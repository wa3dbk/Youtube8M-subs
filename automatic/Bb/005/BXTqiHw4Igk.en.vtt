00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:42.920
 27 to 24 21 to 28 32 30 33 32 28 27 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:16.109
 So maybe it depends a bit 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:17.729
 respect that you have the 

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:20.009
 have discarded one or the other free 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.049
 and especially in the standing attack not 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.759
 have played so well the broad used 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.950
 to have 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.600
 in the isolated combat situation 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.090
 went inside aggressive enough and so 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.350
 of course the bhc players always have 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.149
 again fast balls conquered and 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.149
 thereby made their counter-attacks 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.710
 Thinking about a few chances 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.060
 may have left the one 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.010
 or another job had been done 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.540
 but 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.540
 the second half better done 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.670
 pascal welz also a came he has one 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.670
 few balls held 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.799
 plays back in a short time and the 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.150
 defend a total of a second half 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.680
 outstanding are the things in front 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.680
 did not do that at the beginning 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.860
 I think how much more aggressive 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.780
 defense straight on the half position 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.459
 we defend much more offensively 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.110
 Of course, our fast before 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.880
 why the bhc always under pressure 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.620
 has set and never has to rest 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.360
 come and then I think now 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.470
 clearly on the middle sensational 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.540
 be controlled pressure on the 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.130
 got halfway and always have 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.200
 again these isolated situations 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.390
 get on the half position and took 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.680
 the battles 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.360
 Appropriately prepared and addressed 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.360
 Of course, then our gates made 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.670
 enough for but goes as everyone wanted 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:37.659
 get the thing and the sensation 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.540
 We had nothing to lose 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:42.189
 and everyone has to go gassi all to it 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.180
 believed and then we are just in 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:45.180
 and then it is
