months or weeks that I prefer this on my
hair<00:04:59.900> usually<00:05:00.470> it's<00:05:00.620> around<00:05:00.830> I<00:05:01.930> guess<00:05:03.730> since

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
hair usually it's around I guess since

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.490 
hair usually it's around I guess since
I'm<00:05:04.910> transitioning<00:05:05.300> I<00:05:05.630> probably<00:05:05.870> will<00:05:06.140> do<00:05:06.350> it

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
I'm transitioning I probably will do it

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.040 
I'm transitioning I probably will do it
more<00:05:06.830> like<00:05:06.860> every<00:05:07.490> eight<00:05:07.730> to<00:05:07.850> ten<00:05:08.060> like<00:05:08.840> that

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
more like every eight to ten like that

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.590 
more like every eight to ten like that
this<00:05:09.590> so<00:05:09.800> long<00:05:10.070> when<00:05:10.490> I<00:05:10.520> do<00:05:10.640> decide<00:05:11.150> to<00:05:11.210> cut<00:05:11.480> off

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
this so long when I do decide to cut off

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.940 
this so long when I do decide to cut off
the<00:05:11.720> relax<00:05:12.050> and<00:05:12.350> like<00:05:12.590> I<00:05:12.680> said<00:05:12.860> I'm

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
the relax and like I said I'm

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.170 
the relax and like I said I'm
transitioning<00:05:13.460> without<00:05:13.940> a<00:05:13.970> big<00:05:14.210> chop<00:05:14.450> so

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
transitioning without a big chop so

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.880 
transitioning without a big chop so
hopefully<00:05:17.180> I'll<00:05:17.300> be<00:05:17.330> able<00:05:17.570> to<00:05:18.080> cut<00:05:18.710> off

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 
hopefully I'll be able to cut off

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.910 
hopefully I'll be able to cut off
whatever<00:05:19.190> relax<00:05:19.700> and<00:05:19.970> I<00:05:20.090> have<00:05:20.270> left<00:05:20.680> in<00:05:21.680> about

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
whatever relax and I have left in about

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.060 
whatever relax and I have left in about
a<00:05:21.950> year<00:05:22.250> from<00:05:22.400> now<00:05:22.490> so<00:05:23.270> if<00:05:24.110> I<00:05:24.260> continue<00:05:24.680> to<00:05:24.710> trim

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
a year from now so if I continue to trim

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.250 
a year from now so if I continue to trim
at<00:05:25.280> least<00:05:25.490> a<00:05:25.970> half<00:05:26.390> an<00:05:26.570> inch<00:05:26.660> every<00:05:26.960> three

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
at least a half an inch every three

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.130 
at least a half an inch every three
months<00:05:27.440> or<00:05:27.740> so<00:05:27.950> you<00:05:28.450> probably<00:05:29.450> notice<00:05:30.020> the

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
months or so you probably notice the

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.520 
months or so you probably notice the
difference<00:05:30.530> my<00:05:31.010> hair<00:05:31.220> is<00:05:31.340> growing<00:05:31.550> a<00:05:31.700> lot<00:05:32.530> it
