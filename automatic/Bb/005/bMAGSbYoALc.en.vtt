00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.000
 good evening how Nicolas Mathieu has basel

 not bad rather not bad we ended 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.859
 last night and it was amazing so we 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.910
 two to put it back tonight 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.199
 how are we preparing a show 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.300
 two and a half hours and well 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.490
 we are trying to be quiet 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.279
 during all this time there we 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.689
 try to resist the temptation 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.880
 to go walking to go in Valais 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.170
 we finally rest tomorrow tomorrow 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.030
 my side is really what she 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.690
 it is to rest and to 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.540
 focus because we're after cancer 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.770
 like that we sleep badly and all that 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.450
 the most important thing is not even a 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.670
 little walk in every city has 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.960
 aroused yesterday morning I had been I was 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.450
 run a little bit I was at the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.899
 cathedral and all that giving to the garden 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.730
 Plant 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.559
 yeah so if if if we have a little the 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.760
 time to do me then there is after 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.370
 there is a break of which compared to the sea 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.140
 a few days then indochine 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.969
 these are thirty-year career two 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.500
 million albums sold a twelfth 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.120
 black city parade a few months ago that 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.680
 cardboard of the complete concerts during 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.180
 each tour all that necessarily 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.920
 door an artist is what there is a 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.290
 little more that makes every time we 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.799
 want to give as much to the 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.689
 public 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.549
 no name no more small 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.890
 there is an incredible chance of having this 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.049
 public there who has been following us en masse since 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.750
 thirty years with highs and 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.860
 stockings of course the tooth but we have 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.540
 that's really a gift and we're not 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.000
 not very present in the media does not try 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.280
 of 2 so to think period where there is 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.299
 no tour of being early 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.520
 finally I mean what we feel 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.930
 creaa to be able to make a beautiful album is 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.340
 a nice good tour then there 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.750
 actually we get into a cycle where 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.310
 his albums tour album so 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.990
 I think that actually this tour 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.340
 there is going to be very very important she is 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.820
 very important already because people 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.350
 ahead 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.450
 because I think we will not reproduce 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.710
 no one like that we've been to here 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.230
 go to the end of what we could 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.220
 make 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.630
 and after he will have to find other 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.580
 thing is it stop is this 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.290
 that's all that's what's good 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.520
 also of these two we will end you 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.440
 good there we will announce small 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.670
 surprises there for in the region soon 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:13.850
 there, but here we go this tour 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.310
 will stop at the Stade de France as a 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.350
 kind of apotheosis and friends here but there 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.390
 I think people are stunned 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.620
 from what they see there on this 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.910
 tour there so we are we are really 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.440
 happy because it's been years 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.760
 to think about it you were waiting for that 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.260
 really not to say that all the 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.820
 remains has been evolution between the 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.230
 paradise or alice &amp; june turn it was 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.700
 different universes and there we come 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.580
 in a universe where we can really 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.250
 Wrap people with our pictures etc 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.860
 we could develop that so more the 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.930
 physical performance plus performance 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.940
 emotional from the audience yeah yeah 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.940
 it's important hit west 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.569
 backstage interview with nicola sirkis 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.040
 and the indochina group nicolas the public 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.690
 who comes to see Indochina has known two 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.130
 groups in the 80s and 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.140
 today he returns with his children 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.670
 it's a multigenerational audience 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.080
 what does not it provide 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.730
 amazing if ever seen that actually 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.170
 there are a lot of people from who have 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.030
 10-year-olds who come so he 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.830
 two years ago I see children who 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.390
 have indochine t-shirts at 10 years old so 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.370
 there is everything tidy it starts at 10 years 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.600
 it ends at 50.60 bass and 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.830
 multigenerational federator 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.750
 pretty amazing because there are so many 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.070
 sets is funny because I have 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.060
 always talked about family conflicts 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:26.880
 etc and finally here is the difficulty 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.110
 to be a teenager or at least me 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.690
 what I experienced in an adult world 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.920
 and today it's united families 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.450
 who come to see me and who have the same 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.769
 passion so it's rather a nice gift 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.080
 what is a bright game festival 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.940
 colorful impressive as soon as there is a 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.220
 guitar string that is scratching on 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.840
 scene is a lamp that felt and a 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.430
 huge screen too we are really in 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.260
 the Indochina universe this staging 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.420
 was thought before during or after 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.700
 the recording of the album black city 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.430
 Pau of Nicolas ben album was 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.730
 written like this on 14 months so in 14 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.640
 months there have been discussions and the 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.060
 queries and then and then in everything 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.680
 came 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.420
 it's been a long time since I thought 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.390
 to have a screen that gets into the 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:10.200
 in the crowd but everything went to 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:14.190
 chance as a kind of puzzle 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.360
 mesh magic actually yes ben 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.150
 here we can do this city that 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.820
 reaching it was really thoughtful and 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.160
 we think on the ground unconscious and 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.240
 it was written but it's I'm coming 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.880
 still not believe that we are 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.510
 could have ended up at this thing because 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:33.690
 that's it's thoughtful yes but it's 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.490
 not calibrated we did not know if that 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.600
 was going to walk and so that's it there is a 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.700
 dose of chance that is pretty incredible 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.220
 with all its considerable means 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.419
 technical means make a lot of people 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.590
 it's a big Indochina family ya 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.450
 the technicians 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.860
 how are we doing forever 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.430
 offer very affordable prices at 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.540
 public 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:53.070
 Oh well 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.840
 we fight every day during these 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.970
 trials a fight it's a fight but 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.070
 the people who follow me respect this 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:03.870
 fight there out of respect for the public 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:06.060
 serves that actually me I 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.210
 does not consider that an artist who who who 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.980
 is going to draw money from these public sound and 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.960
 is very honorable what have we 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.910
 actually with everything 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.910
 we have about 120 people on this 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.080
 road and goal has and has never been to 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.360
 get rich but that everyone is 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.860
 paid that people have to carve a 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.960
 respect face and this public there who we 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.390
 live it's not this audience one that 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.320
 must enrich us it's pretty good I 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.320
 mean moderately successful 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.660
 intellectually pc he gives me a 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.000
 positive energy etc 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:39.030
 it helps us live so it's a 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.890
 respect i think yeah that's not it 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.330
 it's not that easy but people 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.260
 there follow us 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.670
 the opposite of all productions 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.860
 French livenation which is a 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.180
 American production of bad 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.570
 reputation it's the only ones who followed 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.540
 the folder 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.800
 like what's the good of it's not all 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.360
 people who are screaming wolf right now 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.560
 in the press saying the gigs 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.200
 not too expensive it's a little hospital 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.630
 who does not care about charity what these voices 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.070
 there but we get there and I'm 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.360
 glad we will remain in any case in 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.740
 historical records as the only 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.550
 group to propose this and to do it 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.280
 Actually 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.380
 that's how it lasts I do not know that 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.090
 I do not know it's not demagogic to 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.250
 anyway the approach is sincere 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:17.310
 after the hard went in the urge to 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:19.680
 continue to and especially from one to be of 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:22.760
 to be able to offer dignified worthy things 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.760
 and which interests us also 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:33.580

 other concerts of other artists on 

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:40.419
 scene to inspire or just 

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:42.819
 out of curiosity 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:44.110

00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:00.339
