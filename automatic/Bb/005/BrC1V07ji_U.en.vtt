00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.790
 this degenerates to another video 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.529
 Today I want to shield you 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.840
 just show a command blog 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.660
 first need a command blog like 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.849
 always with / gif our users in the under 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.100
 with command block then we have here 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.130
 operate with a right click place 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.310
 and with right-click we go here 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.710
 pure with storm and v you then do the 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.019
 comes from the description put it 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.019
 will take to the blog and make it already 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.910
 Here is a small tower after one 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.610
 short time we have right here then 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.940
 box differences number divorced benjamin 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.370
 Here come the whole way, make good here 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.040
 Now we have a little test 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.140
 Zombie yes I'm not without synonymous 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.420
 reason if we are now 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.910
 this box will look at name tag 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.610
 or one day and that is the whole thing 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.440
 if we play now at the beginning 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.410
 or war on the right we have 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.989
 keep the shop 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.760
 So you get the job, yes what we then 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.430
 even weeks is not rotted 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.790
 meat yes to all us to 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.659
 we still need iron gold and buy 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.450
 diamonds around an iron or 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.850
 We have to get iron shield 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.049
 a full ten trips spend around 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.570
 another sign to get the next one 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.520
 a gold there we have 20 gold for 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.670
 numbers 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.840
 so we did that too and for 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.619
 the diamond or man 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.289
 what is called now signboard we get 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:41.640
 or we have the whole 30 diamonds 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:45.939
 So spend in tens exceeded the 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.649
 2020 gold 30 diamonds so I take that 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.270
 but now I'm going away because 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.869
 that's the right thing about it 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.899
 So all we have to do now 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:02:00.240
 do not take a sword fitting 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:04.630
 times still travel a sword wooden sword 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.030
 and a diamond and now it starts 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.500
 So what do we have to do about that? 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:15.730
 signs to use 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:18.940
 the normal gamer 0 and now have to 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:22.720
 we catch an armor from velen we 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.760
 with that there was a war we catch 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.250
 with the iron plate on 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.079
 we have to go to this slot here 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.829
 cookies so where is black and 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:33.970
 then here 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:34.599
 the fourth slot in the inventory and now see 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.060
 her downstairs 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.010
 we got extra hearts and 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.340
 On the left side of my page, there is one now 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.100
 kind of small shield that would be 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.239
 that and the shield brings a halt 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.370
 extra hearts 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.530
 and if you're running, you can see it 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.510
 but not when you stand and feel that way 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.760
 you have moved slightly on the left 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.650
 a sign on the side that's a pity because 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.599
 the whole thing is done in the middle of the east 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.280
 and he can not go that fast 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.290
 you will be teleported when 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.910
 I stand still comes this stands 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.169
 immediately continue and if I am not 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.530
 turn around looks so a bit 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:10.440
 that's an iron armor is yes of 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.000
 It does not look that good on the outside though 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.840
 just when you are like that looks quite 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.720
 nice out 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.720
 yes next we would have the gold 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.700
 So it's still important if you know it 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.190
 no longer used the armor would have 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.650
 but they lie down here then disappear 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.690
 namely the sign on the side yes 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.900
 then she could go freeway somewhere 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.250
 yes the gold shield has the same procedure 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.739
 this time on other side also 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.359
 golden shield 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.560
 this time we even have six hearts 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:42.370
 to get to 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.650
 as I said the whole acts just as 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.040
 shield or you get extra 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.590
 hearts because extra armor points can 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.280
 you do not give yourself but extra heart 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.300
 I think I'm fine and if he is 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.540
 not used again 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.700
 After all, so I can do it too 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.410
 show normal so now I have that 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.760
 Shield at once on the right side 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:08.170
 there you have to always grow 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.640
 then it works out again so we have 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.170
 now the shield here 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.080
 and if we just have it somewhere now 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.889
 lie down in the inventory then you see 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:20.380
 follow us somehow still but 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.790
 that's gonna be really funny too 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.400
 not because it really is not anymore 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.260
 equipped here is therefore always first 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.720
 lie down here and then if it does not 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:33.400
 used to lie down and it is already 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:36.100
 gone now diamond brings us 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.360
 then a whole ten more hearts and so on 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.240
 We would have our hearts, so to speak 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.580
 doubles if we stop 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.650
 That looks great 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.800
 the idea I'm through 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.620
 screenshot the 1.9 come because that is 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.180
 yes also the combat update yes and there should 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.070
 there are also shields and 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.200
 different arrows let's see if that too 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.940
 the celebrate also what's good now 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.800
 Now I've made signs first 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.870
 if in this shield shop no more 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.390
 you do not want to be susceptible 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.370
 just kill you can not kill him either 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.960
 actually should beat you 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.750
 I can not beat out 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.120
 why it does not work 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.770
 ok so if you do not stop the sign 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.550
 wanted to have more so no questions 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:24.510
 come up 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:31.300
 you have to be et the type is easy 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:31.720
 village then in the radius of two around you 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.840
 around 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:37.210
 Then Schildau shop is killed 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.620
 then go away and now I say it has you 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.240
 hopefully 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.240
 Until next time
