00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.780 
put those colored ones in just as a
placeholder<00:03:40.590> so<00:03:41.010> I<00:03:41.070> wouldn't<00:03:41.370> have<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:41.520> put<00:03:41.700> it

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
placeholder so I wouldn't have to put it

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.760 
placeholder so I wouldn't have to put it
in<00:03:41.850> my<00:03:41.970> mouth<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:42.450> then<00:03:42.959> after<00:03:43.200> that<00:03:43.320> you<00:03:43.500> can

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
in my mouth and then after that you can

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.270 
in my mouth and then after that you can
just<00:03:44.070> take<00:03:44.370> those<00:03:44.610> off<00:03:44.910> and<00:03:45.209> that

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.500 

so<00:03:49.280> just<00:03:49.519> look<00:03:49.640> like<00:03:49.670> that<00:03:50.030> it's<00:03:50.150> really<00:03:50.299> nice
