00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
and leather which to me is just so much

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.800 
and leather which to me is just so much
better<00:01:43.979> quality<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:45.060> gato<00:01:45.359> series<00:01:45.659> as<00:01:45.780> a

better quality and the gato series as a
whole<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.229> probably<00:01:46.469> one<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.619> my<00:01:46.710> favorites<00:01:47.280> in

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:52.219 
the indoor as far as indoor lines are
concerned<00:01:50.429> mainly<00:01:51.090> because<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.539> found<00:01:51.990> myself

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
concerned mainly because I found myself

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.590

I've always found that indoor shoes

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.789 
I've always found that indoor shoes
don't<00:01:54.749> have<00:01:54.960> enough<00:01:55.229> cushion<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:55.710> the

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.090 
discomfort or just feeling like there
wasn't<00:02:27.600> enough<00:02:27.840> padding<00:02:28.110> under<00:02:28.470> my<00:02:28.590> feet<00:02:28.830> so

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
wasn't enough padding under my feet so

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.380 
wasn't enough padding under my feet so
if<00:02:29.520> you're<00:02:29.610> one<00:02:29.700> of<00:02:29.790> those<00:02:29.850> people<00:02:29.910> that<00:02:30.150> seems

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
if you're one of those people that seems

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.630 
if you're one of those people that seems
to<00:02:30.480> have<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:30.810> kind<00:02:31.020> of<00:02:31.080> issue<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:32.250> Nike<00:02:32.490> 5

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
to have that kind of issue the Nike 5

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.920 
to have that kind of issue the Nike 5
got<00:02:32.850> so<00:02:33.000> series<00:02:33.270> is<00:02:33.360> probably<00:02:33.630> something<00:02:33.810> you

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
got so series is probably something you

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.630 
got so series is probably something you
want<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.170> take<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.320> look<00:02:34.470> at<00:02:34.650> but<00:02:35.160> as<00:02:35.250> far<00:02:35.430> as<00:02:35.460> the

upper but it seems to be a pretty good

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.400 
upper but it seems to be a pretty good
quality<00:02:41.300> especially<00:02:42.300> for<00:02:42.690> that<00:02:42.780> $60<00:02:43.230> price

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
keep the shape a little bit more true

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.770 
keep the shape a little bit more true
even<00:02:52.500> after<00:02:52.740> break-in<00:02:52.980> you<00:02:53.610> have<00:02:53.760> this<00:02:54.030> suede

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
even after break-in you have this suede

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.900 
even after break-in you have this suede
toe<00:02:55.200> cap<00:02:55.470> as<00:02:55.680> well<00:02:55.890> which<00:02:56.370> is<00:02:56.490> not<00:02:56.610> only<00:02:56.760> going

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
toe cap as well which is not only going

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.280 
toe cap as well which is not only going
to<00:02:57.000> enhance<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.450> durability<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:57.960> the<00:02:58.050> shoe

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
to enhance the durability of the shoe

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.780 
to enhance the durability of the shoe
but<00:02:58.680> it's<00:02:58.830> also<00:02:58.920> going<00:02:59.130> to<00:02:59.190> not<00:02:59.340> allow<00:02:59.550> to<00:02:59.610> the

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
but it's also going to not allow to the

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.760 
but it's also going to not allow to the
shoots<00:03:00.330> over<00:03:00.510> stretch<00:03:00.930> in<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.200> toe<00:03:01.350> box<00:03:01.560> area

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
shoots over stretch in the toe box area

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.800 
shoots over stretch in the toe box area
so<00:03:02.460> it's<00:03:02.550> gonna<00:03:02.640> keep<00:03:02.910> it<00:03:03.060> shape<00:03:03.240> a<00:03:03.270> lot<00:03:03.540> better

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
so it's gonna keep it shape a lot better

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.150 
so it's gonna keep it shape a lot better
and<00:03:04.320> it's<00:03:04.470> also<00:03:04.560> going<00:03:04.710> to<00:03:04.800> provide<00:03:04.980> some

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
and it's also going to provide some

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.980 
and it's also going to provide some
extra<00:03:05.520> traction<00:03:05.880> on<00:03:06.210> the<00:03:06.390> ball<00:03:06.570> grips<00:03:06.870> the

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
extra traction on the ball grips the

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.480 
extra traction on the ball grips the
ball<00:03:07.140> a<00:03:07.170> little<00:03:07.260> bit<00:03:07.410> better<00:03:07.470> if<00:03:07.980> you've<00:03:08.130> ever

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
ball a little bit better if you've ever

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.330 
ball a little bit better if you've ever
had<00:03:08.760> any<00:03:08.910> kind<00:03:09.000> of<00:03:09.180> suede<00:03:09.540> on<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.800> toe<00:03:10.950> cap<00:03:11.190> of

obviously I have the white and silver

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.690 
obviously I have the white and silver
colorway<00:03:52.050> which<00:03:52.230> i<00:03:52.320> think<00:03:52.380> is<00:03:52.680> very<00:03:52.920> simple<00:03:53.640> of

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
colorway which i think is very simple of

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.940 
colorway which i think is very simple of
a<00:03:53.760> really<00:03:54.000> sharp<00:03:54.209> looking<00:03:54.510> as<00:03:54.660> well<00:03:54.870> and<00:03:55.860> then

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
a really sharp looking as well and then

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.500 
a really sharp looking as well and then
of<00:03:56.070> course<00:03:56.130> the<00:03:56.520> sole<00:03:56.760> is<00:03:56.940> really<00:03:57.180> nice<00:03:57.330> as

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
of course the sole is really nice as

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.900 
of course the sole is really nice as
well<00:03:57.540> you<00:03:58.200> have<00:03:58.350> a<00:03:58.380> full<00:03:58.770> gum<00:03:59.040> rubber<00:03:59.250> outsole

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
well you have a full gum rubber outsole

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.880 
well you have a full gum rubber outsole
which<00:04:00.090> to<00:04:00.600> me<00:04:00.750> is<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:00.930> best<00:04:01.230> type<00:04:01.530> of<00:04:01.560> rubber

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
which to me is the best type of rubber

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.490 
which to me is the best type of rubber
it's<00:04:02.430> kind<00:04:02.610> of<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.820> premium<00:04:03.540> rubber<00:04:04.140> for

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
it's kind of the premium rubber for

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.199 
it's kind of the premium rubber for
indoor<00:04:04.830> soccer<00:04:05.070> shoes<00:04:05.489> if<00:04:05.910> you're<00:04:06.120> not

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
familiar with that and the reason for

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.520 
familiar with that and the reason for
that<00:04:08.670> is<00:04:08.880> it's<00:04:09.330> the<00:04:09.510> softest<00:04:09.959> if<00:04:10.350> you're

you're not gonna have any issues with it
wearing<00:04:13.320> away<00:04:13.440> but<00:04:14.160> it's<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.340> softest<00:04:14.790> type

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940
