00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 haha louie a bitter here ie 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.930
 oh man fish with a new one today 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.460
 commentary today i have again and more 3 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.840
 game play for you a few of the 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.710
 Subscribers were in for it 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.030
 asked 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.950
 Peter can be done again three times 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.199
 upload gameplay for those people 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.789
 here it was one to me 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.350
 very fast gameplay that you go to 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.910
 only the look it turned out to be something 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.109
 to be slower 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.910
 that was mainly because 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.350
 I do a lot of double kill center kills 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.820
 and what is really good for you 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.920
 feeling is and what you really mind 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.869
 action full of feeling 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.460
 only downside was that i was in between 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.079
 double kills and triple kills and hope 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.820
 time was running 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.790
 I challenge you on this gameplay and 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.379
 a triple kill is on the way here 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.670
 but only to go to this triple kill 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.050
 I was 12 seconds again 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.579
 en route and here around the corner 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.289
 again clit and that makes it all 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.719
 the speed out 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.550
 anyway i now challenge this gameplay to 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.500
 a point to find but I longer than 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.730
 stand still for three seconds 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.230
 I don't think that's anywhere like mine 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.149
 was running constantly towards the 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.489
 mmi chair and that was also a part 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.410
 what a nice gameplay maybe made 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.870
 if you can't find it then me would 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.670
 very surprised and I would say I am missing 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.020
 but I want to get it over there today 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.610
 you are not about i want it 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.840
 today with you about something serious 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.850
 subject 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.100
 I want it with you today 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.409
 are going to have what what call or duty what 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.689
 game call of duty will follow as 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.159
 big game on the consoles 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.380
 Many people think that call in duty 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.740
 Generally the big game is isn't 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.689
 where boys league of legends on the pc 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.420
 this becomes much larger through much more 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.850
 people played and is also much more 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.329
 played by those people that is one 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.549
 bit the part pc console it is 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.290
 namely always so to that 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.000
 consoles really put much more money into it 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.340
 bring you because you are not on consoles 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.630
 games can crack 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.490
 league of legends is for example one 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.770
 free play anyway so earn there 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.590
 neither expose you as a developer but 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.840
 games as a motor for 360 euros per 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.490
 copy then goes a whole lot of money 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.619
 have incredible amount of money 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.020
 sit down and that's why you 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.100
 much much reads about the consoles in it 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.570
 news compared to for example 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.930
 League of Legends 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.030
 and that kind of PC games but yes for that 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.099
 monitor sadness and actually very call 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.430
 of duty and the largest franchise was on 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.950
 the 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.680
 could sun was actually halo2 the big one 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.299
 game that was still on the xbox the old xbox 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.430
 the standard x book without anything there 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.900
 behind only with the arrival of the xbox 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.609
 360 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.980
 did it take place or become new? 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:28.920
 a new game to the largest 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.349
 to take over the torch to get halo2 from 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.420
 to knock the throne that has a chance to call 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.670
 or duty it adopted with both hands 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.150
 and you all know it now on the 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.019
 xbox 360 and the playstation 3 is call or 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.319
 duty 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.569
 further away the big game but you 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.639
 also all know that the xbox one and the 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.280
 playstation 4 and arrive graphically 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:53.639
 real much more and therefore also 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.650
 leave space for another game 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:57.239
 to become the greatest of all time or 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.290
 perhaps the biggest of that moment 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.669
 who knows 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.010
 To study a new case the 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:05.010
 to take the throne personally I think 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.780
 that that battlefield 4 and or gta 5 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.859
 and maybe both I would 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.730
 don't know it 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:10.560
 but I do n't think so because it 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.030
 battlefield 4 really sold a lot 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.500
 are going to be and maybe better 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.989
 is going to be sold then call of duty 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.319
 ghost just pure and just for reason 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:21.479
 with the new consoles and then 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.549
 battlefield really much more and can 

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:25.290
 it also become much more powerful 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.209
 battlefield 3 on the xbox 360 van 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.129
 namely really way too heavy wants a lot 3 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.229
 was actually made for the PC gamers 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:33.419
 because they are answers in saw that 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:35.970
 the consoles never the graphics 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:37.889
 had to do that game alone 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.540
 with the arrival of the new consoles 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:41.129
 of course it is 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.739
 I think battlefield call of duty so 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:46.290
 thrown off a throne and gta 5 too 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.609
 gta 5 is really becoming a super cool game 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.439
 only i think there is a little one 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:52.139
 multiplayer and a competitive 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:53.699
 something is missing from gta 5 I know too 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.439
 to multiplayer but think it's more 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:57.389
 then little bit will be real than real 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:58.859
 play seriously 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:02.129
 I hope you agree with that here 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:03.870
 is another bonus clip it's an it is 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.069
 blackops 2 so what 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.709
 in that respect it is not 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:10.620
 quite a mb3 solocom a theory 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:13.680
 but guys this is such a nasty clip 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.030
 jesus here i totally with the sniper that 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.909
 I chill with me all the time 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:22.529
 want a payback upon 

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:24.210
 what and nasty journalistic culture in it 

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:24.700
 liked if so forget it 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.050
 not in the 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.910
 to give up that I really thought 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.530
 very nice we have recently 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.590
 two or three times in succession 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.910
 one thousand thumbs up 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.470
 for the most part at a maximum 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.150
 videos that you really like and 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.380
 I want to thank you for that 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.180
 I hope to be able to do that again 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.890
 will reach a thousand thumbs up 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.750
 probably want a little bit 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.940
 but I hope we are the way 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.000
 can reach many thumbs up 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.170
 i would say thank you for looking and 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.710
 until next time 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.710
 let the guests
