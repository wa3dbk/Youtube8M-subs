anything that moves inside a time bubble
will<00:00:51.679> slow<00:00:51.949> down<00:00:51.980> so<00:00:52.760> it's<00:00:52.879> perfect<00:00:53.269> for

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
will slow down so it's perfect for

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.479 
will slow down so it's perfect for

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:04.980 
and of course it's also great for just

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:11.039 
and of course it's also great for just
whacking<00:01:05.160> stuff

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
want to expand on that we really wanted

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.300 
want to expand on that we really wanted
to<00:01:27.020> try<00:01:27.200> something<00:01:27.229> new<00:01:27.860> that<00:01:28.040> we've<00:01:28.159> never

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
to try something new that we've never

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
done before in the series and so the big

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.490 
done before in the series and so the big

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
focus was time itself what claim can do

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.889 
focus was time itself what claim can do
is<00:01:33.710> use<00:01:33.950> time<00:01:34.340> pass<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:35.090> record<00:01:35.479> various
