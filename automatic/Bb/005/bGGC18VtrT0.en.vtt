field much less than a ball game so for

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.130 
field much less than a ball game so for
a<00:01:44.189> program<00:01:44.579> like<00:01:44.759> Miami<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.780> about<00:01:45.960> as

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
a program like Miami this is about as

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.359 
a program like Miami this is about as

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
bad as it gets at the quarterback

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.310 
bad as it gets at the quarterback
position<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:48.180> that's<00:01:48.479> why<00:01:48.720> Jay<00:01:49.020> keeps

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
position and that's why Jay keeps

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.710 
position and that's why Jay keeps
deciding<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.979> transfer<00:01:50.399> there<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:51.060> me<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.540> such

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
deciding to transfer there to me is such

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.600

a<00:01:51.750> big<00:01:51.990> development<00:01:52.380> well<00:01:52.799> that's<00:01:53.009> not<00:01:53.280> really

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
a big development well that's not really

got an offensive line that's got some

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.890 
got an offensive line that's got some
decent<00:02:50.490> playing<00:02:50.910> experience<00:02:51.330> on<00:02:51.660> it<00:02:51.780> that

decent playing experience on it that

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.390 
decent playing experience on it that
should<00:02:52.050> be<00:02:52.110> better<00:02:52.380> than<00:02:52.860> what<00:02:53.040> he<00:02:53.130> had<00:02:53.250> at

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
should be better than what he had at

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.610 
should be better than what he had at
Kansas<00:02:53.790> so<00:02:54.209> yes<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.660> lot<00:02:54.720> more<00:02:55.140> tools<00:02:55.380> around

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
Kansas so yes a lot more tools around

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.860

him<00:02:56.010> Bonnie<00:02:56.250> at<00:02:56.580> Miami<00:02:57.090> than<00:02:57.360> what<00:02:57.510> he<00:02:57.570> had<00:02:57.720> in

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
him Bonnie at Miami than what he had in

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.390 
him Bonnie at Miami than what he had in
Kansas<00:02:58.080> and<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:58.709> think<00:02:58.950> that's<00:02:59.130> what<00:02:59.310> gives

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
Kansas and I think that's what gives

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.270 
Kansas and I think that's what gives
