00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.130

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.090
 famous game of the head what m 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.870
 this mandate will not even be personal I 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.480
 facing south wind 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.590
 but hey we'll say that good bah 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.460
 but I gave myself a little because because for them 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.240
 bongo was an excellent good it's like that in september 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.510
 so the everyday 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.130
 see that I really 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.320
 of the song this part 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.920
 they stop no remains 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.010
 it's not enough 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.750
 then we knew each other incredible carlos is a very beautiful web avatar 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:02.460
 that m 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.590
 you manage 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:04.650
 I do that 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.340
 zenit is really 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.610
 November 10 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.770
 in his novels telling of the world 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.080
 everything happened like that and go past me I was respectful of 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.130
 inner priorities so I'm doing more than 6% 5 0 so far on leave 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.570
 of my strategic package 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.530
 I'm lying in a simple instrument 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.210
 and suddenly not apprehend what I have in my package 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.960
 gunner 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:26.920
 He is running 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.790
 and yes at wizbii 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.010
 so I think we usually say 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.100
 his mission his rates 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.070
 before I agree with you because frankly it's really doing it 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.149
 Apple 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.169
 so see a little expensive to go but a little jetlag 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.810
 having made a death 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:44.740
 there j 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.130
 it was lucid rest 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.130
 I looked crazy dog ​​he reappeared beauregard 10 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.870
 I know this effect 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.760
 we leave you 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.630
 from datta khel 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.940
 so yes I know 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.000
 page 46% for scor 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.900
 e at the beginning of the game 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.730
 lent the winter 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.390
 the highly anticipated 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.109
 of the wine myth 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:13.230
 all enemies rarely show up does not take long enough to the rescue 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:15.019
 bright red 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.019
 this is where there is not enough fight enough little things 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:21.929
 so 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:24.169
 the floor 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:25.939
 possible 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.199
 may be too much for 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:32.089
 was asking in troops at the moment I am immediately driven 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.409
 go to my hossa bonner channel 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:38.019
 % and 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.919
 how does she know more what and politicians 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:42.249
 commented 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:44.619
 I like and 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:49.009
 he never forgot to give and for the children to go 

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:51.839
 right now I'm on vacation so percent 

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:54.029
 ask me companies 

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:57.639
 we respect this artist is a sherpa tells us 14 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.819
 so in fact ben ali the sixers it's true that it's a good score where he is 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:02.749
 and shoot 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:04.829
 the pavement of wine 1 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.030
 and one he was shooting everywhere for x for them 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.509
 you spotted in party 

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:15.639
 so the central world really thanks for spilling in the market fir tree because 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:16.379
 than 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.539
 good result so again 

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:20.080
 I stole mine 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.019
 she is preparing a plan for assistance 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.609
 in all good pruning strokes for the food trades these 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:26.569
 events 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.569
 for the moment 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:32.609
 since 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.719
 not really hours I'm really lucky will divide on the air of st 

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:37.439
 what to do 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:39.089
 I did not even see second 

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:41.789
 the asnl I will present 

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:44.599
 quantity of toilets 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.599
 no frankly I was doing a pretty good part so that ol still plays 

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:51.199
 will land fast he had on me m 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:53.659
 strategic plum 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:54.560
 here is the 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.879
 still that prague Catholics 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:58.859
 on time 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:02.689
 I put my package to when we are on this map% and the future 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:03.690
 store 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.459
 so why 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.949
 video with series of errors in zombie mode 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:13.039
 e on this on the new tic-tac euro maps to 23 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:14.740

 m 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.409
 ukraine 

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:21.279
 m he's on the ground and maybe that's what allowed a 

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.059
 any 

00:04:23.059 --> 00:04:24.360
 the mayor 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.789
 this law made 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:27.309
 red makes% 

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:30.309
 maybe she did is already finished but my putter commented 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.910
 the apc solve what takes a little time even though 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.199
 so I thank% and zelaya 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:43.400
 if the image filmed this part because without it would not give a company 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.599
 private 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:46.229
 an unfortunate tsl 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.490
 and with a low blow I preferred to go for it 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.490
 to throw stones 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:54.779
 then judge you 

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:57.779
 serene already a challenge 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.960
 a judge on the young Belgian 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.960
 with my friend p 5 tons 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.490
 tj ni anti fast 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.240
 eugene in me i did not think in sweden and and i just had the time was 5 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.979
 hours 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.770
 everyone knows at xix dickson mp 5% against 6 dec 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.499
 it must be done with these lands are between 1,125 and 1 

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:21.499
 I have always been 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.020
 you hardly ever need other weapons 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.860
 in addition to traveling to a fairly low level because the riders did I 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.550
 will change we are all here 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.620
 growth and complicated 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.089
 of the rider of the diquigiovanni the team suddenly insisted 

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:39.550
 it's in this 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.240
 For years 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.090
 % 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.069
 today is Thursday 28% 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:46.870
 in a success 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.980
 and their second issue qsp nexity really never so him as little as 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:52.370
 that's enough 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.520
 May 14th among others 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.520
 in the head 

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:01.619
 dompierre 

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:04.029
 so that's it and percent is what I have to say 

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:05.360
 yes then for 100 m 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.129
 but also percent 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:11.780
 1 like all subscribers the tourists were stranded 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:12.819
 everybody 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:16.989
 its subscribers who teemu suninen top 10 I'm unfair 

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:20.669
 for one for the tour of the commune 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:22.520
 the elected representatives introduce themselves 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.469
 once again 

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:26.830
 he turns a little do not 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.979
 even more practical reaches 4 7% 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:35.350
 a spy plane the blackburn representative and I'm not going to mg 

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:40.599
 to celebrate the event 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:42.569
 short 

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:45.650
 so the man you saw on the 3rd of March is 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.720
 the climbing pack that will come out so I intend to take obviously to make 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.409
 videos of his orders to him 

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:52.729
 to oblige one year 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:54.749
 she can take 

00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:58.270
 I think it's someone can I spend days either 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.270
 they hold 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.280
 I intend to make videos of suarez it is necessary because 

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:07.789
 for him 

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:10.930
 the respondent lasted a little longer 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.169
 it's a women's couple in the quarterfinals 

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:15.059
 % 

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:18.059
 directly their old days table on a score 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.969
 really blow 

00:07:20.969 --> 00:07:22.969
 I'm really lucky you can even 

00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:25.740
 but all to say I had little luck 

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.740
 I ended up on a score of I know more how much 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.270
 as well as I ended up on a score 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.240
 too many 7 

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.159
 so that was a small comment him 

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:42.449
 % to man the basic and glazed 

00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:44.710
 it is also 

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:46.330
 it was auxiliary
