00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
was surrounded by trees and we had our

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.390 
was surrounded by trees and we had our

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
little campfire and we were standing

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.750 
little campfire and we were standing
around<00:01:20.880> by<00:01:21.510> the<00:01:21.570> campfire<00:01:22.100> when<00:01:23.100> we<00:01:23.280> realized

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
around by the campfire when we realized

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.560 
around by the campfire when we realized
that<00:01:24.030> up<00:01:24.990> in<00:01:25.260> one<00:01:25.440> of<00:01:25.620> the<00:01:25.770> huge<00:01:26.070> trees<00:01:26.540> was<00:01:27.540> a

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
that up in one of the huge trees was a

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.920 
that up in one of the huge trees was a
wooden<00:01:27.930> platform<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:29.460> up<00:01:30.060> above<00:01:30.330> that<00:01:30.540> was<00:01:30.900> a

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
wooden platform and up above that was a

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.780 
wooden platform and up above that was a
rope<00:01:31.200> swing<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:32.040> looked<00:01:32.340> like<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.550> was

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
rope swing that looked like it was

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.370 
rope swing that looked like it was
connected<00:01:33.360> somewhere<00:01:33.659> like<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.320> outer<00:01:34.500> space

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
connected somewhere like in outer space

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.870 
connected somewhere like in outer space
so<00:01:37.380> we<00:01:37.530> figured<00:01:37.860> out<00:01:38.010> we<00:01:38.190> could<00:01:38.340> get<00:01:38.580> up<00:01:38.610> on

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
so we figured out we could get up on

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.270 
so we figured out we could get up on
that<00:01:39.030> platform

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
that platform

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.520 
that platform
we<00:01:40.820> could<00:01:41.030> swing<00:01:41.330> on<00:01:41.510> that<00:01:41.690> rope<00:01:41.930> swing<00:01:42.260> and

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
we could swing on that rope swing and

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.870 
we could swing on that rope swing and
let<00:01:42.680> go<00:01:42.920> and<00:01:43.390> fly<00:01:44.390> out<00:01:44.570> into<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:45.020> lake<00:01:45.760> and<00:01:46.760> we

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
let go and fly out into the lake and we

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.600 
let go and fly out into the lake and we
were<00:01:47.000> having<00:01:47.180> a<00:01:47.360> great<00:01:47.630> time

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.420 

so<00:01:51.210> we<00:01:51.360> decided<00:01:51.750> we<00:01:52.710> were<00:01:52.800> going<00:01:52.980> to<00:01:53.070> spend<00:01:53.280> the

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
so we decided we were going to spend the

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.130 
so we decided we were going to spend the
whole<00:01:53.580> day<00:01:53.640> just<00:01:54.210> playing<00:01:54.510> on<00:01:54.720> this<00:01:54.870> rope

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140

swing<00:01:55.440> and<00:01:56.310> goofing<00:01:56.730> off<00:01:56.910> rather<00:01:57.630> than<00:01:57.810> just

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
swing and goofing off rather than just

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.880 
swing and goofing off rather than just
sitting<00:01:58.320> around<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.860> campfire<00:02:00.410> so<00:02:01.410> my<00:02:01.620> friend

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890
