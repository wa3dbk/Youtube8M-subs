amount of content that we put in it's
it's<00:01:18.130> it's<00:01:18.490> huge<00:01:18.670> certainly<00:01:19.630> this<00:01:19.780> is<00:01:19.929> the

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
it's it's huge certainly this is the

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.109

been it's the biggest sprint self

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.130 
been it's the biggest sprint self
there's<00:01:24.069> that<00:01:24.189> would<00:01:24.280> be<00:01:24.429> an<00:01:24.700> a<00:01:25.359> to<00:01:25.750> dry<00:01:26.079> or

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
there's that would be an a to dry or

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.080 
there's that would be an a to dry or
cheaper<00:01:26.740> as<00:01:26.859> one<00:01:27.009> of<00:01:27.039> the<00:01:27.159> biggest<00:01:27.520> things<00:01:27.759> is

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
and it's all supported by the way that

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.590 
and it's all supported by the way that
we<00:01:32.319> built<00:01:32.649> the<00:01:32.770> maps<00:01:33.039> every<00:01:33.729> single<00:01:34.149> map<00:01:34.329> in<00:01:34.479> a

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
we built the maps every single map in a

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.940 
we built the maps every single map in a
game<00:01:34.780> is<00:01:34.959> set<00:01:35.140> in<00:01:35.170> a<00:01:35.319> different<00:01:35.439> part<00:01:35.770> of<00:01:35.859> the

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
game is set in a different part of the

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.099 
game is set in a different part of the
world<00:01:36.189> with<00:01:36.520> multiple<00:01:37.119> routes<00:01:37.329> multiple<00:01:37.929> ways

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
world with multiple routes multiple ways

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:40.440 
world with multiple routes multiple ways
to<00:01:38.140> get<00:01:38.439> your<00:01:38.679> objective<00:01:39.219> and<00:01:39.850> extending<00:01:40.420> to

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
to get your objective and extending to

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.730 
to get your objective and extending to
the<00:01:40.600> game<00:01:40.810> modes<00:01:41.079> as<00:01:41.289> well

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
the game modes as well

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.520 
the game modes as well
we've<00:01:42.100> got<00:01:42.340> a<00:01:42.369> large<00:01:42.780> co-op<00:01:43.780> sections<00:01:44.289> of<00:01:44.439> the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
we've got a large co-op sections of the

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.649 
we've got a large co-op sections of the
game<00:01:44.679> and<00:01:44.920> obviously<00:01:45.310> that<00:01:45.579> has<00:01:45.789> required<00:01:46.509> us

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
game and obviously that has required us

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.870 
game and obviously that has required us
to<00:01:46.720> build<00:01:47.170> the<00:01:47.500> enormous<00:01:47.979> amount<00:01:48.250> of<00:01:48.399> content

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
to build the enormous amount of content

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.559 
to build the enormous amount of content
3dsmax<00:01:49.840> is<00:01:50.380> obviously<00:01:50.739> a<00:01:50.860> key<00:01:51.489> part<00:01:51.909> of<00:01:52.179> our

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:52.569 
3dsmax is obviously a key part of our

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:54.929 
3dsmax is obviously a key part of our
pipeline<00:01:52.899> for<00:01:53.619> us<00:01:53.770> it's<00:01:53.979> it's<00:01:54.520> one<00:01:54.759> of<00:01:54.849> the

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
pipeline for us it's it's one of the

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:56.699 
pipeline for us it's it's one of the
fundamental<00:01:55.539> building<00:01:55.719> blocks<00:01:56.140> so<00:01:56.409> as<00:01:56.530> we're

00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:56.709 
fundamental building blocks so as we're

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:59.039 
fundamental building blocks so as we're
building<00:01:57.179> maps<00:01:58.179> and<00:01:58.479> those<00:01:58.569> were<00:01:58.719> building

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
building maps and those were building

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.499 
building maps and those were building
content<00:01:59.709> for<00:02:00.429> the<00:02:00.520> single<00:02:00.819> player<00:02:01.030> for<00:02:01.450> the

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
content for the single player for the

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.289 
content for the single player for the
co-op<00:02:01.810> for<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.229> multiplayer<00:02:02.969> it's<00:02:03.969> really

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
co-op for the multiplayer it's really

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
really needed something that was as

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.410 
really needed something that was as

flexible as spell formas the skill form

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.330 
flexible as spell formas the skill form
really<00:03:09.660> gives<00:03:09.870> us<00:03:09.989> a<00:03:10.170> lot<00:03:10.349> of<00:03:10.380> flexibility<00:03:11.130> and

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
really gives us a lot of flexibility and

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.000 
really gives us a lot of flexibility and
how<00:03:11.610> we<00:03:11.670> bring<00:03:12.269> elements<00:03:12.870> into<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.230> game<00:03:13.440> it

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
how we bring elements into the game it

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.920 
how we bring elements into the game it
gives<00:03:14.220> our<00:03:14.430> hardest<00:03:14.790> so<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.239> full<00:03:15.480> range<00:03:15.750> of

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
gives our hardest so the full range of

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.800 
gives our hardest so the full range of
tools<00:03:15.989> that<00:03:16.530> flash<00:03:16.830> supplies<00:03:17.480> so<00:03:18.480> they<00:03:18.630> can

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
tools that flash supplies so they can

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.259 
tools that flash supplies so they can
work<00:03:19.019> within<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.440> flash<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:20.040> create<00:03:20.910> the
