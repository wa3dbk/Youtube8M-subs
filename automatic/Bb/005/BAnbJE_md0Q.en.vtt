crafts<00:01:34.479> reps<00:01:34.720> to<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:34.960> other<00:01:35.080> side<00:01:35.350> go<00:01:35.770> around

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
crafts reps to the other side go around

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.520 
crafts reps to the other side go around
the<00:01:36.250> loop<00:01:36.400> shank<00:01:36.900> again<00:01:37.900> make<00:01:38.140> some<00:01:38.290> cross

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
the loop shank again make some cross

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.920 
the loop shank again make some cross
wraps<00:01:38.880> from<00:01:39.880> the<00:01:40.060> other<00:01:40.180> side<00:01:40.479> some<00:01:40.690> cross

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
wraps from the other side some cross

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.050 
wraps from the other side some cross
wraps<00:01:42.119> around<00:01:43.119> the<00:01:43.390> hook<00:01:43.540> shank<00:01:43.780> now<00:01:45.060> the

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
wraps around the hook shank now the

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.450 
wraps around the hook shank now the
thing<00:01:46.240> I'm<00:01:46.360> going<00:01:46.570> to<00:01:46.689> do<00:01:46.900> now<00:01:47.140> is<00:01:47.500> really<00:01:48.220> make

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
around the hook shank I'll do that by

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.260 
around the hook shank I'll do that by
whining<00:01:53.890> underneath<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.979> Gumble<00:01:57.369> eyes<00:01:57.520> like

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
a little base alright again

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.410 
a little base alright again
yeah<00:02:21.590> I<00:02:21.980> like<00:02:22.880> to<00:02:23.030> do<00:02:23.150> is<00:02:23.240> really<00:02:23.480> secure<00:02:24.080> it<00:02:25.420> go

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
little base right along here and that

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.160 
little base right along here and that
will<00:02:45.200> prevent<00:02:46.100> the<00:02:46.310> eyes<00:02:46.460> from<00:02:47.170> turning

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
will prevent the eyes from turning

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.560

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.880 
now you can make a couple of these put
them<00:03:11.090> to<00:03:11.210> the<00:03:11.300> side<00:03:11.510> let<00:03:11.780> them<00:03:11.900> dry<00:03:12.140> and<00:03:12.530> I<00:03:12.710> mean

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
them to the side let them dry and I mean

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.500 
them to the side let them dry and I mean
those<00:03:13.190> eyes<00:03:13.370> are<00:03:13.610> not<00:03:13.730> going<00:03:14.060> anywhere

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
those eyes are not going anywhere

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.260 
those eyes are not going anywhere
believe<00:03:14.900> me<00:03:15.140> but<00:03:15.740> make<00:03:16.370> sure<00:03:16.400> you<00:03:16.880> make<00:03:17.030> a<00:03:17.060> good

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
believe me but make sure you make a good

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.410 
believe me but make sure you make a good
base<00:03:17.510> underneath<00:03:18.110> and<00:03:18.740> use<00:03:18.920> a<00:03:19.420> sufficient

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
base underneath and use a sufficient

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.350 
base underneath and use a sufficient
amount<00:03:20.570> of<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:20.990> fuzz<00:03:21.140> that<00:03:21.170> to<00:03:21.440> get<00:03:21.560> to<00:03:21.620> secure

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
amount of the fuzz that to get to secure

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.180 
amount of the fuzz that to get to secure
