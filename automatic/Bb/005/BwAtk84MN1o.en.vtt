00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.170
 hello everyone we are on oust gaming is 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.330
 today first video on 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.880
 the extension of diablo iii reaper of 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.500
 sound it's going to be a pretty short video 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.100
 to be able to talk a little bit 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.390
 from this early extension of what I 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.950
 plan to do very soon 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.240
 because I have a lot of things to you 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.580
 introduce a lot of things that are 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.840
 planned relatively quickly I'm going 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.030
 try to do that as quickly as possible 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.880
 but to here but here I come from 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.020
 finish the campaign and I am I am 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.970
 rather satisfied I am rather 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.010
 satisfied then if you want to level 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.170
 of course of course it's true that 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.330
 it remains an act at the level of those who 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.620
 are interested only in the campaign that 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.210
 can do a little bit light 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.740
 because well, well, what did I do 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.870
 put two three hours to finish it 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.830
 quietly I have a little bit searched 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.960
 right on the left I took a lot 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.720
 of pleasure total immersion headphones on 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.520
 the ears the music absolutely 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.020
 sumptuous late I feasted but 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.570
 it's true that it's way too short 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.250
 and then the disappointment too is not of 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.689
 end kinematics when I talk about 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.000
 cinematic I do not speak these species of 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.950
 two cutscenes in sepia you know 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.140
 penciled that's between the acts and that's 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.210
 very very nice but I was waiting for a 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.729
 real cinematics in computer graphics 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.890
 for the end of the game so maybe he 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.030
 there is one but it does not have 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.960
 worked at home I do not know 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.299
 do not hesitate to tell me 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.100
 if you have seen one in any case 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.710
 but a message that's me I was expecting 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.659
 that's okay I saw 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.439
 people too he was fit in three 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.179
 time 24 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.969
 they played and after 20 minutes 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:38.499
 they were already level 65 kind so 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:39.939
 so it's with me here I'm you 

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:43.479
 advise to take your time 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:45.100
 go quiet there enjoy this act 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.229
 because it is really very short 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.670
 after of course it's that the beginning I 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.950
 want to tell you because the act 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.509
 adventure is one thing but for me 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.459
 this is where the game starts all that 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.049
 I still have to do behind there for example 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:57.639
 I am in the adventure mode you know 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.929
 totally free mode where we can 

00:01:57.639 --> 00:02:01.240
 do a little bit what we want or 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:03.280
 the friend of israel can give us 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.409
 precisely quests to be done through 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.029
 the world to review all the places where 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.530
 there is an exclamation point I have a 

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:11.810
 contract and once I have 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.880
 success all the all the bonuses in 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.730
 big I have the cash will drik 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.020
 as well as gold and experience you 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.230
 lose but here's deloot data in 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.850
 more compos and so it's a lot 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.069
 of things to do we can finally move on 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.950
 from one act to another like that hop in 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.390
 so clicking yeah yeah that's the 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.600
 korean feast that is to say that when we 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.459
 enjoy a game as much as I 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.230
 can appreciate diablo when we are 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.060
 gives new content again 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.680
 step of new enemies and new 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.200
 places 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.180
 wow so there obviously I count 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.340
 make a short video about mysticism 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.989
 of course the brand new job that goes 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.060
 allow to sing the weapons of the 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.890
 transmits to the claws there is to change the 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.890
 visual of a weapon with everything we have 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.120
 could collect in the game so all that 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.160
 it is planned we will try to be done 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.630
 a video exclusively for that to 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.250
 talk a little bit more here 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.050
 details of this new job 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.150
 after there will be there are also some 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.330
 new plans of course in blacksmith 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.550
 loose level 10 I just have to grab some 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.200
 breath of death that's boring I 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.870
 need a lot of stuff but hey 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.739
 I will also mount this gold craft in 12 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.790
 so of course that jewelry there is 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.160
 the queues and fall m 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.480
 there are so many things so much of 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.239
 things to cover so many things 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.250
 I want to talk to you about it 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.420
 do not worry about it 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.579
 diablo I think we have for one 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.310
 moment now the little barbara you 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:35.540
 see I was waiting to mount it 70 for 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.829
 see a little bit of it 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.400
 give one has a new spell that is 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.079
 avalanche 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.530
 Besides, I think it's a small 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:45.920
 little light there they gave for this 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.780
 extension a single spell as well as it's me 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.420
 here seems again this lot of liabilities 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.150
 and one two three new liabilities 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.890
 I think they should have done four 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.079
 new liabilities in history to make his 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.109
 own to 4 colog a liability for each 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:02.840
 columns it should have maybe 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:04.760
 give two three lots or in any case m 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.620
 a new street one for each of 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.840
 brief spells do something more 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.209
 I think it's not bad 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.120
 but but it's a little bit light to my 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.669
 sense after of course that's me I'm going 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.099
 test the barbarian I will test him 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:20.419
 really because there I have not been able 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:21.350
 see what it was like at the level of 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.540
 campaign what the rope 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.030
 she and she is hard that is to say that 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.710
 big up to level 64-65 I was in 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.190
 tornante everything was fine there was no 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.900
 worry from the 65 and the mobs there 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.400
 was beefy I was starting well 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.020
 now but I will not do to myself or 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.820
 is this on it and then that's more 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.350
 I go forward and more I had trouble and so 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.480
 I reduced the difficulty anyway 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.580
 Calvary to be able to finish it 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.530
 quiet so it's not that easy 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.510
 here and there actually I come from farm is a 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.210
 little bit so that's it allows me to be 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.400
 to 3 million euros goal 433 thousand dps 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.110
 which is still relatively weak 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.820
 I will try thanks to the mysticism of 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.890
 to get a rune on this kind of weapons 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.210
 good after it's not easy either 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.130
 to do the mystique for weapons 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.660
 legendary it's expensive in compo for 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.640
 a weapon that is not necessarily worth 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.050
 but hey I'll take the time he 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.320
 I must not rush 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.690
 I'm going to test the barbarian really but 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.810
 really not fast what story 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:17.360
 to be sure that the class suits me or 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.460
 no longer suitable and then from there 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.290
 here I will make the decision to pass 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.240
 on a crusader as mayor or not 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.280
 in any case whatever happens to cross him 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.410
 the new class i'm going to play it 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.240
 for sure I'm going up the s-max 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.290
 because I really want to see this 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.820
 that gives 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.100
 remains to be seen if it will be my but not my 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.420
 role but I believe that play it and 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.430
 besides I said to myself also I know 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.290
 not if you like it I'd like 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.270
 to make a let's play just a species 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.500
 before hard followed on the cross being 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.690
 given that I did not do on the 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.280
 barbarian I told myself why not the 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.170
 to cross a new class it can be 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.130
 the moment to go on an adventure 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:54.230
 followed so it will be videos that will be 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:58.430
 added in addition to the others it will be 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:06:00.410
 really all the progress of my epic 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.970
 will say with the cross 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.610
 so that will leave videos with a 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.680
 crossed low level until the end precisely 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.200
 here I think it can not hurt 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.390
 of content there are people who like 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.800
 well his adventures followed so do not hesitate 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.720
 not to tell me if it tempts you 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.370
 or not in any case that's me I'm going there 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.440
 go back i'm going back i'm going 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.880
 make a maximum of premium precisely 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.710
 here are around the world 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:25.460
 I will collect a maximum of 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.650
 components with the blood crystals I 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.900
 go buy 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.330
 amulets I think I do not know who 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.919
 sells them just that dallas a 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.410
 strap it is there that in dallas 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:37.660
 so here we see that with the crystals of 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.580
 samcon shop you can buy weapons at a 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.020
 hand of mystery weapons a little bit and 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.000
 Well, I'm going to buy a lot of friends 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.940
 the mysteries story to replace when 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.160
 even this one which date from debate of 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.539
 very long time already 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.740
 So here we are we have the 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:52.180
 comments just below if you 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.970
 have things to add things to 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:57.160
 to say do not hesitate I come back 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:59.050
 very soon with a lot of videos on 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.280
 builds on particular objects 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.699
 if I find a fun object I'll give it to you 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:05.440
 presents the fine craftsmanship and faleme the 

00:07:03.699 --> 00:07:08.050
 bonuses we will try a little bit of 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.389
 cover all that incites the let's play the
