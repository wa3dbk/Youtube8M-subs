 but a new video pr online and me 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.150
 need your help because we have one 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.799
 pretty cool new project and that 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.330
 here is part of one of them 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.550
 And it is about a new movie of 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.760
 My name is Kaminski and I am 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.680
 explain how you can help me and yes 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.490
 and everything around it and how it all 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.960
 This is how it works here 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.210
 we look but only once the courses 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.990
 trailer in and then it goes on so 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.929
 movies 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:37.380
 I found out no one 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.850
 know it and who knows how to extend it 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:45.629
 to the fireplace no untapped treasure 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:47.730
 there is no current kaminski was even 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.539
 not at least not then he did 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.870
 became famous 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.570
 everything is lying 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:58.879
 sebastian tax collector alone with the biggest 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:00.160
 the world at the biggest all i big 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.640
 and kaminsky 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.890
 It's weird that you know my life 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.580
 strange not more pleasant the aperture 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.860
 series 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.220
 Being famous means someone like you 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.900
 to have me 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.180
 that manuel kaminski does not live 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.960
 I do not want to be able to sit anymore 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.960
 then that's right 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.909
 I have the five instead of mine 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.920
 Past you as yours 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.049
 what is said is a chance like mine 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.319
 you ask that he is the first person 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:37.710
 I know who the seemingly times in her 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:37.710
 came to live 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.710
 As you have just seen, it is indeed in 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.090
 avoid the artist and who the film 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.680
 looks longer and I know that I go there 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.300
 again like to draw blind and 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.710
 then we thought hey cool came there 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.750
 I also involve the community 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.550
 what to leave cool arise 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.160
 here makes a blind drawing 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.840
 be it around the movie trailer 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.180
 figurine out of it images 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.610
 you are looking for something out of motive 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.350
 technical out of the film makes it so 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.600
 a blind drawing sends the whole 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.250
 by mail to following address and from 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.050
 I will then submit to all submissions 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.730
 create a new work earlier on yours 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.750
 designation for the 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.060
 time to 5 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.890
 to submit the things and then you will 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.390
 your 13 people here on my channel 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.710
 I see what I made of it 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.550
 I would be happy if as many as possible 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.530
 participate 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.840
 There is no big name 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.100
 be it very very cool for me 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.050
 already very curious what's going on 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.460
 and how to draw blindly 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.350
 works is also relatively fast 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.790
 I'll just show it to you 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.350
 and that's how it is with drawing 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.970
 usually you always look up 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.200
 paper and look what you draw in 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.480
 In this case it is so you look 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.040
 only in auggen the motive and not that 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.600
 paper and do not look what you draw 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.300
 System x prepared over the second 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.980
 Camera you can see what I draw 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.180
 I'll be in this one all the time 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.470
 camera view or in 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.420
 mirror next to it because I have indeed 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.100
 now put a mirror around 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.900
 to draw me now and show how 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.760
 that works focused the whole 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.010
 time only the motive in a mirror and 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.090
 over the second camera down here can 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.739
 you see this on paper 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.850
 arises and I probably long 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.080
 we'll just try it 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.080
 Let's go 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.340
 thereby arise characteristic 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.840
 very nice pictures with the sake of 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.560
 I would like to work for you 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.629
 and that's why I would say yes 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.400
 ten donate and conjure up a lot 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.629
 very cool paper so i would 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.489
 say we are already on the 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.989
 cards on a spontaneous wednesday 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.430
 Of course you have video beamer here 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.660
 the page has two more videos 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.040
 you do not know me and mine yet 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.269
 of course you will find all the links on the left 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.799
 below in the video description 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.450
 then I would say we see each other 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.819
 sunday to a new video again or 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.260
 on 13.9 here with the result on mine 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.730
 Kanal and I would say until then 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.730
 always stay creative
