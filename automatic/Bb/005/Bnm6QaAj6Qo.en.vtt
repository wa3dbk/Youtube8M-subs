00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
painted on top of the wax and they come

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.000 
painted on top of the wax and they come
in<00:00:27.210> art<00:00:27.480> stores<00:00:27.869> different<00:00:28.830> there's

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
in art stores different there's

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.339 
in art stores different there's

transparent and there's marbled effects

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.799 
transparent and there's marbled effects
on<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.710> different<00:00:32.070> gels<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.579> I've<00:00:33.120> used<00:00:33.510> that

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
on the different gels and I've used that

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.229 
on the different gels and I've used that
painted<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.410> on<00:00:34.559> top<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.100> wax<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.640> in<00:00:35.969> some

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
painted it on top of the wax and in some

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.569 
painted it on top of the wax and in some
cases<00:00:36.540> there<00:00:36.930> I've<00:00:37.380> actually<00:00:37.739> dusted<00:00:38.550> that

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
cases there I've actually dusted that

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.700 
cases there I've actually dusted that
when<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.120> was<00:00:39.270> wet<00:00:39.600> with<00:00:40.110> some<00:00:40.350> metallic

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
when it was wet with some metallic

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.950 
when it was wet with some metallic
powders<00:00:41.430> just<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.969> get<00:00:42.120> some<00:00:42.360> different<00:00:42.540> looks

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
powders just to get some different looks

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.200 
powders just to get some different looks
so<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.920> one<00:00:44.190> thing<00:00:44.430> that's<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:44.969> there

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
so this is one thing that's in there

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.049 
so this is one thing that's in there
another<00:00:46.110> thing<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.550> kind<00:00:47.910> of

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
another thing that is kind of

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.369 
another thing that is kind of
interesting<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:49.140> took<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:50.750> DVD<00:00:51.750> like

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
interesting is that I took a DVD like

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.799 
interesting is that I took a DVD like
this<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.800> took<00:00:53.129> an<00:00:53.520> embossing<00:00:54.270> gun<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.719> I

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
this I took an embossing gun and I

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.040 
this I took an embossing gun and I
heated<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.410> DVD<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.309> once<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.480> heat<00:00:57.809> that

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
heated the DVD and once you heat that

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.160 
heated the DVD and once you heat that
DVD<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:59.340> can<00:00:59.520> then<00:00:59.789> take<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.510> pair<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.899> scissors

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
DVD you can then take a pair of scissors

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.350 
DVD you can then take a pair of scissors
and<00:01:01.559> actually<00:01:02.190> cut<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.730> DVD<00:01:03.600> up<00:01:04.019> like<00:01:04.500> that

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
and actually cut that DVD up like that

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.310 
and actually cut that DVD up like that
so<00:01:06.470> once<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.650> have<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.340> piece<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.390> DVD<00:01:09.840> cut

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
so once you have a piece of that DVD cut

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.100 
so once you have a piece of that DVD cut
out<00:01:10.610> you<00:01:11.610> could<00:01:11.820> then<00:01:12.060> take<00:01:12.619> a<00:01:14.750> rubber<00:01:15.750> stamp

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
out you could then take a rubber stamp

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.390 
out you could then take a rubber stamp
and<00:01:16.790> you<00:01:17.790> could<00:01:18.390> stamp<00:01:18.720> an<00:01:18.960> image<00:01:19.350> on<00:01:20.210> that<00:01:21.210> DVD

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
and you could stamp an image on that DVD

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:30.289 
and you could stamp an image on that DVD
like<00:01:23.400> this<00:01:27.500> now<00:01:28.500> there's<00:01:28.799> an<00:01:29.040> image<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:30.030> this

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
like this now there's an image of this

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.899 
like this now there's an image of this
half<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.810> face<00:01:31.049> on<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.530> DVD<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:32.130> could<00:01:32.460> cut<00:01:32.729> that

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
half a face on that DVD I could cut that

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.120 
half a face on that DVD I could cut that
out<00:01:33.119> more<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.689> was<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> square<00:01:34.290> like<00:01:34.890> it's

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
out more so it was a square like it's

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.999 
out more so it was a square like it's
shown<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.790> painting<00:01:36.329> up<00:01:36.479> there<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:37.009> then

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
shown in that painting up there and then

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.960 
shown in that painting up there and then
on<00:01:38.369> top<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.479> could<00:01:40.079> take<00:01:40.350> some<00:01:41.070> heavy

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
on top of that I could take some heavy

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.080 
on top of that I could take some heavy
embossing<00:01:42.960> powder<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:44.189> could<00:01:44.399> melt<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.909> in

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
embossing powder and I could melt it in

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.929 
embossing powder and I could melt it in
a<00:01:45.210> melting<00:01:45.659> pot<00:01:45.899> like<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.259> here<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.100> once<00:01:47.729> it

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
a melting pot like this here and once it

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.389 
a melting pot like this here and once it
was<00:01:48.090> all<00:01:48.240> melted<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.990> could<00:01:49.500> take<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.869> melted

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
was all melted I could take the melted

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.929 
was all melted I could take the melted
fluid<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.579> pour<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.180> on<00:01:54.360> top<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.890> DVD<00:01:56.100> to

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
fluid and pour it on top of the DVD to

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.359 
fluid and pour it on top of the DVD to
create<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.329> totally<00:01:58.110> different<00:01:58.469> effect<00:01:58.560> on<00:01:59.009> top

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
create a totally different effect on top

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.870 
create a totally different effect on top
and<00:01:59.640> then<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.119> set<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.990> into<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.710> painting<00:02:02.189> so

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
and then I set that into the painting so

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.850 
and then I set that into the painting so
that's<00:02:03.090> just<00:02:03.329> one<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.899> many<00:02:04.170> effects<00:02:04.649> in

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
that's just one of the many effects in

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.319 
that's just one of the many effects in
this<00:02:05.009> painting<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.700> thought<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.060> would

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
this painting and that I thought I would

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.869 
this painting and that I thought I would
talk<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.780> about
