 the morning and an accident that presents itself 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.970
 in the way that jamundí leads to cali 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.340
 where a tractor-trailer vehicle a 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.590
 articulated vehicle when trying to 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.230
 enter the Pan-American highway 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:58.730
 I qualified a loaded vehicle 20 tons 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:01.550
 he carries in his in his body he tries to 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.170
 get up and interrupting the 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.270
 road operation that brings a vehicle of 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.370
 public service a vehicle of the 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.710
 transipiales company where they result 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.390
 seven people injured the vehicle 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.970
 well, he tries to do the 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.920
 maneuver to evade the collision 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.980
 with this vehicle the kind of 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.080
 tractor but it is not possible 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.760
 perform the maneuver 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.190
 the result I repeat seven people 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.280
 injured where the driver of the 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.040
 articulated vehicle of the tractomula 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.630
 tractor truck shows that he tried to 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.910
 do for a signal there with your assistant 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.890
 with a cloth to join the 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.690
 via the conditions are very complicated 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.790
 because at the moment of joining there 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.770
 a there is a small rise is a 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.060
 vehicle that comes pretty pretty 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.980
 heavy 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.290
 he needs a lot of time to be able 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.540
 incorporate to life the result that 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.040
 again seven people injured and 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.930
 everything what what the 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.209
 contractual liability is contractual 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.650
 in this case for the driver for the 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.959
 owner and for the company to which 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.349
 the tractor type truck belongs 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:05.480
 they spoke then to have prudence 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:07.870
 these days with the speed seeing in 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.239
 So, the climate is quite 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.739
 changed and there are rainy days here in 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.480
 santiago de cali changed the subject 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.700
 quickly to people because you have to 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.769
 talk about the operations of 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.979
 control that are being made in the 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.070

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:30.260
 if Pablo giving application to the decree 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.870
 05 August 46, 2012 where 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.050
 they set schedules and some and some 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.060
 Areas of influence in the Holy Gallery

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.790
 Tuesdays on Thursdays on Saturdays 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.280
 market days doing control 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.580
 well to try to make this broker the 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.830
 Calle 23 flow without any inconvenience 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.120
 in conjunction with the secretariat of the 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.909
 government 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.740
 sometimes we stay relatively 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:05:00.830
 alone but we continue doing this work 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.379
 control the result on 9 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.990
 September , 501 orders of 

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:08.360
 appearing formal notifications by 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.240
 different parking situations 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.770
 vehicles in peak and plate vehicles inc 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.409
 and the distinctive vest helmet 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.419
 different situations but everything happened 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:19.250
 there in the in the area influence of the 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.139
 gallery gallery of santa elena 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.300
 Pablo Good, you also have to have 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:26.050
 recommend recommendations to 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.330
 cyclists especially because people 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:31.280
 if article 96 of law 769 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.900
 establishes what the conditions of 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.229
 security in which the 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.639
 cyclists through the different routes that is 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:40.099
 that must travel on the right side 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:43.699
 from the road not more than one meter from the 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:45.860
 of the cord when the steps are going to be 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:48.379
 cross sections can not pretend 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.629
 equate your forces that traction 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:51.500
 human with the ability to 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:53.569
 displacement of vehicles 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.759
 automotive then at the time of making 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:56.480
 any type of crossing with a cross 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:58.550
 cross 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.860
 we can see in the images verify 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.180
 effectively that vehicles do not come and 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.760
 at the moment of doing it 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.560
 completely until you achieve the other side 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.570
 of the causeway is not intended is not 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.540
 pretend to do diagonally that many 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.890
 Sometimes we watch as cyclists 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.360
 they start the march and when they are halfway 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.060
 of the roadway verify if indeed 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.040
 the vehicles that suddenly came in the 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.170
 they will not reach them or if they could 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.330
 do the exercise remember that the 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:26.180
 vehicles the type of bicycle can not 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.550
 transit with another person with passengers 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.350
 they can not travel with some kind of 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.660
 element that prevents them from free 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:35.000
 skill maneuver of the vehicle and the 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.650
 security depends on them are the part 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.590
 more vulnerable of we repeat it again 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.630
 as pedestrians then in each 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.130
 is the responsibility and the 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.930
 self-care in what has to do with 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.740
 driving type vehicles 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.530
