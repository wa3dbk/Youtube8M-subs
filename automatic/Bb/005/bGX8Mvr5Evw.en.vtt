00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
into the game and I think that why it's

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.400 
into the game and I think that why it's
excellent<00:00:53.359> should<00:00:53.629> still<00:00:53.870> have<00:00:54.019> been<00:00:54.289> the

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
Rick's made a couple of nice plays the

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.549 
Rick's made a couple of nice plays the
guy<00:00:58.219> has<00:00:58.430> a<00:00:58.719> tremendous<00:00:59.719> amount<00:00:59.989> of<00:01:00.109> ability

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
guy has a tremendous amount of ability

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.399 
guy has a tremendous amount of ability
that<00:01:00.739> ball<00:01:01.339> right<00:01:01.579> there<00:01:01.820> I<00:01:02.120> think<00:01:02.629> shows<00:01:03.079> why

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
that ball right there I think shows why

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.079 
that ball right there I think shows why
why<00:01:03.800> it<00:01:03.859> sexist<00:01:04.280> understand<00:01:04.610> and<00:01:04.759> that<00:01:04.879> ball

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
why it sexist understand and that ball

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.600 
why it sexist understand and that ball
was<00:01:05.239> open<00:01:05.600> and<00:01:06.049> he<00:01:06.200> overthrew<00:01:06.710> it<00:01:06.860> if<00:01:07.399> Chris

State<00:04:08.830> that's<00:04:09.370> what's<00:04:09.790> on<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:10.780> line<00:04:10.930> for

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
State that's what's on the line for

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.309 
State that's what's on the line for
Maryland<00:04:11.860> the<00:04:12.010> officials<00:04:12.640> blow<00:04:13.600> the<00:04:13.840> whistle

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
Maryland the officials blow the whistle

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.009 
Maryland the officials blow the whistle
and<00:04:14.560> apparently<00:04:15.389> Maryland<00:04:16.389> was<00:04:16.600> thinking<00:04:16.930> the

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
and apparently Maryland was thinking the

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.469 
and apparently Maryland was thinking the
time<00:04:17.229> they<00:04:17.739> were<00:04:17.829> getting<00:04:18.130> down<00:04:18.370> to<00:04:18.669> the<00:04:19.030> zeros

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
time they were getting down to the zeros

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.080 
time they were getting down to the zeros
on<00:04:19.780> the<00:04:19.900> clock<00:04:20.459> and<00:04:21.459> they<00:04:21.579> wanted<00:04:21.910> to<00:04:21.970> take

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
on the clock and they wanted to take

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.680 
on the clock and they wanted to take
that<00:04:22.300> timeout<00:04:22.630> because<00:04:22.960> at<00:04:23.410> this<00:04:23.680> point<00:04:24.690> it's

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
that timeout because at this point it's

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.060 
that timeout because at this point it's
going<00:04:25.810> to<00:04:25.870> be<00:04:25.960> close<00:04:26.290> whether<00:04:26.620> they<00:04:26.800> can<00:04:26.950> run

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
going to be close whether they can run

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.129 
going to be close whether they can run
this<00:04:27.190> clock<00:04:27.430> out<00:04:27.669> and<00:04:28.120> I<00:04:28.270> and<00:04:28.540> I<00:04:28.630> think<00:04:28.690> that

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
this clock out and I and I think that

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.600 
this clock out and I and I think that
what<00:04:29.260> they're<00:04:29.410> going<00:04:29.560> to<00:04:29.620> do<00:04:29.770> is<00:04:29.979> you've<00:04:30.430> got

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
what they're going to do is you've got

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.700 
what they're going to do is you've got
to<00:04:30.729> run<00:04:30.940> the<00:04:30.970> ball<00:04:31.290> because<00:04:32.290> you're<00:04:32.590> gonna

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
to run the ball because you're gonna

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.590 
to run the ball because you're gonna
have<00:04:32.889> to<00:04:32.950> take<00:04:33.070> off<00:04:33.250> about<00:04:33.400> you<00:04:34.120> look<00:04:34.300> at<00:04:34.390> about

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
have to take off about you look at about

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.750 
have to take off about you look at about
37<00:04:35.200> seconds<00:04:35.860> is<00:04:35.950> about<00:04:36.160> the<00:04:36.310> number<00:04:36.580> you<00:04:36.729> think

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
37 seconds is about the number you think

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.520 
37 seconds is about the number you think
that<00:04:37.210> you<00:04:37.330> can<00:04:37.479> run<00:04:37.630> out<00:04:37.780> with<00:04:37.930> one<00:04:38.110> play<00:04:38.350> and

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
that you can run out with one play and

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.230 
that you can run out with one play and
right<00:04:38.650> now<00:04:38.860> Ralph<00:04:39.520> Smith<00:04:39.789> and<00:04:40.000> all<00:04:40.120> the

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
right now Ralph Smith and all the

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.880 
right now Ralph Smith and all the
coaches<00:04:40.419> have<00:04:40.690> the<00:04:40.810> card<00:04:41.050> and<00:04:41.380> I<00:04:41.680> think

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
coaches have the card and I think

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.080 
coaches have the card and I think
they're<00:04:41.979> going<00:04:42.100> to<00:04:42.160> have<00:04:42.250> to<00:04:42.340> know<00:04:42.550> don't<00:04:42.789> Neal

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
they're going to have to know don't Neal

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.000 
they're going to have to know don't Neal
it<00:04:43.270> run<00:04:43.750> it<00:04:43.900> you<00:04:44.050> might<00:04:44.229> buy<00:04:44.410> that<00:04:44.440> extra<00:04:44.890> three

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
it run it you might buy that extra three

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.409 
it run it you might buy that extra three
seconds<00:04:45.370> otherwise<00:04:45.820> they're<00:04:46.120> gonna<00:04:46.240> have<00:04:46.390> to

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
seconds otherwise they're gonna have to

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.540 
seconds otherwise they're gonna have to
punt<00:04:46.630> it<00:04:46.660> away<00:04:46.750> 40<00:04:47.560> seconds<00:04:48.010> left<00:04:48.070> to<00:04:48.370> go<00:04:48.520> on

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
punt it away 40 seconds left to go on

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.680 
punt it away 40 seconds left to go on
the<00:04:48.850> clock<00:04:49.440> as<00:04:50.440> you<00:04:50.800> see<00:04:51.130> the<00:04:52.000> timeout<00:04:52.479> taken
