00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
all right well here we are at the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.950 
all right well here we are at the
station<00:01:07.680> you're<00:01:08.680> in<00:01:08.799> hartwich<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:10.210> we're

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
station you're in hartwich and we're

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.340 
station you're in hartwich and we're
going<00:01:11.110> to<00:01:11.140> take<00:01:11.320> a<00:01:11.380> look<00:01:11.650> like<00:01:11.830> that<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:14.229> we've

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
going to take a look like that so we've

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.200 
going to take a look like that so we've
got<00:01:14.560> on<00:01:14.710> the<00:01:14.830> clock<00:01:15.190> right<00:01:15.580> now<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:18.610> little

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
got on the clock right now a little

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.260 
got on the clock right now a little
tough<00:01:19.540> to<00:01:19.570> see<00:01:19.720> but<00:01:19.960> it<00:01:20.320> reads<00:01:21.330> 4907<00:01:22.500> for<00:01:24.270> all

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
tough to see but it reads 4907 for all

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.889 
tough to see but it reads 4907 for all
right<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:26.710> we'll<00:01:26.860> fill<00:01:27.130> it<00:01:27.250> up<00:01:27.369> and<00:01:28.270> hook<00:01:28.780> up

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
right so we'll fill it up and hook up

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.499 
right so we'll fill it up and hook up
our<00:01:29.049> generator<00:01:29.470> and<00:01:29.979> then<00:01:30.310> 100<00:01:30.729> or<00:01:30.850> 200<00:01:31.299> miles

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
our generator and then 100 or 200 miles

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:40.899 
our generator and then 100 or 200 miles
we'll<00:01:31.810> check<00:01:32.020> it<00:01:32.170> and<00:01:32.289> see<00:01:32.380> how<00:01:32.470> we<00:01:32.590> did

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:02:10.570 

No

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.740 

one<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.730> advantages<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.300> an<00:02:12.390> ear<00:02:12.540> cool

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
one of the advantages of an ear cool

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.330 
one of the advantages of an ear cool
lunch<00:02:13.020> especially<00:02:13.200> when<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:13.860> heads<00:02:14.100> are

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
lunch especially when the heads are

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.820 
lunch especially when the heads are
hanging<00:02:14.700> down<00:02:14.910> below<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.750> sheet<00:02:16.350> Tim<00:02:16.650> that

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
hanging down below the sheet Tim that

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.310 
hanging down below the sheet Tim that
you<00:02:16.920> see<00:02:17.130> here<00:02:17.520> that<00:02:17.730> way<00:02:18.570> it<00:02:18.690> just<00:02:18.720> stays<00:02:19.020> cool

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
you see here that way it just stays cool

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.130 
you see here that way it just stays cool
anyway<00:02:19.770> but<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.270> engine<00:02:21.270> never<00:02:21.540> builds<00:02:21.990> up

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
anyway but the engine never builds up

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.590 
anyway but the engine never builds up
any<00:02:22.320> heat<00:02:22.680> well<00:02:23.460> it's<00:02:23.670> been<00:02:23.850> about<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.120> week<00:02:24.420> and

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
any heat well it's been about a week and

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.290 
any heat well it's been about a week and
a<00:02:24.690> half<00:02:24.720> which<00:02:25.260> is<00:02:25.440> about<00:02:25.650> two<00:02:26.610> or<00:02:26.700> three<00:02:26.910> more

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
a half which is about two or three more

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.060 
a half which is about two or three more
days<00:02:27.510> longer<00:02:27.990> than<00:02:28.200> my<00:02:28.500> tank<00:02:28.770> should<00:02:28.950> have

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
days longer than my tank should have

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.000 
days longer than my tank should have
gone<00:02:29.280> for<00:02:29.870> so<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:30.900> believe<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.410> hydrogen

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
gone for so I believe the hydrogen

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.420 
gone for so I believe the hydrogen
generation<00:02:32.490> is<00:02:32.760> working<00:02:33.470> but<00:02:34.470> just<00:02:35.130> started

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
generation is working but just started

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.100 
generation is working but just started
up<00:02:35.550> this<00:02:35.730> morning<00:02:36.120> will<00:02:36.270> head<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.690> gas

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
up this morning will head to the gas

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:51.640 
up this morning will head to the gas
station<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.740> find<00:02:38.250> out<00:02:38.460> for<00:02:38.670> sure
