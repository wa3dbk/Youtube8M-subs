00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.429
 other birthdays were the ones that 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.740
 They sent the editorials that I could swallow 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.470

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.440
 cups I keep open in the news 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.170

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:34.350

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.410

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.120

 is the author of the saga 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:54.540
 the truth is I'm not sure how is the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.239
 traced precision that is very good 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.070
 so I read the synopsis of this book and 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.059

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.480

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.110
 so 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.810
 obviously then I decided to ask 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.870

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.910

 study a boarding school in england p and 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.980
 that in that boarding school things happen 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.750
 strange and so more or less of soil the 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.630
 story I do not know very well he has not read 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.410

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.070
 ypf books go but do not know how good

 how many books is it going to be a 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.020

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.659
 they tell me that it is very bad 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.609
 I do not know I never animal in the like that 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.260
 it does not appeal to me but this book 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:21.299
 I saw my friend's review 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.430
 galli of dreaming a gay world liked it 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:26.640
 quite then these muscles to 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.010
 read it because to her because I have 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.870
 like that similar tastes that says that 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.579
 It's like running or dying in the 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.590
 which is based a little bit of this game 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:36.689
 who do not know what waves augur 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.560
 stories sent me seas home in 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.139
 Icelandic 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.299
 of the hera soler they the writer of 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:44.099
 the days that separate us have already given me 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.959
 I loved this topic receiving and 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.359
 every doing they have seen it they can 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.799
 look for women in that book 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:53.129
 loved I really like how is the 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.930
 writing of the already soler then I was 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.810
 I muscularly read this book because I've 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.519
 heard many good things and in fact already 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.889
 I read it giving it to see in Europe and 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.409
 probably in the reviews that are 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:05.760
 They come soon because I gathered 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:08.700
 several scripts from the same publisher 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.500
 so yes that book I loved it I 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.140
 I will say more in europe but 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.450
 and finally they have achieved crossing me 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.820
 sent two scripts between them is that you 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.620
 you go without saying goodbye to Sara say me 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.530
 I've only read but you read only 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.510
 listen to her and I tell you I loved it 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.430
 I really fell in love with the history of 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.680
 the characters and how the story tells 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.200
 it must be then when you had 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.880
 some news and you need to read it 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.730
 I did not care if it was in Spanish because I 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.860
 I thought it would be difficult for me to read them 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.390
 since I had read another English book 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.730
 then I thought that I would not be able to 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.530
 adjust that I would not like for this 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.270
 I also read this book and I loved it 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.280
 it also did not affect me at all 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.709
 read from Spanish and also sent the 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.020
 darkness of lemony snicket this book 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.570
 I saw it on the bizet channel in English 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.489
 it's called the dark then she since 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.440
 it was very intense and although it is for 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.360
 children then when I saw him in the 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.760
 What's new I said then ask for it despite 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.650
 make it for 10,000 plants and then 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.050
 I asked for it and I just read it 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.790
 little bit and this beautiful lemony snicket me 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.170
 really liked it and now if we go to the 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.730
 little books that they gave me in my 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.739
 birthday do not think they gave me 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.450
 very many because my house has as 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.230
 that the philosophy of not giving my 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.000
 books 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.190
 and their families and wood the books 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.430
 then I have three books to show 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.220
 the first one is chemical cj bag in the 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.740
 second part of the flagship trilogy 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.020
 I already read first it was sent to me by Beyer and 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.970
 I was fascinated with history with the 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.920
 characters then nobody told me that you 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.620
 will pass my list of books because they had 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.270
 a surprise for me I said good 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.910
 then the boyfriend peace they gave me 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.040
 this book then yes it made me very happy 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.170
 because I really wanted to know 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.440
 how was the saga going to continue? 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:52.590
 this year the third part comes out I'm not 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.270
 sure but yes and then there was no 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.490
 gave away another free all of which 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.449
 I chose I came to his love if he told me 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.029
 choose two books and I do 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.770
 die because I said and told him no matter 

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:06.349
 almost better does not matter the price of 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.509
 more emotions and chosen so simple 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:10.909
 how to tweet I want you from plugins this 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:13.039
 it's the new duty nights I do not know if that 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:15.680
 conclusive act I do not matter to you 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:17.120
 it was not auto conclusion me somewhere 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.159
 I heard him say it was like a 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.020
 trilogy but then I was fine what 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:23.419
 It is autoconclusive and I will tell you more in 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.039
 europe and probably do a review 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:27.919
 I do not know if you are interested tell me here 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:29.839
 some comments but I stayed with 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:32.930
 Many doubts because obviously I already read it 

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:36.199
 and I have taken them and I have the idea of 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:39.080
 that is not a single book of the after 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:41.629
 Anato's infinite love this is the fourth 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.219
 and last book in the saga after and 

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:45.800
 patience are all the books that I 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:48.080
 they arrived in this month of August I hope 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.330
 that you liked it and tell me the 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.310
 comments had some two books and 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.749
 will show them if they did not like them and all 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.249
 those that throw me said the comments 

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:57.800
