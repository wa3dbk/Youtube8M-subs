00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:17.240
 great fighters with you three yes and we 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:21.200
 finish our marathon heavy tanks in 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:24.470
 cake icing on ki namely 4 m m 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:28.009
 means that it drives mostly 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.289
 men, of course, real men 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:33.790
 why well because the tank has 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:37.730
 absolutely everything to be easy 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:40.250
 bend effortlessly and we have here in 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.500
 As an example, the battle on the map 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.510
 I remember what is called there in general new 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.820
 I don’t really like her card 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.059
 so what is his name me know and 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:53.600
 I do not want it doesn’t matter in general 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:56.869
 i like real truth and walls drivers 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.059
 from 4 half a tank of mine bombs and here is our 

00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:01.640
 the first victim is ferdinand but we 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:06.260
 they just shut up their own landmine 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.960
 straight into the wheelhouse and the guy off went 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.670
 just that he catapulted 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.630
 teleports to the hangar ok and we see 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:18.049
 there is still yagtigr and still ferdinand oh 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:21.140
 missed what a shame oh oh oh yo her 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.280
 what to do what to do 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.590
 we will be with you 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.540
 and we just drive forward while we have 20 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.540
 seconds of charging we are calm now 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.240
 we will drive a little closer and take them 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.070
 already more aiming for us this is not 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.920
 make no problems because 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.020
 Ferdinand punches not punches more precisely 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.810
 not a kilometer away and 500 meters 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.330
 so on 200 so absolutely nothing 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.430
 scary since march on me well i have been torturing 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.979
 bum on the swing and too early 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.610
 bummed shorter did not hit oh oh 3d 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:55.310
 alyoshka 30 cm you understand that what of 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.520
 four just softens his brain 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.920
 leftovers they just run off in heels here 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.479
 these leftovers are simply running down the bones 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.880
 this is unforgivable now i play 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:11.950
 deliberately as typically randomly Alikhan well 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.390
 and again the life-giving bomb gives the fire 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.440
 Ferdinand oh thank goodness 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.959
 the shields still survived on the left by us thrashing to t105 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.040
 that means, and you know, I was not particularly impressed 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.819
 saving up shooting 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.459
 because i'm on c4 we are here therefore i'm not 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.740
 tired board well damaged chassis and 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:34.250
 something on bummed jagtiger than country 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:37.430
 who didn’t try nights 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.280
 find the reed with a sight something not 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:44.600
 turned out let's say okay okay okay 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:47.570
 okay but I save on beans 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.440
 proper ally at the hands 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.880
 ferdinand and 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:56.660
 about hallelujah to t105 could my word 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.300
 arson and rendered the engine that's it 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.650
 I understand this now the Germans have a holiday 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.830
 how so to extend 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.200
 In board Ia fourth ted I understand 30 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.690
 seconds of repair but we are not afraid 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.269
 why are we here a dagger who is nothing to us 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.070

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.560

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.300
 control wait interface is connected 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.750
 under see where is my friend 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:24.799
 Well, the rattle and goes to rage okay sets fire 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:27.230

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.750
 five crew members month transmission well 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.720
 and stand on all recharge stand 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.750
 calmly repairing myself okay 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.690
 the engine is already alive and we see that guy 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.060
 here is this sledge he is a typical driver t-54 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.480
 there is already something that is not taking 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.850
 yagdtigra think that you need to give him how 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.910
 eat so from such a big 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.670
 such a corner as a truly famously shoot and 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.040
 I do not break into the board of the pitheads and not 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.600
 stop because well i'm to the tiger and 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.329
 the same in principle 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.730
 eaten tank so it is all 4 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:04.040
 still it miraculously gets such well 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.400
 we go to our abuser 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.400
 who dared to touch our engine ah 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.820
 you hell is yes we cues you now here 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.320
 let 's make a gruel then mother so that's it 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.870
 shorter roll roll keeps 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.050
 we have a friend kanovka teeth 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:25.520
 kitty kitty kitty from my good roll away well 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:28.290
 hold the bun straight in the forehead of the tower will think 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.900
 think there you want 161 millimeter 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:34.350
 only written 180 but we all know 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:38.460
 that we have implemented quality armor 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:41.370
 Well, the food myself more food food food from someone 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.340
 this is u somewhere katan hiding 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.400
 somewhere there is a katan hiding right in the bushes 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.650
 what do you have to kill him over his 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.900
 kill head sticks out he shoots us 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.780
 we are with you cradle skill 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.630
 so right in the mask tools we break through 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:00.180
 katana 105 and destroy the next 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:03.030
 enemy machine basically on this boyd 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.880
 already ended out of 4 mu and all 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.920
 won who would doubt it was necessary 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.110
 of course I try to drive in style 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.570
 tapco assholes ahead but for and that engine 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.940
 you did not give out too often and therefore 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.130
 I'd probably have a lot 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.940
 repaired well, and so in principle 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:22.770
 car is a dream dtsp chocolate out of 4 car 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.350
 Dc arable land to dream 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.630
 in general, if you didn't like this fight 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.910

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.660
