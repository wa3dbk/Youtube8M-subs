00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.759
 the simple things are the ones 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.690
 play to complex adventure 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.690
 grow up 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.889
 an old game the clever too 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:20.039
 revolutionize 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:21.840
 Give something unprecedented when 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.369
 do you have the last time with real ones 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.369
 friends experienced new 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.760
 we all know that the classic 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.519
 lineup at a kicker two 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.360
 figures stand in defense 5 in 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:54.940
 midfield and three in the storm 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.809
 and of course he did not forget 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.269
 suppose you want this now 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.530
 change fixed setting 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:01.820
 Maybe it's his 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.710
 defended by a player increased 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.890
 should be and for that are enough 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:13.789
 always brilliant scorer in front 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:15.289
 So what to do out of 253 already makes 352 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:17.450
 This results in a whole new 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:19.759
 team staging and that's exactly what 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.110
 now possible with the live ticker 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.700
 open up to you a series of 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.810
 different constellations each after 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.420
 For example , it may change 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.159
 even during a game the best 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.170
 You can do that much more tactically 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.970
 you can act on the example 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.970
 exhibition of the opponent react 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.610
 it sounds simple too 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.140
 and that's how it works 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.350
 by the push of a button the figure of the rod 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.680
 Then solve the corresponding 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.430
 slide position until it engages 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.430
 That's it 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.930
 You could say it's like a kitchen 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.920
 extension to a factual experience 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.340
 so to speak a tactic play tactically with 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.340
