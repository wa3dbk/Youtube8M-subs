 states with gastÃ³n acurio to share his message of fact optimism 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.790
 realistic 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.309
 he is an entrepreneur who is betting on him but 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.189
 and he has been fighting for many years 

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:14.579
 already a very special talent but with all the obstacles with which they have to 

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:17.630
 fight all the entrepreneurs so you have to congratulate him on that side of 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.150
 immediately good night as a strategist 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.349
 We are here with you to try to transmit some of your energy 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:27.990
 our audience and I would like to start 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.160
 even though your trajectory and your message come from a long time ago 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:35.019
 like some messages that have to do with this week and that you have published 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.800
 for example 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.290
 about this need that there was for people to know 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.930
 where were we going to go if the economy went well or bad 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.949
 you mention t in the case of the stock market 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:49.830
 the stock market falls for fear of the investors 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.790
 cooks and restaurant and soul entrepreneurs tend to pine dreams or 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.800
 local entrepreneurs in general sigal betting on the future not a step 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.879
 back to continue investing in our homeland 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:03.710
 that is our duty 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:04.690
 could you 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.900
 explain a little more we understand it but delve a bit into this philosophy and into 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.150
 this message for people who are afraid of what can happen for example 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.290
 In economic terms 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.290
 If Peru is to be a businessman, it is a privilege 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.560
 It is an honor 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.400
 it's good luck 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.430
 that in some cases seriousness other cases a lot of work is spent 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.570
 but above all his enormous responsibility because somehow 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.340
 makes you a leader 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.340
 of a leader in moments of uncertainty 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.030
 he is the one who can least doubt 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.720
 is the one that has to advance 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.140
 that there have to be signals from society to those who have least 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.229
 lg 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.530
 who also gave the yes 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.130
 to both universal responsibility in the case of daily press 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.050
 d that before the storm 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.190
 I faced 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.360
 yes clear but it has a fear cat 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.470
 before it will be 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.520
 - Cloudy delay fearing 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.940
 I have no fear of the art mote mora mora 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.850
 that people can say 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.209
 I must point to me as a coward 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.379
 to shame they voted you afraid to get old from 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.189
 and that people say t 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.749
 the earthquake is a generation more 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:22.870
 that he was not able to in this immensely rich country 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.739
 have achieved a partnership 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.929
 who is also prosperous and equally prospering 

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:30.529
 percent 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:32.659
 josito ropes sol 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:34.859
 that they called us for that prayer 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:36.869
 per 100 where 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:39.479
 he was saying goodbye for 

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:40.829
 valera peru 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.349
 strap he had to ask 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.499
 goodbye for the Peruvians we are going to 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:49.099
 if there is a place in the world where God has created everything and has put everything 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:50.369
 in Peru 

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:51.809
 but nevertheless 

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:54.809
 having everything the Peruvian society has not been able 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:58.699
 in fact see the conditions so that all Peruvians can enjoy 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:59.169
 is 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:03.449
 these riches that peru percent and count naturally not then 

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:05.329
 percent 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:06.629
 It is important 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:10.709
 that we businessmen assume once and for all as it comes assuming a great 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.969
 amount of entrepreneurs to say it 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:15.689
 but the responsibility to determine 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:18.179
 to feel part of this process 

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:19.989
 who should drive 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.180
 in the next 10 years to a country that finally managed to build a society 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.309
 prosperous for everyone we go procession like that 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:28.779
 efe 

00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:33.049
 if there is a country in the world that has the opportunities more than ever today 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.769
 day to achieve it 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.309
 It is Peru 

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:39.909
 in a couple of critical minutes then give yourself a mother is saying they were 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:40.919
 part 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:45.059
 PS the entrepreneur has an important responsibility is for the moment that 

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:48.059
 Peru is living by the uncertainty that yes in the elections 

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:49.660
 not now 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.810
 scientifically clear and I do not speak only the business but spoke of 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.839
 of elites in general moderate intellectual business policies 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:00.809
 always to him 

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:04.189
 I always believe that they have not lived up to the circumstances and not if not already 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:07.580
 we would be a first world country beat germany mercantilism there is no 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.600
 The habit of making money without investing money is not the important thing that says that 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.539
 is being overcome 

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:16.509
 and the biggest proof that it's like that 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:19.539
 have been the last ten years of democracy 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:22.539
 in a development model where the state 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.719
 e has not invested in private activity 

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:29.770
 the wealth that has been created between the last ten years highlighted has created 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.110
 Peruvian society 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.110
 percent and Peruvian society lacks a democratic model 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.559
 who will continue to defend 

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:40.939
 and a Peruvian society that will continue to create wealth 

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:45.379
 the state the government of the day is a representative of Peruvian society 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.270
 whose mission is 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.659
 manage 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:52.569
 these energies that society has from which mind to continue creating wealth 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.039
 but it is also important to say that in these last ten years 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.930
 The bad of the model has also been done by society 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.380
 because just as the businessman who pays his taxes regularly fell I think 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.479
 that does not 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:06.889
 that leads to taxes regularly 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.290
 as well as in the extraordinary mining company that generates wellness 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.449
 Atone environment there have been mining companies have contaminated 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.160
 and so we can continue in each sector of the economy is society that has 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:23.300
 created that not the one that has created the bad in consequence is the society that has 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.650
 who assumed today the responsibility to continue building the good 

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:32.749
 try to attack ships the bad things then what is to say is that in 

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:34.099
 instead of complaining 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:35.169
 invest more 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:36.339
 put the shoulder 

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:38.830
 to play it for Peru in the coming years 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.120
 you have to live ethically 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.169
 you have to live with the sense of honor 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:45.610
 the sense of 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.509
 of the satisfaction of knowing how to get there 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:50.259
 we had been 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:52.569
 part of this generation 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:56.009
 I use the power that somehow had 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:58.369
 to build society 

00:05:58.369 --> 00:06:00.919
 of which our grandchildren are to feel proud 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:04.849
 a leading country in the world that goes but warning the world with what 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:07.539
 we have somehow 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:10.820
 that makes Peruvians feel proud when they travel 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.210
 of what they are and that people recognize them as members of a 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.849
 society and a country 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:17.639
 model in the world 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:20.639
 percent that what you have to take that responsibility 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:24.499
 I think there can be nothing more rewarding than that 

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:27.339
 it was time that his days of government did not end 

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:27.999
 I stayed here
