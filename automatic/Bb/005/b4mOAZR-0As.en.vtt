00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
this is the more natural-looking thought

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.250

here in the front it's kind of like a

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.180 
here in the front it's kind of like a
kind<00:03:53.370> of<00:03:53.460> coarse<00:03:53.820> texture<00:03:54.800> compared<00:03:55.800> to<00:03:55.920> the

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
kind of coarse texture compared to the

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.220 
kind of coarse texture compared to the

baby hair always seemed a little course
more<00:04:01.590> course<00:04:02.130> than<00:04:02.459> the<00:04:02.820> actual<00:04:03.090> hair<00:04:03.660> I<00:04:03.690> don't

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
loose because I to me and this is just

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.940 
loose because I to me and this is just
me<00:04:25.770> uh<00:04:26.100> I<00:04:26.700> like<00:04:27.600> my<00:04:28.020> hair<00:04:28.050> to<00:04:28.560> look<00:04:28.650> a<00:04:28.800> little

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
me uh I like my hair to look a little

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.260 
me uh I like my hair to look a little
natural<00:04:29.220> though<00:04:29.850> you<00:04:30.750> know<00:04:30.870> more<00:04:32.270> realistic

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
natural though you know more realistic

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.010 
natural though you know more realistic
to<00:04:33.720> me<00:04:33.750> that<00:04:34.410> after<00:04:34.650> you<00:04:35.040> do<00:04:35.430> that<00:04:35.990> actually<00:04:36.990> I

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
to me that after you do that actually I

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.830 
to me that after you do that actually I
think<00:04:37.110> it<00:04:37.410> looks<00:04:37.440> a<00:04:37.710> little<00:04:37.890> better<00:04:38.630> once<00:04:39.630> you

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
think it looks a little better once you

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.960 
think it looks a little better once you
loosen<00:04:40.080> up<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.500> curl<00:04:40.740> to<00:04:41.460> make<00:04:41.640> it<00:04:41.790> look<00:04:41.910> more

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
loosen up the curl to make it look more

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.580 
loosen up the curl to make it look more
natural<00:04:42.210> because<00:04:42.840> so<00:04:43.740> this<00:04:44.430> is<00:04:44.640> how<00:04:44.850> I<00:04:45.380> would

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
natural because so this is how I would

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.120 
natural because so this is how I would
come<00:04:48.430> out<00:04:48.640> the<00:04:48.790> curl<00:04:49.170> and<00:04:50.170> just<00:04:50.590> where<00:04:50.890> heart

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.530 
might glue her down later um it's okay
and<00:05:05.710> like<00:05:05.860> i<00:05:05.980> said<00:05:06.040> the<00:05:06.310> hair<00:05:06.460> texture<00:05:06.970> is<00:05:07.240> fine

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
and like i said the hair texture is fine

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.770 
and like i said the hair texture is fine
it's<00:05:08.170> just<00:05:08.530> the<00:05:08.740> baby<00:05:08.950> here<00:05:09.400> and<00:05:09.700> that<00:05:10.600> the

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
it's just the baby here and that the

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.300 
it's just the baby here and that the
fact<00:05:11.050> that<00:05:11.230> the<00:05:11.640> the<00:05:12.640> lathe<00:05:12.940> isn't<00:05:14.070> all<00:05:15.070> the

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
fact that the the lathe isn't all the

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.850 
fact that the the lathe isn't all the
way<00:05:15.430> down<00:05:15.820> from<00:05:16.300> ear<00:05:16.660> to<00:05:16.870> ear<00:05:16.900> is<00:05:17.290> not<00:05:17.530> believe

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
way down from ear to ear is not believe

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.170 
way down from ear to ear is not believe
it<00:05:18.100> infinitely<00:05:18.780> it's<00:05:19.830> like<00:05:20.830> west<00:05:21.190> on<00:05:21.610> the<00:05:21.640> side

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
it infinitely it's like west on the side

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.480 
it infinitely it's like west on the side
so<00:05:22.660> i<00:05:22.990> don't<00:05:23.350> like<00:05:23.530> that<00:05:23.740> and<00:05:23.980> i<00:05:24.070> think<00:05:24.340> it

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
so i don't like that and i think it

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.010 
so i don't like that and i think it
gives<00:05:25.120> the<00:05:25.330> hairline<00:05:25.780> a<00:05:25.810> more<00:05:27.240> a<00:05:28.240> lace<00:05:28.810> front

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
gives the hairline a more a lace front

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.950 
gives the hairline a more a lace front
