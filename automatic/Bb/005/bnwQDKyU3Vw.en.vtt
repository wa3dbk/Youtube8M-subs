00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 Hello all friends with you first 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.330
 game channel and today we will try 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.340
 run gta 5 on one core four 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.040
 gigabytes of ram with 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:22.680
 gtx 560 video card with volume 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:24.560
 video memory one gigabyte but when trying 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.289
 run the game on 4 gigabytes 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:31.410
 RAM was eternal loading 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.550
 this is when we installed already 8 gigabytes 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.770
 random access memory 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.079
 the game started fine without any 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.350
 problems I ran it just in case 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.989
 window and now move on to disable kernels 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:48.030
 Well, turn off my through the dispatcher 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:51.719
 tasks to set similarities and disable our 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.030
 2 cores and 2 threads are very single core and two 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.530
 of the flow and only one core remains with us 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:01.230
 ok click priority changed here and in 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.040
 principle we can proceed to the game 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:08.670
 and the game now we have tupit very, very 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.939
 hard that is without a record with us 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.560
 It obtained somewhere somewhere about 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:17.430
 not at all 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.650
 fps can there 5-7 delays are very strong 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.490
 very big and even if you watch 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.520
 down all the same vidos very much 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.840
 tremble at the minimum settings 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.820
 The settings used by the guys are the most 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:35.549
 minimum of 800 points at 480 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:39.750
 permissions and so that's why 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:42.479
 run and maybe but not less than 4 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.770
 gigabytes of RAM should be 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:51.119
 and one core not less than 3233 gigahertz 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:54.960
 at least that's about the game will be 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.110
 work for you like this well if you 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.969
 really hardcore gamer and 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.090
 like to watch the slide show please 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.460
 but you can enjoy it in order to dispel 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.890
 and type questions if I have two 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.739
 cores and 4 gigabytes of RAM 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.700
 will go guys go rockstar done 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:16.319
 good optimism 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.599
 but unfortunately on one core the game leads 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.840
 yourself very unplayable let's 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.560
 now recheck and still turn on 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.000
 two cores 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.550
 let's go over the similarities add another core 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.190
 okay and let's go into the game and now we have 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.459
 the toy works well, in principle 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.410
 ideally that is 2 cores as you see on 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.530
 minimum settings the game works 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.049
 fine does not brake nothing tupit then 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.459
 there is this oh oh oh michael 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:49.380
 fell in principle playable and no 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:53.940
 discomfort on two cores we are not 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:56.730
 We remind you that two cores of 33 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.940
 gigahertz in turbo boost mode in my opinion 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.019
 to three or four they accelerate 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.870
 used ram 8 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:08.160
 gigabyte available there if not mistaken 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:11.069
 seven and a half gigabytes here since 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.000
 see again we will go into the process and 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.880
 gta 5 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.380
 let's prioritize more precisely the similarity and 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:22.319
 turn on all cores on all frames of course 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.660
 the game works great and you know very 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:28.489
 often the viewer has a question and 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:31.350
 dude go gta5 without any leader 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:34.100
 let's check means go to 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:39.750
 process gta 5 click to set the similarity 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:44.730
 choose the cores and go into the game and you 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:48.450
 know it goes go gta 5 without jager guys 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.019
 it goes but it's even more buggy 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.180
 worry 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.450
 guys don't ask more questions like 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.389
 will i have gta on two frames gtx 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.569
 750, etc. etc. 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:03.299
 install and play anyway 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:05.519
 if it is unplayable, delete but on 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.799
 thanks for watching this video 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:11.239
 like to like subscribe to 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.239
