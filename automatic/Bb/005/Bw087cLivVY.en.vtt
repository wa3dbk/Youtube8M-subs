00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
draw is the background it's unusual to

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.490 
draw is the background it's unusual to
work<00:00:53.390> with<00:00:53.600> your<00:00:53.720> hands<00:00:53.960> in<00:00:54.110> oil<00:00:54.320> paint

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
usually you use like brushes but it's

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.179 
usually you use like brushes but it's
actually<00:00:57.049> very<00:00:57.260> common<00:00:57.559> when<00:00:58.070> you're

00:00:58.179 --> 00:00:58.189 
actually very common when you're

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:59.799 
actually very common when you're
creating<00:00:58.369> a<00:00:58.670> video<00:00:58.820> creation<00:00:59.420> to<00:00:59.479> paint<00:00:59.720> on

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
creating a video creation to paint on

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.710 
creating a video creation to paint on
the<00:00:59.869> glass<00:00:59.960> animation<00:01:00.970> most<00:01:01.970> of<00:01:02.239> the<00:01:02.390> people

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
the glass animation most of the people

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.380 
the glass animation most of the people
that<00:01:03.110> create<00:01:03.680> panel<00:01:04.040> gods<00:01:04.250> and<00:01:04.489> agencies<00:01:05.059> so

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
that create panel gods and agencies so

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.200 
that create panel gods and agencies so
they're<00:01:05.570> using<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:06.020> brush<00:01:06.759> yeah<00:01:07.759> because<00:01:08.030> I

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
they're using the brush yeah because I

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.700 
they're using the brush yeah because I
have<00:01:08.450> to<00:01:08.570> use<00:01:08.600> a<00:01:08.720> lot<00:01:08.930> more<00:01:09.110> paint<00:01:09.380> for<00:01:09.590> this

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
have to use a lot more paint for this

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.429 
have to use a lot more paint for this
this<00:01:10.580> is<00:01:10.909> very<00:01:11.180> thin<00:01:11.479> layer<00:01:11.720> so<00:01:12.049> that<00:01:12.170> you<00:01:12.290> can

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
this is very thin layer so that you can

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:13.840 
this is very thin layer so that you can
really<00:01:12.619> see<00:01:12.920> like<00:01:12.950> the<00:01:13.280> light<00:01:13.460> coming<00:01:13.729> through

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
really see like the light coming through

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.840 
really see like the light coming through
it<00:01:14.150> and<00:01:14.299> the<00:01:14.810> ocean<00:01:15.290> because<00:01:15.710> it's<00:01:16.430> a<00:01:16.640> much

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
it and the ocean because it's a much

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.790 
it and the ocean because it's a much
sort<00:01:17.810> of<00:01:18.369> darker<00:01:19.810> object<00:01:20.810> I'm<00:01:21.140> using<00:01:21.380> a<00:01:21.590> paint

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
sort of darker object I'm using a paint

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.960 
sort of darker object I'm using a paint
brush<00:01:23.710> so<00:01:24.710> this<00:01:24.980> is<00:01:25.130> the<00:01:25.280> camera<00:01:25.670> that<00:01:25.700> I<00:01:25.940> have

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
brush so this is the camera that I have

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.930 
brush so this is the camera that I have
above<00:01:26.840> my<00:01:27.770> painting<00:01:28.310> that<00:01:28.490> is<00:01:28.610> going<00:01:28.790> to<00:01:28.850> be

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
above my painting that is going to be

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:36.630 
above my painting that is going to be
recording<00:01:29.570> everything<00:01:30.530> I<00:01:30.770> do

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.990 

and<00:01:37.640> now<00:01:38.090> we<00:01:38.150> have<00:01:38.330> to<00:01:38.450> change<00:01:38.720> it<00:01:38.990> so<00:01:39.620> I<00:01:40.010> keep

what<00:02:18.709> I<00:02:18.739> have<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:19.070> do<00:02:19.220> though<00:02:19.400> is<00:02:19.430> add<00:02:19.910> in<00:02:20.209> a

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
what I have to do though is add in a

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.140 
what I have to do though is add in a
little<00:02:20.750> bit<00:02:20.959> of<00:02:21.170> red<00:02:21.590> sky<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:22.430> cover<00:02:22.670> up<00:02:22.880> what<00:02:23.090> I

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
little bit of red sky to cover up what I

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.449 
little bit of red sky to cover up what I
just<00:02:23.450> took<00:02:23.570> away<00:02:24.190> so<00:02:26.860> this<00:02:27.860> gets<00:02:28.100> a<00:02:28.250> little

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
just took away so this gets a little

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:39.940 
just took away so this gets a little
covered<00:02:28.700> up

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.710 

it's<00:02:40.370> gonna<00:02:40.520> get<00:02:40.670> messy<00:02:40.880> fast<00:02:42.400> so<00:02:43.720> difficult

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
it's gonna get messy fast so difficult

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.460 
it's gonna get messy fast so difficult
to<00:02:44.840> keep<00:02:44.959> this<00:02:45.110> camera<00:02:45.380> steady<00:02:45.709> but<00:02:47.470> you

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
all right right through the clouds gonna

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.600 
all right right through the clouds gonna
come<00:02:55.290> closer<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:55.950> brain<00:02:56.130> a<00:02:58.490> little<00:02:59.490> bit

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
come closer to the brain a little bit

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.230 
come closer to the brain a little bit
closer<00:03:00.800> no<00:03:01.800> no<00:03:02.220> no<00:03:02.280> I'll<00:03:02.430> get<00:03:02.640> rid<00:03:02.820> of<00:03:02.910> part<00:03:03.210> of
