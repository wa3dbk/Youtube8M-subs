but we get into a game so alright so I'm
getting<00:01:07.439> about<00:01:07.700> 40<00:01:08.700> from<00:01:08.909> wine<00:01:09.119> center<00:01:09.540> right

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
getting about 40 from wine center right

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.120 
getting about 40 from wine center right
now<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:09.840> wish<00:01:10.020> there<00:01:10.170> was<00:01:10.229> something<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.650> like

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
now I wish there was something that like

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.200 
now I wish there was something that like
I<00:01:11.250> don't<00:01:11.310> know<00:01:11.460> if<00:01:11.549> they<00:01:11.640> have<00:01:11.790> like<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:12.030> thing

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
I don't know if they have like a thing

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.550 
I don't know if they have like a thing
where<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.600> shows<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.020> have<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.170> guess<00:01:13.290> on<00:01:13.439> the

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
where it shows you have to guess on the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.649 
where it shows you have to guess on the
screen<00:01:13.799> anymore<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.430> need<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.180> figure<00:01:15.360> out<00:01:15.450> they

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
screen anymore I need to figure out they

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.499 
screen anymore I need to figure out they
have<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.040> but<00:01:17.040> I'm<00:01:17.580> getting<00:01:17.820> about<00:01:17.909> 40<00:01:18.240> FPS

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
have that but I'm getting about 40 FPS

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.740 
have that but I'm getting about 40 FPS
right<00:01:18.720> now<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.759> do<00:01:20.759> have<00:01:21.060> my<00:01:21.180> 760

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
right now and I do have my 760

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.350 
right now and I do have my 760
overclocked<00:01:22.110> just<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.409> little<00:01:22.680> bit<00:01:23.240> so<00:01:24.240> my

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
overclocked just a little bit so my

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.240 
overclocked just a little bit so my
performance<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> bit<00:01:25.740> better<00:01:25.890> than<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
performance is a bit better than the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.130 
performance is a bit better than the
stock<00:01:26.549> setting

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
stock setting

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.350 
stock setting
and<00:01:28.230> it<00:01:29.010> works<00:01:29.460> good<00:01:29.700> for<00:01:29.760> me<00:01:29.940> but<00:01:30.150> I'm<00:01:30.240> gonna

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
and it works good for me but I'm gonna

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.500 
and it works good for me but I'm gonna
get<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> second<00:01:31.620> 760<00:01:32.190> anyway<00:01:32.460> just<00:01:32.670> because<00:01:32.790> I

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
get a second 760 anyway just because I

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.600 
get a second 760 anyway just because I
don't<00:01:34.110> think<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.590> performance<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.190> enough<00:01:35.460> I

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
don't think the performance is enough I

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.790 
don't think the performance is enough I
would<00:01:35.760> like<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.970> play<00:01:36.120> an<00:01:36.180> ultra<00:01:36.660> and<00:01:37.050> while

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
would like to play an ultra and while

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.350 
would like to play an ultra and while
I'm<00:01:37.860> not<00:01:37.890> recording<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.550> usually<00:01:38.820> at<00:01:38.880> around<00:01:39.000> 50

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
I'm not recording I usually at around 50
