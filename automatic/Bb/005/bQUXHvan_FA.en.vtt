with a Surfliner except a car sitting
there<00:00:11.070> I<00:00:11.900> test<00:00:12.900> with<00:00:13.080> these<00:00:13.259> guys<00:00:13.500> because<00:00:13.860> I

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950

there I test with these guys because I
think<00:00:13.980> that's<00:00:14.250> about<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.580> longest<00:00:15.059> car<00:00:15.360> I'll

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480

the way the infrared sensors were they
were<00:02:10.709> very<00:02:10.800> sensitive<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:12.750> just<00:02:12.930> went

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
were very sensitive and so I just went

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.089 
were very sensitive and so I just went
ahead<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.849> wired<00:02:14.849> them<00:02:15.060> up<00:02:15.180> using<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.980> old

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
ahead and wired them up using the old

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.020 
ahead and wired them up using the old
standby<00:02:17.760> with<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:19.340> slicing<00:02:20.340> into<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.730> track

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
standby with the slicing into the track

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.770 
standby with the slicing into the track
making<00:02:21.420> an<00:02:21.599> isolated<00:02:22.230> section<00:02:23.600> two<00:02:24.600> more

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
making an isolated section two more

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.160 
making an isolated section two more
signals<00:02:25.230> down<00:02:25.410> here<00:02:25.800> one<00:02:26.100> face<00:02:26.340> in<00:02:26.520> each<00:02:26.640> way

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
signals down here one face in each way

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.650 
signals down here one face in each way
went<00:02:28.170> with<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:29.030> Pennsylvania<00:02:30.030> Railroad<00:02:30.420> type

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
went with the Pennsylvania Railroad type

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.750 
went with the Pennsylvania Railroad type
signals<00:02:31.200> those<00:02:32.040> are<00:02:32.250> pretty<00:02:32.489> neat<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.730> way

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
signals those are pretty neat the way

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.259 
signals those are pretty neat the way
they<00:02:33.000> change<00:02:33.440> position<00:02:34.790> always<00:02:35.790> stay<00:02:36.000> yellow

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
they change position always stay yellow

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.240 
they change position always stay yellow
but<00:02:36.510> change<00:02:36.780> positions<00:02:37.380> I'll<00:02:37.650> give<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:37.950> quick

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
but change positions I'll give you quick

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.390 
but change positions I'll give you quick
glimpse<00:02:38.610> of<00:02:38.700> those<00:02:38.819> in<00:02:39.060> operation<00:02:40.280> put<00:02:41.280> the

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
glimpse of those in operation put the

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.309 
glimpse of those in operation put the
portal<00:02:41.790> there<00:02:42.000> just<00:02:42.569> so<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:42.720> can<00:02:42.959> get<00:02:43.080> a<00:02:43.110> view

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
portal there just so you can get a view

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.080 
portal there just so you can get a view
of<00:02:43.380> how<00:02:43.590> it's<00:02:43.799> going<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:44.040> be<00:02:44.250> obviously

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
of how it's going to be obviously

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.460 
of how it's going to be obviously
everything<00:02:45.540> behind<00:02:45.810> that's<00:02:46.080> going<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.319> be

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
everything behind that's going to be

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.890 
everything behind that's going to be
hidden<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:47.040> then<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.880> staging<00:02:48.480> back<00:02:48.660> there

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
hidden and then the staging back there

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.830 
hidden and then the staging back there
behind<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.319> computer<00:02:49.500> when<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.069> slides<00:02:50.370> out

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
behind the computer when it slides out

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.270 
behind the computer when it slides out
one<00:02:51.840> interesting<00:02:52.380> idea<00:02:52.650> I<00:02:52.709> was<00:02:52.830> talking<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.250> a

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
one interesting idea I was talking to a

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.699 
one interesting idea I was talking to a
friend<00:02:53.459> about<00:02:53.850> since<00:02:54.690> you<00:02:54.840> can<00:02:55.019> see<00:02:55.290> into<00:02:55.650> that

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
friend about since you can see into that

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.199 
friend about since you can see into that
tunnel<00:02:56.310> from<00:02:56.489> this<00:02:56.670> angle

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
tunnel from this angle

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.289 
tunnel from this angle
I'm<00:02:57.420> thinking<00:02:58.319> about<00:02:58.440> completely<00:02:59.299> encasing

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
I'm thinking about completely encasing

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.820 
I'm thinking about completely encasing
that<00:03:01.459> rock<00:03:02.459> details<00:03:03.000> inside<00:03:03.540> also<00:03:04.260> maybe

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
that rock details inside also maybe

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.900 
that rock details inside also maybe
running<00:03:05.130> some<00:03:05.220> small<00:03:05.700> piping<00:03:06.330> as<00:03:06.890> conduit

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
running some small piping as conduit

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.569 
running some small piping as conduit
with<00:03:08.910> some<00:03:09.150> safety<00:03:09.450> lights<00:03:09.900> I<00:03:10.400> think<00:03:11.400> that

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
with some safety lights I think that

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.460 
with some safety lights I think that
would<00:03:11.700> be<00:03:11.790> something<00:03:12.030> fairly<00:03:12.390> neat<00:03:12.750> that<00:03:13.410> I

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
would be something fairly neat that I

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.080 
would be something fairly neat that I
haven't<00:03:13.680> seen<00:03:13.920> too<00:03:14.130> many<00:03:14.220> people<00:03:14.340> do<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:14.970> I'm

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
haven't seen too many people do and I'm

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.120 
haven't seen too many people do and I'm
always<00:03:15.269> like<00:03:16.230> doing<00:03:16.530> something<00:03:16.890> a<00:03:16.950> little

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
always like doing something a little

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.000 
always like doing something a little
different<00:03:17.549> so<00:03:17.850> might<00:03:18.750> just<00:03:18.959> completely<00:03:19.320> take

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
different so might just completely take

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.750 
different so might just completely take
my<00:03:20.190> time<00:03:20.549> and<00:03:21.079> detail<00:03:22.079> that<00:03:22.260> guy<00:03:22.440> out<00:03:22.760> but

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
my time and detail that guy out but

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.560 
my time and detail that guy out but
we'll<00:03:24.239> see<00:03:24.510> that's<00:03:24.840> later<00:03:25.350> as<00:03:26.000> for<00:03:27.000> now<00:03:27.120> let<00:03:27.450> me

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
we'll see that's later as for now let me

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.440 
we'll see that's later as for now let me
slowly<00:03:27.900> run<00:03:28.170> a<00:03:28.200> train<00:03:28.560> around<00:03:28.890> here<00:03:29.250> since<00:03:30.239> I'm

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
slowly run a train around here since I'm

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.440 
slowly run a train around here since I'm
here<00:03:30.660> alone<00:03:30.870> I'm<00:03:31.079> going<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:32.209> run<00:03:33.209> back<00:03:33.420> over

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
here alone I'm going to run back over

here alone I'm going to run back over
there<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:33.959> shut<00:03:34.200> it<00:03:34.320> off<00:03:34.470> so<00:03:34.769> I'll<00:03:34.950> just<00:03:35.130> shut

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
there and shut it off so I'll just shut

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.270 
there and shut it off so I'll just shut
the<00:03:35.459> video<00:03:35.579> off<00:03:36.109> once<00:03:37.109> we<00:03:37.290> clear<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.590> crossing

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
the video off once we clear the crossing

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.440 
the video off once we clear the crossing
alrighty

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450
