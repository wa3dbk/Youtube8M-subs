00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
locks are really really sick so i

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.060 
locks are really really sick so i
figured<00:04:34.830> no<00:04:35.250> let<00:04:35.490> me<00:04:35.580> do<00:04:35.790> single<00:04:36.330> each<00:04:37.110> one<00:04:37.350> and

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
figured no let me do single each one and

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.940 
figured no let me do single each one and
how<00:04:38.880> long<00:04:39.030> it<00:04:39.240> is<00:04:39.300> and<00:04:39.360> then<00:04:39.720> I<00:04:39.810> just<00:04:40.020> I<00:04:40.320> just

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
how long it is and then I just I just

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.010 
how long it is and then I just I just
fold<00:04:41.610> in<00:04:41.850> half<00:04:42.090> and<00:04:42.560> then<00:04:43.560> twist<00:04:44.360> this<00:04:45.360> leaves

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
fold in half and then twist this leaves

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.160 
fold in half and then twist this leaves
a<00:04:46.200> little<00:04:46.320> flute<00:04:46.740> and<00:04:47.490> then<00:04:47.640> you<00:04:47.730> just<00:04:47.910> took

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
a little flute and then you just took

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:53.810 
a little flute and then you just took
all<00:04:49.170> the<00:04:49.230> way<00:04:49.440> down

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.780 

and<00:04:54.820> then<00:04:55.510> you<00:04:55.630> just<00:04:55.980> tore<00:04:56.980> your<00:04:57.160> hair<00:04:57.370> on<00:04:57.580> it

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
and then you just tore your hair on it

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.060 
and then you just tore your hair on it
and<00:04:58.060> you<00:04:58.150> roll<00:04:58.960> it<00:04:59.140> up<00:04:59.260> now<00:04:59.440> now<00:04:59.650> depends<00:04:59.950> of

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
and you roll it up now now depends of

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.830 
and you roll it up now now depends of
how<00:05:00.100> you<00:05:00.220> Reese<00:05:00.490> with<00:05:00.730> on<00:05:00.970> how<00:05:01.180> you're<00:05:01.720> going

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
how you Reese with on how you're going

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.300 
how you Reese with on how you're going
to<00:05:01.930> have<00:05:02.020> to<00:05:02.110> roll<00:05:02.260> your<00:05:02.470> hair<00:05:02.680> up<00:05:02.860> cuz<00:05:03.100> I<00:05:03.190> had

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
to have to roll your hair up cuz I had

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.680 
to have to roll your hair up cuz I had
to<00:05:03.460> figure<00:05:03.640> that<00:05:03.850> out<00:05:03.910> I<00:05:04.030> had<00:05:04.150> to<00:05:04.240> play<00:05:04.420> with<00:05:04.450> it

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
to figure that out I had to play with it

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.810 
to figure that out I had to play with it
because<00:05:04.810> I<00:05:05.020> was<00:05:05.170> twisting<00:05:05.800> the<00:05:05.890> wrong<00:05:06.040> way<00:05:06.220> so

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
because I was twisting the wrong way so

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.970 
because I was twisting the wrong way so
I<00:05:06.850> would<00:05:07.210> untwist<00:05:07.990> my<00:05:08.200> roots<00:05:08.440> that<00:05:08.590> i<00:05:08.650> had<00:05:08.800> just

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
I would untwist my roots that i had just

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.650 
I would untwist my roots that i had just
you<00:05:09.220> know<00:05:09.370> put<00:05:09.400> the<00:05:09.730> stuff<00:05:09.940> when<00:05:10.210> he<00:05:10.240> twisted

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
you know put the stuff when he twisted

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.230 
you know put the stuff when he twisted
that<00:05:10.810> fried<00:05:11.100> figure<00:05:12.100> it<00:05:12.190> out<00:05:12.340> and<00:05:12.580> cheska<00:05:12.910> was

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
that fried figure it out and cheska was

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.090 
that fried figure it out and cheska was
rolling<00:05:13.540> hers<00:05:13.750> up<00:05:13.990> we<00:05:14.140> roll<00:05:14.350> myself<00:05:14.620> didn't

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
rolling hers up we roll myself didn't

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.830 
rolling hers up we roll myself didn't
work<00:05:15.250> for<00:05:15.280> me<00:05:15.490> role<00:05:15.760> of<00:05:15.880> mines<00:05:16.030> under<00:05:16.450> work<00:05:16.600> for
