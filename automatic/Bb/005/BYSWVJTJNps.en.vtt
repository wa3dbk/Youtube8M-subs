our<00:02:10.070> care<00:02:10.610> package<00:02:11.150> predator<00:02:12.049> missile<00:02:12.440> and

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
our care package predator missile and

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.570 
our care package predator missile and
airdrop

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
airdrop

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.150 
airdrop
and<00:02:13.940> now<00:02:14.780> those<00:02:14.989> kill<00:02:15.260> streets<00:02:15.590> aren't<00:02:15.950> not

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
and now those kill streets aren't not

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.979 
and now those kill streets aren't not
they're<00:02:16.549> not<00:02:16.790> smart<00:02:17.269> to<00:02:17.510> use<00:02:17.630> in<00:02:17.780> search

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
they're not smart to use in search

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.199 
they're not smart to use in search
especially<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.709> airdrop<00:02:19.220> well<00:02:19.580> just<00:02:20.000> mainly

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
especially the airdrop well just mainly

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.630 
especially the airdrop well just mainly
the<00:02:20.450> airdrop<00:02:20.840> because<00:02:21.470> it<00:02:21.890> takes<00:02:22.160> forever<00:02:22.430> to

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
the airdrop because it takes forever to

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.340 
the airdrop because it takes forever to
get<00:02:22.850> here<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.239> then<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.510> enemy<00:02:23.900> can<00:02:24.110> steal

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
get here and then the enemy can steal

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.320 
get here and then the enemy can steal
your<00:02:24.530> packages<00:02:25.130> and<00:02:25.400> crap<00:02:25.670> but<00:02:25.910> I<00:02:25.940> don't<00:02:26.239> know

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
your packages and crap but I don't know

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.140 
your packages and crap but I don't know
it's<00:02:26.510> fun<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:26.989> use<00:02:27.140> that<00:02:27.320> like<00:02:27.560> you<00:02:28.430> know<00:02:28.549> care

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
it's fun to use that like you know care

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.789 
it's fun to use that like you know care
packages<00:02:29.660> or<00:02:29.930> you<00:02:29.959> know<00:02:30.320> like<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:30.530> lot<00:02:30.769> of

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
packages or you know like a lot of

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:32.440 
packages or you know like a lot of
chance<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:31.489> luck<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:31.970> they're<00:02:32.120> a<00:02:32.150> little<00:02:32.330> bit

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
chance and luck and they're a little bit

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.870 
chance and luck and they're a little bit
risky<00:02:32.690> to<00:02:33.019> use<00:02:33.049> in<00:02:33.590> search<00:02:34.130> but<00:02:34.430> I<00:02:34.459> like<00:02:34.700> using

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
risky to use in search but I like using

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.570 
risky to use in search but I like using
them<00:02:35.090> I<00:02:35.239> don't<00:02:35.299> know<00:02:35.709> usually<00:02:36.709> they<00:02:36.830> you<00:02:37.459> know

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
them I don't know usually they you know

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.810 
them I don't know usually they you know
get<00:02:37.760> in<00:02:37.850> a<00:02:37.910> c-130<00:02:38.450> so<00:02:38.840> why<00:02:39.019> not<00:02:39.280> and<00:02:40.280> I'm<00:02:40.430> happy

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
get in a c-130 so why not and I'm happy

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.550 
get in a c-130 so why not and I'm happy
they're<00:02:41.000> gonna<00:02:41.090> be<00:02:41.269> back<00:02:41.480> in<00:02:41.720> black<00:02:41.900> ops<00:02:42.200> but

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
they're gonna be back in black ops but

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.990 
they're gonna be back in black ops but
it<00:02:42.650> looks<00:02:42.799> like<00:02:42.950> in<00:02:43.100> black<00:02:43.310> ops<00:02:43.610> like<00:02:43.880> the

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
it looks like in black ops like the

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.880 
it looks like in black ops like the
thing<00:02:44.299> that<00:02:44.510> delivers<00:02:44.959> the<00:02:45.110> package<00:02:45.290> like

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
thing that delivers the package like

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.640 
thing that delivers the package like
moves<00:02:46.310> a<00:02:46.459> lot<00:02:46.640> slower<00:02:47.000> so<00:02:47.930> can<00:02:48.110> be<00:02:48.200> shot<00:02:48.440> down

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
moves a lot slower so can be shot down

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.250 
moves a lot slower so can be shot down
easier<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:49.370> stuff<00:02:49.670> so<00:02:50.540> it<00:02:50.630> looks<00:02:50.810> like<00:02:50.870> kind

was saying about

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.090 
was saying about
though<00:03:11.480> earlier<00:03:11.959> is<00:03:12.230> okay<00:03:12.680> and<00:03:12.770> I<00:03:12.830> hear<00:03:12.980> this

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
though earlier is okay and I hear this

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.320 
though earlier is okay and I hear this
guy<00:03:13.280> right<00:03:13.459> here<00:03:13.490> cuz<00:03:13.730> he<00:03:13.850> hops<00:03:14.030> out<00:03:14.180> the

window<00:03:14.630> but<00:03:15.470> pre<00:03:15.890> firing<00:03:16.459> is<00:03:16.700> probably<00:03:17.510> one<00:03:17.660> of

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
window but pre firing is probably one of

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.270 
window but pre firing is probably one of
the<00:03:17.780> best<00:03:17.959> strategies<00:03:18.170> you<00:03:18.680> can<00:03:18.860> do<00:03:19.010> that

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
the best strategies you can do that

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.460 
the best strategies you can do that
people<00:03:19.610> don't<00:03:19.790> do<00:03:19.940> enough<00:03:20.170> because<00:03:21.170> you<00:03:21.319> know

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
people don't do enough because you know

people don't do enough because you know
like<00:03:22.220> I<00:03:22.370> said<00:03:22.610> if<00:03:22.700> you<00:03:22.790> if<00:03:22.970> you<00:03:23.240> know<00:03:23.390> some<00:03:23.630> guys

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
like I said if you if you know some guys

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.360 
like I said if you if you know some guys
going<00:03:24.050> to<00:03:24.110> be<00:03:24.260> there<00:03:24.500> or<00:03:24.800> he's<00:03:25.010> around<00:03:25.250> the

going to be there or he's around the

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.920 
going to be there or he's around the
corner<00:03:25.400> just<00:03:25.880> start<00:03:26.060> shooting<00:03:26.240> then<00:03:26.569> because

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
corner just start shooting then because

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.330 
corner just start shooting then because
you<00:03:27.080> know<00:03:27.170> call<00:03:27.410> duty<00:03:27.739> is<00:03:27.920> all<00:03:28.100> about

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
you know call duty is all about

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
connection and just if you're shooting

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.290 
connection and just if you're shooting
first<00:03:30.800> that<00:03:31.130> will<00:03:31.550> you<00:03:31.700> know<00:03:31.819> increase<00:03:32.120> your

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
first that will you know increase your

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.210 
first that will you know increase your
odds<00:03:32.420> of<00:03:32.600> killing<00:03:32.959> him<00:03:33.170> if<00:03:33.410> he's<00:03:33.560> hosts<00:03:33.860> and

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
doing clutches at the beginning so like

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.450 
doing clutches at the beginning so like
the<00:04:20.959> first<00:04:21.140> one<00:04:21.320> in<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:21.500> video<00:04:21.650> was<00:04:22.010> just<00:04:22.250> you

know<00:04:22.490> gameplay<00:04:23.060> noises<00:04:23.540> and<00:04:23.840> that's<00:04:24.110> not<00:04:24.590> as

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
know gameplay noises and that's not as
