your bolt carrier that's it in a

your bolt carrier that's it in a
nutshell<00:00:43.140> now<00:00:44.010> let's<00:00:44.309> look<00:00:44.489> at<00:00:44.610> some<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.910> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
nutshell now let's look at some of the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.389 
nutshell now let's look at some of the
design<00:00:45.149> aspects<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.649> pistol<00:00:47.070> grip<00:00:47.100> is

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
design aspects the pistol grip is

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.180 
design aspects the pistol grip is
clearly<00:00:47.700> m16<00:00:48.660> influenced<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.710> has<00:00:50.160> a

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
clearly m16 influenced and has a

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.040 
clearly m16 influenced and has a
selector<00:00:50.730> switch<00:00:50.760> kind<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.600> like<00:00:51.750> what<00:00:51.930> you

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
selector switch kind of like what you

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.920 
selector switch kind of like what you
see<00:00:52.230> on<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.410> g36<00:00:53.090> it<00:00:54.090> has<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> bolt<00:00:54.629> hold-open

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
see on a g36 it has a bolt hold-open

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.979 
see on a g36 it has a bolt hold-open
device<00:00:55.320> unlike<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.070> earlier<00:00:56.489> mp5<00:00:57.270> it's

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
device unlike the earlier mp5 it's

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.810 
device unlike the earlier mp5 it's
activated<00:00:58.649> right<00:00:58.800> here<00:00:59.070> much<00:00:59.309> like<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.670> one

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
activated right here much like the one

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.750 
activated right here much like the one
on<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.059> m16<00:01:00.690> or<00:01:00.870> m4<00:01:01.039> now<00:01:02.039> what<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:02.520> seen

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
on the m16 or m4 now what I have seen

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.280 
on the m16 or m4 now what I have seen
it's<00:01:02.969> essentially<00:01:03.449> set<00:01:03.690> up<00:01:03.719> better<00:01:03.989> for<00:01:04.080> a

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
it's essentially set up better for a

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.420 
it's essentially set up better for a
right-handed<00:01:04.830> shooter<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.250> when<00:01:05.400> a

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
right-handed shooter so when a

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.899 
right-handed shooter so when a
right-handed<00:01:05.939> shooter<00:01:06.000> inserts<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.750> mag

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
right-handed shooter inserts a mag

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:09.289 
right-handed shooter inserts a mag
brings<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.030> up

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
brings it up

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.120 
brings it up
it's<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.659> bolt<00:01:09.840> release<00:01:09.990> like<00:01:10.320> on<00:01:10.470> an<00:01:10.560> m16

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
it's the bolt release like on an m16

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.830 
it's the bolt release like on an m16
sends<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.610> bolt<00:01:11.820> back<00:01:12.000> forward<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
sends the bolt back forward the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.480 
sends the bolt back forward the
left-hander<00:01:13.439> has<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.650> couple<00:01:14.130> different

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.960 
options
once<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.500> mags<00:01:16.740> inserted<00:01:17.430> he<00:01:17.549> can<00:01:17.729> come<00:01:17.939> up

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
once the mags inserted he can come up

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.789 
once the mags inserted he can come up
underneath<00:01:18.540> which<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.290> method<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.770> prefer

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
underneath which is the method I prefer

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.070 
underneath which is the method I prefer
and<00:01:20.670> release<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.150> with<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:21.479> finger<00:01:21.750> or<00:01:21.869> hand

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
release the charging handle style like

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.469 
release the charging handle style like
an<00:01:25.350> mp5<00:01:27.320> now<00:01:28.320> unlike<00:01:29.130> an<00:01:29.369> mp5<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:30.299> not<00:01:30.450> a

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
an mp5 now unlike an mp5 this is not a

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.300 
an mp5 now unlike an mp5 this is not a
roll<00:01:30.720> lock<00:01:31.049> gun<00:01:31.320> it's<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.650> straight<00:01:32.009> blowback

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
roll lock gun it's a straight blowback

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.270 
roll lock gun it's a straight blowback
gun<00:01:32.850> in<00:01:33.060> but<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.420> does<00:01:33.659> have<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.320> firing<00:01:35.040> pin

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.310 
gun in but it does have a firing pin
safety<00:01:35.549> that's<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.689> don't<00:01:36.810> have<00:01:37.170> an

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
safety that's so you don't have an

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.319 
safety that's so you don't have an
inertia<00:01:37.680> fire<00:01:38.040> or<00:01:38.250> slam<00:01:38.579> fires<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.119> goes

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
inertia fire or slam fires that goes

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.330 
inertia fire or slam fires that goes
forward<00:01:39.720> now<00:01:40.350> one<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.740> problems<00:01:40.890> with

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
forward now one of the problems with

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.340 
forward now one of the problems with
that<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.670> very<00:01:41.970> reliable<00:01:42.540> gun<00:01:42.689> no<00:01:42.960> doubt<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
that is very reliable gun no doubt the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.139 
that is very reliable gun no doubt the
bolt<00:01:43.619> mass<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.159> part<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.640> issue<00:01:44.729> but<00:01:45.030> it

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
bolt mass is part of the issue but it

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.850 
bolt mass is part of the issue but it
has<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.360> little<00:01:45.750> bit<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.079> thump<00:01:46.350> coming<00:01:46.710> back

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
has a little bit of thump coming back

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.649 
has a little bit of thump coming back
and<00:01:47.040> forth<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.670> cyclic<00:01:48.090> rate<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> little

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
and forth the cyclic rate is a little

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.170 
and forth the cyclic rate is a little
bit<00:01:48.869> higher<00:01:49.110> than<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.470> might<00:01:49.680> like<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.220> me

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
bit higher than you might like to me

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.450 
bit higher than you might like to me
this<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.540> really<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.840> gun<00:01:52.140> that's<00:01:52.380> just<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.070> short

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
this is really a gun that's just a short
