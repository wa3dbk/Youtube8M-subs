00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:08.829 
be achieved by doing cross wraps we will

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:10.830 
be achieved by doing cross wraps we will
not<00:01:09.009> be<00:01:09.100> going<00:01:09.250> into<00:01:09.490> these<00:01:09.820> pages<00:01:10.149> because

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
not be going into these pages because

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.300 
not be going into these pages because
what<00:01:11.020> do<00:01:11.109> we<00:01:11.200> have<00:01:11.320> to<00:01:11.439> do<00:01:11.560> is<00:01:11.679> start<00:01:11.979> with<00:01:12.219> the

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
what do we have to do is start with the

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.370 
what do we have to do is start with the
basics<00:01:12.789> if<00:01:13.270> you<00:01:13.420> want<00:01:13.600> to<00:01:13.719> take<00:01:13.929> it<00:01:14.109> a<00:01:14.200> little

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
basics if you want to take it a little

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.510 
basics if you want to take it a little
further<00:01:15.179> then<00:01:16.179> you<00:01:16.210> go<00:01:16.450> into<00:01:16.890> advanced<00:01:17.890> custom

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
further then you go into advanced custom

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.450 
further then you go into advanced custom
rod<00:01:18.729> building<00:01:19.210> and<00:01:20.170> both<00:01:20.409> these<00:01:20.710> books<00:01:21.039> will

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
rod building and both these books will

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.849 
rod building and both these books will
give<00:01:21.490> you<00:01:21.759> the<00:01:21.909> details<00:01:22.450> of<00:01:23.140> how<00:01:23.409> to<00:01:23.439> get<00:01:23.829> over

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:23.859 
give you the details of how to get over

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:29.669 
give you the details of how to get over
the<00:01:24.280> problem<00:01:24.490> of<00:01:25.499> the<00:01:26.499> taper<00:01:26.890> on<00:01:27.280> a<00:01:27.340> blank<00:01:28.619> in<00:01:29.619> a

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:29.679 
the problem of the taper on a blank in a

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:31.760 
the problem of the taper on a blank in a
moment<00:01:30.100> we<00:01:30.219> will<00:01:30.340> work<00:01:30.880> through<00:01:31.240> how<00:01:31.450> you

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
moment we will work through how you

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.419 
moment we will work through how you
develop<00:01:32.770> the<00:01:32.920> spacing<00:01:33.520> for<00:01:33.939> a<00:01:34.270> cross<00:01:34.539> wrap<00:01:34.840> and

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429 
develop the spacing for a cross wrap and

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:39.809 
develop the spacing for a cross wrap and
diamond<00:01:36.429> wraps<00:01:37.439> on<00:01:38.439> a<00:01:38.829> straight<00:01:39.280> length<00:01:39.579> of

00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:39.819 
diamond wraps on a straight length of

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:42.929 
diamond wraps on a straight length of
blank<00:01:40.090> the<00:01:40.929> challenge<00:01:41.380> comes<00:01:41.950> when<00:01:42.789> you're

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
blank the challenge comes when you're

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:45.719 
blank the challenge comes when you're
working<00:01:43.359> with<00:01:43.390> tapered<00:01:44.079> blanks<00:01:44.829> both<00:01:45.520> these

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
working with tapered blanks both these

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.910 
working with tapered blanks both these
books<00:01:45.969> give<00:01:46.329> you<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:46.569> details<00:01:47.079> of<00:01:47.350> how<00:01:47.530> to<00:01:47.560> do

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
books give you the details of how to do

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.989 
books give you the details of how to do
the<00:01:48.460> offset<00:01:48.939> taper<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:50.530> correct<00:01:51.009> spacing<00:01:51.399> and

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:51.999 
the offset taper the correct spacing and

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:55.739 
the offset taper the correct spacing and
method<00:01:52.810> of<00:01:52.929> calculating<00:01:53.889> our<00:01:54.249> spacing<00:01:54.819> when

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:55.749 
method of calculating our spacing when

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:59.340 
method of calculating our spacing when
working<00:01:56.079> with<00:01:56.409> a<00:01:56.439> tapered<00:01:56.740> blank<00:01:58.109> these<00:01:59.109> will

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
working with a tapered blank these will

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.849 
working with a tapered blank these will
then<00:01:59.560> give<00:01:59.829> you<00:01:59.859> an<00:02:00.189> even<00:02:00.509> pattern<00:02:01.649> along<00:02:02.649> the

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:02.859 
then give you an even pattern along the

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:05.850 
then give you an even pattern along the
taper<00:02:03.130> of<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.639> rod
