swivels back in four I'll just show you
that<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.939> second<00:01:18.299> because<00:01:18.390> like<00:01:18.810> every<00:01:19.619> time

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
that in a second because like every time

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.249 
that in a second because like every time
I<00:01:19.890> saw<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.400> when<00:01:20.520> it's<00:01:20.670> booted<00:01:21.030> kupets<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:22.049> goes

I saw it when it's booted kupets it goes

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.109 
I saw it when it's booted kupets it goes
it<00:01:22.619> was<00:01:22.799> blink<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.340> don't<00:01:23.610> want<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.850> go<00:01:23.939> wrong

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119

with that
so<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.580> know<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.659> simple<00:01:29.030> architecture<00:01:30.030> as

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
so I know it is simple architecture as

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.249 
so I know it is simple architecture as
you<00:01:30.299> can<00:01:30.420> see<00:01:30.630> it's<00:01:31.549> bad<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:33.030> like<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.049> from

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259
