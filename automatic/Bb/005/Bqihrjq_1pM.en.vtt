00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:28.820 
can see there are heavy heavy heavy hits
I<00:02:22.760> go<00:02:23.760> on<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:25.250> miss<00:02:26.250> this<00:02:26.370> one<00:02:27.290> but<00:02:28.290> he's

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
I go on I miss this one but he's

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.190 
I go on I miss this one but he's
actually<00:02:29.099> actually<00:02:30.000> didn't<00:02:30.660> miss<00:02:30.810> this<00:02:30.959> one

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
actually actually didn't miss this one

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.170 
actually actually didn't miss this one
the<00:02:31.950> problem<00:02:32.190> is<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:32.489> the<00:02:32.610> record<00:02:32.970> that<00:02:33.000> is

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
the problem is that the record that is

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.720 
the problem is that the record that is
not<00:02:33.330> so<00:02:33.480> windy<00:02:33.720> properly<00:02:34.080> but<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.709> plane<00:02:34.920> you

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
not so windy properly but the plane you

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.600 
not so windy properly but the plane you
can<00:02:35.910> I<00:02:36.150> guess<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.260> can<00:02:37.410> see<00:02:37.620> its<00:02:37.890> maneuvering

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
can I guess you can see its maneuvering

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.259 
can I guess you can see its maneuvering
it's<00:02:39.140> gotta<00:02:40.140> right<00:02:40.709> wing<00:02:40.950> damaged<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:42.090> plane

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
it's gotta right wing damaged the plane

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.970 
it's gotta right wing damaged the plane
was<00:02:42.420> actually<00:02:42.780> rolling<00:02:43.080> very<00:02:43.350> hard<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.709> write

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
was actually rolling very hard to write

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.160 
was actually rolling very hard to write
because<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:44.459> was<00:02:44.640> almost<00:02:45.360> out<00:02:45.630> of<00:02:45.690> control

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
because it was almost out of control

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.729 
because it was almost out of control
well<00:02:46.980> I<00:02:47.010> see<00:02:47.310> it's<00:02:47.489> in<00:02:47.610> gated<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.560> guessing<00:02:49.560> it

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
well I see it's in gated I guessing it

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.860 
well I see it's in gated I guessing it
will<00:02:49.890> go<00:02:50.100> down<00:02:50.280> or<00:02:50.549> another<00:02:51.180> when<00:02:51.360> we<00:02:51.480> go<00:02:51.660> down

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
will go down or another when we go down

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.059 
will go down or another when we go down
who<00:02:52.350> cares<00:02:52.910> so<00:02:54.049> instead<00:02:55.049> I<00:02:55.380> go<00:02:55.799> for<00:02:55.980> another

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
who cares so instead I go for another

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
112 you know it's not the fastest plane

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.330

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
yeah exactly that's what happens that is

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.920 
yeah exactly that's what happens that is
beyond<00:04:26.340> that<00:04:26.550> I<00:04:26.760> mean<00:04:27.000> you<00:04:27.360> can<00:04:27.510> see<00:04:27.660> the<00:04:27.780> guy
