00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
 So here is last Saturday with 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.600
 alexander 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.769
 alexis and so we started lice 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.349
 the removal of the front gear so that's what 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.270
 who what I deposited today 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:24.270
 because we had advanced but we had 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:28.890
 not all of them removed most of 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.660
 elements of which creil if one has hose 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.660
 of gasoline that will be unchanged since 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.829
 mail and also broke at the level 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.519
 from the back so here there and from bars of 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:47.429
 twist and that with the screen is what 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:53.519
 allows to settle their needs we have 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:55.170
 want so here is the chassis the 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.370
 halle trains resumed were dismounted 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.679
 so there what a few hard struggles 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:05.750
 removed but most pheasants 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:09.479
 regulated so there the ordinary train 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.670
 for example on that guilt side of which 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.300
 one is not aiming better than it is 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.290
 impossible 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:19.940
 yet the details do not diminish 1 2 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:23.930
 eat so here I am waiting to buy 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:26.210
 a faculty for the rest is age 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.490
 because I made the album with 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.460
 much trouble 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.990
 without removing the little ones that will bind body 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.720
 like that and remove the big chords 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.040
 more so here I am and that's good because 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.560
 that if not with the flat keys 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.370
 rounds up yeah that's not enough 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:47.060
 but to buy that, here we are 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:49.369
 vast reminded that to remove the the train 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.490
 back some rut here and there 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:58.160
 some stuff like that they 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:00.740
 stay with delight I think that already there 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.400
 will stay bigger so so here is 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.650
 next saturday also i'm going to search 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.950
 in a person's rooms so there 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.630
 everything is ready for going to deposit / 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.050
 back 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:18.160
 so here I have removed there is a vice 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:26.190
 in champlevÃ© nut lift here finally at 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:30.110
 3.6 here big this is 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:33.150
 tiana of terror 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.880
 so here is the whole staff of 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.100
 France removed so there for the hoses 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.720
 in fact that's where they are sunk 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:44.130
 in like that and with a rim staples 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.560
 besides up to save has blocked well 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.740
 this is just to explain a little 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.770
 so here I changed the etvis and that's it 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.940
 I will have you read on yesterday so the tuque 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.520
 the pieces that have been removed since 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.090
 early after we will start to disassemble 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.080
 the 4l buckled the front drums with a 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.520
 sheet not remove the top road 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:08.880
 so higher was on so here at 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:12.420
 pretty much everything so the the rear axle has 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.560
 been kidnapped too so that's so little to 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.060
 all the 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.090
 I started it to remove all 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.920
 lengths of casing on the side there so the 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.730
 brake flu what are you at the hose 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.850
 gasoline 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:29.850
 we pay some tired before otherwise 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:34.430
 are some balls and support bracket 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:39.330
 syed katusha team sebah were a little 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.750
 so here we have removed the 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.239
 box 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.989
 so I girls and young 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:49.120
 women so here is the box filed so 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:54.459
 I think it's about 6 or 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:57.159
 vi who are who fix together motor 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:01.360
 box in which I believe it's his voice 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:03.069
 sisoulith so here for the box so 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.720
 all the aging that was in the 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.700
 tank you are power I say that 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.260
 in the bottles 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.760
 so I'm trying to life birth that's 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.159
 not good at all but these engines 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.230
 turn with that so I kept for 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.900
 so clean up there as we can 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.880
 see it inside and that's it 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.590
 so to instruct remove his 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.389
 declination beaten or something 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.770
 like that and clean everything up to 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:28.750
 gasoline so that's it I went to 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.110
 someone who made four holes that 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:35.800
 so is this person gave me full 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.960
 of parts about low all a 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.729
 two-rooms of 4l so simply 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.760
 since he has redone a 4l more than 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:46.930
 four points which i see so i have a 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.280
 rear axle created so there 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.620
 down in his 4 doors 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.400
 but here the doors of last year 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.720
 generation 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:57.280
 it is ahead of the bio because we have to 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.900
 also look for a second four 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.630
 letters that you saw gives us 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.010
 free to recover coins 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.950
 still then we'll see at that moment 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:08.229
 it's the same generation as ours 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.030
 or not we will advise 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:13.960
 So here we are if we bought 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.620
 rims so we'll see if she goes can 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.370
 to be proof 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:20.380
 normally we should So here there 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.610
 who does so a battery may have 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:26.319
 not in good condition but 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:30.879
 still works bad is 2.3 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:33.659
 alternator starter to the fence over there 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:37.300
 to grill the base of the dashboards 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:40.960
 does not hurt 6 under a carton 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.300
 I also have lots of fire lighters at 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.780
 all cases the image 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:51.189
 so here are lots of dice sets of 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:55.629
 windshield glass seal site door what 

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:58.990
 so a lot of parts so that's me 

00:05:55.629 --> 00:06:01.900
 are already going to finish the two three things 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:04.719
 who stay at the chassis so I did a 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:08.080
 little something on wheels for his 

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:09.460
 silica protects chassis because it's 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.830
 the chassis itself is not very 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.349
 heavy so here is the support of 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.189
 seats that remain removed so and that you 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:18.310
 rhythm here and there 

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:22.000
 and so that's griffin that I'm starting 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:24.840
 to sort all the pieces so bah I 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.840
 tell you next time
