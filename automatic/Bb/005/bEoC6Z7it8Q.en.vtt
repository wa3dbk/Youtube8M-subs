00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 I told the stereo guys here one more 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.890
 time and today I will're going to you 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:13.320
 then the bid setup 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:15.839
 gives class to the guys asked the i and ii 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.020
 so I 'm passing on to you, you know. 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.590
 that I did what I did of him 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.830
 let's go the engine 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:30.599
 You can leave the original coming 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.949
 the street clutch the transmission is 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.489
 original 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:39.719
 the transmission line is running and 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:44.899
 brake differential brake differential 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:48.180
 after spring of race damper 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:51.000
 stability and destabilize 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.780
 front and rear is selected and the 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.260
 racing weight reduction 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:02.129
 the engine the engine just move in the east of 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.909
 valve on the tube and steering wheel 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.820
 in the motor pan was over the setap 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.780
 of the old b class so I just 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.040
 I updated because stronger than I already 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.979
 had in the other 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.750
 the tire is normal 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.729
 the width is the second and the width of the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.830
 behind is the last 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.030
 the air hoop you can when the 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:30.390
 preferably it is if you have even 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.180
 The weight of this lm 6 there meant to beat the 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:39.020
 to 600 right 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:39.020
 now the bumper is the one that sports there 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.329
 rear airfoil is original when the 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.119
 bumper car only has that knows the 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:55.110
 skirt also only have this can with this e 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:57.149
 The hood is the one they see, it's beauty. 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.430
 in this video I will not run live 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:07.070
 because I wanted to show 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:09.890
 the turn I say is around that track 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:15.340
 and I was running and I made the challenge 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:19.970
 of rival in it and I caught things are 76 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:24.170
 with another car that I got you 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:28.520
 and in this video I will announce to 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:32.420
 you there position 43 which is already with the 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:36.500
 setup I did thinking about this track 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:40.880
 leader of this track and is a 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:46.220
 car using lancer evolution as well and 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:50.209
 that's it, it's back to i and ii is as follows 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:53.360
 It's just that I wanted to thank you guys for the 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:56.120
 for the return there the guys sign up 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.320
 not leaving a comment I'm happy 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:03.489
 Fuck that and encourage is to make the 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.260
 videos for you guys are acceptable is 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.150
 This step is not good for this 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.780
 track and I was running too. 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:17.870
 multiplayer with him he 's cool 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:20.780
 understood and he is there you can do the 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:25.190
 next is to use that other setup there 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:28.130
 to run the shortest runway 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:35.360
 end-to-end surveys with a 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:38.350
 unique - with less size there is 4 km and 3 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.180
 kms and this cart he can handle 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:44.930
 they hold a little more in the tip 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:49.579
 the point is six kilometers he's there he 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:51.590
 It's holding on and there, because I did 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.870
 He's thinking about this rally track 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.290
 then come back and make another to 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:00.829
 provinces more than asphalt but that's it 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.980
 It's if you like it if you're enjoying it. 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:06.099
 then the setap leaves 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:11.349
 the videos I 'm doing leave a 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:18.150
 jewelry inscribed on the channel and that's it's there 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:21.549
 for you there, position 43 and it's worth it 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:25.270
 by force and it's us 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:28.650
 I'll stay here until the next setup 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.650
 and thanks
