00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
decoration before we start stitch and we

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.400

finger and then pull the thread down and
that<00:00:54.950> will<00:00:55.100> form<00:00:55.340> a<00:00:55.460> not<00:00:56.829> all<00:00:57.829> right<00:00:57.950> I<00:00:57.980> want<00:00:58.280> to

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
that will form a not all right I want to

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.709 
that will form a not all right I want to
demonstrate<00:00:58.550> for<00:00:59.059> you<00:00:59.180> how<00:00:59.210> to<00:00:59.390> do<00:00:59.600> the

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
demonstrate for you how to do the

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:01.000 
demonstrate for you how to do the
running<00:00:59.930> stitch<00:01:00.350> and<00:01:00.559> there's<00:01:00.680> two<00:01:00.829> different

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
running stitch and there's two different

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.400 
running stitch and there's two different
ways<00:01:01.190> you<00:01:01.340> can<00:01:01.489> do<00:01:01.789> it<00:01:01.820> one<00:01:02.690> is<00:01:02.870> you<00:01:02.899> come<00:01:03.199> up

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
ways you can do it one is you come up

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:09.130 
ways you can do it one is you come up
start<00:01:03.860> from<00:01:04.009> underneath<00:01:04.399> and<00:01:05.030> then<00:01:08.110> come<00:01:09.110> back

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
start from underneath and then come back

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.029 
start from underneath and then come back
here<00:01:09.350> and<00:01:10.000> push<00:01:11.000> your<00:01:11.240> needle<00:01:11.479> through<00:01:12.039> the

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:13.039 
here and push your needle through the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:15.600 
here and push your needle through the
fabric<00:01:13.549> and<00:01:13.970> just<00:01:14.180> go<00:01:14.330> in<00:01:14.600> and<00:01:14.750> out<00:01:14.990> and<00:01:15.320> then

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
fabric and just go in and out and then

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.880 
fabric and just go in and out and then
pull<00:01:16.610> your<00:01:16.790> thread<00:01:16.939> through<00:01:17.510> and<00:01:18.229> go<00:01:18.439> back<00:01:18.650> and

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
pull your thread through and go back and

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.050 
pull your thread through and go back and
go<00:01:19.010> in<00:01:19.280> and<00:01:19.610> out<00:01:19.820> in<00:01:20.180> and<00:01:20.990> out<00:01:21.909> pull<00:01:22.909> your

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
go in and out in and out pull your

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.600 
go in and out in and out pull your
thread<00:01:23.180> thread<00:01:24.020> through<00:01:24.350> and<00:01:24.619> this<00:01:25.220> is<00:01:25.400> one

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
thread thread through and this is one

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.130 
thread thread through and this is one
way<00:01:25.640> that<00:01:26.030> you<00:01:26.090> can<00:01:26.180> do<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.540> running<00:01:26.750> stitch

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
way that you can do the running stitch

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.929 
way that you can do the running stitch
the<00:01:27.530> second<00:01:27.920> way<00:01:28.040> that<00:01:28.070> you<00:01:28.430> do<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:28.729> running

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
the second way that you do the running

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:30.840 
the second way that you do the running
stitches<00:01:29.330> again<00:01:29.630> you<00:01:30.020> start<00:01:30.259> from<00:01:30.439> underneath

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
stitches again you start from underneath

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:38.080 
stitches again you start from underneath
and<00:01:33.280> you<00:01:34.280> stabbed<00:01:34.990> down<00:01:35.990> through<00:01:36.939> pull<00:01:37.939> your

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
and you stabbed down through pull your

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.719 
and you stabbed down through pull your
set<00:01:38.360> thread<00:01:38.780> through<00:01:39.049> and<00:01:39.320> then<00:01:39.979> you<00:01:40.340> come<00:01:40.549> up

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
set thread through and then you come up

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.640 
set thread through and then you come up
from<00:01:41.360> the<00:01:41.509> bottom<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:43.930> then<00:01:44.930> make<00:01:45.409> another

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
from the bottom and then make another

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:56.050 
from the bottom and then make another
stitch<00:01:49.960> and<00:01:50.960> then<00:01:51.790> you<00:01:52.790> stabbed<00:01:53.149> through<00:01:55.060> back

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
stitch and then you stabbed through back

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:03.910 
stitch and then you stabbed through back
up<00:01:56.270> again<00:01:56.600> and<00:01:58.390> make<00:01:59.390> another<00:01:59.630> stitch<00:02:01.149> and<00:02:02.920> so

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
up again and make another stitch and so

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.730 
up again and make another stitch and so
on<00:02:04.100> and<00:02:04.310> so<00:02:04.369> forth<00:02:04.520> and<00:02:05.119> the<00:02:05.990> reason<00:02:06.140> I<00:02:06.380> like<00:02:06.590> to

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
on and so forth and the reason I like to

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.560 
on and so forth and the reason I like to
do<00:02:06.860> it<00:02:06.979> this<00:02:07.130> way<00:02:07.369> is<00:02:07.610> you<00:02:07.729> have<00:02:07.909> greater

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
do it this way is you have greater

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.670 
do it this way is you have greater
control<00:02:08.869> over<00:02:10.570> the<00:02:11.570> size<00:02:11.810> that<00:02:12.140> you<00:02:12.200> make<00:02:12.470> the

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
control over the size that you make the

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.350 
control over the size that you make the
stitch<00:02:12.950> and<00:02:13.220> then<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.670> distance<00:02:14.150> between

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
stitch and then the distance between

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.619 
stitch and then the distance between
each<00:02:14.840> stitch<00:02:15.610> which<00:02:16.610> is<00:02:16.760> a<00:02:16.940> little<00:02:17.150> bit<00:02:17.329> harder

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
each stitch which is a little bit harder

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.210 
each stitch which is a little bit harder
to<00:02:17.750> do<00:02:17.900> when<00:02:18.110> I'm<00:02:18.260> trying<00:02:18.440> to<00:02:18.650> do<00:02:18.770> it<00:02:18.890> upside

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
to do when I'm trying to do it upside

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.100 
to do when I'm trying to do it upside
down<00:02:19.250> but<00:02:19.730> essentially<00:02:20.270> this<00:02:20.480> is<00:02:20.629> how<00:02:20.780> you<00:02:20.840> do

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
down but essentially this is how you do

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.510 
down but essentially this is how you do
the<00:02:21.260> two<00:02:21.440> stitches

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
the two stitches

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.070 
the two stitches

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
add beads so let me show you how I do

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:44.230 
add beads so let me show you how I do
that<00:02:33.910> get<00:02:34.910> some<00:02:35.120> beads<00:02:35.360> out<00:02:35.630> here<00:02:41.380> all<00:02:42.380> right

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
that get some beads out here all right

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.010 
that get some beads out here all right
now<00:02:45.240> again<00:02:46.880> I'll<00:02:47.880> come<00:02:48.150> up<00:02:48.300> through<00:02:48.570> the

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
now again I'll come up through the

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.160 
now again I'll come up through the
bottom<00:02:49.280> and<00:02:50.280> a<00:02:51.030> lot<00:02:51.210> of<00:02:51.240> times<00:02:51.540> I<00:02:51.660> just<00:02:51.690> start

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
bottom and a lot of times I just start

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.860 
bottom and a lot of times I just start
stitching<00:02:52.560> with<00:02:52.890> Abby<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:54.000> all<00:02:54.210> I<00:02:54.240> do<00:02:54.390> is<00:02:54.510> pick

stitching with Abby so all I do is pick

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.790 
stitching with Abby so all I do is pick
up<00:02:54.960> a<00:02:55.080> bead<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.800> then<00:02:56.390> I<00:02:57.390> bring<00:02:58.050> this<00:02:58.410> stitch

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
up a bead and then I bring this stitch

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.740 
up a bead and then I bring this stitch
make<00:02:59.160> a<00:02:59.190> very<00:02:59.460> short<00:02:59.760> stitch<00:03:00.120> right<00:03:00.420> up<00:03:00.600> close

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
make a very short stitch right up close

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.800 
make a very short stitch right up close
to<00:03:00.870> where<00:03:01.200> I<00:03:01.230> came<00:03:01.380> in<00:03:01.770> to<00:03:02.240> hold<00:03:03.240> the<00:03:03.420> bead<00:03:03.630> on

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
to where I came in to hold the bead on

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:13.300 
to where I came in to hold the bead on
and<00:03:04.760> then<00:03:05.760> I'll<00:03:06.300> come<00:03:06.540> up<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:08.990> make<00:03:09.990> a<00:03:10.050> stitch

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:22.310 

and<00:03:14.310> then<00:03:15.290> I'll<00:03:16.290> come<00:03:16.530> up<00:03:16.590> again<00:03:20.990> get<00:03:21.990> a<00:03:22.020> bead

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
and then I'll come up again get a bead

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.710 
and then I'll come up again get a bead
and<00:03:23.190> then<00:03:24.830> again<00:03:25.830> put<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.850> stitch<00:03:27.120> right<00:03:27.420> down

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
and then again put the stitch right down

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.370 
and then again put the stitch right down
close<00:03:28.170> to<00:03:29.150> where<00:03:30.150> I<00:03:30.180> came<00:03:30.300> up<00:03:30.660> to<00:03:30.900> add<00:03:31.050> another

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
close to where I came up to add another

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.890 
close to where I came up to add another
bead<00:03:31.710> and<00:03:32.010> then<00:03:32.070> I<00:03:32.580> can<00:03:32.850> just<00:03:32.880> continue<00:03:33.390> to<00:03:33.600> do

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
bead and then I can just continue to do

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:43.430 
bead and then I can just continue to do
that<00:03:34.880> make<00:03:35.880> a<00:03:35.910> stitch<00:03:39.800> and<00:03:40.800> then<00:03:42.410> come<00:03:43.410> up

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
that make a stitch and then come up

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.470 
that make a stitch and then come up
again<00:03:43.890> and<00:03:43.920> make<00:03:44.190> a<00:03:44.220> short<00:03:44.580> stitch<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.210> put<00:03:45.450> a

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
again and make a short stitch and put a

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.070 
again and make a short stitch and put a
bead<00:03:45.720> on<00:03:45.750> it<00:03:46.140> and<00:03:46.410> you<00:03:47.340> can<00:03:47.520> do<00:03:47.670> that<00:03:48.080> to

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
bead on it and you can do that to

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.890 
bead on it and you can do that to
outline<00:03:49.530> an<00:03:49.709> object<00:03:50.250> or<00:03:50.459> for<00:03:50.730> example<00:03:51.240> if<00:03:51.420> i

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
outline an object or for example if i

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.300 
outline an object or for example if i
put<00:03:52.140> a<00:03:52.170> vein<00:03:52.440> in<00:03:52.470> a<00:03:52.830> leaf<00:03:53.100> i<00:03:53.670> do<00:03:54.270> the<00:03:54.600> same<00:03:54.840> thing

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
put a vein in a leaf i do the same thing

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.449 
put a vein in a leaf i do the same thing
to<00:03:56.310> add<00:03:57.240> definition<00:03:57.600> and<00:03:58.260> decoration<00:03:58.860> to<00:03:59.430> a

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
to add definition and decoration to a

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.610 
to add definition and decoration to a
vein<00:03:59.760> in<00:03:59.790> the<00:04:00.090> lead<00:04:00.390> for<00:04:00.690> i<00:04:00.750> can<00:04:01.110> outline<00:04:01.590> a

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
vein in the lead for i can outline a

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.610 
vein in the lead for i can outline a
certain<00:04:02.070> shape<00:04:02.400> so<00:04:03.209> and<00:04:03.570> also<00:04:03.780> you<00:04:04.050> can<00:04:04.320> vary

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
certain shape so and also you can vary

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.310 
certain shape so and also you can vary
the<00:04:05.610> distance<00:04:06.060> between<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.480> beads<00:04:06.840> or<00:04:07.170> how

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
the distance between the beads or how

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.840 
the distance between the beads or how
many<00:04:07.470> stitches<00:04:07.800> you<00:04:07.980> have<00:04:08.250> there's<00:04:08.550> a<00:04:08.640> lot<00:04:08.820> of

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
many stitches you have there's a lot of

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.640 
many stitches you have there's a lot of
different<00:04:09.000> patterns<00:04:09.630> that<00:04:09.870> you<00:04:09.930> can<00:04:10.230> do<00:04:10.440> to

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
different patterns that you can do to

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.130 
different patterns that you can do to
give<00:04:11.040> your<00:04:11.370> project<00:04:11.580> a<00:04:11.970> different<00:04:12.330> look<00:04:12.510> now

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
give your project a different look now

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.110 
give your project a different look now
another<00:04:13.470> thing<00:04:13.620> that<00:04:14.040> I'll<00:04:14.160> do<00:04:14.340> with<00:04:14.520> beads<00:04:14.850> is

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
another thing that I'll do with beads is

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.550 
another thing that I'll do with beads is
to<00:04:15.420> make<00:04:15.600> the<00:04:15.750> beads<00:04:15.959> look<00:04:16.200> like<00:04:16.350> they're

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
to make the beads look like they're

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.470 
to make the beads look like they're
floating<00:04:17.010> on<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.459> surface<00:04:17.820> of<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.270> fabric

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
floating on the surface of the fabric

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.690 
floating on the surface of the fabric
and<00:04:18.930> again<00:04:19.709> I'll<00:04:19.919> come<00:04:20.100> up<00:04:20.220> from<00:04:20.430> underneath

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
and again I'll come up from underneath

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.060 
and again I'll come up from underneath
and<00:04:21.090> then<00:04:21.120> I'll<00:04:21.330> get<00:04:21.480> a<00:04:21.510> bead<00:04:21.930> and<00:04:22.169> i'll<00:04:22.860> come

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
and then I'll get a bead and i'll come

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.110 
and then I'll get a bead and i'll come
down<00:04:23.100> close<00:04:24.090> to<00:04:24.560> where<00:04:25.560> i<00:04:25.590> came<00:04:25.830> up<00:04:26.040> but<00:04:26.820> then

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
down close to where i came up but then

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.830 
down close to where i came up but then
on<00:04:27.450> the<00:04:27.480> other<00:04:27.630> side<00:04:28.110> i'll<00:04:28.500> make<00:04:29.190> a<00:04:29.250> big<00:04:29.840> stitch

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
on the other side i'll make a big stitch

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.490 
on the other side i'll make a big stitch
here<00:04:31.110> underneath<00:04:31.470> and<00:04:32.190> then<00:04:32.720> i'll<00:04:33.720> just<00:04:33.990> get

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
here underneath and then i'll just get

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:41.210 
here underneath and then i'll just get
the<00:04:34.650> B<00:04:35.419> and<00:04:37.040> put<00:04:38.040> it<00:04:38.160> in

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.080 

and<00:04:41.310> then<00:04:42.120> underneath<00:04:43.130> make<00:04:44.130> another<00:04:44.460> big

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
and then underneath make another big

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:52.160 
and then underneath make another big
stitch<00:04:46.730> and<00:04:47.730> then<00:04:49.040> put<00:04:50.040> a<00:04:50.070> bead<00:04:50.340> on<00:04:50.690> so<00:04:51.690> I'm

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
stitch and then put a bead on so I'm

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.950 
stitch and then put a bead on so I'm
moving<00:04:52.710> from<00:04:53.640> stitch<00:04:53.910> to<00:04:54.210> stitch<00:04:54.270> underneath

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
moving from stitch to stitch underneath

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.530 
moving from stitch to stitch underneath
and<00:04:55.380> then<00:04:55.440> just<00:04:55.680> making<00:04:56.040> a<00:04:56.130> small<00:04:56.430> stitch<00:04:56.820> to

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
and then just making a small stitch to

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.900 
and then just making a small stitch to
hold<00:04:57.750> the<00:04:57.900> bead<00:04:58.140> on<00:04:58.320> so<00:04:59.100> you<00:04:59.460> can<00:04:59.490> do<00:04:59.760> this

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
hold the bead on so you can do this

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.820 
hold the bead on so you can do this
either<00:05:00.180> in<00:05:00.420> a<00:05:00.510> regular<00:05:00.870> pattern<00:05:01.110> or<00:05:01.590> you<00:05:01.680> can

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
either in a regular pattern or you can

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.130 
either in a regular pattern or you can
do<00:05:01.950> it<00:05:02.070> in<00:05:02.190> a<00:05:02.280> random<00:05:02.670> pattern<00:05:02.930> but<00:05:03.930> that's

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
do it in a random pattern but that's

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.750
