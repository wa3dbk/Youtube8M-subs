small<00:00:45.589> rules<00:00:45.829> in<00:00:46.010> cricket<00:00:46.370> which<00:00:46.519> can<00:00:46.699> be

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
small rules in cricket which can be

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:48.459 
small rules in cricket which can be
confusing<00:00:47.149> for<00:00:47.239> a<00:00:47.390> first-timer<00:00:47.839> but<00:00:48.320> if<00:00:48.410> you

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
confusing for a first-timer but if you

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.619 
confusing for a first-timer but if you
just<00:00:48.649> concentrate<00:00:49.010> and<00:00:49.519> know<00:00:50.089> that<00:00:50.329> the<00:00:50.449> two

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
just concentrate and know that the two

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.360 
just concentrate and know that the two
ways<00:00:50.780> you're<00:00:50.929> going<00:00:51.050> to<00:00:51.109> get<00:00:51.199> out<00:00:51.379> is<00:00:51.620> bold

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
ways you're going to get out is bold

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.009 
ways you're going to get out is bold
which<00:00:52.969> is<00:00:53.120> the<00:00:53.300> ball<00:00:53.480> hitting<00:00:53.690> the<00:00:53.839> stumps

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:54.019 
which is the ball hitting the stumps

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.290 
which is the ball hitting the stumps
like<00:00:54.379> a<00:00:54.530> strikeout<00:00:54.920> in<00:00:55.039> baseball<00:00:55.399> and<00:00:55.640> caught

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
like a strikeout in baseball and caught

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.639 
like a strikeout in baseball and caught
out<00:00:56.480> which<00:00:56.719> is<00:00:56.749> this<00:00:56.989> a<00:00:57.199> caught<00:00:57.469> out<00:00:57.620> in

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
out which is this a caught out in

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.169 
out which is this a caught out in
baseball<00:00:58.129> so<00:00:58.280> if<00:00:58.370> you<00:00:58.429> concentrate<00:00:58.909> on<00:00:58.940> that

00:00:59.169 --> 00:00:59.179 
baseball so if you concentrate on that

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:00.819 
baseball so if you concentrate on that
you're<00:00:59.749> right<00:00:59.899> there<00:01:00.109> we<00:01:00.350> actually<00:01:00.499> have<00:01:00.800> a

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
you're right there we actually have a

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.200 
you're right there we actually have a
lot<00:01:01.010> of<00:01:01.039> beginners<00:01:01.249> you<00:01:01.640> know<00:01:01.730> people<00:01:02.030> who<00:01:02.089> are

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
lot of beginners you know people who are

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.390 
lot of beginners you know people who are
born<00:01:02.449> here<00:01:02.690> people<00:01:03.050> who<00:01:03.170> actually<00:01:03.319> from<00:01:04.129> China

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
born here people who actually from China

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.370 
born here people who actually from China
and<00:01:04.670> Japan<00:01:04.760> where<00:01:05.180> there<00:01:05.570> is<00:01:05.689> no<00:01:05.869> cricket<00:01:06.259> at

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
and Japan where there is no cricket at

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.569 
and Japan where there is no cricket at
all<00:01:06.530> but<00:01:06.740> they<00:01:06.829> were<00:01:06.920> interested<00:01:07.340> in<00:01:07.460> knowing

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:07.579 
all but they were interested in knowing

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:08.859 
all but they were interested in knowing
the<00:01:07.729> game<00:01:07.909> so<00:01:08.090> they<00:01:08.210> just<00:01:08.240> you<00:01:08.540> know<00:01:08.600> we<00:01:08.810> just

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
the game so they just you know we just

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.260 
the game so they just you know we just
invite<00:01:09.200> a<00:01:09.229> tent<00:01:09.500> or<00:01:09.649> practices<00:01:10.490> and<00:01:10.670> then<00:01:11.119> they

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
invite a tent or practices and then they

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.340 
invite a tent or practices and then they
know<00:01:11.420> everything<00:01:11.659> now<00:01:11.810> you<00:01:11.930> know<00:01:12.079> it's<00:01:12.229> not

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
know everything now you know it's not

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.830 
know everything now you know it's not
complicated<00:01:12.649> to<00:01:12.979> them<00:01:13.240> so<00:01:14.240> i<00:01:14.270> guess<00:01:14.450> you<00:01:14.720> can

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
complicated to them so i guess you can

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.149 
complicated to them so i guess you can
compare<00:01:15.140> it<00:01:15.200> pretty<00:01:15.530> much<00:01:15.649> to<00:01:15.799> baseball

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
compare it pretty much to baseball

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.440 
compare it pretty much to baseball
instead<00:01:16.549> of<00:01:16.670> the<00:01:16.759> diamond<00:01:17.119> where<00:01:17.270> you<00:01:17.360> have

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
instead of the diamond where you have

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.880 
instead of the diamond where you have
the<00:01:17.570> foul<00:01:17.780> balls<00:01:18.079> and<00:01:18.229> stuff<00:01:18.409> in<00:01:18.560> baseball

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
the foul balls and stuff in baseball

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.800 
the foul balls and stuff in baseball
there<00:01:19.310> are<00:01:19.430> no<00:01:19.549> foul<00:01:19.729> balls<00:01:19.939> and<00:01:20.090> cricket<00:01:20.360> it's

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
there are no foul balls and cricket it's

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.260 
there are no foul balls and cricket it's
a<00:01:20.990> 360-degree<00:01:21.920> field<00:01:22.310> so<00:01:22.729> you're<00:01:22.850> always<00:01:23.149> in

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
a 360-degree field so you're always in

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.090 
a 360-degree field so you're always in
action<00:01:23.600> on<00:01:23.810> a<00:01:23.960> superficial<00:01:24.259> level<00:01:24.500> they<00:01:24.950> had

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
action on a superficial level they had

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.319 
action on a superficial level they had
to<00:01:25.219> have<00:01:25.310> a<00:01:25.369> lot<00:01:25.490> of<00:01:25.520> similarities<00:01:26.060> you<00:01:26.240> know

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
to have a lot of similarities you know

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:27.940 
to have a lot of similarities you know
you<00:01:26.390> have<00:01:26.659> people<00:01:26.810> kind<00:01:27.170> of<00:01:27.259> run<00:01:27.799> around

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
you have people kind of run around

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.029 
you have people kind of run around
something<00:01:28.610> similar<00:01:29.390> to<00:01:29.450> bases<00:01:29.899> you<00:01:30.770> have<00:01:30.920> to

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
something similar to bases you have to

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:33.520 
something similar to bases you have to
score<00:01:31.250> runs<00:01:31.840> people<00:01:32.840> catch<00:01:33.020> the<00:01:33.200> ball<00:01:33.350> you

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
score runs people catch the ball you

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.410 
score runs people catch the ball you
have<00:01:33.590> a<00:01:33.680> catcher<00:01:33.950> you<00:01:34.759> know<00:01:34.880> who's<00:01:35.060> collecting

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
have a catcher you know who's collecting

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.850 
have a catcher you know who's collecting
the<00:01:35.539> ball<00:01:35.689> thrown<00:01:36.020> by<00:01:36.110> the<00:01:36.200> pitcher<00:01:36.320> or<00:01:36.649> but<00:01:36.829> I

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
the ball thrown by the pitcher or but I

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.410 
the ball thrown by the pitcher or but I
guess<00:01:37.009> there's<00:01:37.369> also<00:01:37.520> a<00:01:37.670> lot<00:01:37.909> more<00:01:38.210> stuff

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
guess there's also a lot more stuff

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.050 
guess there's also a lot more stuff
that's<00:01:39.070> different<00:01:40.070> pchar<00:01:40.490> doesn't<00:01:40.880> just

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
that's different pchar doesn't just

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.819 
that's different pchar doesn't just
react<00:01:41.270> we<00:01:41.420> throw<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.780> ball<00:01:41.810> Peter<00:01:42.560> actually

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
react we throw the ball Peter actually

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:44.950 
react we throw the ball Peter actually
has<00:01:43.130> to<00:01:43.280> run<00:01:43.460> the<00:01:43.579> steps<00:01:43.850> and<00:01:44.060> then<00:01:44.240> actually

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
has to run the steps and then actually

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.700 
has to run the steps and then actually
bowl<00:01:45.490> after<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.820> run<00:01:47.000> up<00:01:47.409> there<00:01:48.409> are<00:01:48.530> a<00:01:48.560> lot<00:01:48.680> of
