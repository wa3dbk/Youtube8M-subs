is very unique and interesting all their

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.120 
is very unique and interesting all their
technology<00:03:07.150> is<00:03:07.180> built<00:03:07.540> around<00:03:07.690> bubbles<00:03:08.320> so

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
technology is built around bubbles so

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.670 
technology is built around bubbles so
they<00:03:09.790> they<00:03:10.240> have<00:03:10.450> bubbles<00:03:11.110> that<00:03:11.260> they<00:03:11.380> live

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680

travel through space in they have

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.550 
travel through space in they have
bubbles<00:03:15.700> smaller<00:03:16.150> bubbles<00:03:16.420> that<00:03:16.750> can<00:03:16.960> sort<00:03:17.470> of

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
bubbles smaller bubbles that can sort of

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.699 
bubbles smaller bubbles that can sort of
perform<00:03:18.160> surgery<00:03:19.000> they<00:03:19.570> it's<00:03:19.959> all<00:03:20.140> bubble

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
perform surgery they it's all bubble

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.260 
perform surgery they it's all bubble
based<00:03:20.980> technologies<00:03:21.700> is<00:03:21.820> really<00:03:22.030> fascinating

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
based technologies is really fascinating

called the birth gamble that they built
into<00:03:33.040> their<00:03:33.190> genetic<00:03:33.580> code<00:03:33.850> that<00:03:34.209> says<00:03:34.920> every

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
into their genetic code that says every

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.070 
into their genetic code that says every
time<00:03:36.130> you<00:03:36.310> choose<00:03:36.610> to<00:03:36.820> have<00:03:36.940> a<00:03:36.970> child<00:03:37.330> you<00:03:37.930> have

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
time you choose to have a child you have

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.850 
time you choose to have a child you have
a<00:03:38.110> ten<00:03:38.380> percent<00:03:38.590> chance<00:03:39.160> to<00:03:39.850> have<00:03:40.030> it<00:03:40.150> born

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
a ten percent chance to have it born

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.370 
a ten percent chance to have it born
ignorant<00:03:41.860> and<00:03:42.480> this<00:03:43.480> society<00:03:44.110> because

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
ignorant and this society because

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
they're very sort of Vulcan esque like

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.830 
they're very sort of Vulcan esque like
the<00:03:46.750> Vulcans<00:03:47.200> in<00:03:47.440> Star<00:03:48.130> Trek<00:03:48.160> so<00:03:48.970> very<00:03:49.240> logical

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
the Vulcans in Star Trek so very logical

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.620 
the Vulcans in Star Trek so very logical
they<00:03:50.110> search<00:03:50.950> for<00:03:50.980> facts<00:03:51.730> and<00:03:51.910> truth<00:03:52.180> and<00:03:52.420> and

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
they search for facts and truth and and

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.810 
they search for facts and truth and and
they're<00:03:53.020> very<00:03:53.260> interested<00:03:53.620> in<00:03:53.860> knowledge<00:03:54.610> and

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
they're curious and then one thing that

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.830 
they're curious and then one thing that
they<00:03:56.980> hate<00:03:57.220> in<00:03:57.430> the<00:03:57.520> universe<00:03:57.850> is<00:03:58.060> ignorance

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
they hate in the universe is ignorance

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.900

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
so this birth gamble is very terrifying

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.850 
so this birth gamble is very terrifying
and<00:04:01.090> it<00:04:01.180> helps<00:04:01.390> keeps<00:04:01.630> their<00:04:01.780> population<00:04:02.440> low

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
and it helps keeps their population low

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.620 
and it helps keeps their population low
because<00:04:03.190> people<00:04:03.370> are<00:04:03.670> like<00:04:03.760> well<00:04:03.880> I'd<00:04:04.390> like<00:04:04.570> to

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
because people are like well I'd like to

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.090 
because people are like well I'd like to
have<00:04:04.750> a<00:04:04.780> child<00:04:04.959> but<00:04:05.200> I'm<00:04:05.350> scared<00:04:05.770> of<00:04:05.860> the<00:04:05.980> birth

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
have a child but I'm scared of the birth

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.590 
have a child but I'm scared of the birth
gamble<00:04:06.459> so<00:04:06.550> maybe<00:04:06.700> we<00:04:06.820> should<00:04:06.970> wait<00:04:07.150> or<00:04:07.420> maybe

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
gamble so maybe we should wait or maybe

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.910 
gamble so maybe we should wait or maybe
we<00:04:07.750> should<00:04:07.900> not<00:04:08.050> have<00:04:08.200> as<00:04:08.290> many<00:04:08.410> children<00:04:08.680> as

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
we should not have as many children as

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.680 
we should not have as many children as
we<00:04:08.980> just<00:04:09.520> have<00:04:09.640> the<00:04:09.730> one<00:04:09.910> so<00:04:10.390> it's<00:04:10.510> a<00:04:10.570> way<00:04:10.660> for

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
we just have the one so it's a way for

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.229 
we just have the one so it's a way for
them<00:04:10.930> to<00:04:10.989> keep<00:04:11.170> their<00:04:11.380> population<00:04:12.100> down<00:04:12.340> but

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
them to keep their population down but

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.060 
them to keep their population down but
they<00:04:14.050> sort<00:04:14.290> of<00:04:14.380> learned<00:04:14.620> from<00:04:14.920> the<00:04:15.040> humans

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
they sort of learned from the humans

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.720 
they sort of learned from the humans
that<00:04:15.790> perhaps<00:04:16.500> having<00:04:17.500> hatred<00:04:17.919> toward<00:04:18.220> a<00:04:18.310> ten

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
that perhaps having hatred toward a ten

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.640 
that perhaps having hatred toward a ten
percent<00:04:19.320> segment<00:04:20.320> of<00:04:20.380> their<00:04:20.500> population

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
percent segment of their population

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.730 
percent segment of their population
isn't<00:04:21.609> the<00:04:21.850> most<00:04:22.030> humane<00:04:22.630> thing<00:04:22.690> to<00:04:23.110> do<00:04:23.440> it's<00:04:23.650> a
