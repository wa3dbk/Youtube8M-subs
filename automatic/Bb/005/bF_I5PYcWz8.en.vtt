00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
want to have like a colony I cut two so

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.699 
want to have like a colony I cut two so
two<00:03:19.910> different<00:03:20.810> plants<00:03:21.080> grow<00:03:21.290> and<00:03:21.560> they'll

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
two different plants grow and they'll

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.460 
two different plants grow and they'll
grow<00:03:21.860> fast<00:03:22.130> instead<00:03:22.549> of<00:03:22.780> coming<00:03:23.780> one<00:03:24.019> plant<00:03:24.290> at

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
grow fast instead of coming one plant at

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.830 
grow fast instead of coming one plant at
a<00:03:24.530> time<00:03:24.799> I<00:03:24.830> can<00:03:25.070> have<00:03:25.250> two<00:03:25.940> plants<00:03:26.420> going<00:03:26.660> out

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
a time I can have two plants going out

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.590 
a time I can have two plants going out
on<00:03:27.080> both<00:03:27.680> planets<00:03:28.070> so<00:03:28.880> then<00:03:29.060> on<00:03:29.299> I<00:03:29.450> could<00:03:29.540> have

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
on both planets so then on I could have

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.949 
on both planets so then on I could have
a<00:03:29.750> lush<00:03:30.110> full-on<00:03:30.440> nubius<00:03:31.570> may<00:03:32.570> be<00:03:32.630> wrapped

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
a lush full-on nubius may be wrapped

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.900 
a lush full-on nubius may be wrapped
around<00:03:33.140> the<00:03:33.590> rock<00:03:33.799> it's<00:03:34.310> going<00:03:34.430> to<00:03:34.459> be<00:03:34.580> coming

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
around the rock it's going to be coming

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.699 
around the rock it's going to be coming
