00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 and how good today are we going to 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.629
 make a combustion machine so 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.629
 let's start 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.869
 well this is one of the simplest 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.390
 I've seen in my whole life a machine 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.599
 combustion we will need simply 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.849
 four and four signs something with that 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.320
 build it and probably twelve of 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.340
 obsidian 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.550
 a lava bucket and two of two water buckets 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.739
 and two buckets of water and well then 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.770
 to proceed to build what we were going to 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:44.300
 put 1 2 3 we come here 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:48.050
 diagonally 1 2 3 and we do the same 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:52.100
 until completing this that almost immediately 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.750
 we put one in the center and here we have 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.590
 that we stop at the center and we put 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.300
 thus 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.830
 I do not know how to explain it really 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.330
 just follow the steps as they are 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.580
 very simple then we put these two 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:07.060
 then these two we leave here two 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:10.120
 spaces and we put another two again 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:14.470
 ok and then following in the cube of 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.610
 half we put this and this and then this and 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.070
 this 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.140
 then that is very simple already 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:25.490
 just here we raise this one level 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.800
 so ok now what we're going to do is going to 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.300
 be to remove here where we did not put 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:34.430
 we're going to remove them like this and from 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.140
 this side also sorry that there was a 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.350
 little bit of lag and good what we 're going to do 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.630
 is to remove this and put in its place a 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.960
 same sign here 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:51.159
 and the same thing on the other side since it 's 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:54.700
 symmetric is this figure ok we put it 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:57.009
 well and so we should stay at the end now 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.799
 the obsidian the 12 obsidian that 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:05.530
 you may need to be here here and 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:07.479
 here and then here here and here and etcetera 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.099
 they do not already understand the point of the joke is 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.560
 that is also this and this one in all 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:13.330
 for obsidian this is because good 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.340
 we are going to be here mining 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.610
 we are going to mine this then this then this one 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:22.010
 and then this one and if we look 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.200
 It is likely here as you see here 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.670
 it stays in sight then we 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.950
 we are looking and we give that without 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.480
 it may want to water causes 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.830
 the water comes out and then everything is done 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.970
 a disaster moments that 's why it 's good 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:38.000
 to replace these with obsidian and 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.340
 good at the end they will be left 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.540
 something like that right now I'm going to teach 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:47.170
 my house inside my house in fact we 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.580
 we put here 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:53.920
 and this is where I have it and how you see here 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.560
 these are made of obsidian ok 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.680
 then he went back to tell them how 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.050
 put the lava and that is very simple 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.959
 then we simply put in 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.540
 the middle and sides lava going 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.790
 to put water ok and good as 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.420
 let's have that now 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.150
 then we begin to look but as you see 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.969
 here sometimes I give this to this cube or 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.489
 I miss something out and after 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:24.010
 that comes unwittingly part of what is 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.980
 itself the combustion machine then 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.079
 it can be destroyed completely if 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.150
 we make some movement 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:35.379
 undue because that's why I recommend them 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:37.630
 do these obsidian because that's the way 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:40.330
 it breaks 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.870
 well it does not break so easy and then 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:46.230
 and we can look like this 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:50.340
 happy not without worrying about going to 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.200
 break the machine now also good 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.640
 this one down there can be obsidian 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.180
 and everyone else can do it 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.230
 obsidian if they want but in the end 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.110
 really the only ones that matter for 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:04.769
 do not spend a lot are these three ok in 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.209
 all are those three gays and good the 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.530
 operation of this thing as it is very 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.549
 simple not then us here 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:15.269
 we remove this the water is combined with 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:18.959
 the lava and the bucket is made ok and here we 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:21.269
 all the cubes come out and because these are 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.000
 because it is so that the water does not 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.310
 come out not yet we can grab the 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.810
 cubes that sprout very easily 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.009
 so the joke about this is that 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.789
 we are here mining 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:35.020
 so not only the only thing that 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.569
 we have to do is move a bit the 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.089
 view from left to right and we finish 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:42.069
 with a good one with a good amount of 

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:43.629
 combustion out of one minute of 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:45.969
 done in a moment I'm going to make a 

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:49.930
 test in a minute how much as 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:52.240
 boston managed to grab and then we're going to 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:56.349
 do not then let's hope that the 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:59.040
 clock reaches 10 seconds while 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:05:01.340
 fast I'm going to pull this combustion 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.210
 Y 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.210
 we start 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:24.419
 and well in the minute determined then 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:27.589
 After a minute and see how 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.589
 we are able to grab 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.660
 we managed to grab 43 combustion in a 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:36.160
 minute of your favor because right now I had 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:40.630
 a little bit of lag and the cubes did not appear 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:42.280
 but in the end they were like 40 and in 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.890
 a 45 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.620
 probably get 45 or 50 in a 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.360
 minute I think it's pretty good and 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.760
 well that 's because some of them come to 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.950
 burn there like that with lava but 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.630
 there's really no way to avoid that 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.060
 as they saw there is also went to the 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.800
 Lava then is one of the best and 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.040
 more girls combustion machines than I have 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.150
 seen that it works on 1.2 point 5 and 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.960
 Well, I recommend them 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:11.230
 very much and it works well and does not require 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:13.240
 toni nets or things like that then not that 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:17.070
 it's all I'm weird 900 in your block and 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.070
 here I say goodbye bye
