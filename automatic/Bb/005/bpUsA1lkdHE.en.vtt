00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.620
 the heart of the image came with the idea of ​​bringing 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:12.079
 for veterinary medicine in rio de janeiro 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:14.969
 what is most modern in general was the maximum 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.499
 In Brazil today 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:19.820
 the computerized tomography service 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.949
 with the most sophisticated tomograph today the na'vi finishes in brazil 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.630
 and if you want, you can see 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.699
 a series of structures to study how 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.350
 whole part of the nervous system the tumors the accompaniment of the elderly pathways 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.710
 orthopedic column 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.260
 the digital radiology service makes the radiologist able to extract from 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.950
 a radiographic image 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.560
 much more than what he actually achieved by conventional techniques 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.800
 the digital system is the best and most modern in medicine 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.320
 the generation of more physical training 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.539
 he is experienced more precise details that can generate 1 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.850
 somehow conclusive 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.500
 still have resources 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.700
 allow it 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.700
 We liked it very much and stayed against the climb to the pictures 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.370
 so you do not have to repeat a new biography 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.250
 we aspire 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.620
 one possibility is that they are dynamic length measurement 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.320
 we can send this image was determined through the email understand 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.189
 from sousa to a server 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.299
 surprisingly missed the chance but we can take the second way with the 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.580
 same quality 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.980
 the equipment 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.640
 that we used in ultrasound enclosure super sophisticated as the 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.050
 series of filters a series of features 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.360
 who reads and reads the doctor who was doing exams 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.700
 be more sure of what you are seeing and with this usually training a lot 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.700
 more accurate about that patient 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.930
 are paid with oil and gold resources worth of the work 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.760
 the time passes from this 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.580
 have to do with the second best time of this year present the best 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.280
 operator visual comfort 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.590
 this variation 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.590
 with scores of students performing better in research 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.249
 the digitization of the processes 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:21.090
 whether in radiology tomography ultrasound changed the way 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.030
 with which we produce those years so we do not have but the movie miguel 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.760
 Azores 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.580
 and all this chemistry comes from this process of revelation the series 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.950
 images works with wax compression with cd rom recording and media 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.950
 we avoid any difference really 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:46.499
 not only are they explained 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.199
 waters is sad 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:52.179
 have been benefited by digital radiology by tomography for sound 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.849
 especially in digital radiology 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.319
 the difference the day with a little bit more exposure a little less exposure 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:08.660
 changes the maximum that weighs fifty grams without dramas 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.660
 This makes all the difference in the presentations. 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:15.780
 so it is imperative when we deal with small animals 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.899
 have delicate structures that are difficult to see 

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:22.489
 we work with good quality equipment with transmitted images 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:26.889
 I count on your duty with the professionals that make it up for 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.839
 help on the diagnostic imaging 

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:31.560
 the team was over 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.730
 between a qualified mind unable to work with 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.009
 these devices must reach very specific diagnoses 

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:42.669
 nik very early 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:47.540
 the most efficient system faster because it gives more time to what 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.849
 I can do 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.819
 the most catered animals 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.020
 we have given the freedom to care for the patient 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.600
 and learn more humankind 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.789
 to deal more peacefully 

00:03:58.789 --> 00:04:01.959
 transaction a humanization work - we pass 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.959
 among the people with whom they are super well treated win at the reception 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.429
 up to now with what is being done - with all due respect 

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:14.599
 I want to be sure that the excavations that are documented 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:17.709
 the Cuban owners themselves were a bit of affection and attention 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.709
 because they are having a hard time 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:22.180
 be 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.419
 on exams but a customer 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.749
 be more sophisticated exams shock 

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:31.659
 I needed to once did there are sectors that there is super well prepared patient 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:35.659
 It's being monitored. This gives us a lot of security. 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:38.659
 do the exams r do not have problems with it 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.569
 you had more people have a series of courses a series of events 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:48.150
 is the exposure to the working class 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.189
 baby are sure that with the passage of time 

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:53.669
 is with these techniques will spread 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.770
 that will grow more and more becomes one thing 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.139
 impossible to live without them 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.330
 We're really open arms waiting for the doctors. 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.290
 is that they want our help in our collaboration their game
