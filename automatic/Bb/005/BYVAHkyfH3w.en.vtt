major<00:00:07.620> 7<00:00:08.099> arpeggio<00:00:08.490> so<00:00:09.480> first<00:00:09.719> off<00:00:09.929> let's

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
major 7 arpeggio so first off let's

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:21.800 
major 7 arpeggio so first off let's
check<00:00:10.650> out<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.920> lick<00:00:20.330> now<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.510> like<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.779> just

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
check out the lick now that like I just

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.689 
check out the lick now that like I just
showed<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.529> based<00:00:22.769> around<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.250> more<00:00:23.460> basic

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
showed you is based around a more basic

showed you is based around a more basic
F<00:00:24.029> major<00:00:24.240> 7<00:00:24.720> tapping<00:00:25.050> arpeggio

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740

F major 7 tapping arpeggio
if<00:00:26.369> these<00:00:26.580> patterns<00:00:27.000> are<00:00:27.180> new<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.660> may

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
if these patterns are new to you you may

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.599 
if these patterns are new to you you may
want<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.170> learn<00:00:28.320> that<00:00:28.529> one<00:00:28.710> first<00:00:28.980> before

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
want to learn that one first before

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.240 
want to learn that one first before
adding<00:00:29.880> in<00:00:30.000> all<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.240> right<00:00:30.390> hand<00:00:30.599> extensions

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
adding in all the right hand extensions

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.860 
adding in all the right hand extensions
so<00:00:32.250> before<00:00:32.579> we<00:00:32.669> dive<00:00:32.820> more<00:00:33.030> deeply<00:00:33.090> into<00:00:33.780> the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
so before we dive more deeply into the

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.139 
so before we dive more deeply into the
lick<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.110> just<00:00:34.350> showed<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.670> let's<00:00:35.670> start<00:00:36.000> off

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
lick I just showed you let's start off

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.270 
lick I just showed you let's start off
by<00:00:36.180> learning<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.780> basic<00:00:37.170> F<00:00:37.320> major<00:00:37.559> 7<00:00:37.950> tapping

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
by learning the basic F major 7 tapping

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:57.310 
by learning the basic F major 7 tapping
arpeggio

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.779 

all<00:00:58.320> right<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.980> now<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.190> we've<00:00:59.399> taken<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.760> look

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
all right so now that we've taken a look

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.579 
all right so now that we've taken a look
at<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.089> basic<00:01:00.480> I've<00:01:00.629> major7<00:01:01.260> tapping

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
at the basic I've major7 tapping

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:03.649 
at the basic I've major7 tapping
arpeggio<00:01:02.070> let's<00:01:02.760> go<00:01:02.909> back<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.510> more

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
arpeggio let's go back to the more

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:05.329 
arpeggio let's go back to the more
advanced<00:01:03.960> lick<00:01:04.259> that<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.470> showed<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.159> slow

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
advanced lick that I showed you and slow

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.889 
advanced lick that I showed you and slow
that<00:01:05.549> down<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.090> can<00:01:06.299> really<00:01:06.479> see<00:01:06.750> what

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:06.899 
that down so you can really see what

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:53.260 
that down so you can really see what
notes<00:01:07.049> are<00:01:07.229> being<00:01:07.350> played

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
slow and gradually work up to faster

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.069 
slow and gradually work up to faster
speed<00:01:59.090> no<00:02:00.090> matter<00:02:00.329> what<00:02:00.630> tempo<00:02:00.960> you're
