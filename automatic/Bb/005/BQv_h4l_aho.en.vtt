00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.080 
left-hand side I'm just going to lay
that<00:03:39.440> down<00:03:39.889> so<00:03:40.129> you<00:03:40.220> can<00:03:40.340> see<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:40.639> size<00:03:40.879> of

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
that down so you can see the size of

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.390 
that down so you can see the size of
that<00:03:41.269> and<00:03:42.049> remember<00:03:42.470> if<00:03:42.769> we<00:03:42.889> were<00:03:43.099> putting

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
that and remember if we were putting

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.369 
that and remember if we were putting
that<00:03:43.609> into<00:03:43.909> a<00:03:43.940> boot<00:03:44.209> and<00:03:44.810> take<00:03:45.019> those<00:03:45.139> rear

that into a boot and take those rear

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:47.849 
that into a boot and take those rear
wheels<00:03:45.650> off<00:03:45.859> it<00:03:46.129> would<00:03:46.340> make<00:03:46.370> it<00:03:46.879> smaller

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
wheels off it would make it smaller
