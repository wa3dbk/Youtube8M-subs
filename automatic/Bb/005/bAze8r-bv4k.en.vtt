normally we just get these ones right

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.050 
normally we just get these ones right
here<00:01:43.380> are<00:01:43.770> these<00:01:43.860> like<00:01:44.040> little<00:01:44.070> five-dollar

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
here are these like little five-dollar

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.940 
here are these like little five-dollar
situations<00:01:45.869> where<00:01:46.049> we<00:01:46.110> get<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.290> individuals

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
situations where we get the individuals

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.100 
situations where we get the individuals
and<00:01:47.340> when<00:01:47.549> we<00:01:47.640> get<00:01:47.790> these<00:01:48.000> we<00:01:48.540> cut<00:01:48.780> them<00:01:48.930> in

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
and when we get these we cut them in

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.999 
and when we get these we cut them in
half<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.680> then<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.930> you<00:01:51.930> know<00:01:52.079> just<00:01:52.320> like<00:01:52.680> use

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
half and then I you know just like use

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.859 
half and then I you know just like use
some<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.790> ends<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.360> we<00:01:54.509> got<00:01:54.659> like

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
some on the ends so we got like

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.069 
some on the ends so we got like
technically<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:56.759> should<00:01:56.790> get<00:01:57.180> at<00:01:57.479> least<00:01:57.540> two

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
technically you should get at least two

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.440 
technically you should get at least two
uses<00:01:58.500> out<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.680> one<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:58.920> these<00:01:59.100> things<00:01:59.460> but<00:01:59.939> we

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
uses out of one of these things but we

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.139 
uses out of one of these things but we
reuse<00:02:00.930> them<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.469> don't<00:02:02.399> know<00:02:02.520> if<00:02:02.640> people<00:02:02.820> do

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
reuse them I don't know if people do

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.459 
reuse them I don't know if people do
that<00:02:03.360> but<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.600> think<00:02:03.719> that<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.110> should<00:02:04.140> be<00:02:04.380> able
