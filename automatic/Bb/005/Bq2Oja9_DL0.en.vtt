00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.870
 welcome to everything in this new 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.540
 tutorial entirely devoted to 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.760
 the eyeliner at the end of the video I 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.490
 also decided to place a small part 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.810
 concerning the application of mascara 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.179
 you have been several to ask me 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.710
 how to proceed and given that this 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:23.730
 is not very long to explain I 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.730
 decided on the complete 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.170
 before starting my explanations 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.270
 I would just like to remind you that he is 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.059
 important to tune the color of your 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.850
 eyeliner to your makeup needs of 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.260
 day we will instead use brown except 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.290
 if you really can afford 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.600
 from black or so you will use a 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.940
 color close to that of your shadow to 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.790
 eyelids there are different shapes 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.920
 to eyeliner the liquid the one in jar or 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.540
 still the one in pencil form 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.970
 today we are going to talk 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.980
 only from the liquid form 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.800
 it's the one I use every day 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.300
 however I would like to advise you that 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.670
 when you buy one 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.490
 your wrists a tip like this one 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.530
 which is a hard end and that facilitates 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.070
 therefore the application and avoid the 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.930
 different small possible accidents 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.820
 concerning other forms of eyeliner 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.550
 I will write you an article all 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.560
 soon about them and you'll see me 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.270
 use them in other tutorials of 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.890
 makeup and which you can 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.430
 learn the different applications 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.430
 possible 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.090
 when we want to get the eye out 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.590
 liner of his eye is often a 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.409
 impossible mission 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.090
 so here's a tip so you do not 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.459
 miss the check mark 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.350
 the idea is to follow the movement of the 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:49.329
 lower mucosa of the eye 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.619
 your eyeliner will have to be here to 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:54.599
 do this you go look good 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.469
 face a mirror and keep your eyes open 

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:58.420
 so you take your brush 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:04.500
 applicator you look at you in front of 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:08.979
 mirror and you will follow the movement 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.530
 of the mucosa of live like those here the 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.010
 apple you can see I have my 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.390
 first line of eyeliner that is fixed 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.819
 then you will complete this trait 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.209
 so always with your brush this 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:24.099
 once you are going to close your eye on 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.819
 shot and like these and you go the 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.819
 to place 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.030
 like this if you have small folds 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.190
 at the eyelid level especially keep 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.180
 well your eye closed the time as the eye 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.670
 dry liner 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.210
 otherwise you run the risk of 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.290
 matter in small folds or even 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:57.180
 to mark your upper eyelid 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.310
 then you're going to connect the two 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.180
 traits that you just did and do 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.180
 a filling 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.290
 if you wish, you can come 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.520
 thicken the line to accentuate 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.520
 hay doe effect 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.580
 then you will fill the little ones 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.340
 possible holes so to do this 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.940
 always with your eyeliner you go 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:43.900
 keep your eyes open and replaced by 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:46.590
 little snags of the one hour in order to 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.590
 fill in the gaps 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.450
 if you have eyes strongly 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.800
 close I strongly advise you to 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.810
 always start your line 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.410
 of eyeliner at the level of three quarters of 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.540
 the eyelid 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.000
 you can take as a reference the 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.890
 external point of your pupils I you 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.140
 also advises to always exceeded 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.870
 slightly of the eyelid as this will have 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.190
 to remove your eyes 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.980
 if on the contrary you have eyes 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.450
 strongly distant I advise you to 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.760
 always start your line 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.950
 eyeliner from the inner corner of 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.780
 the eye but never go beyond the 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.230
 eyelid soup end even more 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.230
 spread 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.370
 if you have droopy eyelids I 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.160
 strongly discourages you from doing 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.810
 exceed your line of eyeliner because 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.550
 firstly would not see and 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.160
 second, it would have the effect 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.730
 accentuate had been falling you 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:45.270
 so have done a quick for this 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:48.150
 do you take your high liner and 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:54.870
 you will strain your eyelid as 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:56.940
 this you will draw a line that 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:03.960
 start where you want it for my 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:07.800
 share half of the eye and make you a 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.930
 little rat it if you do not have the 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.550
 drooping eyelid be reassured this 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.210
 line of eyeliner will suit you very 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.880
 good too 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.920
 everything depends on the wind of the desired 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.820
 cancel a fine with an eye effect of 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.170
 doe or a more natural rendering 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.330
 you know now how to draw 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.580
 your line of eyeliner according to your wishes 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.080
 I just did mine because I do not 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.810
 can not do without 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.000
 I have eyes drooping and so that 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:37.160
 either in daytime or evening makeup and 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.160
 I like having a rising effect 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.800
 we are now going to talk about mascara 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.650
 because you have been several to me 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.030
 ask how to place it given 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.490
 the explanation is not long 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:54.760
 I wanted to incorporate it directly into 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:56.620
 this video so you'll take the 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.690
 mascara of your choice and you go the 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.810
 place like this you're going all 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:04.750
 first brushed your eyelashes at the level 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:12.720
 superior like this so the top of 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:17.170
 your eyelashes and then only you go 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:20.110
 in master on the lower part of the cl 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:23.440
 you go for a lengthening effect and 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:26.220
 separator do this as movement 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.510
 so little hague cigs while 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.630
 blinking for good shots 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:33.310
 and the eyelash 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.700
 you will therefore proceed as follows for 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.700
 the second 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:43.360
 you now know early on liner and the 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.520
 mascara if I was not clear enough 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.590
 for some steps, do not hesitate 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.700
 not to send me a message or me 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.620
