00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 biological function of enzymes the 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.470
 enzymes present a wide variety of 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.300
 functions in living organisms are 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.150
 indispensable in the transduction of 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.290
 signals and in regulatory processes 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.049
 normally by means of kinases and 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.359
 69 phosphatases are also capable of 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.520
 produce movement as is the case 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.199
 the myosin to the hydrolyzed to generate 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.269
 muscle contraction or movement 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.939
 of vesicles through the cytoskeleton 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.740
 70 other type of raisins in the membrane 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.480
 cellular are ion pumps 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.080
 involved in transport processes 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.570
 active 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.309
 in addition the enzymes are also 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.649
 involved in much more functions 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.260
 exotic as the production of light by 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.329
 the luciferase in the fireflies 71 the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.610
 viruses can also contain enzymes 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.590
 involved in the cellular infection as 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.870
 is the case of the virus integrase and 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.789
 fidelity the reverse transcriptase or in the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.000
 viral release as neuraminidase 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.590
 of influenza virus an important 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.510
 function of the enzymes is what 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.329
 present the digestive system of 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.399
 animal enzymes such as amylase 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.939
 if the proteases are able to degrade 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.600
 Large starch molecules or proteins 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.369
 respectively in others 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.220
 small so they can be 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.680
 absorbed in the intestine the molecules 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.720
 of starch for example that are too much 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.670
 great to be absorbed are 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.070
 degraded by various enzymes to 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.350
 smaller molecules like brushy and 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.180
 finally to glucose which if you can 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.670
 be absorbed through the cells 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.320
 of the intestine different enzymes 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.110
 digestive are able to degrade 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.270
 different types of food 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.460
 ruminants that have a herbivorous diet 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.530
 they have in their intestines a series of 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.750
 microorganisms that produce another enzyme 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.970
 the cells to be able to degrade the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.429
 cellulose present in the cell wall of 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.289
 plants 72 various enzymes can 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.450
 act together in an order 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.149
 specific creating a route 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.280
 metabolic in a metabolic path a 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.100
 enzyme takes as substrate the product of 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.200
 another enzyme after the catalytic reaction 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.020
 the product is transferred to the next 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.240
 enzyme and so on occasionally 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.369
 there is more than one enzyme capable of 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.350
 catalyze the same reaction in parallel 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.810
 what allows to establish a regulation 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.790
 more sophisticated for example in the case 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.500
 in which an enzyme has an activity 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.420
 constitutive but with a low 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.940
 moment of activity and a second 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.620
 enzyme whose activity is unspeakable but 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.440
 presents a greater constant of 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.620
 activity the enzymes determine the 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.630
 steps that follow these metabolic pathways 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.730
 without the enzymes the metabolism does not 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.130
 would produce through the same steps 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.800
 nor would it be fast enough to 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.750
 meet the needs of the cell of 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.060
 made a metabolic path like the 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.850
 glycolysis could not exist without enzymes 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.860
 glucose for example can react 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.020
 directly with the atc so that 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.050
 is phosphorylated in one or more carbons 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.000
 in the absence of enzymes this reaction is 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.060
 would produce so slowly that it would be 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.100
 insignificant however if you add 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.080
 the exo kinase enzyme that phosphorylates 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.090
 carbon 6 of glucose and measured the 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.830
 concentration of the mixture in a brief 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.010
 space of time can be found 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.980
 only glucose 6 phosphate at levels 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.900
 significant, therefore, the networks of 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.790
 metabolic pathways within the cell 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.170
 depend on the set of enzymes 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.170
 functional ones that present
