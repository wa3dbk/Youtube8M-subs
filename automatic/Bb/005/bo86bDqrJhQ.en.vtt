00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:02.660 

so<00:00:01.619> in<00:00:01.740> this<00:00:01.859> video<00:00:02.040> I'm<00:00:02.310> going<00:00:02.429> to<00:00:02.520> talk<00:00:02.640> about

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:02.670 
so in this video I'm going to talk about

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.029 
so in this video I'm going to talk about
protein<00:00:03.389> shakes<00:00:03.810> and<00:00:04.109> whether<00:00:04.620> or<00:00:04.799> not<00:00:04.890> you

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:05.039 
protein shakes and whether or not you

00:00:05.039 --> 00:00:06.409 
protein shakes and whether or not you
should<00:00:05.069> consume<00:00:05.640> them<00:00:05.850> as<00:00:05.970> part<00:00:06.209> of<00:00:06.269> your

00:00:06.409 --> 00:00:06.419 
should consume them as part of your

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:08.810 
should consume them as part of your
training<00:00:06.629> regime<00:00:07.109> so<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:07.919> protein<00:00:08.340> shake<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:08.790> a

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
training regime so a protein shake is a

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.669 
training regime so a protein shake is a
good<00:00:09.089> source<00:00:09.360> of<00:00:09.540> getting<00:00:09.690> protein<00:00:10.349> quickly

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
good source of getting protein quickly

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.430 
good source of getting protein quickly
into<00:00:11.250> your<00:00:11.370> system<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:12.030> protein<00:00:12.629> is<00:00:12.780> required

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
into your system and protein is required

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.829 
into your system and protein is required
in<00:00:13.679> fairly<00:00:14.280> high<00:00:14.309> amounts<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:15.059> restore

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
in fairly high amounts to restore

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.900 
in fairly high amounts to restore
regenerate<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.650> grow<00:00:16.680> your<00:00:17.100> muscles<00:00:17.460> so<00:00:17.850> we

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
regenerate and grow your muscles so we

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.000 
regenerate and grow your muscles so we
do<00:00:18.240> need<00:00:18.450> protein<00:00:19.050> there's<00:00:19.320> no<00:00:19.440> argument

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
do need protein there's no argument

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.440 
do need protein there's no argument
there

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:20.450 
there

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.790 
there
however<00:00:21.450> if<00:00:21.810> I<00:00:21.990> look<00:00:22.020> at<00:00:22.230> my<00:00:22.350> clinical

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
however if I look at my clinical

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.190 
however if I look at my clinical
experience<00:00:23.030> ten<00:00:24.030> years<00:00:24.300> ago<00:00:24.600> if<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:24.960> were<00:00:25.110> to

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.200 
experience ten years ago if you were to

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.870 
experience ten years ago if you were to
ask<00:00:25.410> people<00:00:25.680> in<00:00:25.860> the<00:00:25.920> gym<00:00:26.100> did<00:00:26.370> they<00:00:26.460> consume

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
ask people in the gym did they consume

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.240 
ask people in the gym did they consume
protein<00:00:27.300> shakes<00:00:27.630> there<00:00:28.290> was<00:00:28.380> very<00:00:28.650> few<00:00:28.740> people

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
protein shakes there was very few people

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.740 
protein shakes there was very few people
I<00:00:29.490> could<00:00:29.610> probably<00:00:29.760> count<00:00:29.940> them<00:00:30.150> on<00:00:30.210> one<00:00:30.270> hand

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
I could probably count them on one hand

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.290 
I could probably count them on one hand
that<00:00:30.870> said<00:00:31.140> they<00:00:31.290> did<00:00:31.530> and<00:00:31.770> nowadays<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:33.090> seems

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
that said they did and nowadays it seems

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.940 
that said they did and nowadays it seems
that<00:00:33.450> everyone's<00:00:33.900> taking<00:00:34.380> them<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.650> mean<00:00:34.800> the

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
that everyone's taking them I mean the

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.620 
that everyone's taking them I mean the
media<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.580> advertising<00:00:35.700> are<00:00:36.390> partly

media and advertising are partly
responsible<00:00:36.720> for<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:37.530> everyone<00:00:38.340> takes<00:00:38.579> a

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
responsible for this everyone takes a

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.190 
responsible for this everyone takes a
protein<00:00:39.090> shake<00:00:39.120> they<00:00:39.540> think<00:00:39.720> it's<00:00:39.870> part<00:00:40.110> of

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
protein shake they think it's part of

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.630 
protein shake they think it's part of
their<00:00:40.350> gym<00:00:40.590> routine<00:00:40.800> it's<00:00:41.190> gonna<00:00:41.340> build

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
their gym routine it's gonna build

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.240 
their gym routine it's gonna build
muscle<00:00:42.079> for<00:00:43.079> some<00:00:43.290> people<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.829> can<00:00:44.010> definitely

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
muscle for some people it can definitely

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.250 
muscle for some people it can definitely
aid<00:00:44.790> you<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.270> I'm<00:00:45.329> not<00:00:45.480> one<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.690> these<00:00:45.870> people

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
aid you and I'm not one of these people

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.240 
aid you and I'm not one of these people
that's<00:00:46.380> going<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.590> say<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.800> should<00:00:47.070> not

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
that's going to say you should not

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.340 
that's going to say you should not
consume<00:00:47.640> protein<00:00:48.120> shakes<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.720> do<00:00:48.930> occasionally

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
consume protein shakes I do occasionally

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.920 
consume protein shakes I do occasionally
myself<00:00:50.250> but<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.790> should<00:00:50.940> be<00:00:50.970> a<00:00:51.090> supplement<00:00:51.810> to

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
myself but it should be a supplement to

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.319 
myself but it should be a supplement to
your<00:00:52.140> diet<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:52.800> when<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.370> can't<00:00:53.640> get<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.910> meal

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
your diet so when you can't get a meal

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.450 
your diet so when you can't get a meal
that<00:00:54.720> has<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.899> high<00:00:55.170> protein<00:00:55.649> content<00:00:55.890> then

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
that has a high protein content then

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.360 
that has a high protein content then
maybe<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:57.090> can<00:00:57.239> take<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.450> protein<00:00:57.930> shake

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
maybe you can take a protein shake

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.530 
maybe you can take a protein shake
straight<00:00:59.370> after<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.850> workout<00:01:00.239> there's<00:01:00.480> a

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
straight after you workout there's a

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.210 
straight after you workout there's a
thirty<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:01.050> forty<00:01:01.410> minute<00:01:01.649> window<00:01:01.800> where<00:01:02.100> your

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
thirty to forty minute window where your

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.590 
thirty to forty minute window where your
cells<00:01:02.520> are<00:01:02.670> really<00:01:02.880> crying<00:01:03.180> out<00:01:03.420> for

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
cells are really crying out for

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.779 
cells are really crying out for
nutrition<00:01:04.079> and<00:01:04.140> for<00:01:04.320> protein<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.920> heal<00:01:05.549> your

00:01:05.779 --> 00:01:05.789 
nutrition and for protein to heal your

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:07.609 
nutrition and for protein to heal your
damaged<00:01:06.149> muscles<00:01:06.569> so<00:01:06.960> maybe<00:01:07.229> there's<00:01:07.530> an

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
damaged muscles so maybe there's an

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.319 
damaged muscles so maybe there's an
argument<00:01:07.799> for<00:01:08.069> taking<00:01:08.399> a<00:01:08.460> protein<00:01:08.850> shake<00:01:08.880> then

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:09.329 
argument for taking a protein shake then

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:11.899 
argument for taking a protein shake then
however<00:01:10.200> as<00:01:10.679> I've<00:01:10.920> said<00:01:11.039> in<00:01:11.189> previous<00:01:11.219> videos

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
however as I've said in previous videos

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.999 
however as I've said in previous videos
if<00:01:12.149> you<00:01:12.420> start<00:01:12.719> taking<00:01:12.869> protein<00:01:13.439> shakes<00:01:13.770> and

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
if you start taking protein shakes and

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:15.590 
if you start taking protein shakes and
they<00:01:14.549> don't<00:01:14.789> work<00:01:15.030> for<00:01:15.270> you

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
they don't work for you

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.029 
they don't work for you
you're<00:01:15.810> not<00:01:15.990> building<00:01:16.409> muscle<00:01:16.469> you're<00:01:16.920> not

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
you're not building muscle you're not

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:18.319 
you're not building muscle you're not
putting<00:01:17.340> on<00:01:17.429> weight<00:01:17.639> you're<00:01:17.819> not<00:01:17.939> getting<00:01:18.240> the

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
putting on weight you're not getting the

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:19.550 
putting on weight you're not getting the
physique<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.780> want<00:01:18.990> or<00:01:19.139> you've<00:01:19.259> just<00:01:19.409> not

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
physique you want or you've just not

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.069 
physique you want or you've just not
changed<00:01:20.130> then<00:01:20.670> don't<00:01:21.149> continue<00:01:21.569> to<00:01:21.869> waste

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079 
changed then don't continue to waste

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:23.870 
changed then don't continue to waste
your<00:01:22.229> money<00:01:22.319> start<00:01:23.280> off<00:01:23.459> with<00:01:23.639> a<00:01:23.670> good

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
your money start off with a good

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.840 
your money start off with a good
foundation<00:01:24.119> eat<00:01:25.020> real<00:01:25.439> food<00:01:25.469> eat<00:01:26.219> protein

foundation eat real food eat protein

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.449 
foundation eat real food eat protein
with<00:01:26.999> every<00:01:27.119> meal<00:01:27.539> if<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.229> find<00:01:28.679> that<00:01:28.799> after

00:01:29.449 --> 00:01:29.459 
with every meal if you find that after

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:31.340 
with every meal if you find that after
doing<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.939> you're<00:01:30.359> still<00:01:30.719> not<00:01:30.929> getting<00:01:31.259> the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
doing that you're still not getting the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.749 
doing that you're still not getting the
physique<00:01:31.649> you<00:01:31.679> want<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.219> want<00:01:32.429> to<00:01:32.520> try<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
physique you want you want to try the

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.989 
physique you want you want to try the
supplement<00:01:33.329> route<00:01:33.509> then<00:01:33.959> a<00:01:34.200> protein<00:01:34.770> shake
