00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:06.140
 in general, hello to all today we will have 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.450
 review interesting need firm conder 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.070
 we also prepare the name of the bushâ€™s model 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.469
 such benefits are logical forms and gun 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.990
 cars for 1 bribe by the way also inspires 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.940
 trust i think with the right 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.980
 operation and care of the knife will serve 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.010
 but let's not get ahead and start 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.320
 perhaps difficult need to be made of leather 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.820
 5 millimeters thick 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.439
 how to see need stitched for 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.740
 additional fixation are available bizarre 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.560
 tube 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.239
 there is also an excellent belt clip 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.399
 I'd add something too big 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.260
 take for belt done of course 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.640
 stock is possible only on my what 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.290
 version even after all the serial especially on 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.570
 you can tell nothing you need pretty 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.379
 same standard look at the quality 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.980
 parts don't need my money I think that 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.260
 they fight back completely to fit 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.140
 nothing much to say on my own 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.800
 that for the care of the right, I chose this 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.010
 whether lax maintenance of shoe polish not 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.700
 as needed I grease need 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.850
 to appoint 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.950
 environmental influences need all 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:16.950
 let's move perhaps alone wedge with us 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.350
 Sultan began to be used 10 and 5 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.590
 somewhere to select this Che is that without these 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.409
 you do not have an analogue in 1095 as a steel 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.130
 true to understand or 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:30.100
 do you mean the length of our knife is 23 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.549
 centimeter blade length ten s 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.149
 half a centimeter stick length and 23 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.859
 and a half 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.369
 total finish 12 and a half centimeters 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:41.609
 ear thickness 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.259
 three and a half millimeters in the very 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:47.319
 thick spot this runs the match will be here 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.840
 here she is metal 4 millimeter would like 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:52.030
 of course a little more 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.869
 the handle on the wooden is made of 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:58.390
 two pads installation we handle 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:01.259
 produced on two such pin here and 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.789
 again metal plus rubber glue 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.209
 these are these lanyard holes 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:09.579
 made in the form of such a thing and 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:14.950
 non-ferrous metal and from st to develop 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:18.160
 possible additional , but in principle 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.069
 wedge. also ran here from myself 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.870
 I will note a little to the full rather 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.920
 grip 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:29.769
 stick on although its such here 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.290
 ergonomic yet we are not very very 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:35.250
 strongly rubbed my hand because for 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.560
 my hands are a knife a little rather a handle 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.260
 he swims there I'm pretty serious 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.639
 he worked and specifically for this hand 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.810
 that is, on the second day and with a knife already 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:48.459
 nothing could not get up no cut 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.650
 gloves will he be comfortable but without 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:54.250
 gloves gloves rubs your mother do not worry 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.260
 and you still will also add that the coating and 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.180
 shit resistant start up this coating 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.040
 there was still some kind of colorless 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.940
 coating how to nail polish say 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:07.410
 sense one she is just as fast you 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:10.389
 sharpening holds and become very good and 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.870
 once a full opened canning 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:15.130
 jar this knife my cutting edge 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.010
 completely collapsed on some of 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:21.280
 I decided on one of the parties 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:24.940
 choosing misfortunes i just give emotion xiang 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.980
 xiang xiang he is in full help 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.030
 In short, you jump this burr 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.770
 I had a knife simply 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:35.569
 than start her feather bed dragged over 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:38.690
 Well, the knife is pretty good 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:42.500
 the box was from her grip I now 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.670
 I thought about buying a version with a handle from 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.770
 jitter 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.370
 with a man makes a life card in my 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:52.340
 friend any media card there seems to be 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.140
 The pen reviews turned out more 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.819
 such a 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.950
