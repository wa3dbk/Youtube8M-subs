00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.090
 very good gamers and movie lovers 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.580
 comic and derivatives all geek culture 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.259
 we already know because first of all 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.580
 first remind you that you can go through 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:19.119
 this lottery production that we have 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:22.210
 six active raffles and said that we're going to 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:25.350
 comment then say my impressions before 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:29.480
 the spectacular trailer 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.480
 of the next zombie movie 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.890
 good spectacular 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.780
 for the concept I do not know where we are going 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.560
 situation is apparently worth braille 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.470
 tells us that in the near future that 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.930
 there is a typical zombie epidemic's 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.180
 typical brutal plague that almost burned him 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.030
 all then humanity has 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.390
 survived that plague is is like 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.430
 the day after then then those who 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.170
 remain alive protocols are created 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:06.920
 medical security in case someone else 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:10.940
 tends to catch that virus and prevent 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.580
 again a second crisis 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.790
 zombie not then what happens that 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:21.500
 schwarzenegger lives in a poor man and his 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:24.080
 daughter starts with I believe you think in the 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.020
 movie that the daughter tries to run away from 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.840
 house that teen roll for love with 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.640
 whatever it's from the father's looks 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.250
 but the rumors of 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.890
 security and take her to a center 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.380
 containment to examine it is a doctor 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.270
 then the doctor tells you look 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.500
 i 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:48.640
 her daughter is awakened 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:51.580
 can you go home be careful or be 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.680
 let's see how this is going to happen 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.520
 can kill control has to cure 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:01.270
 he sees it as it is then I think I intuit that 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.660
 at first the time 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.300
 the rat or save it according to how you want it 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:11.200
 You see the hospital takes her home to 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.550
 learn to try to heal he is a 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.070
 reality or very well you know why I am 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.160
 I was freaking out but good 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.420
 concept is that good security 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.810
 the mother movie that they have to go to 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:26.770
 for her the guy has to flee and is 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.050
 little by little the daughter becoming 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.450
 zombie in fact you have to take care 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.209
 the a-3 that heal her and has to kill her 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.890
 are the phrases ex the air messages 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.290
 I the truth as a fan of the 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.959
 I'm super excited 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.880
 but even more so as a fan of 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.090
 the movies of our channels because 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.760
 this same year we have 2 movies of the 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.030
 great guanche 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:55.780
 crisis and it's wrong and that I did not 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.510
 He expected at all and it smells good that 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.750
 flavor behind a cult movie 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:05.110
 zombie we who love zombies have 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.950
 had some very good years in the one of the 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.780
 2000 years but it was 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.540
 some objects that did not come out 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.310
 interesting man to see I mean in 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.459
 plan but because to make the series the 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.000
 walking dead is there not but the truth 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.550
 be said 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.410
 this movie promises a lot of good many 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.480

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.080
