00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.187
Humidity and I are no friends

00:00:04.187 --> 00:00:06.040
especially when it comes to my hair.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.639
Hi guys I'm Noella, a professional hair stylist

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:09.869
and I'm here to give you tips

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:11.250
on how to take care of your hair

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.320
during the humid weather.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.720
Most of the time we try to protect our hair

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.040
from pollution, humidity

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.680
but we can't avoid it all the time.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.700
So first thing I need to do is

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.960
when you get back home

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.000
is use a mild shampoo for your hair

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.800
make sure you rinse it really well.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.970
Apply conditioner from mid ends to ends.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.420
Leave it for 2-3 minutes.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.540
After leaving it for some time rinse it off with cold water

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.380
Towel dry your hair and let it air dry.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.320
If your looking out for a good conditioner

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.520
beer is the answer.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.760
Yes guys I'm not joking,

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.740
the beer works really well for your hair.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.600
So let's talk about frizzy and curly hair just like mine.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.640
So what you need to do is,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.940
make sure you use a shampoo

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.500
which is cream based so that it keeps your curls intact,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.500
use a conditioner

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.520
which has a lot of deep conditioning properties,

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.560
so it enhances your curls .

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.580
Always make sure

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.840
you use an after product

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.880
after your shampoo condition

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.060
like a serum or like a leave-in conditioner.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.760
For example,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.560
a spiral Splender works wonders for curly and wavy hair.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.860
Now a wide tooth comb is very good

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.200
to detangle your hair

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.420
So during the day you don't land up breaking your hair.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.720
The second thing is that

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.380
a wide tooth comb is very necessary

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.210
for conditioning,

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.859
So when you apply your conditioner

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:28.880
use a wide tooth comb and detangle it.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.720
So it spreads your condition evenly throughout the hair.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.140
People have this misconception

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.860
that one should not use a comb while the hair is wet,

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.187
but I would recommend using a wide tooth comb

00:01:38.187 --> 00:01:40.100
specially when you apply conditioner,

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.329
so when you apply conditioner what it does,

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.589
it detangles your hair

00:01:43.589 --> 00:01:45.983
it also helps to spread the conditioner evenly

00:01:45.983 --> 00:01:47.128
from mid ends to ends.

00:01:47.128 --> 00:01:49.200
Your next comb is your teasing comb

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.900
Always make sure you have a teasing comb with you

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.880
specially if you have hair like mine

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.760
which is curly and wavy,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.960
so what it does

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.960
it gives you volume on your roots and it also

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.100
enhances your curl and your perm look.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.640
So there are  different types of oil in the market,

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.840
but I would recommend using a Moroccan oil

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.398
which is very good for the hair.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.620
It strengthens your hair gives you good shine.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.500
Second thing you can use neem oil

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.000
use a little bit of neem oil

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.500
massage it on your scalp

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.080
very gently leave it for  few hours,

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.260
and shampoo your hair.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.780
Make sure when your oiling your hair

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.260
you don't use too much of  your oil

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.260
because what happens is you

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.780
land up over shampooing your hair

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.360
which leads to over drying.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.260
I know we all want to look different try out new things,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.740
experiment with our hair,

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.320
but it's not a good idea

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.880
going in for any chemical treatment

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.340
during the monsoon season.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.180
For example,

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.980
your straightening,your perming, your colouring,

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.080
I would not recommend doing it at this time.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.088
The reason being that is

00:02:46.088 --> 00:02:48.020
because what happens is your hair is very limp

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.820
it frizzes and it gets very unmanageable.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.140
Also, keep in mind that you're in this weather

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.120
don't go for some very elaborate haircut

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.900
keep it simple.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.320
Don't go for fringes or bangs or short layers,

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.640
because it gets very difficult to manage

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.460
during this season.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.560
So what do you need to do is keep your hair simple,

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.780
go for long layers,

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.260
try getting haircuts

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.620
which you don't have to blow dry

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.940
you don't have to iron

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.580
because natural look is the best look.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.020
You might not know this

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.080
but your diet plays a very important role

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.480
when it comes to hair texture.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.820
You should make sure

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.757
that you include a lot of protein,

00:03:25.757 --> 00:03:27.580
vitamin E ,omega-3 in your diet.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.460
Food items like fish,

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.800
curd,walnuts play a very important role

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.680
when it comes to your hair texture.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.300
I personally make sure I have dry fruits every morning

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.760
to make my hair look gorgeous.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.420
I hope these tips will help you fight stubborn hair

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.160
and if you like them,
