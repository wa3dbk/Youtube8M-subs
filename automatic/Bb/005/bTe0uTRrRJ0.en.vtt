00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:14.469
 hello I am organ decorates tricks and we are going to 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:17.420
 make some planters for the kitchen 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.700
 recycling plastic bottles 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.740
 bezoya the materials to make the 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.140
 Pots are the following plants 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.830
 aromatic some bottles that we will cut 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:31.310
 an acrylic paint has to be an al 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.800
 kiel varnish the cutter the marker 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.230
 permanent something that has mesh some 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.840
 stones and some brushes 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.150
 we started by taking a bottle and 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.909
 removing the label below 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.460
 we have to mark the way we want 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:48.320
 give the pot the back will have 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.170
 to be taller than the front 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.690
 we mark first with a marker and 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.699
 now we proceed to cut once 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.129
 we have cut off we finish with the scissors 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.559
 trying to remove what is the marker 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.379
 permanent with alcohol we can remove 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.309
 both the corn letters and the 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.799
 marker pen 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.860
 we already have a piece and we would do the same 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.570
 with the other part we dry all the 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.759
 inside because that 's where we're going to 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.479
 paint to create as a glass effect 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:20.250
 and we start and we go painting but in 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.350
 instead of extending the painting we are giving 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.049
 taps so the paint 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.149
 give yourself the whole bottle always 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.490
 we start below because if we start 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.049
 above then we 're going to stain a 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.799
 Once we have painted 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.960
 the bottle and we have let it dry 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:41.130
 we take the drill and we do the 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.709
 hole to hang on the stand 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.140
 of the wall finally we have to 

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:48.479
 varnish the inside part we would take a 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.820
 Botecito and apply in the same way 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.610
 that we have applied the paint 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.650
 To finish the flowerpot we take a 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.890
 permanent marker and write what 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:02.430
 we want and we go around all the 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.250
 bottle once we have written all 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.730
 the piles the flowerpot 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:12.260
 it would be like that 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:15.230
 next we are going to transplant the 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.420
 plant in the pot the inconvenience of 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.340
 this pot of this format is that no 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.230
 has a drain with which what we have 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.080
 what to do is create a drain in the 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.960
 inside this we get it by filling the 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.390
 pebble background 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.820
 we plant we have to make sure 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.310
 that the earth is compact we take a 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.550
 cloth 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.489
 we cleaned the pot and it would be like that if 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.590
 we have chosen the head of the bottle in 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.450
 the fund we could first a little bit of 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.069
 mosquito netting or grid 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.280
 whatever we have to be 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.769
 squishy and we plant another the steps are 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.720
 the same in a kitchen as always 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:56.319
 lack of space on the counter 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.989
 thought about a wall holder the flowerpot 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.970
 it would be like this thank you very much we hope 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.560
 that this idea has appealed to you 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.560
 and I can do you very 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.550
 First 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.550
