00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
the wheel it keeps spinning so they're

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.299 
the wheel it keeps spinning so they're
consistent<00:00:51.390> pushed<00:00:52.379> across<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.860> table<00:00:53.070> what

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
consistent pushed across the table what

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.540 
consistent pushed across the table what
kind<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.640> just<00:00:53.850> wants<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.690> keep<00:00:54.840> going<00:00:55.550> so

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550

because<00:01:50.700> odd<00:01:50.939> if<00:01:51.570> your<00:01:51.720> figure<00:01:52.020> boarding<00:01:52.350> on<00:01:52.470> a

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
because odd if your figure boarding on a

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.399 
because odd if your figure boarding on a
table<00:01:52.890> like<00:01:53.009> bride<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.610> know<00:01:53.640> it's<00:01:53.909> old<00:01:54.810> not

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
table like bride you know it's old not

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.950 
table like bride you know it's old not
very<00:01:55.680> clean

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
very clean

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.899 
very clean
after<00:01:57.920> you<00:01:58.010> figure<00:01:58.280> board<00:01:58.520> for<00:01:58.700> a<00:01:58.729> while

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
after you figure board for a while

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.960 
after you figure board for a while
especially<00:01:59.150> if<00:01:59.780> you're<00:02:00.049> on<00:02:00.200> a<00:02:00.400> granite<00:02:01.400> for

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
especially if you're on a granite for

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.420 
especially if you're on a granite for
instance<00:02:02.409> you<00:02:03.409> do<00:02:03.560> something<00:02:03.830> like<00:02:03.920> a<00:02:04.010> blood

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
instance you do something like a blood

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.280 
instance you do something like a blood
slide<00:02:04.670> where<00:02:05.030> it<00:02:05.119> slides<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.659> wheels<00:02:05.869> across

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
slide where it slides the wheels across

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.680 
slide where it slides the wheels across
the<00:02:06.470> top<00:02:06.650> of<00:02:06.680> the<00:02:06.860> surface<00:02:07.280> it<00:02:07.970> will<00:02:08.149> pick<00:02:08.420> up<00:02:08.569> a

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
the top of the surface it will pick up a

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.220 
the top of the surface it will pick up a
lot<00:02:08.840> of<00:02:08.990> gunk<00:02:09.649> you<00:02:10.220> know<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:10.870> said<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:12.020> wheels

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
lot of gunk you know and said the wheels

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.710 
lot of gunk you know and said the wheels
get<00:02:12.530> really<00:02:12.860> rough<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:13.459> that<00:02:14.450> usually

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
get really rough and that usually

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.530 
get really rough and that usually
happens<00:02:15.410> pretty<00:02:16.370> quickly<00:02:16.700> actually<00:02:17.060> they

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
happens pretty quickly actually they

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.640 
happens pretty quickly actually they
pick<00:02:18.050> up<00:02:18.200> crowd<00:02:18.440> pretty<00:02:18.680> easily<00:02:20.500> usually<00:02:21.500> when

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
pick up crowd pretty easily usually when

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.800 
pick up crowd pretty easily usually when
that<00:02:21.680> happens<00:02:22.190> I<00:02:22.310> just<00:02:22.340> take<00:02:23.120> my<00:02:23.150> fingernail

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
that happens I just take my fingernail

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.930 
that happens I just take my fingernail
and<00:02:24.040> scratch<00:02:25.040> it<00:02:25.250> off<00:02:27.220> I've<00:02:28.220> tied<00:02:28.670> by

they<00:02:34.610> stole<00:02:34.910> they<00:02:35.540> still<00:02:35.780> real<00:02:35.959> pretty<00:02:36.170> good

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
they stole they still real pretty good

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.720 
they stole they still real pretty good
actually<00:02:36.620> they'll<00:02:37.100> last<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:37.550> long<00:02:37.670> time

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
actually they'll last a long time

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:48.650 
actually they'll last a long time
because<00:02:40.360> yeah

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.060 

the<00:02:49.560> wheel<00:02:49.710> just<00:02:49.950> keeps<00:02:50.220> spitting<00:02:51.890> they<00:02:52.890> have

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
the wheel just keeps spitting they have

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.280 
the wheel just keeps spitting they have
gotten<00:02:53.460> smaller<00:02:53.760> over<00:02:54.630> time<00:02:54.660> though<00:02:55.080> I<00:02:55.140> don't

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
gotten smaller over time though I don't

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.190 
gotten smaller over time though I don't
know<00:02:55.470> if<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.680> can<00:02:55.830> tell<00:02:56.010> but<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:57.720> g<00:02:57.960> six

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
know if you can tell but the the g six

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.980 
know if you can tell but the the g six
days<00:02:58.410> are<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.680> lot<00:02:58.890> smaller<00:02:59.190> than<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.990> other

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
days are a lot smaller than the other

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.700 
days are a lot smaller than the other
ones<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:02.220> that's<00:03:02.550> because<00:03:03.170> they're<00:03:04.170> older

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
ones and that's because they're older

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:10.520 
ones and that's because they're older
more<00:03:05.010> worn<00:03:05.310> out<00:03:08.300> compared<00:03:09.300> to<00:03:09.390> these<00:03:10.200> wheels

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
more worn out compared to these wheels

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.040 
more worn out compared to these wheels
that<00:03:10.800> I<00:03:10.890> gone<00:03:11.070> on<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.250> generic<00:03:11.820> board<00:03:12.180> that<00:03:13.020> i

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
that I gone on a generic board that i

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:19.070 
that I gone on a generic board that i
got<00:03:13.440> from<00:03:13.830> ebay<00:03:16.790> they're<00:03:17.790> just<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.150> little<00:03:18.690> less

with how fast the wheels are just trying

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:11.330 
with how fast the wheels are just trying
to<00:04:04.400> harder<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:05.520> get<00:04:05.670> a<00:04:05.730> grip<00:04:06.480> with<00:04:09.860> but<00:04:10.860> yeah<00:04:11.040> i

price thirty dollars for a pair of
single<00:04:42.390> bearing<00:04:42.750> wheels<00:04:42.960> is<00:04:43.410> it<00:04:44.310> the<00:04:44.430> best

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640
