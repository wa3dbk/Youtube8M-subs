00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.720 
sure the reason behind you do these big
ones<00:03:03.810> but<00:03:04.139> they<00:03:04.439> work<00:03:04.650> just<00:03:04.680> as<00:03:05.250> well<00:03:05.310> they're

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730

longer<00:03:10.829> so<00:03:11.819> I<00:03:11.849> have<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:12.090> do<00:03:12.180> some<00:03:12.359> research<00:03:12.629> on

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
longer so I have to do some research on

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.759 
longer so I have to do some research on
why<00:03:13.169> those<00:03:13.560> things<00:03:13.919> are<00:03:14.069> there<00:03:14.189> and<00:03:15.530> yeah<00:03:16.530> that

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
why those things are there and yeah that

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.619 
why those things are there and yeah that
was<00:03:16.859> nice<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.159> just<00:03:17.310> review<00:03:17.699> overall<00:03:18.269> it<00:03:18.540> was

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
was nice to just review overall it was

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:20.960 
was nice to just review overall it was
pretty<00:03:18.690> good<00:03:19.109> I<00:03:19.709> mean<00:03:20.190> only<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.549> lips<00:03:20.790> were

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
pretty good I mean only the lips were

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.030 
pretty good I mean only the lips were
really<00:03:21.299> good<00:03:21.540> on<00:03:21.569> this<00:03:21.959> but<00:03:22.440> it<00:03:22.769> was<00:03:22.829> very

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
really good on this but it was very

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.149 
really good on this but it was very
cheap<00:03:23.489> so<00:03:23.549> I<00:03:23.849> think<00:03:24.150> was<00:03:24.239> worth<00:03:24.510> it<00:03:24.889> and<00:03:25.889> I<00:03:25.979> use

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159
