 I want to teach how to install the game 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.110

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:30.720
 android cell and to upload the files 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.610
 to mediafire are these three files the 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.550
 files that must be installed in the 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.320
 folder or and the installer the apec to the 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.230
 explanation of how to download these three 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.239
 files is in in another video that I made 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.730
 so as not to make the videos so long 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.710
 just click here in this part 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.680
 I'm going to leave the link to go to 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.300
 video and then watching that video 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.520
 we go back to this video to see how 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.199
 install it good if they kept seeing the 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.059
 video I guess they already have all three 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.440
 files the first thing that you have 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.500
 what to do then is connect your 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.170
 Android device to the computer by 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.210
 usb copy in these three files in the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.950
 folder that you generally want 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.990
 I have a folder called games 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.090
 and all these files were copied by 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.070
 Games folder once they are copied 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.869
 to that folder we're going to move on to 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.460
 what should be done on the tablet or in 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.290
 your android device 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.480
 well then once being here in the 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.180
 tablet 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:28.070
 The first thing we have to give is here 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:30.430
 in applications then we look for the 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.250
 application in which 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.670
 where we can look at the folders in 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.520
 this case here is in we oppress that 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.590
 application I'm going to run here a little bit 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.020
 of this in this case I recorded it in the 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.720
 folder games then I open the folder 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.240
 games and inside that folder games 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.479
 here this plant to see his zombies 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:56.200
 then I'm going to open it I press there and 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.700
 there are the two files the apk and the 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.710
 folder that we have to copy in the 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.330
 folder or the first thing we have to 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.649
 do is install the apk then 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.800
 we select here this icon 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.590
 we just press it and here it says 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.700
 that if we want to install or cancel 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.400
 obviously we give it there in install 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.950
 We waited a few seconds before 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.520
 finish the installation I clarify them there is no 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.870
 to open it simply here we give in 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.790
 done we did not open the game yet 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.670
 because first we have to copy the 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.670
 folder the folder in the folder ok 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.060
 so let's copy this 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.280
 folder with james we put the pigeon and 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.850
 we open the options among which 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.700
 we see 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.730
 this one is to copy 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.190
 already says that there is a copied element 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.790
 now let's go here to look for the folder 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.790
 android 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.620
 here they are then we select them 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.480
 there if it has to be in all 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.849
 devices in the android folder 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.010
 there is the folder or in the case that 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.200
 you do not have that folder or do not 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.170
 come out to you because you have to create it 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.890
 well as it says here side and sees it two 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.069
 times 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.870
 then they create it and here we open it and 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.670
 that's where we're going to hit 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.459
 then we select this icon 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.260
 we just wait for it to stick there 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.450
 have patience because like 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.519
 they saw it is a bit heavy 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.989
 ready is now stuck now what 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.390
 we have to do is go to the 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.060
 applications something we left here we go 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.579
 to the applications we look for the icon of 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.680
 Plants vs zombies and we can play it 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.420
 I'm sure you're going to like this 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.340
