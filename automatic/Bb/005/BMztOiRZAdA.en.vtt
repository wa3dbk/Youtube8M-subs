00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.710 
sports car we've got 250 kilos at the
back<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:19.890> it's<00:01:20.070> not<00:01:20.250> serious<00:01:20.640> payload<00:01:21.450> but

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
back so it's not serious payload but

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.290 
back so it's not serious payload but
it's<00:01:21.900> enough<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.620> balance<00:01:23.550> the<00:01:23.760> weight<00:01:23.940> of<00:01:24.210> the

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
it's enough to balance the weight of the

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.980 
it's enough to balance the weight of the

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.620 

I<00:01:34.890> could<00:01:35.400> really<00:01:35.580> get<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.120> like<00:01:36.330> this

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.170 

in<00:01:41.080> a<00:01:41.229> part-time<00:01:41.830> four-wheel<00:01:42.460> drive<00:01:42.850> where

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
in a part-time four-wheel drive where

you're normally running in two-wheel
drive<00:01:45.100> you<00:01:45.759> come<00:01:46.030> across<00:01:46.390> a<00:01:46.689> slippery<00:01:47.200> spot

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
drive you come across a slippery spot

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.320 
drive you come across a slippery spot
like<00:01:48.250> this<00:01:48.549> one

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.150 

it's<00:01:51.450> good<00:01:51.660> to<00:01:51.810> be<00:01:51.840> able<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.380> grab<00:01:52.620> four-wheel

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
it's good to be able to grab four-wheel

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.520 
it's good to be able to grab four-wheel
drive<00:01:53.490> in<00:01:53.910> a<00:01:54.060> hurry<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:54.600> having<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.230> button

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
twice by the gear lever it's a very good

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.969 
twice by the gear lever it's a very good
ergonomic<00:01:59.880> point

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.340

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
the five-speed get track gearbox is

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.850 
the five-speed get track gearbox is
excellent<00:02:06.979> very<00:02:07.580> easy<00:02:07.909> to<00:02:08.209> use

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.170 

and<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:11.460> like<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.940> fact<00:02:12.210> that

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
and I like the fact that

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
right near the gear lever so you're not

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.890 
right near the gear lever so you're not
groping<00:02:19.519> around<00:02:19.640> looking<00:02:20.209> for<00:02:20.480> them
