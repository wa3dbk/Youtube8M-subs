00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.769
 the ambient sound 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.040
 as every year the sports arena is crowded the 45000 bedard were 

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:37.039
 ripped off the places for already several months to attend what 

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:40.440
 is now considered the most beautiful supercross in the world 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.680

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.429
 his value 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.110
 in search of his consecration the darling of the public of bercy 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.590
 also the most titrated 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.590
 so the best of our pilots 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.030
 acclaimed by the whole hall jean-michel come to look at bercy 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.130
 the only victory 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.930
 which is missing from his list 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.870
 but by his side to represent France no less than sixteen pilots of the 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.780
 youngest frederic gal 16 years 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.590
 to the oldest and the niqab is there 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.859
 who participated in all 6 greens through one of our most serious 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:32.859
 of hope philippe de maria who intends to defend our colors 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.260
 proposed levels one of the first to fall even more than the others 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.350
 years already banks I aim for a place in the final 8% 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.680
 the gendarmes have verbalized 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.860
 while in police custody 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.190
 only jérôme belleval for his first participation in bercy seems 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.410
 somewhat intimidated by the event level a few days 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.020
 previous 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.370
 we do it it's bercy where riding next to the best 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.200
 pilots of the world 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.200
 the impressive cf 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.850
 a pretty technical track 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.850
 our memories because they know 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.799
 15000 spectators per night is impressive knowing also that it 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.469
 goes on TV and it's really about thrashing 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:11.499
 the fact that 

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:14.309
 for the best Americans are there but also the best Europeans 

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:17.449
 I think it's one of the most beautiful plateaus in the world of their trial 

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:20.449
 we are all happy to be there and we would all be happy to get there 

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:23.479
 mehdi carcela always a little 

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:26.999
 zuma the death of this participation and it is well understood for the only 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:30.009
 times of the year he will find himself side by side with the elite 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:33.009
 the global supercross we must be told as a warning 

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:36.519
 myself I want a simple 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.519
 still of course 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:47.139
 johnson stone town the ward the beasts of all supercross pilots 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:51.319
 they do not fear anything or anyone except maybe not a man the only one to 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.329
 to be able to beat them 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.329
 I was annoyed that he is a nightmare 

00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:01.129
 jean-michel baylet was quick to move to the united states for 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.010
 know how do these americans 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.010
 to be so fast 

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:10.409
 it will allow to 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.489
 we trust me 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.489
 what to do with 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.159
 faster on the track more tactical intelligence racing 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:32.559
 jean-michel managed the feat of going beat the Americans at home he did not 

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:35.559
 no longer so cases beat them at home 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:45.949
 according to thierry béthys champion of france supercross bercy has taken 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:48.949
 dream paces an awesome first dream 

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:52.499
 when it is the case of a person 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:57.439
 then between the pilots 

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:04.810
 without betty complex its rivalry with the stars of the discipline 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.609
 aggressive on the general track 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:09.729
 in his attack he paid his excess of daring elbow-to-elbow with 

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:12.729
 the yellow team sounds sapers also part of the experience 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:26.199
 like all the young pilots he's married one day dreamed of finding himself in 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:27.830
 head of the final 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.830
 the dream came true 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.830
 without really understanding what was happening to him from Florida maria who 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.300
 leaves behind leaving behind the stars of the American dropped to his 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.400
 troops 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.910
 the crowd unleashed to the courage of Maria who chained the obstacles with 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.029
 a disconcerting ease 

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:53.119
 but as he begins the third round the reality takes back his rights 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.180
 I arrived yesterday in selestat direction of the beloved college of banks 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.180
 many of the institutions that cause multiple deaths 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.180
 I am too 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.779
 the two youth leaders and because good 

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:20.889
 decidedly most top sellers of cd and dvd and blu-ray and dvd 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:22.779
 to come up 

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:25.529
 the army won 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:26.330
 that night 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.460
 damone bradshaw wins the final he is only 17 but he is American 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:34.129
 a seemingly innocuous and supercross criterion 

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:48.189
 miller and as needed
