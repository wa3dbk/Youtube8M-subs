00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.790
 I am here and that again 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.130
 Germany after about two months 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.840
 abroad and I'm really sorry 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.880
 that I do not like that in the two months 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.530
 I could turn many videos I hope you 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.859
 the plane just does not hear that much 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.750
 how to enter the offer 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:20.430
 In any case, I wanted to 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.289
 I'm sorry for not doing that for so long 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.400
 no longer so regularly videos shot 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.439
 but I could not really have 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.080
 did not have regular internet or 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.119
 if I had not at that time 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.369
 really possible to upload videos 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.320
 as it was too slow but now I am 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.790
 I'm back for less than 24 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.890
 hours I arrived last night 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.430
 and I'm off to the city right now 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.079
 friends 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.640
 I thought so I can 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.610
 to make videos again and turn 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.800
 i am sad a short car day what i am 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.930
 I'll wear it for the case 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.370
 if you so be in my situation 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.640
 Certainly not really what they wear 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.100
 should 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.870
 you look a bit sun but 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.750
 nevertheless skeptical therefore the tries 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.920
 to find such a mean thing 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.480
 and yes that's maybe an outfit 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:07.590
 for such transitional moments warm weather 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.880
 to cold weather then we have 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.570
 with the knee 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.299
 he has a very strange sweater 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.799
 You can only cut with strapless we 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.049
 have to pull because otherwise you can see here 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.420
 the stripes because he is in such a big 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.970
 but delisted is the war that is in 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.590
 the deep but in the strings out so 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.229
 to say what I mean that he is very beautiful 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.759
 find and what if you wear chains 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.810
 wanted the chain very nice 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.040
 highlights and the pole has if you 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.280
 you can see it here on the side 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.680
 incorporated in sequins and is in such 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.689
 an olive and I agree 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.299
 olive green is best for gold 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.790
 Although I personally do not 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.430
 I have a lot of gold jewelery 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.750
 then to now well combined and that 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.700
 I really wanted my golden one 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.329
 but I do not have them on 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.520
 found 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.820
 on the fast and that's why I have 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.670
 just so sparkling so completely 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.979
 normal plug and chain I have 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.340
 an heirloom dressed by me and that 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.500
 is that a gold coin so i hope so 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.310
 you can see 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.700
 it's from my greek family so 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.900
 worth having come to me 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.530
 and yes it is one of my few 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.590
 I thought so gold chains like mine 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.450
 fits the whole action just then because 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.070
 I think maybe it's too hot 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.830
 so i could have a chance 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.540
 combined if I could 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.790
 it will be when I have a long pants 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.600
 nazareth, that's why I have a short one 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:41.240
 pants by abercrombie &amp; fitch combined 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.160
 and actually I would need like that 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.070
 no belt but because the t shirt 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.800
 relatively short is this political 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.720
 and you always actually here the 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.430
 area I thought I come to me 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.900
 a belt that makes it a whole 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:03:00.830
 simpler yes I know that is fabric 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.110
 So brown fabric so braided and the 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.100
 goes well with the shoes the schools 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.840
 maybe you know when you others 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.200
 Outfit for this we already set 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.940
 have that are here in which of 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.720
 marc o'polo and have as brown 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.370
 suede 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:19.970
 I hope you can only recognize and the 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.870
 are super comfortable and therefore with those 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.459
 i have been in the city for a long time 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.630
 run around and my bag around that 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.070
 I take it because it still is 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.570
 summer is a bit like that 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.030
 to stop because I am the colors 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.340
 I have a bit dark in general 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.650
 still this session combines this 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:41.690
 is my new which Scottish better 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:44.720
 it is from yesterday it was a present 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.690
 from my grandma I choose my 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.700
 and yes it has such a cream tone and a 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.459
 a little bit big built in here 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.019
 stripes and the handles are in pink and 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.680
 also with gold applications so here 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:04:01.610
 The fast forward gold is the super 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.519
 golf is here also from the end of 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.320
 handle so the new fits then 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:09.820
 good for the jewelery if I am now 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:12.320
 to even give up an organ donation 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.610
 and it was me too 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.010
 I hope you liked the video 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.510
 and I will start shooting more videos 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.680
 I should not speak anymore where 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.450
 I have internet again 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.120

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.740
 a nice monday if you like it 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.830
 could ask the Monday would indeed the 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.780
 most people but I also defend 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:33.010
