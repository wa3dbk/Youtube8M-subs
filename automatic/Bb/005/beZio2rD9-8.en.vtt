00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
we've had in the past with flash

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.809 
we've had in the past with flash
animated<00:03:42.690> websites<00:03:43.230> is<00:03:43.440> that<00:03:44.190> there<00:03:44.400> is<00:03:44.519> no

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
animated websites is that there is no

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.089
