00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
hey guys on the cliff my zip 55 another

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.459 
hey guys on the cliff my zip 55 another
one<00:00:07.319> that<00:00:07.500> I<00:00:07.620> haven't<00:00:08.330> filmed<00:00:09.330> flying<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.170> I

one that I haven't filmed flying and I

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.110 
one that I haven't filmed flying and I
got<00:00:10.620> it<00:00:10.710> dialed<00:00:10.860> in<00:00:11.040> pretty<00:00:11.340> well<00:00:11.490> hopefully<00:00:11.849> I

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
got it dialed in pretty well hopefully I

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.299 
got it dialed in pretty well hopefully I
don't<00:00:12.360> make<00:00:13.320> fool<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:13.590> myself<00:00:13.740> now<00:00:14.070> saying

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309

don't make fool of myself now saying
that<00:00:14.519> uh<00:00:15.470> got<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.500> couple<00:00:16.710> interesting<00:00:16.980> things

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
that uh got a couple interesting things

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.620 
that uh got a couple interesting things
mixed<00:00:17.520> with<00:00:17.699> this<00:00:17.960> got<00:00:18.960> renovator<00:00:19.400> got<00:00:20.400> runner

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
mixed with this got renovator got runner

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.670 
mixed with this got renovator got runner
elevator<00:00:22.519> hang<00:00:23.519> around<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:24.630> then<00:00:25.170> incidents

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
elevator hang around and then incidents

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.970 
elevator hang around and then incidents
adjustments<00:00:26.220> with<00:00:28.189> with<00:00:29.480> changing<00:00:30.980> elevator

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
adjustments with with changing elevator

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.120 
adjustments with with changing elevator
so<00:00:32.550> I've<00:00:32.790> got<00:00:33.000> an<00:00:33.989> incidence<00:00:34.530> down<00:00:34.710> for<00:00:35.100> a

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
so I've got an incidence down for a

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.910 
so I've got an incidence down for a
little<00:00:35.250> bit<00:00:35.399> more<00:00:35.579> speed<00:00:36.410> middle<00:00:37.410> which<00:00:37.770> is

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
little bit more speed middle which is

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.350 
little bit more speed middle which is
just<00:00:38.160> going<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.309> be<00:00:38.399> my<00:00:38.579> normal<00:00:38.730> flight<00:00:39.059> and

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
just going to be my normal flight and

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.979 
just going to be my normal flight and
then<00:00:39.960> sort<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.350> landing<00:00:41.059> landing<00:00:42.059> setup<00:00:42.540> so

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
then sort of a landing landing setup so

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.860 
then sort of a landing landing setup so
hopefully<00:00:43.640> this<00:00:44.640> flies<00:00:44.850> off<00:00:45.090> it's<00:00:45.660> getting

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
hopefully this flies off it's getting

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.799 
hopefully this flies off it's getting
pretty<00:00:45.930> cold<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.440> be<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.590> foot<00:00:46.739> fighter<00:00:46.950> but

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
pretty cold so to be a foot fighter but

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:49.850 
pretty cold so to be a foot fighter but
that's<00:00:48.809> fun<00:00:49.050> show<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.289> off<00:00:49.410> it's<00:00:49.620> just<00:00:49.770> a

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
that's fun show it off it's just a

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:57.500 
that's fun show it off it's just a
beautiful<00:00:50.010> plane<00:00:53.780> look<00:00:54.780> at<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.640> tracks<00:00:56.640> so

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
beautiful plane look at that tracks so

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.770 
beautiful plane look at that tracks so
straight

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:15.760 

it's<00:01:03.559> getting<00:01:03.800> pretty<00:01:03.860> dark<00:01:04.010> out<00:01:04.369> here<00:01:04.430> now

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.709 

computer<00:01:17.380> close<00:01:18.380> as<00:01:18.590> a<00:01:18.619> full<00:01:18.829> kit<00:01:19.039> built<00:01:19.250> a<00:01:19.719> 55

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:20.719 
computer close as a full kit built a 55

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:25.090 
computer close as a full kit built a 55
inch<00:01:20.750> wingspan<00:01:21.640> it's<00:01:22.640> a<00:01:22.729> glider<00:01:23.799> with<00:01:24.799> AE

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
inch wingspan it's a glider with AE

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.059 
inch wingspan it's a glider with AE
option<00:01:25.969> so<00:01:26.329> he<00:01:26.659> gives<00:01:26.899> you<00:01:27.140> basically<00:01:28.090> some

00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:30.069 
option so he gives you basically some

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:34.990 
option so he gives you basically some
mountable<00:01:31.780> pieces<00:01:32.780> that<00:01:33.079> fit<00:01:33.409> in<00:01:33.829> not<00:01:34.789> in

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
mountable pieces that fit in not in

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.240 
mountable pieces that fit in not in
place<00:01:35.299> of<00:01:36.310> the<00:01:37.310> collider<00:01:37.579> option<00:01:38.030> pieces<00:01:39.250> it's

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
place of the collider option pieces it's

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.120 
place of the collider option pieces it's
a<00:01:40.369> beautiful<00:01:40.490> kit<00:01:40.909> it's<00:01:41.240> an<00:01:42.049> intricate<00:01:42.770> build

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
a beautiful kit it's an intricate build

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.339 
a beautiful kit it's an intricate build
but<00:01:43.670> an<00:01:43.909> amazing<00:01:44.270> book<00:01:46.689> and<00:01:47.689> when<00:01:48.200> they're

00:01:48.339 --> 00:01:48.349 
but an amazing book and when they're

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:52.389 
but an amazing book and when they're
dialed<00:01:48.709> in<00:01:48.860> they<00:01:49.459> fly<00:01:50.140> super<00:01:51.140> well<00:01:51.349> just<00:01:52.250> like

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
dialed in they fly super well just like

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:58.380 
dialed in they fly super well just like
it's<00:01:52.549> a<00:01:53.170> baby<00:01:54.170> brother<00:01:54.470> the<00:01:54.799> 55<00:01:55.250> or<00:01:55.489> the<00:01:55.640> 33

track straight gain speed in corners
like<00:02:08.300> any<00:02:08.539> good<00:02:08.750> sailplane<00:02:09.619> especially

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
like any good sailplane especially

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:06.309 

what<00:02:58.610> a<00:02:58.640> nice<00:02:58.940> plan<00:03:03.880> it's<00:03:04.880> very<00:03:05.060> very<00:03:06.050> time

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
what a nice plan it's very very time

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.980 
what a nice plan it's very very time
consuming<00:03:06.350> building<00:03:07.420> which<00:03:08.420> my<00:03:08.569> rhetoric

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.510 

yeah<00:03:11.990> super<00:03:12.530> super<00:03:12.800> time-consuming<00:03:13.280> I'd

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
yeah super super time-consuming I'd

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.060 
yeah super super time-consuming I'd
probably<00:03:13.880> spent

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.060

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.500 

I<00:03:50.590> should<00:03:51.250> probably<00:03:51.400> consider<00:03:51.910> laminate

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
I should probably consider laminate

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.940 
I should probably consider laminate

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
because it is getting pretty dark and

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.370 
because it is getting pretty dark and
it's<00:03:54.070> a<00:03:54.160> dark<00:03:54.400> plane<00:03:54.670> to<00:03:54.850> begin<00:03:55.090> with
