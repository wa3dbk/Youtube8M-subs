00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.390
 the Peugeot 508 is watching in the combo version 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.799
 clearly better than in the sedan version 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:13.829
 the station wagon is called the Peugeot she's called out under his body 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:14.959
 a font 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:18.750
 the roof slopes down and the side windows are very low 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.200
 The interior offers an atmosphere of intimacy and security 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.060
 There is a pleasant fluffy cath 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.339
 the view of the purist instruments is free 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:33.340
 the driver escaped because of the bad and circumspection 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.190
 the body is very confusing the means are supposed to be 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.520
 Bridge pier and the number of buttons does not confuse most Dante 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.580
 second hand 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.490
 in the front you sit that as the rear kick off weight it was sufficient but the 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.250
 Back seat is not deep enough 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.850
 but the width of the bank is not the same 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.860
 generous is the trunk 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.180
 the tailgate swings up Saturday 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.540
 the rear wall also unlocks from the load compartment and the storage volume grows from 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.720
 560 liters to about 1000 600 liters 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.760
 Genet 70 kilo no driver to shop 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.050
 This is not enough for a full-blown station wagon 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.820
 the two-liter diesel engine reveals a good refinement in just ten 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.070
 Seconds you accelerated from zero to a hundred hair came 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.950
 maximum now reached a 12 chamber 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.460
 The turbocharger offers a torque of 320 Newton meters and a hundred 40 hp 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.210
 Unfortunately, you can use the two switching stages five and six in German 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.659
 City traffic hardly used the fifth silt of the car since 60 Haag came close 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.910
 above idle speed there 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:46.210
 Conclusion of the Peugeot 508 SW is processed high quality offers plenty of space for 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.720
 Passengers and luggage 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.240
 and has a too strong modernization course 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.240
 Negatively noticed are the confusing body 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.990
 the limited payload and the too long translated Oberon gears
