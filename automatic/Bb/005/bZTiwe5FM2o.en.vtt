00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
really good foundation for going into a

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.759 
really good foundation for going into a
new<00:00:15.299> game<00:00:15.509> it<00:00:15.869> was<00:00:15.989> easier<00:00:16.289> for<00:00:16.350> us<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.619> be<00:00:16.740> a

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:16.769 
new game it was easier for us to be a

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:18.050 
new game it was easier for us to be a
bit<00:00:16.949> more<00:00:17.039> creative<00:00:17.250> especially<00:00:17.789> since<00:00:17.970> we

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
bit more creative especially since we

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.790 
bit more creative especially since we
already<00:00:18.150> had<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.630> nice<00:00:19.199> sound<00:00:19.470> palette<00:00:19.650> to

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
already had a nice sound palette to

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.400 
already had a nice sound palette to
begin<00:00:20.009> with<00:00:20.189> we<00:00:20.339> could<00:00:20.460> focus<00:00:20.640> on<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.150> know

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
begin with we could focus on you know

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.099 
begin with we could focus on you know
just<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.800> know<00:00:22.919> stuff<00:00:23.849> that<00:00:23.970> we<00:00:24.029> wanted<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.390> to

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
just you know stuff that we wanted to to

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.419 
just you know stuff that we wanted to to
basically<00:00:25.320> expand<00:00:25.710> upon<00:00:25.890> we<00:00:26.039> couldn't<00:00:26.279> do<00:00:26.339> in

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:26.429

basically expand upon we couldn't do in
the<00:00:26.490> first<00:00:26.669> game<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:26.880> we<00:00:27.029> could<00:00:27.119> now<00:00:27.269> doing

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
the first game that we could now doing

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.390 
the first game that we could now doing
this<00:00:27.630> one<00:00:27.839> with<00:00:28.169> our<00:00:28.289> Foley<00:00:28.499> studio<00:00:28.919> here<00:00:29.249> we

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
this one with our Foley studio here we

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.759 
this one with our Foley studio here we
really<00:00:29.699> aim<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.449> create<00:00:30.599> our<00:00:30.929> own<00:00:31.140> custom

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769

really aim to create our own custom
sound<00:00:32.130> effects<00:00:32.430> libraries<00:00:32.969> as<00:00:33.120> opposed<00:00:33.449> to

00:00:33.529 --> 00:00:33.539 
sound effects libraries as opposed to

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:36.529 
sound effects libraries as opposed to
buying<00:00:34.100> you<00:00:35.100> know<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.219> stock<00:00:35.640> there's<00:00:36.300> there's

everywhere<00:03:28.469> you<00:03:28.530> go<00:03:28.799> so<00:03:29.519> we<00:03:29.640> needed<00:03:29.819> a<00:03:29.939> lot<00:03:30.060> of

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
everywhere you go so we needed a lot of

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.420 
everywhere you go so we needed a lot of
new<00:03:30.299> rocket<00:03:30.689> source<00:03:33.560> so<00:03:34.560> Ian<00:03:34.859> and<00:03:35.040> I<00:03:35.129> and<00:03:35.400> a

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
new rocket source so Ian and I and a

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.649 
new rocket source so Ian and I and a
bunch<00:03:35.609> of<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:35.760> other<00:03:35.879> guys<00:03:36.030> we<00:03:36.239> built<00:03:36.450> a<00:03:36.540> bunch

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
bunch of the other guys we built a bunch

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:38.270 
bunch of the other guys we built a bunch
of<00:03:36.780> model<00:03:36.840> rockets<00:03:37.379> took<00:03:37.799> him<00:03:37.920> out<00:03:38.010> into<00:03:38.159> the

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
of model rockets took him out into the

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:51.800 
of model rockets took him out into the
desert<00:03:48.859> fire<00:03:49.859> stager<00:03:50.220> sure<00:03:50.540> cool<00:03:51.540> thing<00:03:51.780> that

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
desert fire stager sure cool thing that

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.809 
desert fire stager sure cool thing that
we<00:03:52.049> really<00:03:52.290> did<00:03:52.470> with<00:03:52.620> them<00:03:52.739> was<00:03:52.919> we<00:03:53.549> put<00:03:53.730> them

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
we really did with them was we put them

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.770 
we really did with them was we put them
on<00:03:53.879> a<00:03:53.939> cable<00:03:54.709> so<00:03:55.939> we<00:03:56.939> had<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.209> rocket<00:03:57.510> attached

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
on a cable so we had the rocket attached

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.869 
on a cable so we had the rocket attached
to<00:03:57.989> a<00:03:58.019> cable<00:03:58.260> and<00:03:58.680> then<00:03:58.799> got<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.370> microphones

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
to a cable and then got the microphones

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.270 
to a cable and then got the microphones
about<00:04:00.120> halfway<00:04:00.329> down<00:04:00.659> the<00:04:00.719> cable<00:04:01.230> so<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.040> get

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
about halfway down the cable so you get

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.800 
about halfway down the cable so you get
the<00:04:02.370> sound<00:04:02.639> of<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:02.909> rocket<00:04:03.239> actually<00:04:03.329> flying

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
the sound of the rocket actually flying

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.679 
the sound of the rocket actually flying
by<00:04:04.019> so<00:04:04.889> we're<00:04:05.010> shooting<00:04:05.129> them<00:04:05.370> horizontally

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:05.689 
by so we're shooting them horizontally

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:08.659 
by so we're shooting them horizontally
and<00:04:06.689> able<00:04:07.319> to<00:04:07.379> get<00:04:07.560> that<00:04:07.739> you<00:04:08.099> know<00:04:08.189> the<00:04:08.310> rocket

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
and able to get that you know the rocket

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:11.360 
and able to get that you know the rocket
coming<00:04:08.879> in<00:04:09.290> really<00:04:10.290> listen<00:04:10.829> by<00:04:10.950> your<00:04:11.189> head

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
coming in really listen by your head

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.440 
coming in really listen by your head
behind<00:04:11.579> a<00:04:11.819> sound<00:04:13.760> so<00:04:14.760> we<00:04:14.849> had<00:04:14.969> that<00:04:15.060> then<00:04:15.239> mike

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
behind a sound so we had that then mike

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.240 
behind a sound so we had that then mike
was<00:04:15.599> kind<00:04:15.780> of<00:04:15.840> static<00:04:16.229> in<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.500> middle<00:04:17.009> of<00:04:17.130> the

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
was kind of static in the middle of the

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.189 
was kind of static in the middle of the
line<00:04:17.400> so<00:04:18.030> you<00:04:18.090> get<00:04:18.299> a<00:04:18.329> really<00:04:18.690> fast<00:04:18.840> whizzed<00:04:19.169> by

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
line so you get a really fast whizzed by

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:20.659 
line so you get a really fast whizzed by
and<00:04:19.380> then<00:04:19.709> we<00:04:19.739> had<00:04:19.919> another<00:04:19.949> mic<00:04:20.400> that<00:04:20.639> was

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
and then we had another mic that was

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.159 
and then we had another mic that was
following<00:04:21.329> it<00:04:21.419> from<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.659> back<00:04:21.840> so<00:04:22.019> you<00:04:22.049> can

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
following it from the back so you can

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.370 
following it from the back so you can
actually<00:04:22.349> get<00:04:22.560> a<00:04:22.620> nice<00:04:22.830> decay<00:04:23.159> of<00:04:23.310> it<00:04:23.430> in<00:04:23.789> three

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
actually get a nice decay of it in three

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.839 
actually get a nice decay of it in three
two<00:04:25.380> one

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.300 

by<00:04:29.849> doing<00:04:30.150> like<00:04:30.270> a<00:04:30.330> bunch<00:04:30.990> of<00:04:31.139> layering<00:04:31.949> up<00:04:32.099> of

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
by doing like a bunch of layering up of

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.879 
by doing like a bunch of layering up of
a<00:04:32.400> number<00:04:32.669> of<00:04:32.699> those<00:04:33.080> those<00:04:34.080> rocket<00:04:34.530> sounds

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
a number of those those rocket sounds

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.730 
a number of those those rocket sounds
you<00:04:35.099> take<00:04:35.430> maybe<00:04:36.419> a<00:04:36.570> half<00:04:36.780> a<00:04:36.900> dozen<00:04:37.050> or<00:04:37.409> four<00:04:37.680> or

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
you take maybe a half a dozen or four or

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.010 
you take maybe a half a dozen or four or
five<00:04:37.889> of<00:04:38.330> what<00:04:39.330> we<00:04:39.389> originally<00:04:39.539> recorded

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
five of what we originally recorded

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.570 
five of what we originally recorded
stack<00:04:40.409> them<00:04:40.530> on<00:04:40.590> top<00:04:40.800> of<00:04:40.860> each<00:04:41.039> other<00:04:41.220> pitch

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
stack them on top of each other pitch

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.879 
stack them on top of each other pitch
some<00:04:41.820> of<00:04:41.940> them<00:04:42.060> down<00:04:42.210> an<00:04:42.449> octave<00:04:42.570> or<00:04:42.900> to<00:04:43.080> just

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
some of them down an octave or to just

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.129 
some of them down an octave or to just
add<00:04:44.070> any<00:04:44.550> kind<00:04:44.820> of<00:04:44.909> punchy<00:04:45.630> sound<00:04:45.840> at<00:04:46.050> the

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
add any kind of punchy sound at the

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.439 
add any kind of punchy sound at the
front<00:04:46.380> whether<00:04:46.590> it's<00:04:46.830> a<00:04:46.979> an<00:04:47.699> actual<00:04:48.120> like

to<00:04:54.180> give<00:04:54.330> you<00:04:54.419> some<00:04:54.599> attack<00:04:54.900> then<00:04:55.349> we<00:04:55.800> can<00:04:55.919> end

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 
to give you some attack then we can end

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:57.230 
to give you some attack then we can end
up<00:04:56.130> with<00:04:56.190> some<00:04:56.430> sounds<00:04:56.729> like<00:04:56.849> these<00:04:57.000> here's

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
up with some sounds like these here's

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.570 
up with some sounds like these here's
one<00:04:57.389> of<00:04:57.479> the<00:04:57.539> actual<00:04:57.930> in-game<00:04:58.580> vehicle

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
one of the actual in-game vehicle

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.399 
one of the actual in-game vehicle
rockets<00:04:59.970> that<00:05:00.180> you<00:05:00.690> can<00:05:00.870> fire<00:05:01.080> off<00:05:03.259> so<00:05:04.259> this

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:04.409 
rockets that you can fire off so this

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:06.860 
rockets that you can fire off so this
first<00:05:04.650> group<00:05:04.860> of<00:05:05.009> sounds<00:05:05.970> we<00:05:06.210> have<00:05:06.330> here<00:05:06.539> is

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
first group of sounds we have here is

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:07.939 
first group of sounds we have here is
some<00:05:07.050> things<00:05:07.080> we<00:05:07.320> recorded<00:05:07.680> out<00:05:07.770> in<00:05:07.860> the

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
some things we recorded out in the

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:10.129 
some things we recorded out in the
desert<00:05:08.280> using<00:05:08.789> the<00:05:08.970> slingshot<00:05:09.419> in<00:05:09.630> some

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
desert using the slingshot in some

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.230 
desert using the slingshot in some
quarters<00:05:10.680> we<00:05:11.130> set<00:05:11.280> up<00:05:11.370> some<00:05:11.520> microphones<00:05:11.820> to

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
quarters we set up some microphones to

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.450 
quarters we set up some microphones to
where<00:05:12.509> the<00:05:12.659> coins<00:05:13.259> were<00:05:13.530> flying<00:05:13.800> by<00:05:14.009> the<00:05:14.070> mics

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
where the coins were flying by the mics

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.240 
where the coins were flying by the mics
and<00:05:14.820> into<00:05:15.060> the<00:05:15.180> dirt<00:05:15.419> and<00:05:15.889> here's<00:05:16.889> a<00:05:16.949> little

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
and into the dirt and here's a little

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.010 
and into the dirt and here's a little
bit<00:05:17.310> of<00:05:17.400> what<00:05:17.490> we're<00:05:17.610> able<00:05:17.669> to<00:05:17.820> get<00:05:17.970> with<00:05:18.120> those

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
bit of what we're able to get with those

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:26.240 
bit of what we're able to get with those
so<00:05:20.680> these<00:05:20.800> are<00:05:20.950> just<00:05:21.040> the<00:05:21.220> raw<00:05:24.510> the<00:05:25.510> raw<00:05:25.660> sounds

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
so these are just the raw the raw sounds

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.710 
so these are just the raw the raw sounds
which<00:05:27.250> are<00:05:27.340> pretty<00:05:27.550> decent<00:05:27.730> little<00:05:28.030> sound<00:05:28.330> you

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
which are pretty decent little sound you

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:34.200 
which are pretty decent little sound you
know<00:05:28.870> it<00:05:29.620> sound<00:05:29.890> like<00:05:30.010> bullets<00:05:31.680> but<00:05:33.210> it's

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
know it sound like bullets but it's

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.760 
know it sound like bullets but it's
Cybertron's<00:05:34.720> so<00:05:34.900> it's<00:05:35.050> not<00:05:35.140> really<00:05:35.410> bullets

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
Cybertron's so it's not really bullets

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.160 
Cybertron's so it's not really bullets
right<00:05:36.420> so<00:05:37.420> we<00:05:37.510> had<00:05:37.600> to<00:05:37.660> do<00:05:37.750> a<00:05:37.780> little<00:05:37.900> work<00:05:38.110> to

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.170 
right so we had to do a little work to

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.040 
right so we had to do a little work to
those<00:05:38.470> and<00:05:38.860> here's<00:05:39.580> an<00:05:39.700> example<00:05:40.000> of<00:05:40.510> what<00:05:40.990> were

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
those and here's an example of what were

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.030 
those and here's an example of what were
able<00:05:41.110> to<00:05:41.290> do<00:05:41.530> with<00:05:41.710> those<00:05:41.890> sounds<00:05:42.840> for<00:05:43.950> one<00:05:44.950> of

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:45.040 
able to do with those sounds for one of

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.660 
able to do with those sounds for one of
the<00:05:45.130> projectile<00:05:45.610> weapons<00:05:46.000> in<00:05:46.120> the<00:05:46.210> game<00:05:46.240> where

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:47.670 
the projectile weapons in the game where

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.920 
the projectile weapons in the game where
you<00:05:48.670> should<00:05:48.820> have<00:05:48.910> blade<00:05:49.090> and<00:05:49.330> that<00:05:49.390> kind<00:05:49.870> of

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
you should have blade and that kind of

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.200 
you should have blade and that kind of
bounces<00:05:50.380> around<00:05:50.640> so<00:05:51.640> we've<00:05:51.820> got<00:05:52.030> that

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
bounces around so we've got that

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.120 
bounces around so we've got that
bouncing<00:05:52.750> sound<00:05:52.990> from<00:05:53.200> the<00:05:53.320> original

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
bouncing sound from the original

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.270 
bouncing sound from the original
ricochets<00:05:54.610> and<00:05:54.910> then<00:05:56.040> included<00:05:57.040> some

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
ricochets and then included some

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.270 
ricochets and then included some
additional<00:05:57.750> metal<00:05:58.750> impacts<00:05:59.410> and<00:05:59.860> things<00:06:00.100> with

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
additional metal impacts and things with

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.080 
additional metal impacts and things with
it<00:06:00.400> so<00:06:02.070> we<00:06:03.070> also<00:06:03.280> seem<00:06:03.430> to<00:06:03.550> do<00:06:03.670> a<00:06:03.700> lot<00:06:03.910> of

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
it so we also seem to do a lot of

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:05.640 
it so we also seem to do a lot of
smaller<00:06:04.840> recording<00:06:05.290> trips<00:06:05.500> you<00:06:05.590> know

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
smaller recording trips you know

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.080 
smaller recording trips you know
everyone<00:06:05.920> does<00:06:06.070> the<00:06:06.250> gun<00:06:06.400> trips<00:06:06.730> and<00:06:07.030> the

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
everyone does the gun trips and the

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.000 
everyone does the gun trips and the
vehicle<00:06:07.450> trips<00:06:07.660> and<00:06:07.810> stuff<00:06:07.930> like<00:06:08.020> that<00:06:08.260> but

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.010 
vehicle trips and stuff like that but

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.860 
vehicle trips and stuff like that but
it's<00:06:09.730> actually<00:06:09.850> kind<00:06:10.060> of<00:06:10.150> nice<00:06:10.270> just<00:06:10.540> you<00:06:10.750> know

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 
it's actually kind of nice just you know

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.090 
it's actually kind of nice just you know
if<00:06:10.960> I'm<00:06:11.050> working<00:06:11.230> in<00:06:11.470> there<00:06:11.620> one<00:06:11.770> day<00:06:11.800> and<00:06:12.040> I

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.100 
if I'm working in there one day and I

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.680 
if I'm working in there one day and I
know<00:06:12.160> I<00:06:12.310> need<00:06:12.580> something<00:06:12.970> for<00:06:13.150> instance<00:06:13.480> I

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
know I need something for instance I

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.770 
know I need something for instance I
needed<00:06:14.290> a<00:06:14.350> big<00:06:14.740> windstorm<00:06:15.460> for<00:06:16.060> part<00:06:16.660> of<00:06:16.720> the

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
needed a big windstorm for part of the

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.750 
needed a big windstorm for part of the
level<00:06:16.990> and<00:06:17.140> so<00:06:17.860> I<00:06:17.890> listen<00:06:18.190> what<00:06:18.280> we<00:06:18.370> had<00:06:18.520> and

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:18.760 
level and so I listen what we had and

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.010 
level and so I listen what we had and
some<00:06:18.910> of<00:06:19.000> it<00:06:19.090> worked<00:06:19.240> some<00:06:19.390> of<00:06:19.480> it<00:06:19.600> didn't<00:06:19.840> but

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020 
some of it worked some of it didn't but

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.080 
some of it worked some of it didn't but
I<00:06:20.050> figured<00:06:20.350> are<00:06:20.470> able<00:06:20.710> I've<00:06:21.460> got<00:06:21.640> a<00:06:21.670> mic<00:06:21.880> let's

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
I figured are able I've got a mic let's

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.730 
I figured are able I've got a mic let's
just<00:06:22.210> go<00:06:22.300> and<00:06:22.420> get<00:06:22.540> something<00:06:22.870> so<00:06:23.080> we<00:06:23.620> hopped

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
just go and get something so we hopped

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.080 
just go and get something so we hopped
in<00:06:23.920> the<00:06:23.950> car<00:06:24.130> with<00:06:24.340> another<00:06:24.550> sound<00:06:24.790> designer

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
in the car with another sound designer

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.450 
in the car with another sound designer
and<00:06:25.240> I<00:06:25.630> drove<00:06:26.230> around<00:06:26.320> the<00:06:26.470> block<00:06:26.680> and<00:06:26.980> he<00:06:27.310> held

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
and I drove around the block and he held

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.250 
and I drove around the block and he held
the<00:06:27.550> mic<00:06:27.640> out<00:06:27.790> the<00:06:28.030> sunroof<00:06:28.510> and<00:06:28.660> that<00:06:29.080> worked

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:29.260 
the mic out the sunroof and that worked

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:34.220 
the mic out the sunroof and that worked
great

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.230 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.470 

this<00:06:34.740> was<00:06:34.950> the<00:06:35.250> track<00:06:35.880> that<00:06:36.030> we<00:06:36.120> built<00:06:36.300> out<00:06:36.450> in

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:36.480 
this was the track that we built out in

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.620 
this was the track that we built out in
quad<00:06:36.950> so<00:06:37.950> I<00:06:37.980> in<00:06:38.520> the<00:06:38.670> rest<00:06:38.850> of<00:06:38.970> you<00:06:39.090> land<00:06:39.480> down

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:39.630 
quad so I in the rest of you land down

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:40.940 
quad so I in the rest of you land down
there<00:06:39.870> and<00:06:40.080> it's<00:06:40.200> you're<00:06:40.590> in<00:06:40.650> the<00:06:40.710> middle<00:06:40.860> of<00:06:40.890> a

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:40.950 
there and it's you're in the middle of a

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.170 
there and it's you're in the middle of a
huge<00:06:41.070> storm<00:06:41.400> and<00:06:41.520> so<00:06:41.640> you<00:06:41.730> hear<00:06:41.850> this<00:06:42.000> in

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.180 
huge storm and so you hear this in

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:48.460 
huge storm and so you hear this in
surrounds<00:06:42.630> just<00:06:42.780> all<00:06:42.930> around<00:06:43.200> you<00:06:43.320> this<00:06:43.440> wind

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:48.470 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:52.310 

so<00:06:49.470> pretty<00:06:50.010> intense
