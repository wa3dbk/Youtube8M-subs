attack<00:00:20.760> i<00:00:20.850> think<00:00:20.880> it's<00:00:21.300> an<00:00:21.449> internet-based<00:00:21.810> if

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
attack i think it's an internet-based if

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.170

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
bombs in this area Tesla's are over here

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.990 
bombs in this area Tesla's are over here
and<00:00:33.600> over<00:00:34.110> here<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.829> only<00:00:35.520> possible

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
locations for bombs are on those sites

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.030 
locations for bombs are on those sites
so<00:00:39.390> that's<00:00:39.750> pretty<00:00:39.960> much<00:00:40.170> all<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.559> need<00:00:40.739> to

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
so that's pretty much all you need to

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.819 
so that's pretty much all you need to
know<00:00:41.190> about<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.879> one<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.500> let's<00:00:43.500> go<00:00:43.649> over

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
know about this one and let's go over

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.350 
know about this one and let's go over
the<00:00:43.950> plan<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.309> see<00:00:44.460> how<00:00:44.579> he's<00:00:44.730> gonna<00:00:44.879> use<00:00:45.000> it

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
the plan and see how he's gonna use it

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.020 
the plan and see how he's gonna use it
so<00:00:45.989> queen<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.770> located<00:00:47.280> over<00:00:47.489> here<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:47.910> he's

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
so queen is located over here so he's

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.549 
so queen is located over here so he's
gonna<00:00:48.149> go<00:00:48.390> with<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> kill<00:00:48.930> squad<00:00:49.050> from<00:00:49.350> this

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
gonna go with a kill squad from this

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.470 
gonna go with a kill squad from this
direction<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:50.100> gonna<00:00:50.309> drop<00:00:50.579> two<00:00:50.820> golems<00:00:51.030> break

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
direction is gonna drop two golems break

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.990 
direction is gonna drop two golems break
through<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.809> wall<00:00:51.960> drop<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.500> jump<00:00:52.860> spell<00:00:53.129> over

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
through the wall drop a jump spell over

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.510 
through the wall drop a jump spell over
here<00:00:54.210> this<00:00:54.390> will<00:00:54.600> get<00:00:54.840> him<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.980> Queen<00:00:56.250> and

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
here this will get him to the Queen and

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.369 
here this will get him to the Queen and
detonate<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.270> bomb<00:00:57.300> bond<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.870> way<00:00:57.989> or<00:00:58.199> two

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
detonate a bomb bond the way or two

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.830 
detonate a bomb bond the way or two
bombs<00:00:58.590> on<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.250> way<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.399> think<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.850> was<00:01:00.059> only<00:01:00.539> one

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
bombs on the way I think it was only one

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.080 
bombs on the way I think it was only one
so<00:01:01.559> this<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:02.010> gonna<00:01:02.190> eliminate<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.850> clan

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
so this is gonna eliminate the clan

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.789 
so this is gonna eliminate the clan
castle<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.750> gonna<00:01:03.899> eliminate<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.530> Queen

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
castle this is gonna eliminate the Queen

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.149 
castle this is gonna eliminate the Queen
and<00:01:05.040> all<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.760> those<00:01:05.909> defenses<00:01:06.869> as<00:01:07.049> well<00:01:07.890> and

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
and all of those defenses as well and

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.730 
and all of those defenses as well and
once<00:01:08.939> those<00:01:09.210> are<00:01:09.270> down<00:01:09.600> he<00:01:09.900> can<00:01:10.140> send<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.530> Hogs

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
once those are down he can send the Hogs

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.280 
once those are down he can send the Hogs
from<00:01:11.250> both<00:01:11.460> direction<00:01:12.090> onedirection<00:01:12.720> is

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
from both direction onedirection is

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.080 
from both direction onedirection is
going<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.530> be<00:01:13.619> from<00:01:13.830> here<00:01:14.130> with<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.549> hillsville

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
going to be from here with a hillsville

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.450 
going to be from here with a hillsville
another<00:01:15.900> direction<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.590> gonna<00:01:16.799> be<00:01:16.920> from<00:01:17.189> here

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
another direction is gonna be from here

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.969 
another direction is gonna be from here
with<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> hillsville<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.619> what<00:01:19.619> i<00:01:19.650> recommend

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
with a hillsville and what i recommend

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.030 
with a hillsville and what i recommend
with<00:01:20.790> dealing<00:01:21.210> for<00:01:21.600> Tesla's<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.500> probably

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
with dealing for Tesla's you probably

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.830 
with dealing for Tesla's you probably
know<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.520> we're<00:01:23.820> Tesla's<00:01:24.030> together<00:01:24.600> are

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
know that we're Tesla's together are

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.149 
know that we're Tesla's together are
very<00:01:25.560> deadly<00:01:26.479> for<00:01:27.479> hogs<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.080> they<00:01:28.860> can<00:01:29.040> take

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
very deadly for hogs and they can take

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.899 
very deadly for hogs and they can take
out<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.520> whole<00:01:29.670> probably<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.420> two<00:01:31.259> seconds

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
out the whole probably in two seconds

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.899 
out the whole probably in two seconds
together<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.530> that's<00:01:34.530> pretty<00:01:34.860> hard<00:01:35.189> attacking

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
together so that's pretty hard attacking

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.060 
together so that's pretty hard attacking
such<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> base<00:01:36.720> with<00:01:37.110> with<00:01:37.500> all<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.860> for

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
such a base with with all the for

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.190 
such a base with with all the for
Tesla's<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.700> one<00:01:39.030> location<00:01:39.299> so<00:01:39.840> what<00:01:40.170> I

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
Tesla's in one location so what I

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.899 
Tesla's in one location so what I
recommend<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.250> exactly<00:01:41.400> what<00:01:41.820> I've

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
recommend and this is exactly what I've

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.469 
recommend and this is exactly what I've
done<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.270> dropping<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.350> rage<00:01:43.680> slow<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.240> rage

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
done is dropping a rage slow so a rage

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.270 
done is dropping a rage slow so a rage
fall<00:01:45.780> over<00:01:45.960> here<00:01:46.200> we'll<00:01:46.409> get<00:01:46.710> those<00:01:46.890> hooks

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
fall over here we'll get those hooks

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.780 
fall over here we'll get those hooks
into<00:01:48.210> those<00:01:48.570> Tesla's<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.619> fast<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.070> they're

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
into those Tesla's so fast that they're

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.190 
into those Tesla's so fast that they're
not<00:01:51.030> going<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.299> be<00:01:51.420> able<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.750> make<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.930> lot<00:01:52.140> of

three-star let's attack I mean and yeah
let's<00:02:01.259> see<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.409> back<00:02:02.810> so<00:02:03.810> here<00:02:04.049> goes

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
let's see that back so here goes

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.260 
let's see that back so here goes
attack<00:02:07.190> first<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.369> all<00:02:08.459> is<00:02:08.640> dropping<00:02:09.090> the

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
attack first of all is dropping the

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.520 
attack first of all is dropping the
golems<00:02:09.660> you're<00:02:10.259> covering<00:02:10.800> both<00:02:11.069> sections

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
golems you're covering both sections

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.930 
golems you're covering both sections
wizards<00:02:13.530> are<00:02:13.680> funneling<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.400> take<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.849> out

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
wizards are funneling and take it out

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.300 
wizards are funneling and take it out
those<00:02:15.180> outer<00:02:15.390> defenses<00:02:16.170> it's<00:02:16.860> pretty<00:02:17.040> bad

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
those outer defenses it's pretty bad

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.460 
those outer defenses it's pretty bad
that<00:02:17.489> that<00:02:17.760> this<00:02:17.970> guy<00:02:18.150> put<00:02:18.390> this<00:02:18.540> base<00:02:18.810> in<00:02:19.290> the

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
that that this guy put this base in the

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.710 
that that this guy put this base in the
corner<00:02:19.860> so<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.370> doesn't<00:02:20.700> have<00:02:20.849> any

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
corner so it doesn't have any

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.839 
corner so it doesn't have any
possibility<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:22.620> put<00:02:22.800> any<00:02:23.010> buildings<00:02:23.519> that

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
possibility to put any buildings that

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.270 
possibility to put any buildings that
are<00:02:24.090> going<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.569> cover<00:02:24.810> for<00:02:25.200> those<00:02:25.380> defenses<00:02:26.010> so

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
are going to cover for those defenses so

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.180 
are going to cover for those defenses so
this<00:02:27.060> allows<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.690> Wizards<00:02:28.110> taking<00:02:28.890> out<00:02:29.010> those

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
this allows the Wizards taking out those

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.120 
this allows the Wizards taking out those
defenses<00:02:29.730> directly<00:02:30.330> so<00:02:31.260> if<00:02:31.590> you<00:02:31.739> build<00:02:31.950> your

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
defenses directly so if you build your

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.160 
defenses directly so if you build your
base<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.700> you've<00:02:32.910> done<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.239> same<00:02:33.420> change<00:02:33.959> it

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
base and you've done the same change it

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.160 
base and you've done the same change it
right<00:02:34.410> away<00:02:34.830> it's<00:02:35.220> going<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.700> hurt<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:36.090> so<00:02:36.810> one

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
right away it's going to hurt you so one

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.110 
right away it's going to hurt you so one

the enemy King as well so that's another
thing<00:02:47.400> that<00:02:47.670> you<00:02:47.880> gotta<00:02:48.150> consider<00:02:48.450> when

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
thing that you gotta consider when

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.180 
thing that you gotta consider when
you're<00:02:48.870> defending<00:02:49.260> your<00:02:49.530> base<00:02:49.799> you<00:02:50.160> don't

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.140 
want the kill squad you get the king as
well<00:02:52.709> because<00:02:53.130> that's<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.489> waste<00:02:53.670> it's<00:02:53.970> not

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
well because that's a waste it's not

against<00:02:59.370> those<00:02:59.489> Hawks<00:02:59.760> for<00:03:00.060> example<00:03:00.420> in<00:03:00.569> the

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
against those Hawks for example in the

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.750 
against those Hawks for example in the
bottom<00:03:01.019> of<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.230> base<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:01.769> will<00:03:02.250> have<00:03:02.400> much

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
bottom of the base it will have much

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.870 
bottom of the base it will have much
better<00:03:03.030> so<00:03:03.239> notice<00:03:03.569> that<00:03:03.750> reachable<00:03:04.410> and<00:03:04.880> it's

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
better so notice that reachable and it's

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.390 
better so notice that reachable and it's
getting<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.480> Hogs<00:03:06.720> so<00:03:07.590> fast<00:03:07.890> into<00:03:08.250> those

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
getting the Hogs so fast into those

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.370 
getting the Hogs so fast into those
Tesla's<00:03:08.880> that<00:03:09.180> they're<00:03:09.690> totally<00:03:10.200> useless

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
Tesla's that they're totally useless

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.099 
Tesla's that they're totally useless
seasoning<00:03:11.190> few<00:03:11.430> balloons<00:03:11.670> as<00:03:11.940> well<00:03:12.180> from<00:03:12.959> the

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
seasoning few balloons as well from the

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.289 
seasoning few balloons as well from the
right<00:03:13.319> side<00:03:13.590> maybe<00:03:14.130> a<00:03:14.250> bit<00:03:14.519> too<00:03:14.730> early<00:03:14.880> because

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
right side maybe a bit too early because

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.590 
right side maybe a bit too early because
that<00:03:15.630> air<00:03:15.810> defense<00:03:16.140> is<00:03:16.319> not<00:03:16.590> down<00:03:16.859> yet<00:03:16.920> but<00:03:17.600> and

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
that air defense is not down yet but and

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.599 
that air defense is not down yet but and
yeah<00:03:19.079> he<00:03:19.230> loses<00:03:19.590> some<00:03:19.769> of<00:03:19.799> the<00:03:19.980> balloons<00:03:20.280> but

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
yeah he loses some of the balloons but

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.340 
yeah he loses some of the balloons but
it<00:03:21.090> didn't<00:03:21.420> really<00:03:21.600> matter<00:03:21.810> you<00:03:22.049> got<00:03:22.200> the

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
it didn't really matter you got the

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.259 
it didn't really matter you got the
three-star<00:03:22.829> all<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.280> defenses<00:03:23.760> are<00:03:23.940> going<00:03:24.209> to

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
three-star all the defenses are going to

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.220 
three-star all the defenses are going to
be<00:03:24.359> down<00:03:24.569> now<00:03:25.790> queen<00:03:26.790> is<00:03:26.910> fully<00:03:27.180> alive<00:03:27.569> so<00:03:27.959> you

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
be down now queen is fully alive so you

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.920 
be down now queen is fully alive so you
can<00:03:28.440> kind<00:03:28.829> of<00:03:28.889> call<00:03:29.069> it<00:03:29.190> an<00:03:29.400> overkill<00:03:29.970> over<00:03:30.480> 1

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
can kind of call it an overkill over 1

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.580 
can kind of call it an overkill over 1
minute<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:32.010> 20<00:03:32.850> seconds<00:03:33.299> for<00:03:33.569> the<00:03:33.720> cleanup<00:03:34.049> so
