00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:45.660 

you

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.540 

so<00:00:46.670> let's<00:00:46.880> look<00:00:47.060> at<00:00:47.120> the<00:00:47.750> pattern<00:00:48.220> it<00:00:49.220> sounds

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
so let's look at the pattern it sounds

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:57.580 
so let's look at the pattern it sounds
like<00:00:49.700> this<00:00:52.780> and<00:00:55.360> from<00:00:56.360> there<00:00:56.570> on<00:00:56.720> it<00:00:57.170> starts

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
like this and from there on it starts

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.670 
like this and from there on it starts
over<00:00:57.860> again<00:00:58.390> so<00:00:59.390> let's<00:00:59.989> play<00:01:00.170> that<00:01:00.350> a<00:01:00.380> little

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
over again so let's play that a little

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.860 
over again so let's play that a little
slower<00:01:00.949> tempo<00:01:01.520> I'm<00:01:02.360> starting<00:01:02.690> on<00:01:02.720> the<00:01:02.780> E

string back to the second fret and then

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.010 
string back to the second fret and then
switching<00:01:30.740> to<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:31.009> D<00:01:31.220> string<00:01:31.640> on<00:01:32.330> the<00:01:32.690> second

switching to the D string on the second

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.279 
switching to the D string on the second

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.179 

and<00:01:47.329> now<00:01:47.780> to<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:48.110> low<00:01:48.229> e<00:01:48.259> string<00:01:48.409> on<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:49.009> third

and now to the low e string on the third

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.999 
and now to the low e string on the third
fret<00:01:49.219> and<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:49.850> fourth<00:01:50.090> fret<00:01:53.649> so<00:01:54.649> it<00:01:54.740> sounds

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
fret and the fourth fret so it sounds

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:15.710 
fret and the fourth fret so it sounds
like<00:01:55.039> this<00:01:55.369> one<00:01:56.179> two<00:01:56.929> three<00:01:57.890> four

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.309 

and<00:02:15.930> now<00:02:16.590> we<00:02:16.650> are<00:02:16.920> switching<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:18.170> playing<00:02:19.170> on

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
and now we are switching to playing on

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:29.680 
and now we are switching to playing on
starting<00:02:19.740> on<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.890> string

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.840 

so<00:02:30.690> all<00:02:30.870> I'm<00:02:31.020> playing<00:02:31.260> there<00:02:31.470> is<00:02:31.790> starting<00:02:32.790> on

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
so all I'm playing there is starting on

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.180 
so all I'm playing there is starting on
the<00:02:32.940> a<00:02:32.970> string<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.530> using<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.620> D<00:02:34.800> string<00:02:35.160> and

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
the a string and using the D string and

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.140 
the a string and using the D string and
the<00:02:35.400> g<00:02:35.430> string<00:02:36.770> instead<00:02:37.850> otherwise<00:02:38.850> the

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
the g string instead otherwise the

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.960 
the g string instead otherwise the
pattern<00:02:39.570> is<00:02:39.739> identically<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:40.800> same<00:02:40.950> as<00:02:41.430> the

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
pattern is identically the same as the

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.220 
pattern is identically the same as the
first<00:02:42.150> one<00:02:42.300> we<00:02:42.390> did<00:02:42.420> we're<00:02:42.930> just<00:02:43.080> switching

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
first one we did we're just switching

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.500 
first one we did we're just switching
the<00:02:43.530> strings<00:02:43.910> then<00:02:44.910> we<00:02:44.970> go<00:02:45.090> back<00:02:45.239> to<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.480> e

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
the strings then we go back to the e

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:55.390 
the strings then we go back to the e
string<00:02:45.750> again

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.309 

the<00:02:56.400> last<00:02:56.610> part<00:02:56.910> is<00:02:57.060> when<00:02:57.300> we<00:02:57.450> start<00:02:57.780> on<00:02:57.930> the

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
the last part is when we start on the

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:04.100 
the last part is when we start on the
note<00:02:58.770> B<00:02:59.160> on<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:01.050> a<00:03:01.080> string<00:03:02.810> then<00:03:03.810> we're<00:03:03.989> going

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
note B on the a string then we're going

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.210 
note B on the a string then we're going
to<00:03:04.140> play<00:03:05.780> use<00:03:06.780> my<00:03:06.989> pinky<00:03:07.470> here<00:03:07.800> on<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.040> fifth

to play use my pinky here on the fifth

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.640 
to play use my pinky here on the fifth

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
fourth fret on the g string switching

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.520 
fourth fret on the g string switching
back<00:03:25.800> to<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:26.100> g<00:03:26.220> string<00:03:26.519> on<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:27.209> sixth<00:03:27.480> fret

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.770 

and<00:03:31.640> then<00:03:32.640> fifth<00:03:32.880> and<00:03:33.090> sixth<00:03:33.330> fret<00:03:33.450> on<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.660> a

and then fifth and sixth fret on the a

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.600 
and then fifth and sixth fret on the a
string<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:36.290> then<00:03:37.290> it<00:03:37.739> starts<00:03:38.010> over<00:03:38.190> again<00:03:38.489> on

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
string and then it starts over again on

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:44.809 
string and then it starts over again on
the<00:03:38.640> E<00:03:38.730> string<00:03:42.080> and<00:03:43.080> so<00:03:43.319> on<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:44.280> right<00:03:44.489> hand

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
the E string and so on the right hand

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.340 
the E string and so on the right hand
you<00:03:45.090> have<00:03:45.360> a<00:03:45.390> couple<00:03:45.600> of<00:03:45.750> options<00:03:46.140> you<00:03:46.200> can

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
you have a couple of options you can

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.009 
you have a couple of options you can
either<00:03:46.560> play<00:03:46.830> it<00:03:46.860> with<00:03:47.100> a<00:03:47.130> open<00:03:48.030> movement<00:03:48.930> like

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
either play it with a open movement like

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.170 
either play it with a open movement like
this<00:03:49.230> but<00:03:49.739> then<00:03:49.890> you<00:03:50.010> would<00:03:50.100> have<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.400> mute<00:03:50.970> the

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
this but then you would have to mute the

00:03:51.180 --> 00:04:01.330 
this but then you would have to mute the
strings<00:03:51.480> with<00:03:51.900> your<00:03:52.019> left<00:03:52.200> hand

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.170 

you

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.250

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
hard to explain but it means covering up

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.360

those<00:04:27.510> open<00:04:27.960> strings<00:04:28.260> with<00:04:28.920> any<00:04:29.070> of<00:04:29.220> your

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
left-hand fingers as best you can so it

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.670 
left-hand fingers as best you can so it
doesn't<00:04:31.530> ring<00:04:32.520> like<00:04:32.730> that<00:04:33.050> but<00:04:34.050> you<00:04:34.290> can<00:04:34.470> also

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680
