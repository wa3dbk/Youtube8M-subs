00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
and we see a scientist who has this

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.189 
and we see a scientist who has this
weird<00:00:52.550> control<00:00:53.550> over<00:00:53.940> machines<00:00:54.300> or<00:00:54.510> her<00:00:54.660> set

weird control over machines or her set

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.369 
weird control over machines or her set
of<00:00:55.410> machines<00:00:56.030> but<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.059> did<00:00:57.449> feel<00:00:57.750> some<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.350> the

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
of machines but I did feel some of the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.500 
of machines but I did feel some of the
action<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.370> beginning<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.000> comic<00:01:00.329> was

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
action in the beginning of the comic was

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.200 
action in the beginning of the comic was
hard<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.170> follow<00:01:01.550> particularly<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.910> fight

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
hard to follow particularly the fight

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.210 
hard to follow particularly the fight
between<00:01:03.510> Vader<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.589> trend<00:01:04.799> ocean<00:01:05.129> I

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
between Vader and the trend ocean I

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.940 
between Vader and the trend ocean I
didn't<00:01:05.430> really<00:01:05.549> understand<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.600> flow<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:07.320> the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
didn't really understand the flow of the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.590 
didn't really understand the flow of the
panels<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.640> things<00:01:08.880> like<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.060> some<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
panels and things like that some of the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.330 
panels and things like that some of the
other<00:01:09.750> fight<00:01:10.080> scenes<00:01:10.260> were<00:01:10.380> okay<00:01:10.680> but<00:01:10.740> between

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
other fight scenes were okay but between

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.429 
other fight scenes were okay but between
that<00:01:12.090> particular<00:01:12.360> character<00:01:12.869> for<00:01:13.110> whatever

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
that particular character for whatever

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.219 
that particular character for whatever
reason<00:01:13.740> for<00:01:13.920> me<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.189> just<00:01:14.220> did<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.990> couldn't<00:01:15.990> see

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
reason for me it just did I couldn't see

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.660 
reason for me it just did I couldn't see
the<00:01:16.380> fight<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.590> couldn't<00:01:16.979> get<00:01:17.189> understand

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
the fight I couldn't get understand

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.020 
the fight I couldn't get understand
which<00:01:17.970> motion<00:01:18.509> was<00:01:18.659> following<00:01:19.140> which<00:01:19.619> act<00:01:20.030> but

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
which motion was following which act but

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.460 
which motion was following which act but
that's<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.240> really<00:01:21.450> small<00:01:21.689> great<00:01:21.960> as<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.439> thought

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
that's a really small great as I thought

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.670 
that's a really small great as I thought
before<00:01:22.890> Sidious<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.909> indeed<00:01:24.680> experimenting

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
before Sidious is indeed experimenting

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.399 
before Sidious is indeed experimenting
with<00:01:26.450> cybernetics<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.600> he's<00:01:27.780> actually<00:01:28.020> in

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
with cybernetics and he's actually in

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.590 
with cybernetics and he's actually in
one<00:01:28.590> point<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.130> comic<00:01:29.460> says<00:01:29.670> everything

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
one point and the comic says everything

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.539 
one point and the comic says everything
is<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.960> force<00:01:31.200> not<00:01:31.500> just<00:01:31.740> sentient<00:01:32.250> beings

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
is of the force not just sentient beings

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.730 
is of the force not just sentient beings
but<00:01:32.700> machines<00:01:33.450> as<00:01:33.689> well<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.320> makes<00:01:34.380> sense

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
but machines as well and it makes sense

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.399 
but machines as well and it makes sense
because<00:01:35.009> his<00:01:35.310> biggest<00:01:35.729> experiment<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.780> Darth

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
because his biggest experiment is Darth

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.920 
because his biggest experiment is Darth
Vader<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.100> he<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:39.119> course<00:01:39.299> half-man

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
Vader and he is of course half-man

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.580 
Vader and he is of course half-man
half-machine<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.700> guess<00:01:41.970> for<00:01:42.720> me<00:01:42.899> for<00:01:43.290> from

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
half-machine and I guess for me for from

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.590 
half-machine and I guess for me for from
that<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:44.159> think<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.880> reason<00:01:45.060> why<00:01:45.299> city

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
that I think this is the reason why city

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.120 
that I think this is the reason why city
is<00:01:45.780> would<00:01:46.110> want<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.470> do<00:01:46.619> something<00:01:46.829> like<00:01:46.920> this

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
is would want to do something like this

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.649 
is would want to do something like this
while<00:01:47.369> he<00:01:47.520> wants<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.790> experiment<00:01:48.240> with<00:01:48.420> this

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
while he wants to experiment with this

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.109 
while he wants to experiment with this
and<00:01:48.930> that's<00:01:49.470> why<00:01:49.649> silo<00:01:50.369> five<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:50.939> so

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
and that's why silo five is so

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.190 
and that's why silo five is so
interested<00:01:51.600> because<00:01:51.780> he's<00:01:51.869> kind<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.079> like

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
interested because he's kind of like

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.080 
interested because he's kind of like
being<00:01:52.409> like<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.710> sales<00:01:52.950> man<00:01:53.159> saying<00:01:53.729> like<00:01:53.939> hey

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
being like the sales man saying like hey

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.240 
being like the sales man saying like hey
here<00:01:54.600> are<00:01:54.630> all<00:01:54.840> my<00:01:54.869> experiments<00:01:55.680> let's<00:01:56.130> see

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
here are all my experiments let's see

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.100 
here are all my experiments let's see
which<00:01:56.399> one<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.610> like<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.820> best<00:01:56.939> insidious<00:01:57.750> is

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
which one you like the best insidious is

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.840 
which one you like the best insidious is
basically<00:01:58.560> pitting<00:01:58.920> Vader<00:01:59.189> against<00:01:59.610> all

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
basically pitting Vader against all

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.749 
basically pitting Vader against all
these<00:02:00.000> other<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:01.079> know<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.740> cyborgs<00:02:02.490> that

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
these other you know the cyborgs that

this theory i have about Vader in
general<00:02:17.470> I<00:02:17.680> think<00:02:18.150> between<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.510> points<00:02:19.810> of

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
general I think between the points of

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.370 
general I think between the points of
revenge<00:02:20.710> of<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.860> sith<00:02:21.070> and<00:02:21.430> a<00:02:22.180> new<00:02:22.450> hope<00:02:22.720> he

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
revenge of the sith and a new hope he

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.580 
revenge of the sith and a new hope he
was<00:02:23.560> sort<00:02:23.890> of<00:02:23.980> complacent<00:02:24.670> I<00:02:24.820> don't<00:02:25.000> think<00:02:25.590> he

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
was sort of complacent I don't think he

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.400 
was sort of complacent I don't think he
was<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:27.100> full<00:02:28.090> potential<00:02:28.660> that<00:02:28.810> Vader<00:02:29.050> could

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
was the full potential that Vader could

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.170 
was the full potential that Vader could
be<00:02:29.590> I<00:02:29.620> don't<00:02:29.800> think<00:02:30.220> he<00:02:30.340> was<00:02:30.490> in<00:02:30.580> his<00:02:30.700> prime<00:02:30.880> at

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
be I don't think he was in his prime at

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.050 
be I don't think he was in his prime at
all<00:02:31.330> I<00:02:31.630> think<00:02:31.990> his<00:02:32.170> fight<00:02:32.410> with<00:02:32.440> Kenobi<00:02:33.160> the

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
all I think his fight with Kenobi the

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.870 
all I think his fight with Kenobi the
discovery<00:02:34.570> of<00:02:34.920> this<00:02:35.920> rebel<00:02:36.190> pilot<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:36.760> this

new threat and these new cyborgs are

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.420 
new threat and these new cyborgs are
kind<00:02:40.780> of<00:02:40.840> playing<00:02:41.080> into<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.770> reason<00:02:42.070> why<00:02:42.160> he

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
kind of playing into the reason why he

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.940 
kind of playing into the reason why he
needs<00:02:42.700> to<00:02:43.030> step<00:02:43.840> up<00:02:43.900> his<00:02:44.020> game<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:44.620> I<00:02:44.680> think

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
needs to step up his game and I think

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.760 
needs to step up his game and I think
that<00:02:45.160> that<00:02:45.430> plays<00:02:46.150> into<00:02:46.360> the<00:02:46.960> fact<00:02:47.200> of<00:02:47.350> why<00:02:47.560> he

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
that that plays into the fact of why he

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.920 
that that plays into the fact of why he
was<00:02:47.890> so<00:02:48.100> much<00:02:48.460> more<00:02:48.760> skilled<00:02:49.390> in<00:02:49.600> Empire

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
was so much more skilled in Empire

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.510

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
why I think his prime is in that that

why I think his prime is in that that
time<00:02:54.580> period<00:02:54.790> not<00:02:55.120> only<00:02:55.390> because<00:02:55.660> the

novelization of Return of the Jedi says

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.420 
novelization of Return of the Jedi says

explicitly that this was him in his

i think is very vital to his progression

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.449 
i think is very vital to his progression
as<00:03:19.510> a<00:03:19.540> character<00:03:19.900> in<00:03:20.170> his<00:03:20.740> progression<00:03:21.250> to<00:03:21.340> his

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
so after he attains this information

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.199 
so after he attains this information
from<00:03:26.050> Boba<00:03:26.350> Fett<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:27.070> first<00:03:27.640> thing<00:03:27.880> he<00:03:28.030> does

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
from Boba Fett the first thing he does
