charter<00:05:06.470> school<00:05:06.680> has<00:05:06.920> the<00:05:07.040> ability<00:05:07.340> I<00:05:07.370> guess

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
charter school has the ability I guess

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.130 
charter school has the ability I guess
to<00:05:07.820> create<00:05:08.150> a<00:05:08.180> caring<00:05:08.450> environment<00:05:08.570> for<00:05:09.080> the

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
to create a caring environment for the

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
to create a caring environment for the
students<00:05:09.470> here<00:05:09.590> because<00:05:09.800> we<00:05:09.890> have<00:05:09.980> a<00:05:10.010> bit<00:05:10.130> of

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
students here because we have a bit of

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.130 
students here because we have a bit of
freedom<00:05:10.400> and<00:05:10.970> I<00:05:11.030> think<00:05:11.270> having<00:05:11.480> the<00:05:11.810> role<00:05:12.110> of

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
freedom and I think having the role of

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.660 
freedom and I think having the role of
both<00:05:12.380> the<00:05:12.590> teacher<00:05:12.770> but<00:05:13.130> not<00:05:13.280> just<00:05:13.460> as<00:05:13.550> an

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:13.670 
both the teacher but not just as an

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.580 
both the teacher but not just as an
instructor<00:05:14.000> but<00:05:14.180> as<00:05:14.300> a<00:05:14.360> mentor<00:05:14.840> can<00:05:15.350> we<00:05:15.440> see

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
instructor but as a mentor can we see

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.620 
instructor but as a mentor can we see
their<00:05:15.740> concerts<00:05:16.220> taking<00:05:17.120> it<00:05:17.270> from<00:05:17.390> outside

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
their concerts taking it from outside

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.780 
their concerts taking it from outside
just<00:05:18.080> the<00:05:18.200> classroom<00:05:18.650> but<00:05:18.860> going<00:05:19.340> into<00:05:19.550> their

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
just the classroom but going into their

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
just the classroom but going into their
lives<00:05:20.000> and<00:05:20.300> I<00:05:20.360> think<00:05:20.540> that's<00:05:20.690> why<00:05:20.780> the

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
lives and I think that's why the

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.580 
lives and I think that's why the
students<00:05:21.200> I<00:05:21.260> think<00:05:21.290> feel<00:05:21.650> cared<00:05:22.010> and<00:05:22.220> scholars
