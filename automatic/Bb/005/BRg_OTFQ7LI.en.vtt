00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
it's just the nightmare to render this

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.709 
it's just the nightmare to render this
video<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.530> make<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:44.070> GT<00:00:44.730> fo<00:00:44.940> sho<00:00:45.210> it's<00:00:45.629> gonna

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
video to make this GT fo sho it's gonna

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.869 
video to make this GT fo sho it's gonna
take<00:00:45.809> like<00:00:46.020> an<00:00:46.170> hour<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.530> half<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.670> know

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
take like an hour and a half so you know

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.310 
take like an hour and a half so you know
it's<00:00:48.000> just<00:00:48.180> been<00:00:48.270> really<00:00:48.480> difficult<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.170> make

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
it's just been really difficult to make

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.690 
it's just been really difficult to make
videos<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:49.950> that's<00:00:50.129> why<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.280> haven't<00:00:50.520> been

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
videos so that's why I haven't been

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.850 
videos so that's why I haven't been
doing<00:00:50.879> any<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.360> still<00:00:52.350> don't<00:00:52.530> have<00:00:52.680> my<00:00:52.710> computer

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.069 
back but I just decided I'm gonna have
to<00:00:56.399> deal<00:00:56.579> with<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.000> put<00:00:57.449> some<00:00:57.600> more<00:00:57.750> videos

remember<00:01:40.439> when<00:01:40.680> I've<00:01:40.799> heard<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.159> from<00:01:41.340> but<00:01:41.520> I

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
remember when I've heard that from but I

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.730 
remember when I've heard that from but I
think<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.150> maybe<00:01:42.360> one<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:42.840> December<00:01:43.409> in<00:01:43.470> just

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
think that maybe one in December in just

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.649 
think that maybe one in December in just
a<00:01:43.829> few<00:01:43.979> days<00:01:44.040> time<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.520> don't<00:01:44.700> know<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:45.000> thought

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
a few days time I don't know I thought

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.569 
a few days time I don't know I thought
it'd<00:01:45.840> be<00:01:45.869> more<00:01:45.960> rumors<00:01:46.470> about<00:01:46.680> but<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.340> think

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
it'd be more rumors about but I think

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.590 
it'd be more rumors about but I think
there<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.820> new<00:01:48.060> one<00:01:48.210> I've<00:01:48.360> read<00:01:48.570> articles
