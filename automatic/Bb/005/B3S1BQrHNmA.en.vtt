a<00:00:09.059> stage<00:00:11.269> anyways<00:00:12.269> our<00:00:12.509> blade<00:00:12.719> room<00:00:13.049> we<00:00:13.200> saw

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
a stage anyways our blade room we saw

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.929 
a stage anyways our blade room we saw
she<00:00:13.650> appears<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:14.280> be<00:00:14.400> in<00:00:14.490> Japan<00:00:17.630> yeah<00:00:19.939> actually

I think the UM the Lobo transitions
actually<00:00:23.519> kind<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:23.760> make<00:00:23.910> sense<00:00:24.119> if<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.480> ask

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630

drums aren't as hard as they look and I

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.330 
drums aren't as hard as they look and I
don't<00:06:14.260> know<00:06:14.350> why<00:06:14.470> those<00:06:14.650> cavemen<00:06:14.979> we're

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.340 
don't know why those cavemen we're

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.440 
don't know why those cavemen we're
standing<00:06:15.610> on<00:06:15.729> each<00:06:15.850> other<00:06:17.910> these<00:06:18.910> jumps<00:06:19.240> can

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.450 
standing on each other these jumps can

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.659 
standing on each other these jumps can
be<00:06:19.630> difficult<00:06:20.050> but<00:06:20.290> compared<00:06:21.130> to<00:06:21.190> that<00:06:21.340> last

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:21.669 
be difficult but compared to that last

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:22.140 
be difficult but compared to that last
jump

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
jump

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.850 
jump
it's<00:06:22.990> not<00:06:23.140> a<00:06:23.169> problem<00:06:25.260> they<00:06:26.260> do<00:06:26.320> however<00:06:26.620> like

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
it's not a problem they do however like

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.840 
it's not a problem they do however like
spawning<00:06:27.760> cavemen<00:06:28.419> behind<00:06:28.840> you<00:06:29.020> to<00:06:29.320> kind<00:06:29.560> of

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:29.850 
spawning cavemen behind you to kind of

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
spawning cavemen behind you to kind of
make<00:06:30.850> you<00:06:31.000> nervous<00:06:31.180> and<00:06:31.540> feel<00:06:31.630> like<00:06:31.720> you<00:06:31.840> have

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
make you nervous and feel like you have

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.010 
make you nervous and feel like you have
to<00:06:32.020> hurry<00:06:32.590> up<00:06:32.650> and<00:06:32.890> do<00:06:33.010> the<00:06:33.130> jump<00:06:33.340> but<00:06:33.990> really<00:06:34.990> I

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:35.020 
to hurry up and do the jump but really I

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.230 
to hurry up and do the jump but really I
find<00:06:35.229> it's<00:06:35.410> best<00:06:35.440> to<00:06:35.680> take<00:06:35.890> your<00:06:36.100> time<00:06:36.280> and<00:06:36.610> in

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 
find it's best to take your time and in

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.180 
find it's best to take your time and in
cases<00:06:37.510> like<00:06:37.690> that<00:06:37.840> I'll<00:06:38.200> jump<00:06:38.500> right<00:06:38.710> off

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.190 
cases like that I'll jump right off

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.060 
cases like that I'll jump right off
so<00:06:40.790> it's<00:06:40.910> not<00:06:41.060> as<00:06:41.210> difficult<00:06:41.420> as<00:06:41.690> they<00:06:41.810> try<00:06:42.020> to

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.070 
so it's not as difficult as they try to

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:48.460 
so it's not as difficult as they try to
make<00:06:43.070> it<00:06:43.130> seem<00:06:46.600> you<00:06:47.600> just<00:06:47.840> gotta<00:06:48.080> know<00:06:48.320> what

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:48.470 
make it seem you just gotta know what

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.860 
make it seem you just gotta know what
you're<00:06:48.650> doing<00:06:48.680> see<00:06:49.460> right<00:06:50.360> there<00:06:50.540> that's<00:06:50.690> the

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:50.870 
you're doing see right there that's the

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.300 
you're doing see right there that's the
end<00:06:51.050> that's<00:06:51.230> the<00:06:51.320> end<00:06:51.410> of<00:06:51.590> the<00:06:51.650> stage<00:06:51.890> already

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:52.310 
end that's the end of the stage already

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.500
