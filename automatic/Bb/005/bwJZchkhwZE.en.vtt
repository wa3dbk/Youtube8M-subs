factory<00:00:16.080> this<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.830> very<00:00:17.010> basic<00:00:17.190> figure

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
factory this is a very basic figure

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.670 
factory this is a very basic figure
you've<00:00:18.420> got<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.690> figure<00:00:18.900> here<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.350> couple<00:00:19.619> of

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
you've got the figure here a couple of

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.859 
you've got the figure here a couple of
heads<00:00:19.890> as<00:00:20.100> you<00:00:20.189> can<00:00:20.310> see<00:00:20.430> here<00:00:20.699> at<00:00:21.060> katana<00:00:21.600> and

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
heads as you can see here at katana and

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.230 
heads as you can see here at katana and
the<00:00:22.500> sheet<00:00:22.710> here<00:00:23.070> can<00:00:23.670> tree<00:00:23.760> see<00:00:23.910> much<00:00:24.060> else

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
the sheet here can tree see much else

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.670 
the sheet here can tree see much else
but<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.660> guess<00:00:24.930> there's<00:00:25.140> some<00:00:25.170> more<00:00:25.350> down<00:00:25.529> there

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
but I guess there's some more down there

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.470 
but I guess there's some more down there
alternate<00:00:26.250> hands<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.699> whatnot<00:00:27.000> here's<00:00:27.359> the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
alternate hands and whatnot here's the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.400 
alternate hands and whatnot here's the
side<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.840> box<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.460> on<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.550> back<00:00:29.699> here<00:00:30.410> so

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
side of the box and on the back here so

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.110 
side of the box and on the back here so
mainly<00:00:31.590> it's<00:00:31.859> just<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.489> figure<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:32.969> the

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
mainly it's just the figure and the

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.510 
mainly it's just the figure and the
katana<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.690> all<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:33.960> have<00:00:34.110> here<00:00:34.340> so<00:00:35.340> let's

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
katana is all you have here so let's

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.650 
katana is all you have here so let's
have<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.670> look<00:00:35.790> inside<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.210> box

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
have a look inside the box

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:54.709 
have a look inside the box
I<00:00:52.340> think<00:00:53.340> my<00:00:53.460> figures<00:00:53.789> have<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:53.969> nice<00:00:54.149> weight<00:00:54.539> to

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
I think my figures have a nice weight to

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.959 
I think my figures have a nice weight to
them<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.260> feel<00:00:55.469> really<00:00:55.980> good<00:00:56.100> quality<00:00:56.489> other

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
them to feel really good quality other

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.520 
them to feel really good quality other
figures<00:00:57.300> like<00:00:57.480> BRE<00:00:57.690> voltec<00:00:58.050> can<00:00:58.199> feel<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.379> bit

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
figures like BRE voltec can feel a bit

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.580 
figures like BRE voltec can feel a bit
soft<00:00:58.980> or<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.430> little<00:01:00.120> bit<00:01:00.270> strange<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.230> plastic

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
soft or a little bit strange the plastic

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.920 
soft or a little bit strange the plastic
can<00:01:01.680> stick<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.370> they<00:01:02.820> just<00:01:03.030> feel<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.510> little

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
can stick and they just feel a little

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.590 
can stick and they just feel a little
bit<00:01:04.049> inferior<00:01:04.409> quality<00:01:04.830> but<00:01:05.159> figma<00:01:05.460> figures

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
bit inferior quality but figma figures

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.840 
bit inferior quality but figma figures
always<00:01:06.600> tend<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.840> look<00:01:06.930> good<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:07.640> right<00:01:08.640> out<00:01:08.790> of

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
always tend to look good so right out of

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.100 
always tend to look good so right out of

overall looks really nice the
accessories<00:01:20.490> include<00:01:20.990> the<00:01:21.990> katana<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:23.250> sheet

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
accessories include the katana the sheet

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.710 
accessories include the katana the sheet
which<00:01:23.880> very<00:01:24.240> interestingly<00:01:24.920> houses<00:01:25.920> this

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
which very interestingly houses this

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.170 
which very interestingly houses this
section<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.900> katana<00:01:28.340> so<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.430> can<00:01:29.579> have<00:01:29.790> an

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
section of a katana so you can have an

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.140 
section of a katana so you can have an
empty<00:01:30.869> sheet<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:32.070> katana<00:01:32.430> housed<00:01:32.759> in<00:01:33.030> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
empty sheet the katana housed in the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.740 
empty sheet the katana housed in the
sheet<00:01:33.360> or<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.570> semi<00:01:34.020> drawn<00:01:34.409> effect<00:01:35.720> which<00:01:36.720> is

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
sheet or a semi drawn effect which is

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.859 
sheet or a semi drawn effect which is
really<00:01:37.140> cool<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:38.340> alternate<00:01:38.820> faces<00:01:41.659> I'm<00:01:42.659> the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
really cool the alternate faces I'm the

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.310 
really cool the alternate faces I'm the
alternate<00:01:43.259> hands<00:01:43.500> some<00:01:44.130> open<00:01:44.700> hands<00:01:45.320> these

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
alternate hands some open hands these

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.480 
alternate hands some open hands these
hands<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.860> guess<00:01:46.979> are<00:01:47.250> for<00:01:47.369> old<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.610> katana<00:01:48.000> and

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
hands I guess are for old the katana and

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.819 
hands I guess are for old the katana and
some<00:01:50.490> extra<00:01:50.850> hands<00:01:51.500> probably<00:01:52.500> for<00:01:52.590> whom<00:01:52.710> the

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
some extra hands probably for whom the

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.109 
some extra hands probably for whom the
katana<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.310> different<00:01:53.610> ways

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
katana in different ways

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.130 
katana in different ways
I'm<00:01:54.240> guessing<00:01:54.509> this<00:01:54.570> one's<00:01:54.750> for<00:01:54.899> holding<00:01:55.079> the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
I'm guessing this one's for holding the

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.190 
I'm guessing this one's for holding the
sheet<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.040> included<00:01:56.850> figma<00:01:57.149> base<00:01:57.329> ok<00:01:58.140> so

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
sheet and the included figma base ok so

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.830 
sheet and the included figma base ok so
having<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.619> look<00:01:58.740> at<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.369> articulation<00:01:59.840> head

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
having a look at the articulation head

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.539 
having a look at the articulation head
can't<00:02:01.110> move<00:02:01.200> up<00:02:01.469> too<00:02:01.680> much<00:02:01.860> because<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.460> all

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
can't move up too much because of all

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.550 
can't move up too much because of all
the<00:02:02.640> hair<00:02:02.820> back<00:02:02.850> here<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.659> that's<00:02:04.350> it

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
the hair back here and that's it

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.449 
the hair back here and that's it
pointing<00:02:05.549> down<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:06.240> arms<00:02:06.479> up<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:07.190> little<00:02:08.190> shade

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459
