00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:04.129
 Garitano in this video on how to make magic with cards 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.420
 good sign the Mexican mix 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.540
 nor useful for controlling the first and last cards of a deck 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.669
 you have to hold the mallet by placing your thumb on one side the other fingers of the 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:19.039
 hand except the index 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.289
 on the other side 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.359
 the beginning in irak and letters exerting pressure and soft the deck of cards and the 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.529
 thumb will let out some that are picked up by the other hand 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.440
 the engines will be square 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.970
 and now with the hands in the same position 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.970
 let's let letters escape with the thumb 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.250
 now this may end 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.030
 percent 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.030
 joining the engines to the center like this 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.080
 using the technique called the waterfall technique 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.410
 consists of the following once we have mixed in the heaps 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.980
 mdz the couple inside 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.390
 We do this 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.840
 This consists 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.520
 letters 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.390
 release the pressure 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.660
 about them 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.060
 we are here, we donated, you made tastings up 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.060
 and let's say they were falling 1 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.980
 this scourge study of texts in which not even against the first 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.090
 a in the last or the first and the last letter 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.550
 i can help pretty efe for example here we have between Sundays 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.110
 and down in 3d shamrocks 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.390
 with extremes 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.860
 we know that the first amount that each is the button below and that therefore the 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.290
 letter below are this amount pints that abide above are this 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.040
 so when we start to drop letters with the thumbs we'll start with 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.040
 that amount and we'll end up with this 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.540
 now we have apparently one is not completely normal but in truth 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.100
 we know well here the same letter above 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.100
 the same letter below 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.689
 that has been the American mix I hope you liked that it was served 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:13.169
 my daughter comments on her loved ones 

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:13.719
 thank you
