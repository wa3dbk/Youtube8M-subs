gone oh there's a pan of mountains at
least<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.840> think<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:22.170> was<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.289> pan<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.680> mountains

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
least I think it was a pan of mountains

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.259 
least I think it was a pan of mountains
because<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.220> might<00:00:23.369> have<00:00:23.460> been<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.640> slideshow

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
because it might have been a slideshow

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.630 
because it might have been a slideshow
from<00:00:24.750> like<00:00:24.990> my<00:00:25.380> great-aunts<00:00:26.010> trip<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.519> the

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
Alps or something because it's

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.810 
Alps or something because it's
ridiculous<00:00:28.380> anyway<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:28.980> digress

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
Logitech which is pretty similar to the

g2 30 now we've addressed an issue with

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.720 
g2 30 now we've addressed an issue with
outdoor<00:00:37.290> unboxings<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.160> people<00:00:38.430> have<00:00:38.579> been

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
outdoor unboxings that people have been

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.639 
outdoor unboxings that people have been
complaining<00:00:39.120> about<00:00:39.270> for<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.719> while<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.260> that

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
complaining about for a while and that

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:41.750 
complaining about for a while and that
is<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:40.980> there's<00:00:41.160> nowhere<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.430> put<00:00:41.610> the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
is that there's nowhere to put the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.880

product we have dragged the table
outdoors<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.420> solution<00:00:45.570> that

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
outdoors and that is the solution that

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.100 
outdoors and that is the solution that
we've<00:00:46.770> come<00:00:47.250> up<00:00:47.430> with<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:48.600> headset<00:00:49.050> is

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110

30 so unlike the g2 30 the g4 30 has a

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.460 
30 so unlike the g2 30 the g4 30 has a
blue<00:01:11.729> theme<00:01:12.119> which<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.720> kind<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.049> shaking

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
blue theme which is kind of shaking

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.920 
blue theme which is kind of shaking
things<00:01:13.710> up<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:14.040> little<00:01:14.220> bit<00:01:14.430> because<00:01:14.930> generally

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
things up a little bit because generally

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.370 
things up a little bit because generally
speaking<00:01:16.259> like<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:18.229> like<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
speaking like the the like the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.410 
speaking like the the like the
stereotype<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.610> high<00:01:20.759> performance

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
stereotype is that the high performance

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.890 
stereotype is that the high performance
Extreme<00:01:21.900> Edition<00:01:22.229> one<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.979> going<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.820> be<00:01:23.939> red

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
Extreme Edition one is going to be red

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.929 
Extreme Edition one is going to be red
whereas<00:01:25.650> like<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.130> lower-end<00:01:26.549> one<00:01:26.700> will<00:01:26.820> be

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
whereas like the lower-end one will be

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.300 
whereas like the lower-end one will be
blue<00:01:27.150> but<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.600> case<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.439> g4<00:01:28.890> 30<00:01:29.130> is

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
blue but in this case the g4 30 is

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.830 
blue but in this case the g4 30 is
actually<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.850> more<00:01:29.970> premium<00:01:30.240> headset

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
actually the more premium headset

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.020 
actually the more premium headset
because<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.560> does<00:01:32.159> come<00:01:32.490> with<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.820> USB

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
because it does come with a USB

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.980 
because it does come with a USB
soundcard

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200

surround<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:38.189> software<00:01:39.030> capabilities<00:01:39.930> so

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
surround in software capabilities so

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.380 
surround in software capabilities so
they're<00:01:40.619> using<00:01:40.829> Dolby<00:01:41.250> technology<00:01:41.880> which<00:01:42.119> by

they're using Dolby technology which by

they're using Dolby technology which by

the better solutions out there but in

has a very slow recoil see that that's
really<00:02:05.340> important<00:02:05.820> because<00:02:05.909> what<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.240> does

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
really important because what that does

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.719 
really important because what that does
is<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:06.899> makes<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.229> feel<00:02:07.469> kind<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.860> funny<00:02:08.099> the

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
is it makes it feel kind of funny the

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.249 
is it makes it feel kind of funny the
first<00:02:09.000> time<00:02:09.209> you<00:02:09.360> ever<00:02:09.479> put<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.810> headset<00:02:09.989> on

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
first time you ever put the headset on

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.280 
first time you ever put the headset on
but<00:02:10.979> once<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.459> mushes<00:02:11.849> out<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.030> little<00:02:12.270> bit

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
but once it mushes out a little bit

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.899 
but once it mushes out a little bit
pushes<00:02:13.620> out<00:02:13.769> and<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:14.010> puts<00:02:14.189> much<00:02:14.370> more<00:02:14.610> even

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
pushes out and it puts much more even

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:16.459 
pushes out and it puts much more even
pressure<00:02:15.180> on<00:02:15.360> your<00:02:15.599> head<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:15.780> mean<00:02:15.900> Logitech's

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
on the other hand do use a harder foam

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.520 
on the other hand do use a harder foam
but<00:02:23.879> it's<00:02:24.000> quite<00:02:24.359> deep<00:02:24.689> so<00:02:24.930> what<00:02:25.290> you're<00:02:25.409> going

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
but it's quite deep so what you're going

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.289 
but it's quite deep so what you're going
to<00:02:25.560> discover<00:02:25.709> with<00:02:26.159> headsets<00:02:26.579> like<00:02:26.670> this<00:02:27.060> is

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
to discover with headsets like this is

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.819 
to discover with headsets like this is
that<00:02:27.450> they<00:02:27.540> might<00:02:27.750> not<00:02:27.900> be<00:02:27.959> instantly<00:02:28.650> the

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
that they might not be instantly the

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.199 
that they might not be instantly the
most<00:02:29.010> comfortable<00:02:29.430> thing<00:02:29.670> you've<00:02:29.790> ever<00:02:29.909> heard

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
most comfortable thing you've ever heard

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.360 
most comfortable thing you've ever heard
but<00:02:30.870> they<00:02:31.049> will<00:02:31.230> definitely<00:02:31.409> improve<00:02:32.040> over

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
but they will definitely improve over

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.339 
but they will definitely improve over
time<00:02:32.400> as<00:02:32.849> they<00:02:33.060> mold<00:02:33.299> to<00:02:33.480> your<00:02:33.510> head<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:33.959> these

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
time as they mold to your head and these

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:35.750 
time as they mold to your head and these
aren't<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.650> kinds<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.069> things<00:02:35.280> that<00:02:35.489> I<00:02:35.519> would

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
aren't the kinds of things that I would

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.759 
aren't the kinds of things that I would
lend<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.209> someone<00:02:36.540> else<00:02:36.720> because<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.530> don't

as well as their 350 SES it's a very

as well as their 350 SES it's a very

elegant way to deal with it so there
that<00:05:14.470> there's<00:05:14.770> a<00:05:14.830> tip<00:05:15.099> that<00:05:15.340> I<00:05:15.370> wish<00:05:15.610> everyone

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910

that there's a tip that I wish everyone
would<00:05:16.150> get<00:05:16.330> from<00:05:16.690> from<00:05:17.110> what<00:05:17.289> Sennheiser's

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
would get from from what Sennheiser's

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.499 
would get from from what Sennheiser's
done<00:05:17.949> over<00:05:18.190> there<00:05:18.310> the<00:05:18.789> microphone<00:05:19.300> because

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:19.509 
done over there the microphone because

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:21.149 
done over there the microphone because
it's<00:05:19.840> a<00:05:19.930> boom<00:05:20.139> mic<00:05:20.349> and<00:05:20.560> not<00:05:20.680> a<00:05:20.710> retractable

00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:21.159 
it's a boom mic and not a retractable

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:23.399 
it's a boom mic and not a retractable
mic<00:05:21.430> isn't<00:05:21.880> that<00:05:22.270> adjustable<00:05:22.930> in<00:05:23.020> terms<00:05:23.229> of

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:23.409 
mic isn't that adjustable in terms of

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:25.649 
mic isn't that adjustable in terms of
positioning<00:05:23.979> but<00:05:24.580> it<00:05:24.729> is<00:05:24.849> noise<00:05:25.090> cancelling

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:25.659 
positioning but it is noise cancelling

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:28.200 
positioning but it is noise cancelling
and<00:05:26.020> you<00:05:26.500> can<00:05:26.680> kind<00:05:26.949> of<00:05:27.039> go<00:05:27.340> up<00:05:27.370> and<00:05:27.669> down<00:05:27.849> like

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
and you can kind of go up and down like

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.480 
and you can kind of go up and down like
this<00:05:28.449> and<00:05:28.720> it<00:05:29.139> does<00:05:29.289> have<00:05:29.500> some<00:05:29.530> bendiness<00:05:30.250> to

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
this and it does have some bendiness to

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:31.830 
this and it does have some bendiness to
it<00:05:30.580> as<00:05:30.669> well<00:05:30.849> so<00:05:30.880> you<00:05:31.090> guys<00:05:31.240> can<00:05:31.449> see<00:05:31.659> hopefully

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
it as well so you guys can see hopefully

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.950 
it as well so you guys can see hopefully
from<00:05:32.199> that<00:05:32.349> angle<00:05:32.560> that<00:05:33.220> it<00:05:33.430> can<00:05:33.610> I<00:05:34.389> find<00:05:34.840> the

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
from that angle that it can I find the

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.629 
from that angle that it can I find the
easiest<00:05:35.229> way<00:05:35.380> it's<00:05:35.500> like<00:05:35.560> Oh<00:05:35.710> put<00:05:36.310> it<00:05:36.400> right<00:05:36.490> in

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 
easiest way it's like Oh put it right in

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:38.339 
easiest way it's like Oh put it right in
my<00:05:36.669> mouth<00:05:36.880> and<00:05:37.120> then<00:05:37.180> it'll<00:05:37.509> kind<00:05:37.810> of<00:05:37.870> end<00:05:38.139> up

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:38.349 
my mouth and then it'll kind of end up

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:39.570 
my mouth and then it'll kind of end up
in<00:05:38.500> about<00:05:38.710> the<00:05:38.830> right<00:05:38.949> place<00:05:39.159> you<00:05:39.280> want<00:05:39.430> to<00:05:39.490> at

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
in about the right place you want to at

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.550 
in about the right place you want to at
the<00:05:39.669> corner<00:05:40.030> of<00:05:40.120> your<00:05:40.210> mouth<00:05:40.330> for<00:05:40.990> optimal

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
listening for the other people so I'm

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.120 
listening for the other people so I'm
going<00:05:43.509> to<00:05:43.570> see<00:05:43.690> if<00:05:43.780> I<00:05:43.900> haven't<00:05:44.500> even<00:05:44.560> looked<00:05:44.889> at

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
this is something that probably would

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
have been good to mention and I think

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.969 
have been good to mention and I think
that<00:06:10.300> is<00:06:10.690> pretty<00:06:11.440> much<00:06:11.680> it

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:11.979 
that is pretty much it

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
lake lay flat ear cups okay this is

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.770 
lake lay flat ear cups okay this is
something<00:06:14.830> so<00:06:15.310> there<00:06:15.340> you<00:06:15.520> go<00:06:15.639> lays<00:06:15.880> flat<00:06:16.120> this

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780
