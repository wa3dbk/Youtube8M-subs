00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.510 
doesn't work for him in his thunderous
again<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.689> I've<00:01:28.110> kind<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.650> felt<00:01:28.799> like<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.250> I

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
again so I've kind of felt like that I

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.460 
again so I've kind of felt like that I
should<00:01:30.329> keep<00:01:30.479> trucking<00:01:30.869> around<00:01:31.140> for<00:01:31.290> later

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
should keep trucking around for later

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.289 
should keep trucking around for later
because<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:31.979> apart<00:01:32.369> II<00:01:32.549> with<00:01:32.670> him<00:01:32.820> it's<00:01:33.030> quick

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
because I apart II with him it's quick

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.510 
because I apart II with him it's quick
attack<00:01:33.600> granted<00:01:34.380> but<00:01:34.409> it's<00:01:34.799> still<00:01:35.009> priority

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
attack granted but it's still priority

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.020 
attack granted but it's still priority
so<00:01:37.040> instead<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.100> going<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.400> my<00:01:38.460> drogyn<00:01:38.939> my

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
so instead of going in my drogyn my

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.270 
so instead of going in my drogyn my
specially<00:01:39.450> defensive<00:01:39.840> wall<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:41.040> take<00:01:41.250> a

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
thunderbolt pretty nicely which is

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.690 
thunderbolt pretty nicely which is
actually<00:01:43.020> pretty<00:01:43.200> good<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:43.890> after<00:01:44.399> all<00:01:44.579> that

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700

anyways keep in mind I just I didn't
even<00:02:14.330> realize<00:02:14.660> this<00:02:15.020> feel<00:02:15.230> like<00:02:15.440> it<00:02:15.560> happened

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
even realize this feel like it happened

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.800 
even realize this feel like it happened
because<00:02:16.670> I<00:02:16.880> keep<00:02:17.060> forgetting<00:02:17.450> for<00:02:17.570> whatever

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
because I keep forgetting for whatever

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.190 
because I keep forgetting for whatever
reason<00:02:18.370> but<00:02:19.370> yeah<00:02:19.910> I<00:02:20.270> take<00:02:20.510> super<00:02:20.900> effective

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
reason but yeah I take super effective

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.160 
reason but yeah I take super effective
damage<00:02:21.530> because<00:02:21.830> steel<00:02:22.130> not<00:02:22.750> just<00:02:23.750> dark

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
damage because steel not just dark

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.320 
damage because steel not just dark
anymore<00:02:24.410> so<00:02:24.820> generally<00:02:25.820> think<00:02:26.000> about<00:02:26.210> that

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.000 
that I mean I guess it could bring in
volcarona<00:04:31.390> but<00:04:32.230> they<00:04:32.320> could<00:04:32.560> just<00:04:32.590> go<00:04:32.800> for<00:04:32.920> a

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
volcarona but they could just go for a

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.710 
volcarona but they could just go for a
thunderbolt<00:04:33.400> and<00:04:33.490> just<00:04:33.640> hit<00:04:33.790> me<00:04:33.910> pretty<00:04:34.480> hard

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
pretty much the same exact thing that

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.130 
pretty much the same exact thing that

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
happened when I was facing that greninja

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.960 
happened when I was facing that greninja
not<00:05:14.500> too<00:05:14.710> long<00:05:14.890> ago<00:05:14.950> in<00:05:15.340> a<00:05:15.400> different<00:05:15.700> battle

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
not too long ago in a different battle

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.140 
not too long ago in a different battle
but<00:05:16.840> it's<00:05:17.230> much<00:05:18.160> better<00:05:18.520> looking<00:05:18.760> for<00:05:19.060> me

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
but it's much better looking for me

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.310 
but it's much better looking for me
right<00:05:19.180> now<00:05:19.390> because<00:05:19.750> I<00:05:19.870> have<00:05:19.930> two<00:05:20.140> more

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
right now because I have two more

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.770 
right now because I have two more
pokemon<00:05:20.770> as<00:05:20.980> he<00:05:21.100> does<00:05:21.280> too<00:05:21.520> but<00:05:21.730> you<00:05:22.450> only<00:05:22.570> do

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
pokemon as he does too but you only do

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.270 
pokemon as he does too but you only do
too<00:05:22.930> much<00:05:23.050> to<00:05:23.260> volcarona<00:05:23.560> which<00:05:23.920> is<00:05:24.040> really

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
too much to volcarona which is really

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.510 
too much to volcarona which is really
nice<00:05:24.460> so<00:05:25.300> uh<00:05:25.780> what's<00:05:26.350> gonna<00:05:26.440> happen<00:05:26.830> is<00:05:27.070> that

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
nice so uh what's gonna happen is that

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.420 
nice so uh what's gonna happen is that
uh<00:05:27.880> I<00:05:28.810> guess<00:05:29.260> it's<00:05:29.440> kind<00:05:29.620> of<00:05:29.650> a<00:05:29.740> problem<00:05:29.950> he<00:05:30.310> is

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
uh I guess it's kind of a problem he is

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.980 
uh I guess it's kind of a problem he is
flame<00:05:30.730> body<00:05:31.000> so<00:05:31.270> if<00:05:31.390> I<00:05:31.480> end<00:05:31.630> up<00:05:31.660> losing<00:05:31.930> my

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
flame body so if I end up losing my

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.980 
flame body so if I end up losing my
volcarona<00:05:32.670> well<00:05:33.670> if<00:05:33.910> I<00:05:34.060> do<00:05:34.120> I<00:05:34.540> better<00:05:34.840> have

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
volcarona well if I do I better have

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.600
