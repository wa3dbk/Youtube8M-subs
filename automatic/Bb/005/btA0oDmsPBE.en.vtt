so<00:00:01.949> today<00:00:02.280> we<00:00:02.460> have<00:00:03.410> c7<00:00:04.410> lights

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:05.810 
so today we have c7 lights

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.930 
so today we have c7 lights
versus<00:00:07.160> led<00:00:08.160> c7<00:00:08.610> lights<00:00:09.800> these<00:00:10.800> are<00:00:10.860> GE<00:00:11.250> the

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.930 
takes a hundred a hundred and seventeen
watts<00:00:42.140> with<00:00:43.140> 4<00:00:43.559> watt<00:00:43.770> bulbs<00:00:44.129> in<00:00:44.280> each<00:00:44.399> strand

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
watts with 4 watt bulbs in each strand

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.139 
watts with 4 watt bulbs in each strand
25<00:00:45.629> lights<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.710> whole<00:00:46.950> strand<00:00:47.809> 50<00:00:48.809> bulbs<00:00:50.149> 25

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
25 lights this whole strand 50 bulbs 25

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.860 
25 lights this whole strand 50 bulbs 25
foot<00:00:51.420> lighted<00:00:51.930> length<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:53.149> this<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.270> about<00:00:54.480> 25

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
foot lighted length and this is about 25

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.139 
foot lighted length and this is about 25
lighted<00:00:55.559> lengths<00:00:55.739> also<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.640> this<00:00:56.760> gives<00:00:57.030> you

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
lighted lengths also so this gives you

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.540 
lighted lengths also so this gives you
double<00:00:57.360> amount<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.079> bulbs<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.010> lights<00:00:59.219> and

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
double amount the bulbs and lights and

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.880 
double amount the bulbs and lights and
this<00:00:59.910> whole<00:01:00.090> strand<00:01:00.449> only<00:01:00.750> uses<00:01:01.050> 3<00:01:01.410> watts

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
this whole strand only uses 3 watts

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.450 
this whole strand only uses 3 watts
now<00:01:02.930> along<00:01:03.930> with<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.589> has<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.129> really

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
now along with that it has this really

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.940 
now along with that it has this really
nice<00:01:05.700> heavy<00:01:06.000> plastic<00:01:06.540> coating<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.830> know

I<00:02:18.740> got<00:02:19.190> four<00:02:19.460> strand<00:02:19.760> of<00:02:19.880> these<00:02:20.000> this<00:02:20.990> box

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
I got four strand of these this box

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.750 
I got four strand of these this box
you're<00:02:21.590> going<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.740> pay<00:02:21.890> only<00:02:22.040> six<00:02:22.370> or<00:02:22.520> seven

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
you're going to pay only six or seven

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.540 
you're going to pay only six or seven
dollars<00:02:22.850> for<00:02:23.060> we<00:02:23.960> got<00:02:24.110> these<00:02:24.260> $4<00:02:24.740> also<00:02:25.400> on

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
dollars for we got these $4 also on

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.140 
dollars for we got these $4 also on
clearance

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
clearance

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.410 
clearance
so<00:02:26.690> but<00:02:27.200> compared<00:02:27.770> to<00:02:27.830> energy<00:02:28.220> costs<00:02:28.700> this

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
so but compared to energy costs this

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.500 
so but compared to energy costs this
whole<00:02:29.660> strand<00:02:30.050> uses<00:02:31.040> a<00:02:31.070> hundred<00:02:31.460> close<00:02:31.940> to<00:02:32.090> 120

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
whole strand uses a hundred close to 120

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.590 
whole strand uses a hundred close to 120
watts<00:02:32.870> that's<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.740> lot<00:02:33.950> it<00:02:34.520> really<00:02:34.610> is<00:02:35.000> and<00:02:35.270> keep

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
watts that's a lot it really is and keep

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.050 
watts that's a lot it really is and keep
in<00:02:35.720> mind<00:02:35.900> it's<00:02:36.110> only<00:02:36.170> 25<00:02:36.710> feet<00:02:37.010> you<00:02:37.490> do<00:02:37.640> a<00:02:37.670> tree

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
in mind it's only 25 feet you do a tree

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.180 
in mind it's only 25 feet you do a tree
with<00:02:38.780> them<00:02:38.960> or<00:02:39.200> decorate<00:02:39.770> the<00:02:39.890> fun<00:02:40.040> of<00:02:40.100> your

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
with them or decorate the fun of your

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.100 
with them or decorate the fun of your
house<00:02:40.340> you're<00:02:41.060> using<00:02:41.360> a<00:02:41.510> whole<00:02:41.690> entire

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
house you're using a whole entire

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.540 
house you're using a whole entire
circuit<00:02:42.650> and<00:02:42.830> you're<00:02:43.010> probably<00:02:43.130> going<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.490> hit

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
circuit and you're probably going to hit

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.830 
circuit and you're probably going to hit
1500<00:02:44.330> watts

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
1500 watts

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.900 
1500 watts
you<00:02:45.320> also<00:02:45.560> can't<00:02:46.070> connect<00:02:46.460> that<00:02:46.670> many

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
you also can't connect that many

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.490 
you also can't connect that many
end-to-end<00:02:47.390> I<00:02:47.600> believe<00:02:47.900> it's<00:02:48.020> only<00:02:48.110> like<00:02:48.320> two

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
end-to-end I believe it's only like two

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.670 
end-to-end I believe it's only like two
or<00:02:48.620> three<00:02:48.650> strands<00:02:49.300> these<00:02:50.300> only<00:02:51.230> use<00:02:51.380> three

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
or three strands these only use three

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.950 
or three strands these only use three
watts<00:02:51.860> of<00:02:52.070> strand<00:02:52.340> you<00:02:53.000> can<00:02:53.030> decorate<00:02:53.570> a<00:02:53.870> tree

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
watts of strand you can decorate a tree

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.960 
watts of strand you can decorate a tree
and<00:02:54.530> you<00:02:54.980> can<00:02:55.010> probably<00:02:55.280> do<00:02:55.460> your<00:02:55.580> whole<00:02:55.760> yard

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
and you can probably do your whole yard

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.510 
and you can probably do your whole yard
and<00:02:56.180> LEDs<00:02:56.570> and<00:02:56.750> one<00:02:56.900> in<00:02:57.170> use<00:02:57.500> one<00:02:57.830> 15<00:02:58.340> amp

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
and LEDs and one in use one 15 amp

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.760 
and LEDs and one in use one 15 amp
circuit<00:02:59.470> these<00:03:00.470> I<00:03:00.980> believe<00:03:01.610> a<00:03:01.720> maximum<00:03:02.720> of<00:03:02.870> 216

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
circuit these I believe a maximum of 216

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.820 
circuit these I believe a maximum of 216
watts<00:03:04.010> at<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:04.970> end<00:03:05.170> so<00:03:06.170> you<00:03:06.230> could<00:03:06.620> probably

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
watts at the end so you could probably

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.770 
watts at the end so you could probably
put<00:03:07.160> I'm<00:03:07.940> going<00:03:08.090> to<00:03:08.150> say<00:03:08.300> maybe<00:03:08.510> like<00:03:08.630> a

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
put I'm going to say maybe like a

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.420 
put I'm going to say maybe like a
hundred<00:03:09.170> and<00:03:09.290> hundred<00:03:09.560> 50<00:03:09.860> strands<00:03:10.190> together

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
hundred and hundred 50 strands together

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.260 
hundred and hundred 50 strands together
on<00:03:10.820> these<00:03:11.170> lots<00:03:12.170> and<00:03:12.410> lots<00:03:12.560> of<00:03:12.710> strands<00:03:13.270> but

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
on these lots and lots of strands but

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.030 
on these lots and lots of strands but
between<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:14.870> two<00:03:15.080> if<00:03:15.320> you're<00:03:15.860> definitely

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
between the two if you're definitely

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.360 
between the two if you're definitely
going<00:03:16.340> to<00:03:16.400> buy<00:03:16.520> lights<00:03:16.820> nowadays<00:03:17.590> yeah<00:03:18.590> go

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
going to buy lights nowadays yeah go

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.850 
going to buy lights nowadays yeah go
with<00:03:19.489> a<00:03:19.550> go<00:03:20.120> with<00:03:20.239> the<00:03:20.330> LEDs<00:03:20.780> if<00:03:21.080> you're<00:03:21.680> buying

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
with a go with the LEDs if you're buying

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.520 
with a go with the LEDs if you're buying
regular<00:03:22.400> Christmas<00:03:22.640> lights<00:03:23.200> such<00:03:24.200> as<00:03:24.350> these

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
regular Christmas lights such as these

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.729 
regular Christmas lights such as these
the<00:03:24.560> minis<00:03:25.100> I<00:03:26.000> have<00:03:26.780> to<00:03:26.900> say<00:03:27.080> unfortunately

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
the minis I have to say unfortunately

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.229 
the minis I have to say unfortunately
just<00:03:28.370> go<00:03:28.489> with<00:03:28.640> the<00:03:28.730> regular<00:03:29.000> incandescent

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
just go with the regular incandescent

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.470 
just go with the regular incandescent
because<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.050> LEDs<00:03:30.440> don't<00:03:30.950> seem<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.310> last<00:03:31.489> even

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
because the LEDs don't seem to last even

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.260 
because the LEDs don't seem to last even
if<00:03:32.720> they<00:03:32.840> do<00:03:32.900> last<00:03:33.260> you<00:03:33.620> know<00:03:33.739> if<00:03:34.640> one<00:03:34.940> strand

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
if they do last you know if one strand

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.180 
if they do last you know if one strand
breaks<00:03:35.540> or<00:03:35.840> gets<00:03:36.080> ripped<00:03:36.410> apart<00:03:36.620> or<00:03:36.980> tit

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
breaks or gets ripped apart or tit

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.490 
breaks or gets ripped apart or tit
tugged<00:03:37.580> on<00:03:37.730> or<00:03:38.090> chewed<00:03:38.390> on<00:03:38.540> by<00:03:38.989> an<00:03:39.170> animal

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
tugged on or chewed on by an animal

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.970 
tugged on or chewed on by an animal
you're<00:03:40.370> out<00:03:40.550> your<00:03:40.790> whole<00:03:41.330> entire<00:03:41.980> profit

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
you're out your whole entire profit

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.060 
you're out your whole entire profit
already<00:03:43.340> so<00:03:43.930> but<00:03:44.930> there<00:03:45.110> you<00:03:45.200> go

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
already so but there you go

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.040 
already so but there you go
and<00:03:46.760> I<00:03:46.820> tried<00:03:47.030> to<00:03:47.120> make<00:03:47.209> this<00:03:47.360> video<00:03:47.630> as<00:03:47.780> short

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
and I tried to make this video as short

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.170 
and I tried to make this video as short
as<00:03:48.140> possible<00:03:48.190> keeping<00:03:49.190> it<00:03:49.280> under<00:03:49.400> 4<00:03:49.730> minutes

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
as possible keeping it under 4 minutes

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.070 
as possible keeping it under 4 minutes
there's<00:03:50.720> your<00:03:50.989> comparison<00:03:51.410> and<00:03:51.709> there<00:03:52.550> you<00:03:52.640> go

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
there's your comparison and there you go

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.690 
there's your comparison and there you go
