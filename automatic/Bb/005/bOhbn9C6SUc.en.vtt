00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
the time like maybe every other week

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.730 
the time like maybe every other week
because<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:16.710> can<00:00:17.490> be<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.789> little<00:00:18.029> bit

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
because it can be a little bit

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.870 
because it can be a little bit
irritating<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.890> your<00:00:20.039> skin<00:00:20.310> if<00:00:20.430> you<00:00:20.550> use<00:00:20.699> it

too much or in high in high

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.540 
too much or in high in high
concentrations<00:00:24.660> or<00:00:24.810> large<00:00:25.080> amounts<00:00:25.560> so<00:00:25.800> kind

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
concentrations or large amounts so kind

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.950 
concentrations or large amounts so kind
of<00:00:26.609> take<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.880> easy<00:00:26.970> since<00:00:27.359> they're<00:00:27.630> like<00:00:27.810> the

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
of take it easy since they're like the
