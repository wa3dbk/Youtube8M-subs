the pinky ring middle and index you can

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.380 
the pinky ring middle and index you can
sweep<00:01:10.890> them<00:01:12.920> once<00:01:13.920> we<00:01:14.130> play<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.700> major<00:01:14.939> 7th

sweep them once we play that major 7th

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.679 
sweep them once we play that major 7th
we<00:01:15.570> can<00:01:15.750> add<00:01:16.049> an<00:01:16.439> extra<00:01:17.220> note<00:01:17.549> by<00:01:17.939> skipping<00:01:18.270> the

we can add an extra note by skipping the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.830 
we can add an extra note by skipping the
root<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.380> going<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.280> 9th<00:01:20.850> or<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.420> second
