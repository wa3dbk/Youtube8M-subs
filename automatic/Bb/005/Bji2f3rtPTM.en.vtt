00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.849
 I want to introduce you to the front suspension 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:15.389
 Michal was said to have done this for his 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:16.550
 mix, I repeated the spring here rollers 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.609
 burana 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.670
 but its rigidity was not enough by the way 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.310
 I had to put you know this spring 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:33.059
 suspension travel has become as big as 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:36.420
 I would like a suspension work is not very 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:41.629
 Strong spring stiffness can be changed 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:46.110
 but this is all the complexity of skiing hunting 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:48.539
 Ordinary, I such a podvesochka 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:53.539
 then redistribution for another did 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:56.600
 suspension with two spring price springs 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:59.879
 on the market about 70 rubles 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.910
 Kohl bes so two springs total 100 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:08.240
 rubles on the suspension principle is exactly the same 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.930
 same two springs from buran from carts 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.110
 you can pull 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:18.560
 adjusts stiffness increasing tightness 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.560
 springs move such a suspension 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:29.920
 decent but I didn't have a stop 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:32.890
 what to make such spring stops 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.680
 do not tie a knot and so here it is 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.390
 works charm which 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.570
 suggested metal said everything 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.540
 is that you are not a toe 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.910
 never goes down springs and always 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:02:02.860
 supports up position here 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:02:05.800
 I will show you my example 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:10.840
 always in this position the toe 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:14.880
 she doesn't go down here on the top 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.000
 position so it is very very comfortable 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.430
 here 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.430
 as I usually have a threaded sleeve 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:29.380
 can be adjusted higher lower 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:33.970
 you're at the expense of cutting such a sanwa 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:36.480
 such a suspension is very convenient economically 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.480
 profitable 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:48.510
 so here you are for easy 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:54.020
 snowmobile can be repeated 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.020
 easy and simple thanks
