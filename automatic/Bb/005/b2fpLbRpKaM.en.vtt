this is Adam L Humphries and I thought I

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.820 
this is Adam L Humphries and I thought I

was cleaning a little spot here on my

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.740 
was cleaning a little spot here on my

on<00:00:09.929> this<00:00:10.080> new<00:00:10.320> shelf<00:00:10.800> I<00:00:11.130> was<00:00:12.000> rubbing<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:12.570> I

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
on this new shelf I was rubbing it I

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.379 
on this new shelf I was rubbing it I
kind<00:00:13.110> of<00:00:13.170> found<00:00:13.469> by<00:00:14.219> accident<00:00:14.400> this<00:00:14.910> special

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
kind of found by accident this special

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.840 
kind of found by accident this special
looking<00:00:15.719> menu<00:00:16.350> looked<00:00:16.680> like<00:00:17.130> it<00:00:17.279> looked<00:00:17.490> like

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
looking menu looked like it looked like

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.050 
looking menu looked like it looked like
a<00:00:18.150> service<00:00:18.960> menu<00:00:19.670> then<00:00:20.670> you'd<00:00:20.850> normally

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
a service menu then you'd normally

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.720 
a service menu then you'd normally
probably<00:00:21.449> discover<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.170> service<00:00:22.800> manual<00:00:23.130> which

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
probably discover a service manual which

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.300 
probably discover a service manual which
people<00:00:24.119> usually<00:00:24.390> don't<00:00:24.720> have<00:00:24.960> access<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.529> and

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
people usually don't have access to and

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.450 
people usually don't have access to and
I<00:00:27.000> finally<00:00:27.449> figured<00:00:27.750> out<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.310> combination<00:00:29.310> if

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
I finally figured out the combination if

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.600 
I finally figured out the combination if
you<00:00:30.210> simply<00:00:30.599> run<00:00:31.500> your<00:00:31.679> thumb<00:00:31.710> across<00:00:32.160> the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
you simply run your thumb across the

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.630 
you simply run your thumb across the
bottom<00:00:33.180> -<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:34.050> all<00:00:34.290> three<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.710> them<00:00:34.890> then<00:00:35.460> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
bottom - and all three of them then the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.420

bottom<00:00:35.910> two<00:00:36.090> again<00:00:37.160> yeah

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430
