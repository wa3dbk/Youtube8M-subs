overall I guess Hall of players that I
had<00:00:41.910> received<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.540> didn't<00:00:42.840> go<00:00:42.930> fullscreen

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
had received and I didn't go fullscreen

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.600 
had received and I didn't go fullscreen
here<00:00:43.620> because<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:43.920> couldn't<00:00:44.190> open<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.460> pack

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
here because I couldn't open the pack

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.799 
here because I couldn't open the pack
originally<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.120> fullscreen<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.570> then<00:00:45.750> I

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
originally in fullscreen and then I

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.240 
originally in fullscreen and then I
forgot<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.320> change<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.590> ever<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:46.950> we<00:00:47.070> will

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
forgot to change it ever but we will

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.459 
forgot to change it ever but we will
eventually<00:00:47.600> switch<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.750> full<00:00:48.899> screen<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.379> you

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
eventually switch to full screen so you

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.229 
eventually switch to full screen so you
can<00:00:49.500> see<00:00:49.620> what<00:00:49.920> that's<00:00:50.039> all<00:00:50.370> about<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.000> went

that I think I've picked him up just to

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.550

paid 750 coins for not a big deal I

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.800 
paid 750 coins for not a big deal I
think<00:04:54.580> the<00:04:54.820> Belgian<00:04:55.120> Pro<00:04:55.270> League<00:04:55.300> Silver's

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
think the Belgian Pro League Silver's

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.750 
think the Belgian Pro League Silver's
are<00:04:55.960> quite<00:04:56.169> good<00:04:56.350> and<00:04:56.590> that<00:04:57.040> could<00:04:57.280> be<00:04:57.430> a<00:04:57.460> team

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
are quite good and that could be a team

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.550 
are quite good and that could be a team
that<00:04:57.940> I<00:04:57.970> might<00:04:58.240> like<00:04:58.450> to<00:04:58.479> play<00:04:58.780> with<00:04:58.990> but<00:04:59.410> the

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
that I might like to play with but the

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.409 
that I might like to play with but the
cards<00:04:59.830> are<00:04:59.950> gonna<00:05:00.040> undoubtably<00:05:01.000> go<00:05:01.270> up

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
cards are gonna undoubtably go up

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.540 
cards are gonna undoubtably go up
because<00:05:01.720> someone<00:05:02.169> will<00:05:02.470> want<00:05:02.800> to<00:05:02.919> play<00:05:03.220> with

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
because someone will want to play with

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.159 
because someone will want to play with
these<00:05:03.790> Silver's<00:05:04.389> and<00:05:04.419> so<00:05:04.750> I'm<00:05:04.900> pretty

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
these Silver's and so I'm pretty

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.710 
these Silver's and so I'm pretty
confident<00:05:05.950> in<00:05:06.130> my<00:05:06.160> I<00:05:06.580> guess<00:05:07.090> I<00:05:07.210> would<00:05:07.360> call<00:05:07.570> it

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
confident in my I guess I would call it

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.190 
confident in my I guess I would call it
silver<00:05:08.139> investing<00:05:09.120> now<00:05:10.120> investing<00:05:10.780> is<00:05:10.900> one<00:05:11.080> of

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
silver investing now investing is one of

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.540 
silver investing now investing is one of
the<00:05:11.260> cool<00:05:11.440> things<00:05:11.680> that<00:05:11.800> I've<00:05:12.010> been<00:05:12.190> meaning

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
the cool things that I've been meaning

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.950 
the cool things that I've been meaning
to<00:05:12.580> talk<00:05:12.850> about<00:05:13.060> because<00:05:13.479> of<00:05:13.600> how<00:05:13.690> difficult

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
to talk about because of how difficult

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.159 
to talk about because of how difficult
trading<00:05:14.590> is<00:05:14.710> if<00:05:14.860> you<00:05:15.340> get<00:05:15.580> a<00:05:15.610> fantastic<00:05:16.169> deal

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
trading is if you get a fantastic deal

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:19.860 
trading is if you get a fantastic deal

on a player this year more than any
other<00:05:20.229> year<00:05:20.530> it<00:05:20.770> is<00:05:20.800> probably<00:05:21.580> worth<00:05:21.880> it<00:05:22.150> to

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
other year it is probably worth it to

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.450 
other year it is probably worth it to
maybe<00:05:22.630> just<00:05:23.020> hold<00:05:23.260> on<00:05:23.590> to<00:05:23.800> that<00:05:23.889> guy<00:05:24.130> rather

overhyped I talked about Lucas Piazon

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.510 
overhyped I talked about Lucas Piazon
yesterday<00:05:43.870> he<00:05:44.380> might<00:05:44.590> be<00:05:44.740> a<00:05:44.770> solid<00:05:45.220> one<00:05:45.370> and

yesterday he might be a solid one and

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.430 
yesterday he might be a solid one and
that's<00:05:46.060> largely<00:05:46.330> because<00:05:46.539> of<00:05:46.990> he's<00:05:47.200> got<00:05:47.410> a

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
that's largely because of he's got a

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.560 
that's largely because of he's got a
very<00:05:47.740> high<00:05:47.950> name<00:05:48.220> value<00:05:48.460> he's<00:05:48.760> also<00:05:49.030> a<00:05:49.270> Bruce

very high name value he's also a Bruce
silver<00:05:49.930> and<00:05:50.889> so<00:05:51.160> he<00:05:51.310> could<00:05:51.490> be<00:05:51.610> good<00:05:51.789> we<00:05:51.940> picked

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
silver and so he could be good we picked

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.750 
silver and so he could be good we picked
up<00:05:52.389> another<00:05:53.289> troop<00:05:53.650> of<00:05:53.800> mo<00:05:53.950> tang<00:05:54.190> right<00:05:54.490> here
