what<00:03:13.380> can<00:03:13.500> be<00:03:13.560> made<00:03:13.739> out<00:03:13.769> of<00:03:13.950> this<00:03:14.130> week<00:03:14.370> is

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
what can be made out of this week is

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.210 
what can be made out of this week is
that<00:03:14.970> it<00:03:15.120> was<00:03:15.299> a<00:03:15.329> tale<00:03:15.660> of<00:03:15.959> two<00:03:16.260> parts<00:03:17.040> the

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
that it was a tale of two parts the

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.059 
that it was a tale of two parts the
first<00:03:17.790> half<00:03:18.209> was<00:03:18.510> very<00:03:18.870> pitching<00:03:19.109> oriented<00:03:19.950> a

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
first half was very pitching oriented a

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.000 
first half was very pitching oriented a
lot<00:03:20.579> of<00:03:20.760> shutdown<00:03:21.299> pitching<00:03:21.810> by<00:03:22.230> one<00:03:22.680> side

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
lot of shutdown pitching by one side

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.340 
lot of shutdown pitching by one side
then<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.000> second<00:03:24.450> half<00:03:24.630> was<00:03:24.900> a<00:03:25.109> lot<00:03:25.319> of

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
then the second half was a lot of

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.740 
then the second half was a lot of
slugfest<00:03:25.819> so<00:03:26.819> what<00:03:27.180> does<00:03:27.239> that<00:03:27.299> say<00:03:27.720> about

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
slugfest so what does that say about

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.160 
slugfest so what does that say about
week<00:03:28.590> two<00:03:28.920> coming<00:03:29.340> up<00:03:29.489> I<00:03:29.670> think<00:03:30.540> it's<00:03:30.720> going<00:03:31.049> to

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
week two coming up I think it's going to
