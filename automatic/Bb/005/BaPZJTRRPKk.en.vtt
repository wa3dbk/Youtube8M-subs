00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
upper 20s so on my base layers I've got

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.200 
upper 20s so on my base layers I've got
the<00:00:51.170> Marino<00:00:51.850> bottoms<00:00:52.850> in<00:00:53.060> a<00:00:53.150> zip<00:00:53.390> T<00:00:53.600> top<00:00:55.210> good

for keeping the odor down the natural
odor<00:00:58.850> resistor<00:00:59.450> and<00:00:59.630> it's<00:00:59.810> also<00:01:00.020> a<00:01:00.230> great

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
odor resistor and it's also a great

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.580 
odor resistor and it's also a great
insulator<00:01:01.160> to<00:01:01.370> keep<00:01:01.520> your<00:01:01.670> body<00:01:01.880> warm<00:01:02.590> mid

the tops got the extended sleeves with
the<00:01:11.420> thumb<00:01:11.659> loops<00:01:11.930> so<00:01:12.710> you<00:01:12.799> can<00:01:12.979> keep<00:01:13.189> that

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
the thumb loops so you can keep that

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.670 
the thumb loops so you can keep that
heat<00:01:13.970> trapped<00:01:14.509> inside<00:01:14.689> at<00:01:15.079> the<00:01:15.170> sleeves<00:01:15.470> it

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
heat trapped inside at the sleeves it

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.489 
heat trapped inside at the sleeves it
doesn't<00:01:15.979> exit<00:01:16.220> out<00:01:16.369> and<00:01:16.909> other<00:01:17.570> zip<00:01:17.780> tees<00:01:18.049> zips
