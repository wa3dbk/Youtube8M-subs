00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.350
 You do not land, 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.040
 Fortunately, in a short period of time bleeding seems to have been removed cleanly 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:20.850
 Because 103 I'll always try 4 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.850
 It's done well again. 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.640
 Our patient's operation time how chopping over 30 minutes not 40 minutes a Friend 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.640
 U 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.780
 Ah 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:45.770
 Uh intact until relatively easy skill ago when the now well-controlled bath only 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:51.730
 I thought I could go back now. 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.730
 Beautiful group who took the last chance to escape the blindness of the crisis 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:01:01.150
 These meals do you go up a little bout 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:02.560
 If you have a cough or a hobby or a run, it's not good. 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:07.060
 Then, 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:11.740
 Do not step on your nose and pull your nose tight. 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:17.680
 However, the meal prices are in Modena 4 Stay a little bit boring expectations fell 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:20.250
 I think it's going to be a good start. 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.250
 Well 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:27.460
 Now, if I can just line up with diabetes, I'll be able to regain my sight. 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:40.539
 Within a day of receiving the surgery 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.539
 I changed the world of Lee Young-gyu. I got to eat alone without my wife's support. 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:47.219
 we 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:55.450
 Yesterday, the face of the patient whose blindness had settled in fear 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:02:00.490
 Today, now that is not full of laughter which must now 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:04.480
 But it does not hurt a lot and it is often a little washable. 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:07.750
 Known issues: Resolved Known issues: Resolved aspirin yiraseo minutes and then need to get into some layers digit 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:13.540
 But I say outside and it 's okay . 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:18.700
 I still can see the world again. 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:23.080
 Gidaeban sympathies balyida fear waiting for the answer of the leading yunyoung 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:27.820
 The honor is that the government is now trying to get out. 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:31.450
 There seems to be a bit of gas to eradicate domestic water, but my mouth will gradually disappear. 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:36.250
 It's very nice because it looks good in the center . 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:42.220
 Would lead've paid professor who stuffs such as glasses, for example, send 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:45.100
 U 2 4 I 'll look pretty right now. Well, a little more focus once. 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.020
 If you look at the work, you 'll see wrinkles. 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.490
 Yoon Jung Hee 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:54.820
 4 is recommended. 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.850
 It's a sweet girl. Be careful 4 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.850
 U 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:07.830
 I think it's good to have opted for ophthalmology. I think it's very rewarding. 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.890
 To the patient 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.760
 like this 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:18.730
 I think it's a good field to do a lot of things 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:25.810
 Oh, that's how it came to be. 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:31.599
 Because patients are really jwotgi me and I get to study and pass surgery 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:36.300
 Continue to keep things out of the way so you can keep up with the sit 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:36.300
 I think it was possible because 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.730
 As the retina is responsible for important visual functions, it can cause various diseases 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:54.900
 Recently, a fluorescence fundus examination to confirm the blood vessel status and hydrothermal state of the retina 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:59.850
 And it can be relatively easily diagnosed with retinal tomography there was a problem 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:01.920
 Depending on the area where the retinal disease occurs, the patient does not feel the symptoms, 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:07.050
 To miss 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:09.410
 Yimyeongsuk's too suddenly darkened hospital As a marketing center in sight contact 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.410
 found 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.600
 You look at it like that . So when you see something like fake or three, I slept like that. 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.620
 It's in the middle. 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.620
 I do not see meat. 

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:27.720
 Is this the same thing? 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.720
 It looks as if the center part is erased . 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:36.490
 If you walk down the street and you can not see it, 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:42.150
 When to get the big accident is even bigger fear 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:42.150
 Why is there a black hole in the world that she sees? 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:55.990
 Kim Seung-ho would not be able to control his blood pressure. 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:59.000
 Gert's okay. I like cholesterol. It's a concession. It's okay. 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:04.610
 I asked you to take your medicine. 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:07.340
 4 It is not the case that the veins are blocked again like this, 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:12.350
 p created by now and make non eopjanahyo 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:17.330
 Because if the depth between the more or place well I just sunk the heart of 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:24.920
 The blood vessels now do not get to the normal position. 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:28.520
 4 It has been stabilized to a certain extent now, 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:30.530
 Or no longer in the right spirit scan or take care of a little catch up again now 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.270
 It looks like it started. 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:36.110
 Ah 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:40.190
 One thing is new clogging The currency exchange that had gone through the retinas of the past 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:46.130
 This time , there was a macular edema and a vision problem. 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:50.600
 The research begins today. The retina is peripheral, 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:54.380
 I can tell you that the most likely candidate in the center 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:06:00.110
 The central vision of macular vision 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:07.060
 It is the part where the very solitary cortical neurons are gathered, 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:07.060
 There will be many illnesses here, which will cause the central vision to deteriorate. 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:14.419
 Fang Ban is the center of the retina, where the important cells that respond to this stimulus are dense 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:19.669
 Place 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:21.350
 However, when the blood vessels around the macula become weak and the exudates accumulate, 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:24.290
 Edema occurs 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:29.410
 Membrane with proprietary tissue at the back of the retina 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:29.410
 The inclusion of the macula was also responsible for 9 species. 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:40.850
 5 How uncomfortable is the cause of macular edema now? 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.480
 Retinal vein occlusion is one of those that smells little and is not on the right side. 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:45.350
 this is 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:48.410
 The second most common retinal vascular disease after diabetes 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:53.270
 It is also called a stroke in the eye. 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:53.990
 Arteriosclerosis or thrombosis causes clogged veins in the retina, resulting in vision impairment 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.160
 Because 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:07:01.110
 This is it. 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:03.150
 There nerve membranes so looked straight About the retina can not work our 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:06.360
 There's a lot of blood vessels. 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:10.160
 In the meantime, I was a little blocked. 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:16.560
 I'm taking pictures of the inside of the sulfur preservation center. 

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:23.960
 If you look at the left side of the optic nerve is a way to * 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:23.960
 CT also lead one to look at the core movements sulfur
