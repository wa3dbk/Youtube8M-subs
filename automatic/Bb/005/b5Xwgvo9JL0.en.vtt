00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:09.019 
that guy's gin put up on machine guns

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:11.480 
that guy's gin put up on machine guns
and<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.170> thought<00:00:10.320> it<00:00:10.440> was<00:00:10.559> pretty<00:00:10.710> cool<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.040> I

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.060 
and I thought it was pretty cool and I
began<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:12.269> wonder<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:13.139> speculate<00:00:13.769> and

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
began to wonder and speculate and

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.550 
began to wonder and speculate and
ask<00:00:14.280> questions<00:00:14.940> as<00:00:15.330> I'm<00:00:15.660> sure<00:00:15.960> many<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.379> you

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
ask questions as I'm sure many of you

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.439 
ask questions as I'm sure many of you
are<00:00:16.590> doing<00:00:17.070> as<00:00:17.190> well<00:00:17.369> but<00:00:17.910> what<00:00:18.060> we're<00:00:18.210> looking

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
are doing as well but what we're looking

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.750 
are doing as well but what we're looking
at<00:00:18.539> right<00:00:18.600> now<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:19.260> an<00:00:19.410> m3<00:00:19.680> American<00:00:20.550> light

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
at right now is an m3 American light

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.290 
at right now is an m3 American light
tank<00:00:21.119> firing<00:00:21.840> what<00:00:22.050> appears<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.590> be<00:00:22.850> the<00:00:23.850> top

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
tank firing what appears to be the top

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.650 
tank firing what appears to be the top
mounted<00:00:24.960> machine<00:00:25.769> gun<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.550> coaxial<00:00:27.330> machine

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
mounted machine gun in a coaxial machine

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.599 
mounted machine gun in a coaxial machine
gun<00:00:27.689> so<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.230> looks<00:00:28.470> like<00:00:28.680> only<00:00:28.830> two<00:00:29.160> machine

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
gun so it looks like only two machine

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.070 
gun so it looks like only two machine
guns<00:00:29.789> are<00:00:29.910> firing<00:00:30.119> both<00:00:30.359> which<00:00:30.630> are<00:00:30.779> 30

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
guns are firing both which are 30

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.260 
guns are firing both which are 30
caliber<00:00:31.500> machine<00:00:31.529> guns<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.640> between<00:00:32.940> seven

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
caliber machine guns so between seven

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.940 
caliber machine guns so between seven
and<00:00:33.300> eight<00:00:33.390> millimeters<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.200> keep<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:34.920> mind

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
and eight millimeters and keep in mind

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.680 
and eight millimeters and keep in mind
that<00:00:35.340> there<00:00:35.520> are<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.700> couple<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:36.059> other<00:00:36.270> machine

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
that there are a couple of other machine

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.270 
that there are a couple of other machine
guns<00:00:36.840> on<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.170> tank<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.739> it's

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
guns on this tank and it's

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.459 
guns on this tank and it's
forward-facing<00:00:38.850> but<00:00:39.300> they're<00:00:39.480> not<00:00:39.629> firing<00:00:40.260> so

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
forward-facing but they're not firing so

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.970 
forward-facing but they're not firing so
I'm<00:00:40.530> not<00:00:40.710> entirely<00:00:41.100> sure<00:00:41.340> what<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.030> means<00:00:42.329> or

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
I'm not entirely sure what it means or

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.889 
I'm not entirely sure what it means or
if<00:00:43.980> they<00:00:44.399> will<00:00:44.700> be<00:00:44.760> able<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.149> fire<00:00:45.360> if<00:00:45.660> all

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
if they will be able to fire if all

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.630 
if they will be able to fire if all
machine<00:00:46.320> guns<00:00:46.500> will<00:00:46.680> be<00:00:46.710> able<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.039> be<00:00:47.129> fired<00:00:47.430> or

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
machine guns will be able to be fired or

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.970 
machine guns will be able to be fired or
if<00:00:47.760> some<00:00:48.030> will<00:00:48.180> just<00:00:48.210> kind<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.750> be<00:00:48.980> cosmetic

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
if some will just kind of be cosmetic

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.700 
if some will just kind of be cosmetic
and<00:00:50.160> superficial<00:00:51.030> but<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.050> think<00:00:52.320> it's<00:00:52.410> kind<00:00:52.649> of

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
and superficial but I think it's kind of

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.040 
and superficial but I think it's kind of
cool<00:00:52.980> first<00:00:53.760> off<00:00:54.000> because<00:00:54.180> World<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.870> Tanks

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
cool first off because World of Tanks

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.650 
cool first off because World of Tanks
doesn't<00:00:55.440> have<00:00:55.530> machine<00:00:55.829> guns<00:00:56.239> if<00:00:57.239> you're

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
doesn't have machine guns if you're

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.330 
doesn't have machine guns if you're
gonna<00:00:57.750> be<00:00:57.930> competing<00:00:58.410> with<00:00:58.620> other<00:00:58.949> people<00:00:59.039> I

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
gonna be competing with other people I

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.189 
gonna be competing with other people I
think<00:00:59.699> it's<00:01:00.000> always<00:01:00.149> good<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.420> have<00:01:00.660> like<00:01:00.989> a

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
think it's always good to have like a

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.200 
think it's always good to have like a
little<00:01:01.500> bit<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.649> innovation<00:01:01.980> stuff<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.940> you

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
little bit of innovation stuff that you

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.939 
little bit of innovation stuff that you
can<00:01:03.420> show<00:01:03.660> off<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:04.080> other<00:01:04.290> games<00:01:04.650> and

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
can show off that other games and

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.670 
can show off that other games and
competitors<00:01:05.790> don't<00:01:06.090> really<00:01:06.450> have<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:07.650> know

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
competitors don't really have you know

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.710 
competitors don't really have you know
that's<00:01:07.979> that's<00:01:08.820> one<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.180> reasons<00:01:09.540> why<00:01:09.689> I

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
that's that's one of the reasons why I

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.980 
that's that's one of the reasons why I
encourage<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.740> idea<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.280> flame<00:01:11.970> tanks<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:12.659> I

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
encourage the idea of flame tanks so I

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.410 
encourage the idea of flame tanks so I
think<00:01:13.500> that's<00:01:13.770> pretty<00:01:13.979> controversial<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.000> if

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
think that's pretty controversial and if

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.999 
think that's pretty controversial and if
some<00:01:15.600> people<00:01:15.840> put<00:01:16.049> out<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.500> know<00:01:16.650> what<00:01:16.890> if

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
some people put out you know what if

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.429 
some people put out you know what if
what<00:01:17.310> if<00:01:17.430> my<00:01:17.549> game<00:01:17.610> just<00:01:18.060> crashes<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:18.930> my

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
what if my game just crashes in my

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.690 
what if my game just crashes in my
frames<00:01:19.770> drop<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.310> crap<00:01:20.610> but<00:01:21.360> anyway<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.700> what

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
frames drop the crap but anyway so what

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.130 
frames drop the crap but anyway so what
we're<00:01:23.850> looking<00:01:24.060> at<00:01:24.119> right<00:01:24.180> here<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.659> some

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
we're looking at right here is some

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.490 
we're looking at right here is some
video<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.770> m2<00:01:26.580> medium<00:01:27.119> tank<00:01:27.630> also<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:28.259> new

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
video of the m2 medium tank also a new

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.109 
video of the m2 medium tank also a new
American<00:01:28.979> tank<00:01:29.189> that's<00:01:29.400> probably<00:01:29.970> only

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
American tank that's probably only

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.749 
American tank that's probably only
coming<00:01:30.420> out<00:01:30.540> with<00:01:30.720> patch<00:01:30.979> 1.45<00:01:31.979> hopefully

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
coming out with patch 1.45 hopefully

soon trademarked obviously but this

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.460 
soon trademarked obviously but this
thing<00:01:36.000> what<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.630> brings<00:01:36.990> up<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.259> question

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
thing what this brings up a question

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.020 
thing what this brings up a question
like<00:01:37.770> how<00:01:37.979> many<00:01:38.040> machines<00:01:38.579> are<00:01:38.670> gonna<00:01:38.880> be<00:01:38.939> able

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
like how many machines are gonna be able

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.999 
like how many machines are gonna be able
to<00:01:39.180> fire<00:01:39.420> because<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:39.990> one<00:01:40.200> can<00:01:40.380> carry<00:01:40.560> seven

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
to fire because this one can carry seven

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.160 
to fire because this one can carry seven
to<00:01:41.070> nine<00:01:41.310> different<00:01:41.640> machine<00:01:42.299> guns<00:01:42.540> that's

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
to nine different machine guns that's

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.410 
to nine different machine guns that's
pretty<00:01:43.560> ridiculous<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.369> here<00:01:45.090> what<00:01:45.299> we're

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
pretty ridiculous and here what we're

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.030 
pretty ridiculous and here what we're
looking<00:01:45.750> at<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.520> t35<00:01:47.689> firing<00:01:48.689> it's<00:01:48.930> two<00:01:49.500> 45

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
looking at is a t35 firing it's two 45

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.789 
looking at is a t35 firing it's two 45
millimeter<00:01:50.520> turrets<00:01:51.270> it's<00:01:51.509> 76<00:01:52.350> millimeter

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
millimeter turrets it's 76 millimeter

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.410 
millimeter turrets it's 76 millimeter
turret<00:01:53.100> as<00:01:53.189> well<00:01:53.520> as<00:01:53.670> two<00:01:53.880> machine<00:01:54.270> gun

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
turret as well as two machine gun

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.469 
turret as well as two machine gun
turrets<00:01:54.780> all<00:01:55.159> five<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.189> those<00:01:56.520> turrets<00:01:56.909> fire

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
turrets all five of those turrets fire

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.810 
turrets all five of those turrets fire
in<00:01:57.780> this<00:01:58.020> video<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.649> think<00:01:59.070> that's<00:01:59.250> pretty

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
in this video I think that's pretty

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.319 
in this video I think that's pretty
awesome<00:02:00.380> so<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.469> can<00:02:01.590> kind<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:01.860> see<00:02:02.070> how<00:02:02.329> you

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
awesome so you can kind of see how you

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.819 
awesome so you can kind of see how you
know<00:02:03.360> we're<00:02:03.750> going<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.899> be<00:02:03.990> able<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.229> use<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.409> lot

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
know we're going to be able to use a lot

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.740 
know we're going to be able to use a lot
of<00:02:04.860> different<00:02:05.340> weapon<00:02:05.670> systems<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.390> war

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
of different weapon systems in war

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.350 
of different weapon systems in war
thunder<00:02:07.079> here<00:02:07.500> you're<00:02:07.619> going<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.799> see<00:02:08.360> m103

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
thunder here you're going to see m103

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.020 
thunder here you're going to see m103
also<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.140> new<00:02:10.349> american<00:02:10.770> tank<00:02:11.009> with<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.550> mounted

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
also a new american tank with a mounted

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.990 
also a new american tank with a mounted
machine<00:02:12.060> gun<00:02:12.450> on<00:02:12.569> a

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
machine gun on a

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.560 
machine gun on a
and<00:02:13.180> earlier<00:02:14.020> we<00:02:14.650> saw<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:14.890> m3<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:16.000> the

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
and earlier we saw the m3 and the

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.330 
and earlier we saw the m3 and the
machine<00:02:17.260> gun<00:02:17.290> mounted<00:02:17.680> on<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:17.950> top<00:02:18.130> of<00:02:18.280> the

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
machine gun mounted on the top of the

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.700 
machine gun mounted on the top of the
turret<00:02:18.550> was<00:02:19.000> firing<00:02:19.600> so<00:02:20.200> it<00:02:20.320> makes<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:20.680> think

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
turret was firing so it makes you think

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.040 
turret was firing so it makes you think
that<00:02:21.300> we're<00:02:22.300> going<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.450> be<00:02:22.570> able<00:02:22.720> to<00:02:22.780> fire

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
that we're going to be able to fire

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.080 
that we're going to be able to fire
these<00:02:23.650> kinds<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:23.980> machine<00:02:24.280> guns<00:02:24.430> now<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.670> ones

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
these kinds of machine guns now the ones

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.450 
these kinds of machine guns now the ones
that<00:02:25.330> are<00:02:25.600> mounted<00:02:26.350> on<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.830> top<00:02:27.070> of<00:02:27.310> the

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
that are mounted on the top of the

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.730 
that are mounted on the top of the
turrets<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:28.090> wonder<00:02:28.930> if<00:02:29.080> those<00:02:29.350> are<00:02:29.590> going<00:02:29.680> to

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
turrets I wonder if those are going to

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.010 
turrets I wonder if those are going to
be<00:02:29.860> like<00:02:30.010> an<00:02:30.160> upgraded<00:02:30.790> attachment<00:02:31.720> or<00:02:31.870> an

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
be like an upgraded attachment or an

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.220 
be like an upgraded attachment or an
upgraded<00:02:32.470> module<00:02:33.100> for<00:02:33.550> tanks<00:02:34.000> like<00:02:34.690> say<00:02:34.960> after

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
upgraded module for tanks like say after

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.100 
upgraded module for tanks like say after
a<00:02:35.260> certain<00:02:35.650> amount<00:02:35.890> of<00:02:36.220> you<00:02:37.000> know<00:02:37.150> experience

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
a certain amount of you know experience

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.020 
a certain amount of you know experience
and<00:02:38.320> unlocking<00:02:38.890> various<00:02:39.220> modules<00:02:39.760> for

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
and unlocking various modules for

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.110 
and unlocking various modules for
whatever<00:02:40.210> reason<00:02:41.340> you'd<00:02:42.340> finally<00:02:42.670> be<00:02:42.820> able<00:02:43.060> to

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
whatever reason you'd finally be able to

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.650 
whatever reason you'd finally be able to
unlock<00:02:43.270> that<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:45.040> I<00:02:45.910> think<00:02:46.360> that<00:02:46.510> would<00:02:46.600> be

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
unlock that and I think that would be

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.150 
unlock that and I think that would be
kind<00:02:46.930> of<00:02:47.020> cool<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:47.410> if<00:02:47.470> you<00:02:47.590> look<00:02:47.770> at<00:02:47.920> some<00:02:48.070> of

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
kind of cool and if you look at some of

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.400 
kind of cool and if you look at some of
the<00:02:48.250> tanks<00:02:48.790> existing<00:02:49.240> in<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.420> game<00:02:49.600> you<00:02:50.380> see

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
the tanks existing in the game you see

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.220 
the tanks existing in the game you see
that<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:51.130> t54<00:02:52.000> here<00:02:52.270> already<00:02:52.630> has<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:52.840> machine

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
that the t54 here already has a machine

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.060 
that the t54 here already has a machine
gun<00:02:53.380> mounted<00:02:53.680> on<00:02:53.830> the<00:02:53.950> top<00:02:54.190> and<00:02:54.490> stood<00:02:55.420> in

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
gun mounted on the top and stood in

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.170 
gun mounted on the top and stood in
particular<00:02:57.070> have<00:02:57.730> this<00:02:58.690> plate<00:02:59.110> where<00:02:59.590> a<00:03:00.180> like

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
particular have this plate where a like

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.140 
particular have this plate where a like
I<00:03:01.360> believe<00:03:01.990> it<00:03:02.170> was<00:03:02.410> a<00:03:03.150> remote-controlled

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
I believe it was a remote-controlled

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.490 
I believe it was a remote-controlled
machine<00:03:04.570> gun<00:03:04.720> or<00:03:04.870> basically<00:03:05.200> you<00:03:05.320> could

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
machine gun or basically you could

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.900 
machine gun or basically you could
control<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:05.980> machine<00:03:06.250> gun<00:03:06.370> from<00:03:06.550> with<00:03:06.730> inside

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
control the machine gun from with inside

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.690 
control the machine gun from with inside
the<00:03:07.300> tank<00:03:08.080> destroyer<00:03:08.470> you<00:03:09.250> could<00:03:09.400> fire<00:03:09.670> that

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
the tank destroyer you could fire that

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.730 
the tank destroyer you could fire that
machine<00:03:10.209> gun<00:03:10.300> on<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.480> top<00:03:10.750> but<00:03:11.350> here<00:03:11.530> there's

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
machine gun on the top but here there's

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.710 
machine gun on the top but here there's
no<00:03:11.890> machine<00:03:12.220> gun<00:03:12.340> there<00:03:12.490> so<00:03:12.760> you<00:03:13.570> know<00:03:13.690> I

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
no machine gun there so you know I

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.449 
no machine gun there so you know I
wonder<00:03:14.080> if<00:03:14.170> you<00:03:14.260> could<00:03:14.410> upgrade<00:03:14.650> that<00:03:15.070> and

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
wonder if you could upgrade that and

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.190 
wonder if you could upgrade that and
then<00:03:15.640> here's<00:03:16.000> something<00:03:16.390> interesting<00:03:16.510> the

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
then here's something interesting the

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.440 
then here's something interesting the
bt7<00:03:17.739> with<00:03:18.010> a<00:03:18.040> rear<00:03:18.340> facing<00:03:18.580> machine<00:03:19.120> gun<00:03:19.269> I

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
bt7 with a rear facing machine gun I

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.690 
bt7 with a rear facing machine gun I
don't<00:03:20.170> really<00:03:20.350> know<00:03:20.590> if<00:03:20.860> you'd<00:03:21.280> ever<00:03:21.400> be<00:03:21.640> able

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
don't really know if you'd ever be able

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.150 
don't really know if you'd ever be able
to<00:03:21.850> use<00:03:22.060> those<00:03:22.390> a<00:03:22.810> lot<00:03:23.050> of<00:03:23.230> Soviet<00:03:23.590> tanks<00:03:23.800> have

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
to use those a lot of Soviet tanks have

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.440 
to use those a lot of Soviet tanks have
them<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:26.410> also<00:03:27.370> you<00:03:27.459> can<00:03:27.640> see<00:03:27.850> that<00:03:28.060> we<00:03:28.209> have

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
them and also you can see that we have

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.600 
them and also you can see that we have
machine<00:03:28.930> gun<00:03:29.080> stats<00:03:29.440> for<00:03:29.709> both<00:03:29.920> the<00:03:30.160> radioman

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
machine gun stats for both the radioman

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.690 
machine gun stats for both the radioman
and<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.420> commander<00:03:32.200> and<00:03:32.470> I<00:03:33.190> think<00:03:33.459> this<00:03:33.610> is

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
and the commander and I think this is

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.910 
and the commander and I think this is
kind<00:03:33.910> of<00:03:33.970> interesting<00:03:34.480> when<00:03:35.200> we<00:03:35.440> look<00:03:35.470> at<00:03:35.769> the

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
kind of interesting when we look at the

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.220 
kind of interesting when we look at the
m3<00:03:36.489> firing<00:03:36.910> of<00:03:37.000> machine<00:03:37.269> guns<00:03:37.420> earlier<00:03:37.780> only

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
m3 firing of machine guns earlier only

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.710 
m3 firing of machine guns earlier only
two<00:03:38.680> were<00:03:38.860> firing<00:03:39.190> and<00:03:39.550> of<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.180> tank<00:03:40.450> crew

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
two were firing and of the tank crew

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.449 
two were firing and of the tank crew
only<00:03:41.050> two<00:03:41.290> of<00:03:41.440> them<00:03:41.530> have<00:03:41.830> machine<00:03:42.310> gun

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
only two of them have machine gun

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.060 
only two of them have machine gun
statistics<00:03:43.330> right<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:44.410> radioman<00:03:44.799> and<00:03:45.010> the

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
statistics right the radioman and the

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.310 
statistics right the radioman and the
commander<00:03:45.600> so<00:03:46.600> I<00:03:47.340> wonder<00:03:48.340> how<00:03:48.900> that<00:03:49.900> really

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
commander so I wonder how that really

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.900 
commander so I wonder how that really
works<00:03:50.680> because<00:03:50.830> the<00:03:51.130> radioman<00:03:51.459> could<00:03:51.790> be

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
works because the radioman could be

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.210 
works because the radioman could be
firing<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.690> coaxial<00:03:53.440> mounted<00:03:53.769> machine<00:03:53.860> gun

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
firing the coaxial mounted machine gun

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.770 
firing the coaxial mounted machine gun
or<00:03:54.370> a<00:03:54.400> whole<00:03:54.760> Mountain<00:03:55.120> Michigan<00:03:55.390> as<00:03:55.630> they

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
or a whole Mountain Michigan as they

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.080 
or a whole Mountain Michigan as they
normally<00:03:56.019> would<00:03:56.320> and<00:03:56.769> maybe<00:03:57.400> the<00:03:57.610> commander

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
normally would and maybe the commander

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.120 
normally would and maybe the commander
is<00:03:58.299> the<00:03:58.510> one<00:03:58.690> responsible<00:03:58.870> firing<00:03:59.769> the

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
is the one responsible firing the

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.130 
is the one responsible firing the
machine<00:04:00.519> guns<00:04:00.880> mounted<00:04:01.030> on<00:04:01.330> the<00:04:01.390> top<00:04:01.750> of<00:04:02.019> the

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
machine guns mounted on the top of the

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.100 
machine guns mounted on the top of the
turret<00:04:02.549> I'm<00:04:03.549> not<00:04:03.790> sure<00:04:04.000> that's<00:04:04.269> just

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
turret I'm not sure that's just

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.509 
turret I'm not sure that's just
guesswork<00:04:05.320> and<00:04:05.769> I'd<00:04:05.890> like<00:04:06.040> to<00:04:06.190> get<00:04:06.310> your

infantry<00:05:21.789> right<00:05:22.090> and<00:05:22.330> these<00:05:23.169> machine<00:05:23.560> guns

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
infantry right and these machine guns

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.320 
infantry right and these machine guns
would<00:05:23.860> be<00:05:23.889> very<00:05:24.370> very<00:05:24.639> good<00:05:24.820> at<00:05:24.940> dealing<00:05:25.120> with

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
would be very very good at dealing with

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.750 
would be very very good at dealing with
infantry<00:05:25.840> and<00:05:26.220> here<00:05:27.220> you<00:05:27.310> can<00:05:27.460> see<00:05:27.610> some

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
infantry and here you can see some

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.350 
infantry and here you can see some
pictures<00:05:28.120> of<00:05:28.150> some<00:05:28.300> very<00:05:28.810> detailed<00:05:30.120> models<00:05:31.120> of

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
pictures of some very detailed models of

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.020 
pictures of some very detailed models of
infantry<00:05:31.930> and<00:05:32.110> I'm<00:05:32.169> not<00:05:32.320> sure<00:05:32.590> what<00:05:32.830> the<00:05:33.820> guys

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
infantry and I'm not sure what the guys

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.850 
infantry and I'm not sure what the guys
Jane<00:05:34.330> and<00:05:34.539> war<00:05:34.660> thunder<00:05:34.930> have<00:05:35.080> planned<00:05:35.530> for

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
Jane and war thunder have planned for

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.909 
Jane and war thunder have planned for
infantry<00:05:36.370> in<00:05:36.520> general<00:05:37.000> but<00:05:37.900> there's<00:05:38.289> a<00:05:38.349> lot<00:05:38.740> of

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
infantry in general but there's a lot of

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:40.710 
infantry in general but there's a lot of
speculation<00:05:39.130> and<00:05:39.700> a<00:05:39.820> lot<00:05:39.940> of<00:05:39.970> hope<00:05:40.210> that<00:05:40.510> we

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
speculation and a lot of hope that we

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.330 
speculation and a lot of hope that we
would<00:05:40.840> get<00:05:40.960> to<00:05:41.020> play<00:05:41.260> them<00:05:41.500> at<00:05:41.680> some<00:05:41.919> point<00:05:41.950> now

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
would get to play them at some point now

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.940 
would get to play them at some point now
that<00:05:42.370> is<00:05:42.669> so<00:05:43.120> far<00:05:43.660> away<00:05:43.870> like<00:05:44.200> I<00:05:44.410> don't<00:05:44.830> even

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
that is so far away like I don't even

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.740 
that is so far away like I don't even
know<00:05:45.070> if<00:05:45.250> gaijin<00:05:45.610> is<00:05:45.700> even<00:05:45.910> planning<00:05:46.450> on<00:05:46.510> ever

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
know if gaijin is even planning on ever

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.480 
know if gaijin is even planning on ever
being<00:05:47.139> able<00:05:47.320> to<00:05:47.440> play<00:05:47.620> infantry<00:05:48.039> it<00:05:48.160> would<00:05:48.340> be

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
being able to play infantry it would be

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.520 
being able to play infantry it would be
cool<00:05:48.729> if<00:05:48.940> this<00:05:49.150> game<00:05:49.300> ever<00:05:49.510> to<00:05:49.630> get<00:05:49.750> insanely

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
cool if this game ever to get insanely

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.100 
cool if this game ever to get insanely
successful<00:05:51.220> they<00:05:51.789> could<00:05:51.970> easily<00:05:52.120> fund<00:05:52.840> that

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
successful they could easily fund that

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.110 
successful they could easily fund that
and<00:05:53.349> that<00:05:53.500> would<00:05:53.650> probably<00:05:53.919> just<00:05:54.250> draw<00:05:54.490> even

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
and that would probably just draw even

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.480 
and that would probably just draw even
more<00:05:55.419> people<00:05:56.039> because<00:05:57.039> it<00:05:57.220> would<00:05:57.310> basically

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
more people because it would basically

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.879 
more people because it would basically
be<00:05:57.849> like<00:05:58.090> battlefield<00:05:58.780> but<00:05:59.050> to<00:05:59.349> the<00:05:59.500> next

00:05:59.879 --> 00:05:59.889 
be like battlefield but to the next

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:02.730 
be like battlefield but to the next
level<00:06:00.430> you<00:06:01.240> know<00:06:01.389> of<00:06:01.660> where<00:06:02.080> you<00:06:02.169> get<00:06:02.289> a<00:06:02.320> gotta

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
level you know of where you get a gotta

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.060 
level you know of where you get a gotta
have<00:06:02.979> this<00:06:03.099> full<00:06:03.780> experience<00:06:04.780> of<00:06:05.229> what<00:06:05.500> war

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
have this full experience of what war

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.730 
have this full experience of what war
would<00:06:06.280> be<00:06:06.400> like<00:06:06.610> during<00:06:06.880> World<00:06:07.060> War<00:06:07.150> two<00:06:07.419> but<00:06:07.740> I

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
would be like during World War two but I

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.279 
would be like during World War two but I
really<00:06:09.160> wonder<00:06:09.550> if<00:06:09.699> maybe<00:06:10.479> there'll<00:06:10.840> be<00:06:10.870> AI

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:11.289 
really wonder if maybe there'll be AI

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:14.490 
really wonder if maybe there'll be AI
infantry<00:06:11.979> because<00:06:12.310> the<00:06:12.490> AI<00:06:12.610> infantry<00:06:13.500> react

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500 
infantry because the AI infantry react

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.890 
infantry because the AI infantry react
when<00:06:15.010> you<00:06:15.130> strafe<00:06:15.490> at<00:06:15.729> them<00:06:15.940> and<00:06:16.180> shoot<00:06:16.780> at

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
when you strafe at them and shoot at

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.529 
when you strafe at them and shoot at
them<00:06:17.080> and<00:06:17.229> stuff<00:06:17.440> like<00:06:17.590> that<00:06:17.800> and<00:06:17.949> some<00:06:18.190> of<00:06:18.280> the

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:18.539 
them and stuff like that and some of the

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:21.839 
them and stuff like that and some of the
missions<00:06:19.539> and<00:06:19.870> just<00:06:20.500> you<00:06:20.770> know<00:06:20.919> flying<00:06:21.370> out<00:06:21.669> by

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:21.849 
missions and just you know flying out by

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:23.520 
missions and just you know flying out by
yourself<00:06:22.360> that<00:06:22.630> you'll<00:06:22.900> be<00:06:23.080> able<00:06:23.169> to<00:06:23.320> see

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
yourself that you'll be able to see

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.740 
yourself that you'll be able to see
these<00:06:23.770> the<00:06:24.070> infantry<00:06:24.820> and<00:06:25.000> so<00:06:25.270> I<00:06:25.300> think<00:06:25.479> that's

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:25.750 
these the infantry and so I think that's

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.120 
these the infantry and so I think that's
kind<00:06:25.960> of<00:06:25.990> cool<00:06:26.050> and<00:06:26.260> I<00:06:26.320> do<00:06:26.380> have<00:06:26.620> some<00:06:26.800> videos

of machine guns and war thunder

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.310 
of machine guns and war thunder
obviously<00:06:46.150> you're<00:06:46.870> going<00:06:46.960> to<00:06:47.050> be<00:06:47.110> able<00:06:47.169> to

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:47.320

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.350 
shoot at enemy aircraft but if you think
if<00:06:49.780> you<00:06:49.840> got<00:06:49.990> like<00:06:50.169> a<00:06:50.199> a<00:06:50.580> mounted<00:06:51.580> 30<00:06:51.880> caliber

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.360 
if you got like a a mounted 30 caliber

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.870 
if you got like a a mounted 30 caliber
or<00:06:52.510> mounted<00:06:52.900> 50<00:06:53.229> caliber<00:06:53.530> machine<00:06:53.830> gun<00:06:54.010> you

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 
or mounted 50 caliber machine gun you

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.850 
or mounted 50 caliber machine gun you
you<00:06:55.120> see<00:06:55.360> how<00:06:55.570> difficult<00:06:55.870> it<00:06:56.229> is<00:06:56.320> to<00:06:56.380> kind<00:06:56.740> of

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:56.860 
you see how difficult it is to kind of

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.550 
you see how difficult it is to kind of
shoot<00:06:57.370> down<00:06:57.550> planes<00:06:57.930> unless<00:06:58.930> you<00:06:59.139> get<00:06:59.320> a

00:06:59.550 --> 00:06:59.560 
shoot down planes unless you get a

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.740 
shoot down planes unless you get a
steady<00:07:00.070> amount<00:07:00.520> of<00:07:00.610> ammunition<00:07:00.850> on<00:07:01.240> target<00:07:01.600> so

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:01.750 
steady amount of ammunition on target so

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.719 
steady amount of ammunition on target so
it<00:07:01.810> should<00:07:01.960> be<00:07:02.080> interesting<00:07:02.290> anyway<00:07:03.160> make

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:03.729 
it should be interesting anyway make

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:04.860 
it should be interesting anyway make
sure<00:07:03.850> to<00:07:03.940> pull<00:07:04.150> the<00:07:04.270> trigger<00:07:04.449> on<00:07:04.600> that<00:07:04.660> like
