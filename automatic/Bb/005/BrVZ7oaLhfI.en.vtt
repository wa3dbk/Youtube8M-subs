00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.120
 We in my country Mexico also will 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.969
 knows in other parts of the world how 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.760
 three online dictates I'm tik poet 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.870
 tik tok and cat guts cat of guts 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:07.440
 ouija god of war 3 call of duty and so on 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.750
 well let's start my first advice for 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.540
 that win most of the time is to be 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.700
 the first to throw second advice 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.000
 they have in the corner the corner is the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.149
 box with more chances to win 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.920
 first play on the diagonal corner 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:25.619
 we throw in the corner if the opponent 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.259
 strip in the center we throw in the 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.240
 corner that remains diagonally the 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.619
 most of the time the opponent throws 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.630
 in a corner 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.360
 if this happens we throw in the corner 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.229
 remaining this will leave you surrounded 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.530
 adversary we will win immediately second 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.300
 played in the corner the envelope 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.970
 we throw in the corner if the opponent 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.060
 pull to the side of our figure we throw 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.130
 in the other corner leaving him wrapped 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.259
 opponent must throw to the center to not 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.080
 lose but most of the time throws 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.750
 in another place if you pull in this way 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.020
 we throw to the center so 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.850
 we will have the won game again 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.220
 if instead of shooting in the center pulls in 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.080
 a corner we proceed pulling 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.380
 in the remaining corner 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.720
 we will win again if you pull this 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.100
 way we will throw in the next 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.100
 corner and we will win again 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.280
 third corner technique the skin was 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:27.530
 we throw in the corner if the opponent 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.930
 throw in a corner we will have the 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.090
 game won we just have to throw 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.310
 again in the corner he must close 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.829
 the line then we go back to throw in 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.469
 corner as we can observe already you 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:41.450
 we won again when the 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:44.810
 adversary learn to defend yourself high 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.459
 technique we will get this other one afloat if 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.290
 we have to shoot first and we have 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.319
 applied the techniques in the corner 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.349
 now we will throw in the center this one 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:57.169
 flame the tangent we throw in the center 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:59.650
 if the adversary pulls linearly and 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:02.329
 not diagonal we will have the game won 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.669
 pay attention once you pull 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.500
 linear shape we will throw in a 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:09.349
 corner but only the line that remains 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.199
 free the opponent will have to block the 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:15.099
 line then we block the 

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:17.689
 yours and eureka we will have won again 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.790
 as you can notice those are the 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:21.829
 necessary knowledge they need 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.080
 to win a couple of times until your 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.120
 friends understand the pattern 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.100
 but for you to be undefeated 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.010
 I will teach them to fend 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.170
 techniques if the opponent throws in the 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.930
 corner we will throw in the center 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.000
 always in the center after the 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.820
 opponent can try the diagonal 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.310
 or the corner in the case of the diagonal 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.230
 we will pull linearly the 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.300
 opponent must cover the line 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.710
 then you will block your line and the 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.350
 game will be a draw 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.900
 in the case of the cornerback we will cover your 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.940
 line he will have to cover yours and 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.920
 now they are just covering lines 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.530
 until there is another tie or until 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.810
 someone shit xd this you should do 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.790
 every time your opponent pulls first like this 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.730
 you will never lose but if you will have more 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.250
 chances of winning I personally 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.380
 I won about 50 pesos betting with 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.720
 this simple game and winning a couple of 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.020
 Sometimes the fool who falls is also missing 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.510
 hundreds of times in the plays x of 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:23.790
 well thats all friends thank you for watching 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.280
