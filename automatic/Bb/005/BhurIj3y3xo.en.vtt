independent volume control so if one

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.870 
independent volume control so if one
person<00:03:23.110> is<00:03:23.470> watching<00:03:23.709> for<00:03:24.100> example<00:03:24.700> the

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
person is watching for example the

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.650 
person is watching for example the
television<00:03:25.510> and<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:26.350> other<00:03:26.470> person<00:03:27.010> is<00:03:27.660> let's

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
television and the other person is let's

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.120 
television and the other person is let's
say<00:03:28.810> has<00:03:28.989> hearing<00:03:29.380> difficulties<00:03:29.920> and<00:03:30.040> they

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
say has hearing difficulties and they

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.010 
say has hearing difficulties and they
use<00:03:30.310> headphones<00:03:30.790> for<00:03:31.000> a<00:03:31.060> higher<00:03:31.300> volume<00:03:31.540> you

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
use headphones for a higher volume you

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.750 
use headphones for a higher volume you
can<00:03:32.170> have<00:03:32.200> two<00:03:32.560> independent<00:03:32.860> volumes<00:03:33.580> which

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
can have two independent volumes which

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.300 
can have two independent volumes which
is<00:03:33.880> a<00:03:33.910> very<00:03:34.120> nice<00:03:34.270> feature<00:03:34.540> you<00:03:34.840> have<00:03:34.900> on<00:03:35.110> these

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
is a very nice feature you have on these

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.510 
is a very nice feature you have on these
televisions<00:03:36.420> finally<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.930> power<00:03:38.320> wise<00:03:38.620> it's

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
televisions finally the power wise it's

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.030 
televisions finally the power wise it's
as<00:03:40.180> I<00:03:40.239> mentioned<00:03:40.660> earlier<00:03:40.989> it's<00:03:41.170> a<00:03:41.260> plasma<00:03:41.739> so

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
as I mentioned earlier it's a plasma so

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.940 
as I mentioned earlier it's a plasma so
it<00:03:42.220> is<00:03:42.310> a<00:03:42.340> little<00:03:42.580> bit<00:03:42.790> more<00:03:43.140> cost<00:03:44.140> of<00:03:44.290> costly

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
it is a little bit more cost of costly

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.759 
it is a little bit more cost of costly
to<00:03:45.160> run<00:03:45.340> so<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:45.970> Class<00:03:46.360> A<00:03:46.600> is<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.260> energy

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
to run so the Class A is the energy

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.280 
to run so the Class A is the energy
efficiency<00:03:48.370> on<00:03:48.489> this<00:03:48.700> television<00:03:49.330> and<00:03:50.050> that's

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
efficiency on this television and that's

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.380 
efficiency on this television and that's
it<00:03:50.500> if<00:03:50.980> you'd<00:03:51.130> like<00:03:51.250> to<00:03:51.489> pop<00:03:51.760> into<00:03:52.060> one<00:03:52.090> of<00:03:52.300> our
