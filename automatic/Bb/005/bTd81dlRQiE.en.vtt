00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
blade as it is its width now I'll just

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.800 
blade as it is its width now I'll just
make<00:02:19.319> one<00:02:19.709> more<00:02:19.739> notch<00:02:20.459> in<00:02:20.879> that<00:02:21.390> plywood

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.710 

I'll<00:02:26.500> take<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:26.860> edge<00:02:27.100> to<00:02:27.700> one<00:02:27.940> of<00:02:28.060> my<00:02:28.210> boards

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
I'll take the edge to one of my boards

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.840 
I'll take the edge to one of my boards
and<00:02:28.930> I'm<00:02:29.050> going<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.260> butt<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:29.740> up<00:02:29.860> right<00:02:30.310> next

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
and I'm going to butt it up right next

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.700 
and I'm going to butt it up right next
to<00:02:31.000> that<00:02:31.180> pin<00:02:31.630> I'm<00:02:31.960> just<00:02:32.170> going<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.320> hold<00:02:32.530> this

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
to that pin I'm just going to hold this

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:38.340 
to that pin I'm just going to hold this
on<00:02:32.950> there<00:02:33.130> tightly<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:33.880> run<00:02:34.660> it<00:02:34.810> through<00:02:37.350> now

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
on there tightly and run it through now

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.710 
on there tightly and run it through now
I'll<00:02:38.500> move<00:02:38.680> it<00:02:38.830> over<00:02:39.190> that<00:02:39.370> pin<00:02:39.730> and<00:02:40.030> just<00:02:40.060> keep

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
I'll move it over that pin and just keep

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:59.070 
I'll move it over that pin and just keep
going<00:02:41.050> all<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.290> way

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.540 

when<00:03:00.080> you<00:03:00.200> get<00:03:00.349> to<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.590> end<00:03:00.770> then<00:03:01.220> you<00:03:01.250> want<00:03:01.520> to

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
when you get to the end then you want to

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.970 
when you get to the end then you want to
grab<00:03:01.670> the<00:03:02.360> board<00:03:02.690> that<00:03:02.989> is<00:03:03.110> going<00:03:03.319> to<00:03:03.470> join<00:03:03.709> up

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
grab the board that is going to join up

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.790 
grab the board that is going to join up
with<00:03:04.040> that<00:03:04.519> one<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:05.030> you'll<00:03:05.900> butt<00:03:06.590> it<00:03:06.709> up

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
with that one and you'll butt it up

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.250 
with that one and you'll butt it up
against<00:03:07.250> this<00:03:07.459> one<00:03:07.700> and<00:03:07.879> run<00:03:08.030> it<00:03:08.150> through<00:03:08.260> the

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
against this one and run it through the

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.290 
against this one and run it through the
way<00:03:09.379> I<00:03:09.410> live<00:03:09.650> work<00:03:09.830> out<00:03:10.040> mine<00:03:10.370> is<00:03:10.670> it<00:03:11.030> just

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
way I live work out mine is it just

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.270 
way I live work out mine is it just
butts<00:03:11.510> up<00:03:11.720> against<00:03:12.110> that<00:03:12.260> pin<00:03:12.650> depending<00:03:13.160> on

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
butts up against that pin depending on

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.160 
butts up against that pin depending on
how<00:03:13.459> you<00:03:13.519> have<00:03:13.730> it<00:03:13.790> set<00:03:13.910> you<00:03:14.510> may<00:03:14.750> need<00:03:14.989> to

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
how you have it set you may need to

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.229 
how you have it set you may need to
press<00:03:15.590> it<00:03:15.769> right<00:03:15.980> up<00:03:16.190> against<00:03:16.519> the<00:03:16.700> board<00:03:16.970> if

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
press it right up against the board if

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:33.850 
press it right up against the board if
it<00:03:17.390> overhangs<00:03:18.019> a<00:03:18.200> little<00:03:18.470> bit

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.100 

and<00:03:34.860> these<00:03:35.250> should<00:03:35.549> make<00:03:36.090> together<00:03:36.360> about

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
and these should make together about

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.140 
and these should make together about
like<00:03:37.379> that<00:03:37.799> and<00:03:38.069> you<00:03:38.430> know<00:03:38.459> of<00:03:38.760> course<00:03:39.000> you

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
like that and you know of course you

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.000 
like that and you know of course you
wouldn't<00:03:39.390> run<00:03:39.599> a<00:03:39.659> few<00:03:39.900> tests<00:03:40.439> and<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:40.890> know

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
wouldn't run a few tests and you know

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.199 
wouldn't run a few tests and you know
tweak<00:03:41.310> it<00:03:41.459> a<00:03:41.489> little<00:03:41.519> bit<00:03:41.819> before<00:03:41.970> you

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
tweak it a little bit before you

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.229 
tweak it a little bit before you
actually<00:03:42.689> run<00:03:42.989> it<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:43.349> mine's<00:03:44.159> not<00:03:44.549> too<00:03:44.939> bad

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
actually run it and mine's not too bad

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.869 
actually run it and mine's not too bad
I'm<00:03:45.480> a<00:03:45.540> little<00:03:45.780> butt<00:03:45.930> off<00:03:45.959> here<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:46.890> but<00:03:47.220> it's

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
I'm a little butt off here and but it's

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:48.819 
I'm a little butt off here and but it's
good<00:03:48.030> enough<00:03:48.060> for<00:03:48.209> me

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
good enough for me

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.829 
good enough for me
