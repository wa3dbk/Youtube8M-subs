00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.589
 the sum of different ads 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.660
 different news that we have gone 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.210
 confirming downloadable content of 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.800
 high cost in different titles very 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.290
 expected for this new generation of 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.750
 consoles has made that good well many 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.189
 users are repaired replante itself 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.230
 we are really facing a good 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.150
 generation video game is 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.589
 happening with video games now 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.300
 we do not talk about consoles anymore 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:27.390
 we talk about video games those that go 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.909
 leaving then week after week month 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.040
 after months the most expected and even 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:34.170
 like batman arkham night that comes to us 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.470
 this summer, well, the truth is that 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.450
 it's really embarrassing and this also 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.970
 many media have reproduced it and it is 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.860
 that is the situation that is now 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.350
 same in the world of video games and 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.150
 why name me precisely to batman 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.910
 arkham night because precisely for that 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.310
 season pass that will have to the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.680
 truth is that I think they have abused 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.780
 too much a season pass that goes to 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.079
 cost nothing more and nothing less than 40 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.270
 euros 40 euros a season pass that 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.980
 eye to have to be able to use it 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.310
 we will have to have the game 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.590
 a game that will cost us an average of 70 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.530
 launching euros therefore 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.660
 we would be before a sum of 110 euros 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.420
 that the truth is that you want me to tell you 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.490
 I think it's outrageous I know this has 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.560
 happened with more titles previously 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.480
 there have been very seasonal passes 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.120
 high but the truth is that now 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.620
 it seems to be a custom not and all 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.870
 games that come out always 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.560
 announce with their season pass we are going 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.510
 let's see why if the companies 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.630
 they really have the contents already 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.490
 facts and we are going back to the same 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.010
 debate are always starting the 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.410
 games in pieces are giving them to 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.030
 chubs and in the end what we are 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.940
 selling as a complete game is not a 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.230
 full game is a part of the game to 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.780
 the one that lacks what they have decided 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.520
 them that is going to be the dlp or the 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.080
 different from the efes to which we are going to 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.510
 to be able to access through the pass 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.909
 Real season I find horrible 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.690
 that this is happening 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.060
 let it be so we leave 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.100
 and try that way not and that 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.310
 let's accept to buy that kind of content 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.710
 I find it shameful not only is it the 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.870
 case of batman arkham night is worth it 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.540
 I repeat what is happening with more titles 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.970
 mortal kombat 10 for example also 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.950
 has a lot of paid content and the 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.690
 I really do not understand do not understand 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.240
 why a game that just came out of 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.010
 suddenly an endless number of 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.780
 payment contents at the same time 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.180
 practically the game has come out or 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.770
 it simply seems that what they are 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.490
 trying to do with this kind of thing 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.380
 is to take money out more and more money and 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.030
 honestly guys and girls the price 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.060
 of an exit videogame it seems to me already 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.680
 too high for good 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.510
 it is understood that we are already 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.510
 paying all those contents 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.120
 in short is a little reflection is not 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.710
 that generation of video games that 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.420
 we are living right now that yes 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:04.190
 It is true that it has a lot of quality but 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:07.020
 I think that with the use of tlc 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:10.370
 they are precisely trying to get us out 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.370
 more drink pasta
