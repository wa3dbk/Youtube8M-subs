kind<00:02:02.579> of<00:02:02.670> writing<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.119> may<00:02:03.210> be<00:02:03.240> learning<00:02:03.659> a

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
kind of writing and may be learning a

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.090 
kind of writing and may be learning a
little<00:02:03.780> bit<00:02:03.930> i<00:02:04.020> decide<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.530> direct<00:02:04.740> some<00:02:04.890> more

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
little bit i decide to direct some more

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.340 
little bit i decide to direct some more
so<00:02:05.790> we<00:02:06.060> did<00:02:06.240> some<00:02:06.270> other<00:02:06.509> stuff<00:02:06.630> from<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.110> we

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350

comedy shorts and stuff that we just

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.990 
comedy shorts and stuff that we just
thought<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.050> would<00:02:10.170> write<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.739> by<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.670> end<00:02:11.879> of

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
thought it would write and by the end of

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.840 
thought it would write and by the end of
that

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.220 
that
I<00:02:12.910> don't<00:02:13.240> know<00:02:13.330> after<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:13.720> end<00:02:13.840> of<00:02:13.900> that<00:02:14.020> bit

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230

down because with no money trying to put

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.610 
down because with no money trying to put
the<00:02:18.790> other<00:02:19.000> projects<00:02:19.450> that<00:02:19.630> really<00:02:19.810> have<00:02:20.020> no<00:02:20.290> I

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
the other projects that really have no I

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.560 
the other projects that really have no I
don't<00:02:21.520> know<00:02:21.580> outlet<00:02:22.000> or<00:02:22.120> anything<00:02:22.390> like<00:02:22.420> that

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
don't know outlet or anything like that

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.540 
don't know outlet or anything like that
it's<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:22.990> situation<00:02:23.170> where<00:02:23.680> after<00:02:24.100> that<00:02:24.250> I<00:02:24.280> kind

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
it's a situation where after that I kind

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.010 
it's a situation where after that I kind
decided<00:02:25.030> that<00:02:25.240> I<00:02:25.330> really<00:02:25.390> want<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.750> learn<00:02:25.870> how

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
decided that I really want to learn how

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.600 
decided that I really want to learn how
to<00:02:26.080> write<00:02:26.290> better<00:02:26.500> because<00:02:27.130> I<00:02:27.220> think<00:02:27.370> if<00:02:27.520> I

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
to write better because I think if I

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.430 
to write better because I think if I
become<00:02:27.910> a<00:02:27.940> better<00:02:28.150> writer<00:02:28.390> probably<00:02:29.020> learn<00:02:29.410> a

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
become a better writer probably learn a

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.880 
become a better writer probably learn a
little<00:02:29.740> bit<00:02:29.860> better<00:02:30.100> about<00:02:30.190> direction<00:02:30.750> and

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
little bit better about direction and

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.540 
little bit better about direction and
