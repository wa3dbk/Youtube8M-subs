 hello to all, swami was still noah 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.820
 sagem iphone 6 plus let's check 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.800
 will the iphone survive after the fire in which he 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.679
 there will be a condition and it will be possible 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.370
 enable this video from the rox kek channel and we 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.370
 getting started 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.510
 most likely as soon as we connect 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.310
 burning iphone he will not be able to write 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.590
 this information on your camera 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.290
 so use a reflector 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.590
 the reflector will record the iphone 6 plus screen and 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:40.309
 what is now on iphone well fire 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:48.379
 let's go fry it whole and 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:50.660
 let's move straight to the fire as we see our 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.970
 iphone is slowly being destroyed but it is not 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.360
 enough for really good 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.360
 video 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.640
 failure 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.750
 and 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:22.720

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.720

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.020

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:55.509
 he got burned on the back display 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.729
 looks good but it's not the screen 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.549
 completely disconnected from the system and not 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:03.429
 Apparently fire is working shock all controls 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:06.849
 buttons work but it slows down but it 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:11.039
