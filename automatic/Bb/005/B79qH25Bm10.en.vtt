00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:46.019 
you guys another factor too is how

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:48.049 
you guys another factor too is how
heavy-duty<00:00:46.530> your<00:00:46.890> truck<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.309> if<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.699> can<00:00:47.910> go

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
heavy-duty your truck is if you can go

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.160 
heavy-duty your truck is if you can go
up<00:00:48.179> an<00:00:48.359> extra<00:00:49.350> foot<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.829> then<00:00:50.370> if<00:00:51.089> you<00:00:51.329> it's

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
up an extra foot and then if you it's

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.680 
up an extra foot and then if you it's
just<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:53.010> way<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.339> sits<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.999> different<00:00:54.539> when

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
just the way it sits is different when

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.029 
just the way it sits is different when
you're<00:00:54.839> driving<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.589> it's<00:00:55.710> not<00:00:55.859> as

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
you're driving so it's not as

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.770 
you're driving so it's not as
aerodynamic<00:00:56.339> you<00:00:56.969> have<00:00:57.089> to<00:00:57.269> have<00:00:57.359> a<00:00:57.390> kind<00:00:57.660> of

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
aerodynamic you have to have a kind of

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.750 
aerodynamic you have to have a kind of
straight<00:00:58.079> out<00:00:58.260> because<00:00:58.440> otherwise<00:00:58.620> if<00:00:59.219> you

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
straight out because otherwise if you

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.299 
straight out because otherwise if you
have<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.570> wings<00:01:00.839> bent<00:01:01.230> in<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.159> is

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
have the the wings bent in and this is

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.270 
have the the wings bent in and this is
just<00:01:02.489> where<00:01:02.699> be<00:01:02.909> plow<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.780> know<00:01:04.070> it'll<00:01:05.070> hit

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
just where be plow so you know it'll hit

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.250 
just where be plow so you know it'll hit
the<00:01:05.460> ground<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:06.300> you<00:01:06.390> got<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.630> have<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.780> out

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
the ground so you got to have it out

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.410 
the ground so you got to have it out
more<00:01:07.680> which<00:01:07.980> you<00:01:08.580> know<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.150> like<00:01:09.180> you're

driving a big kite around so it's not

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.640 
driving a big kite around so it's not
the<00:01:11.370> most<00:01:11.550> fuel<00:01:11.880> efficient<00:01:12.300> but<00:01:12.480> anyways<00:01:13.290> hope

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.180 
are we mostly plow with bas plows this
is<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> nine-footer<00:01:52.230> I<00:01:52.470> was<00:01:52.680> going<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.950> go<00:01:53.070> over

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
is a nine-footer I was going to go over

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.240 
is a nine-footer I was going to go over
the<00:01:53.310> differences<00:01:53.760> between<00:01:53.940> a<00:01:54.210> nine-footer<00:01:55.250> v

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
the differences between a nine-footer v

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.490 
the differences between a nine-footer v
plow<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.390> poly<00:01:57.720> meaning<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:59.880> red<00:02:00.060> part

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
plow this is a poly meaning the red part

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.860 
plow this is a poly meaning the red part
is<00:02:01.500> basically<00:02:01.770> plastic<00:02:02.250> rather<00:02:03.030> than<00:02:03.240> steel

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
is basically plastic rather than steel

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.350 
is basically plastic rather than steel
so<00:02:04.800> here's<00:02:05.040> an<00:02:05.190> 8-footer<00:02:06.200> here<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.910> I<00:02:08.910> guess

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
so here's an 8-footer here and I guess

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.090 
so here's an 8-footer here and I guess
you<00:02:09.750> know<00:02:09.780> people<00:02:10.530> are<00:02:10.590> probably<00:02:10.800> wondering

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
you know people are probably wondering

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.100 
you know people are probably wondering
if<00:02:11.400> it's<00:02:11.580> worth<00:02:11.640> going<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.390> getting<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.870> foot

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
if it's worth going to getting a foot

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.790 
if it's worth going to getting a foot
more

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
more

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.060 
more
and<00:02:14.160> it<00:02:15.120> always<00:02:15.270> depends<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:15.990> always<00:02:16.260> say<00:02:16.860> that

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
and it always depends I always say that

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.890 
and it always depends I always say that
it<00:02:17.190> always<00:02:17.340> depends<00:02:17.820> on<00:02:18.090> what<00:02:18.660> you're<00:02:18.810> gonna

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
it always depends on what you're gonna

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.790 
it always depends on what you're gonna
use<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.350> for

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
use it for

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.950 
use it for
I<00:02:19.830> really<00:02:20.670> like<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.000> nine-footer<00:02:21.570> I<00:02:21.660> think

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
I really like the nine-footer I think

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.770 
I really like the nine-footer I think
the<00:02:22.370> as<00:02:23.370> if<00:02:23.820> you're<00:02:24.000> just<00:02:24.210> starting<00:02:24.420> out<00:02:24.720> I

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
the as if you're just starting out I

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.600 
the as if you're just starting out I
mean<00:02:25.080> in<00:02:25.230> eight<00:02:25.410> footers<00:02:25.800> really<00:02:26.040> probably

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
mean in eight footers really probably

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.280 
mean in eight footers really probably
ease<00:02:26.850> a<00:02:26.880> little<00:02:27.240> bit<00:02:27.330> easier<00:02:27.600> to<00:02:27.750> use<00:02:27.930> it's<00:02:28.230> not

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
ease a little bit easier to use it's not

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.350 
ease a little bit easier to use it's not
you<00:02:28.890> know<00:02:28.980> it's<00:02:29.190> not<00:02:29.250> as<00:02:29.460> much<00:02:29.640> in<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:29.910> way<00:02:30.090> and

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
you know it's not as much in the way and

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.450 
you know it's not as much in the way and
if<00:02:30.450> you're<00:02:30.600> still<00:02:30.810> learning<00:02:31.140> how<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.460> drive

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
if you're still learning how to drive

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.640 
if you're still learning how to drive
and<00:02:33.030> stuff<00:02:33.510> like<00:02:33.690> that<00:02:33.870> with<00:02:33.990> a<00:02:34.020> plow<00:02:34.260> in<00:02:34.530> eight

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
and stuff like that with a plow in eight

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.010 
and stuff like that with a plow in eight
foot<00:02:34.890> is<00:02:34.980> probably<00:02:35.310> good<00:02:35.660> ten<00:02:36.660> four<00:02:36.930> two<00:02:36.990> one

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
foot is probably good ten four two one

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.480 
foot is probably good ten four two one
thing<00:02:37.290> that's<00:02:37.500> nice<00:02:37.650> about<00:02:37.710> it<00:02:38.100> is<00:02:38.160> if<00:02:38.340> you

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
thing that's nice about it is if you

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
thing that's nice about it is if you
look<00:02:38.700> at<00:02:38.850> it<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:40.230> profile<00:02:40.740> of<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.980> truck<00:02:41.510> it

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
look at it the profile of the truck it

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.100 
look at it the profile of the truck it
sticks<00:02:42.930> out<00:02:43.110> so<00:02:43.880> one<00:02:44.880> year<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.330> lot<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:45.870> times

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
sticks out so one year a lot of times

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.110 
sticks out so one year a lot of times
I'll<00:02:46.410> show<00:02:46.620> you<00:02:46.680> on<00:02:47.190> both<00:02:47.520> trucks<00:02:47.880> they

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
I'll show you on both trucks they

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.110 
I'll show you on both trucks they
actually<00:02:48.510> have<00:02:48.690> it<00:02:48.960> I<00:02:49.170> think<00:02:49.950> I<00:02:50.220> haven't<00:02:51.000> done

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
actually have it I think I haven't done

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.450 
actually have it I think I haven't done
either<00:02:51.330> of<00:02:51.630> these<00:02:51.720> has<00:02:52.170> been<00:02:52.320> other<00:02:53.070> people

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
either of these has been other people

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.720 
either of these has been other people
that<00:02:53.550> have<00:02:53.670> been<00:02:54.150> driving<00:02:54.450> my<00:02:54.780> trucks<00:02:55.110> but

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
that have been driving my trucks but

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.870 
that have been driving my trucks but
right<00:02:56.730> here<00:02:56.760> there's<00:02:57.480> a<00:02:57.540> dent<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.640> I<00:02:59.640> think

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
right here there's a dent and I think

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.720 
right here there's a dent and I think
that's<00:03:00.060> from<00:03:00.180> snow<00:03:00.540> collapsing<00:03:01.230> back<00:03:02.040> on<00:03:02.340> to

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
that's from snow collapsing back on to

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.330 
that's from snow collapsing back on to
the<00:03:03.420> side<00:03:03.660> of<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:03.990> I<00:03:04.170> don't<00:03:04.680> know<00:03:04.770> because<00:03:05.070> I

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
the side of it I don't know because I

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.820 
the side of it I don't know because I
didn't<00:03:06.060> do<00:03:06.150> it<00:03:06.360> craziness<00:03:07.290> happens<00:03:07.710> when

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
didn't do it craziness happens when

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.290 
didn't do it craziness happens when
other<00:03:07.950> people<00:03:08.310> drive<00:03:08.520> your<00:03:08.730> stuff<00:03:08.970> but<00:03:09.710> so<00:03:11.300> for

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
other people drive your stuff but so for

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.480 
other people drive your stuff but so for
that<00:03:12.480> it's<00:03:12.780> nicer<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.260> have<00:03:13.410> a<00:03:13.440> you<00:03:14.340> know<00:03:14.460> a

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
that it's nicer to have a you know a

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.590 
that it's nicer to have a you know a
nine-foot<00:03:15.060> plow<00:03:15.270> because<00:03:16.760> then<00:03:17.760> you're<00:03:18.450> not

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
nine-foot plow because then you're not

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.620 
nine-foot plow because then you're not
gonna<00:03:18.770> you<00:03:19.770> know<00:03:19.860> you<00:03:19.980> just<00:03:20.160> it's<00:03:20.490> gonna<00:03:20.700> not

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
gonna you know you just it's gonna not

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.210 
gonna you know you just it's gonna not
necessarily<00:03:22.050> throw<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.440> up<00:03:22.590> higher<00:03:22.830> but<00:03:23.100> what

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
necessarily throw it up higher but what

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.730 
necessarily throw it up higher but what
its<00:03:23.340> gonna<00:03:23.430> do<00:03:23.760> is<00:03:24.420> allow<00:03:24.630> you<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:25.230> keep<00:03:25.680> your

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
its gonna do is allow you to keep your

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.830 
its gonna do is allow you to keep your
truck<00:03:26.160> away<00:03:26.430> from<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:27.000> pile<00:03:27.209> of<00:03:27.240> snow<00:03:27.510> that

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
truck away from the pile of snow that

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.960 
truck away from the pile of snow that
you're<00:03:27.990> moving<00:03:28.410> better<00:03:29.250> so<00:03:29.550> that's<00:03:29.670> really

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
you're moving better so that's really

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.520 
you're moving better so that's really
nice<00:03:30.240> especially<00:03:30.720> if<00:03:30.990> you're<00:03:31.110> doing<00:03:31.380> more

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
nice especially if you're doing more

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.780 
nice especially if you're doing more
commercial<00:03:32.070> stuff<00:03:33.470> it's<00:03:34.470> it's<00:03:34.860> heavier<00:03:35.310> so<00:03:35.640> if

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
commercial stuff it's it's heavier so if

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.750 
commercial stuff it's it's heavier so if
you're<00:03:35.910> back<00:03:36.120> dragging<00:03:36.570> you<00:03:36.690> don't<00:03:36.840> need<00:03:37.760> back

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
you're back dragging you don't need back

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.250 
you're back dragging you don't need back
drag<00:03:39.030> bar<00:03:39.270> for<00:03:39.630> as<00:03:39.930> much<00:03:40.260> snow<00:03:40.650> and<00:03:41.930> or<00:03:42.930> if<00:03:43.110> that

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
drag bar for as much snow and or if that

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.940 
drag bar for as much snow and or if that
made<00:03:43.440> sense

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
made sense

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.320 
made sense
you<00:03:44.070> know<00:03:44.160> it's<00:03:44.400> heavier<00:03:44.670> which<00:03:44.910> is<00:03:45.060> a<00:03:45.090> good

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
you know it's heavier which is a good

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.150 
you know it's heavier which is a good
thing<00:03:45.540> if<00:03:45.720> you're<00:03:45.840> back<00:03:46.020> dragging<00:03:46.530> because

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
thing if you're back dragging because

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.740 
thing if you're back dragging because
basically<00:03:47.430> when<00:03:47.820> you're<00:03:47.940> back<00:03:48.150> dragging<00:03:48.630> it's

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
basically when you're back dragging it's

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.170 
basically when you're back dragging it's
just<00:03:48.959> the<00:03:49.080> weight<00:03:49.260> of<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.500> plow<00:03:49.680> that's

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
just the weight of the plow that's

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.900 
just the weight of the plow that's
that's<00:03:51.180> moving<00:03:51.600> the<00:03:51.720> snow<00:03:51.990> because<00:03:52.350> there's<00:03:52.530> I

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
that's moving the snow because there's I

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.520 
that's moving the snow because there's I
can<00:03:53.910> go<00:03:54.000> in<00:03:54.120> that<00:03:54.270> more<00:03:54.510> if<00:03:54.660> you<00:03:54.780> guys<00:03:54.900> need<00:03:55.200> if

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
can go in that more if you guys need if

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.199 
can go in that more if you guys need if
you<00:03:55.650> want<00:03:55.890> that<00:03:56.400> but<00:03:56.730> you<00:03:57.030> probably

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
you want that but you probably

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.500 
you want that but you probably
understand<00:03:57.750> that<00:03:58.010> I<00:03:59.150> like<00:04:00.150> poly<00:04:00.480> over<00:04:01.340> steel

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
understand that I like poly over steel

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.210 
understand that I like poly over steel
personally<00:04:03.510> it's<00:04:04.410> worth<00:04:04.620> spending<00:04:04.890> a<00:04:05.100> little

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
personally it's worth spending a little

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.090 
personally it's worth spending a little
bit<00:04:05.340> more<00:04:05.580> on<00:04:05.730> them<00:04:05.910> a<00:04:06.120> couple<00:04:06.510> other<00:04:06.600> things

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
bit more on them a couple other things

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.680 
bit more on them a couple other things
with<00:04:08.100> plows<00:04:08.370> you<00:04:08.640> notice<00:04:09.000> this<00:04:09.180> one<00:04:09.240> doesn't

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
with plows you notice this one doesn't

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
even have the spring return Springs this

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.789

is<00:04:13.800> my<00:04:14.100> main<00:04:14.340> truck<00:04:14.730> that<00:04:14.910> I<00:04:15.030> Drive<00:04:15.390> and<00:04:15.799> you

because<00:05:10.340> otherwise<00:05:11.340> it<00:05:11.730> doesn't<00:05:11.880> even<00:05:12.030> make

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
because otherwise it doesn't even make

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.300 
because otherwise it doesn't even make
sense<00:05:12.270> to<00:05:12.600> have<00:05:12.810> a<00:05:12.870> V<00:05:13.110> cuz<00:05:13.350> you're<00:05:13.530> gonna<00:05:13.650> push

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
sense to have a V cuz you're gonna push

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.860 
sense to have a V cuz you're gonna push
a<00:05:14.340> pile<00:05:14.700> of<00:05:14.940> snow<00:05:15.030> and<00:05:15.390> then<00:05:15.480> it's<00:05:15.630> just<00:05:15.720> gonna

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
a pile of snow and then it's just gonna

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.860 
a pile of snow and then it's just gonna
fold<00:05:16.260> back<00:05:16.620> like<00:05:17.490> they<00:05:17.670> are<00:05:17.790> now<00:05:18.060> and<00:05:18.750> you're

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
fold back like they are now and you're

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.240 
fold back like they are now and you're
not<00:05:19.020> gonna<00:05:19.170> be<00:05:19.320> pushing<00:05:19.560> anything<00:05:19.980> because<00:05:20.160> it

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
not gonna be pushing anything because it

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.380 
not gonna be pushing anything because it
doesn't<00:05:20.280> hold<00:05:20.700> it<00:05:20.880> so<00:05:20.970> they<00:05:21.090> might<00:05:21.270> as<00:05:21.360> well

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
doesn't hold it so they might as well

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.990 
doesn't hold it so they might as well
just<00:05:21.480> sell<00:05:21.840> it<00:05:21.870> as<00:05:22.380> one<00:05:23.070> but<00:05:23.340> the<00:05:23.520> way<00:05:23.640> they<00:05:23.850> can

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
just sell it as one but the way they can

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.870 
just sell it as one but the way they can
make<00:05:24.120> a<00:05:24.180> couple<00:05:24.450> extra<00:05:24.570> bucks<00:05:24.930> I<00:05:25.140> guess<00:05:25.350> so
