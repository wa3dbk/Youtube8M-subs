00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:16.910
 Whenever today the word Work Westfeld think of players that Danny Brewer p 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.919
 Geo World of Warcraft 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:22.650
 but what a pity because then device is a milestone of the poem about the GI 

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:24.789
 Joe's latest oblivion 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.929
 Borghorst from 1994 and the 1996 successor Prof Rath 2 if I 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:31.729
 show you here 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:35.690
 even laid the foundation for the former icon who gave us the classic 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.690
 Real-time strategy Jonah has been preserved 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.030
 some StarCraft Mitterrand would wonder the Queen reads Workers 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.530
 two already game 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.720
 Although there are only two parties namely people and Port Said the offside everyone 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.400
 Combat units fly very much into the military structures 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.400
 but basically the usual rules apply 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.140
 this little thing here lyrical Milow Olpe 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.000
 Markdorf be like straw 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.360
 and as awesome a fight as Florian Silbereisen 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.250
 but is the backbone of the entire army 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.080
 because only he can build the resources and gold and at Zapp 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.230
 or building buildings 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.710
 from the armory to amiando colors to the secret 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.090
 Research Laboratory comes all from one source 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.799
 Lokman Tiras 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:22.640
 almost 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.410
 Cologne the third need raw materials 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.410
 he can not score points that chancellor must do more 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.010
 actually unbelievable 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.010
 one depends on this little poster 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.860
 the Verbundbank 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.020
 because the first act of the opponent is mostly in it 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.050
 to pay for all construction work 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.050
 while you're still training an army 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.800
 since there were no queues for the production so please something completely 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.280
 nice at the patience and took time away 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.450
 you needed somewhere else 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.130
 For example, for the cease since 1996 was the sequence of construction functions 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.980
 pretty complex 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.290
 only those who offer weapons and armor expensive 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.320
 I had forgotten that it was a chance to continue 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.090
 such subtleties moorland that not only show off the competition 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.090
 but also made it in the multiplayer incredibly exciting 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:23.319
 The CDU has hardly anything in the campaign on the box and consumed most 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.469
 Fancy their resources 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:27.219
 but human players build at different speeds 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:29.419
 and set other priorities 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:33.349
 so you could avoid big battles by constantly being with the opponent 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.239
 small groups get on their nerves and put him off schedule 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:41.269
 for example with flying units 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.949
 or camouflaged ships that do not actually cause so much damage but 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:49.319
 so hard to destroy are that you make damn nervous 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.089
 can 

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:54.799
 assuming the units find their way to the goal because almost one thing belongs 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.599
 not exactly to the strength of the program 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.599
 Allo here full of north 

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:04.619
 the other left 

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:10.539
 noteworthy in this context, however, is that 2 needs only in 1999 

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:13.539
 to an online mode rated the Battlenet came 

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:17.239
 before that one had to play the CS even more direct last to each other 

00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:22.779
 although at that time already have the much more complex StarCraft 

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:26.839
 the fans were still battles with Bach and humans until 2002 

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:30.329
 because Warcraft was talking with his iconic image and the weird one 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.639
 Setting has always been a whole lot funnier than its space counterpart 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:36.280
 Blaschke actors not 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.399
 rinse incredibly 

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:40.049
 "If you ask me, that's the reason 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.150
 why there is no Board of StarCraft today and all attempts are easy 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.539
 that I am also satisfied failed miserably
