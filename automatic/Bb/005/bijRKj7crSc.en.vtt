screws<00:00:15.570> on<00:00:15.719> this<00:00:15.900> one<00:00:16.080> so<00:00:16.949> we'll<00:00:17.160> take<00:00:17.279> that

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
screws on this one so we'll take that

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.160 
screws on this one so we'll take that
off<00:00:17.640> push<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.270> side<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.900> what<00:00:19.050> you're

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170

looking<00:00:19.260> for<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:19.920> this<00:00:20.039> bolt<00:00:20.310> right<00:00:20.400> here<00:00:20.580> to

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
looking for is this bolt right here to

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.179 
looking for is this bolt right here to
level<00:00:21.720> your<00:00:21.900> refrigerator<00:00:22.439> on<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.619> backside

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
level your refrigerator on the backside

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.210 
level your refrigerator on the backside
are<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.900> wheels<00:00:25.109> you<00:00:25.289> probably<00:00:25.680> cannot<00:00:25.949> see

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
are the wheels you probably cannot see

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.009 
are the wheels you probably cannot see
that<00:00:26.369> because<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.060> lighting<00:00:27.420> but<00:00:27.630> there

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
that because of the lighting but there

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.839 
that because of the lighting but there
it<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:29.130> then<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.310> course<00:00:29.519> on<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:29.789> side

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
it is and then of course on this side

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.910 
it is and then of course on this side
here's<00:00:30.359> your<00:00:30.480> water<00:00:30.660> filter<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.260> then<00:00:31.890> you

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
here's your water filter and then you

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.280 
here's your water filter and then you
have<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.219> same<00:00:32.430> wheel<00:00:32.640> now<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.960> want<00:00:34.140> that

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
have the same wheel now you want that

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.170 
have the same wheel now you want that
you<00:00:34.469> want<00:00:34.500> your<00:00:34.800> refrigerator<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.670> be<00:00:35.790> level

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
you want your refrigerator to be level

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.660 
you want your refrigerator to be level
and<00:00:36.590> you<00:00:37.590> want<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.950> be<00:00:38.070> approximately<00:00:38.610> a

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
and you want it to be approximately a

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.450 
and you want it to be approximately a
quarter<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.329> an<00:00:39.420> inch<00:00:39.770> higher<00:00:40.770> in<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.190> front

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
quarter of an inch higher in the front

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.010 
quarter of an inch higher in the front
so<00:00:41.670> if<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.120> your<00:00:42.210> refrigerator<00:00:42.750> looking

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
so if this is your refrigerator looking

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.110 
so if this is your refrigerator looking
from<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.290> side<00:00:43.340> you<00:00:44.340> want<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.550> be<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.700> quarter

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
from the side you want to be a quarter

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.459 
from the side you want to be a quarter
of<00:00:45.210> an<00:00:45.270> inch<00:00:45.329> so<00:00:45.510> they<00:00:45.629> have<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.840> be<00:00:45.930> exact<00:00:46.260> no

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
of an inch so they have to be exact no

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.260 
of an inch so they have to be exact no
but<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.920> definitely<00:00:47.250> needs<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.460> be<00:00:47.550> higher<00:00:47.969> in

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
but it definitely needs to be higher in

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.150 
but it definitely needs to be higher in
the<00:00:48.300> front<00:00:48.660> then<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.320> back<00:00:49.530> which<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:49.920> why

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
the front then the back which is why

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.369 
the front then the back which is why
these<00:00:51.090> are<00:00:51.270> designed<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.809> way<00:00:51.840> they<00:00:52.050> are<00:00:52.170> so

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
these are designed the way they are so

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.380 
these are designed the way they are so
when<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.590> tighten<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.430> way<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:54.059> bolt

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
when you tighten this this way this bolt

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.619 
when you tighten this this way this bolt
which<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.410> half<00:00:55.620> inch<00:00:55.860> bolt<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.460> pushes<00:00:57.329> the

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
which is a half inch bolt it pushes the

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.830 
which is a half inch bolt it pushes the
wheel<00:00:57.780> back<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.410> way<00:00:58.820> and<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.940> causes<00:01:00.180> the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
wheel back this way and it causes the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.319 
wheel back this way and it causes the
refrigerator<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.440> lift<00:01:01.620> up<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.309> if<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.149> look

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
refrigerator to lift up so if you look

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.920 
refrigerator to lift up so if you look
at<00:01:03.449> my<00:01:03.570> refrigerator<00:01:04.229> it's<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.680> little<00:01:05.010> bit<00:01:05.159> off

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
at my refrigerator it's a little bit off

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.200 
at my refrigerator it's a little bit off
and<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:06.990> reason<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.710> because<00:01:07.760> this<00:01:08.760> bolt

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
and the reason is is because this bolt

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.289 
and the reason is is because this bolt
is<00:01:09.479> farther<00:01:09.900> end<00:01:10.200> there<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.640> bolt<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.150> can

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
is farther end there this bolt you can

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.630 
is farther end there this bolt you can
probably<00:01:12.510> see<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:12.840> visually<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.400> needs

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
probably see that visually so this needs

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.719 
probably see that visually so this needs
to<00:01:14.700> be<00:01:14.790> tightened<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:16.259> way<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.740> recommend

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
to be tightened this way I recommend

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.240 
to be tightened this way I recommend
using<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.119> half<00:01:18.509> inch<00:01:18.689> socket<00:01:18.960> wrench<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.890> you

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
using a half inch socket wrench and you

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.609 
using a half inch socket wrench and you
simply<00:01:20.460> just<00:01:20.790> stick<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.330> on<00:01:21.420> here<00:01:23.960> and<00:01:24.960> you're

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
simply just stick it on here and you're

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.140 
simply just stick it on here and you're
going<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.799> tighten<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.490> not<00:01:26.640> hard<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.970> do

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
going to tighten it it's not hard to do

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.679 
going to tighten it it's not hard to do
doesn't<00:01:28.110> take<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.380> lot<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.590> strength<00:01:29.210> but<00:01:30.210> what

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
doesn't take a lot of strength but what

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.800 
doesn't take a lot of strength but what
will<00:01:30.869> happen<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:32.090> this<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.329> probably<00:01:33.659> take

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
will happen is this is probably take

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.550 
will happen is this is probably take
about<00:01:33.930> 20<00:01:34.409> turns<00:01:34.680> here<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:36.290> want<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.350> make<00:01:37.470> the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
about 20 turns here I want to make the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.160 
about 20 turns here I want to make the
video<00:01:37.799> longer<00:01:38.070> than<00:01:38.310> needs<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.670> be<00:01:38.790> but<00:01:39.170> you'll

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
video longer than needs to be but you'll

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.020 
video longer than needs to be but you'll
notice<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.799> butt<00:01:40.979> was<00:01:41.189> moved<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.790> tad

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
notice that the butt was moved to tad

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.240 
notice that the butt was moved to tad
bit<00:01:42.270> more<00:01:42.450> over<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.899> left<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:44.009> then<00:01:44.130> when

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
bit more over to the left so then when
