portable<00:00:34.620> ops<00:00:34.770> once<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.430> did<00:00:35.670> play<00:00:35.850> asset<00:00:36.270> and

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329

portable ops once I did play asset and
everything<00:00:36.630> but<00:00:36.780> that's<00:00:36.960> fine<00:00:37.110> but<00:00:37.680> looking

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
everything but that's fine but looking

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.700 
everything but that's fine but looking
at<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.550> though<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.170> the<00:00:40.170> review<00:00:40.559> itself

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
at this though is that the review itself

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.200 
at this though is that the review itself
doesn't<00:00:41.129> necessarily<00:00:41.579> match<00:00:41.730> up<00:00:41.910> with<00:00:42.149> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
doesn't necessarily match up with the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.910 
doesn't necessarily match up with the
score<00:00:42.660> because<00:00:42.870> if<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.140> game<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.320> 10<00:00:43.559> out<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.680> 10

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
score because if a game is 10 out of 10

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.590 
score because if a game is 10 out of 10
you<00:00:44.100> probably<00:00:44.399> wouldn't<00:00:44.670> what<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.120> wouldn't

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
you probably wouldn't what it wouldn't

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.510
