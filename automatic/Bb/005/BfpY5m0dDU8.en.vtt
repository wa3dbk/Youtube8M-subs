00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:23.839 
to fold this in half it's going to leave

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:27.359 
to fold this in half it's going to leave
a<00:00:23.869> dip<00:00:24.199> mark<00:00:24.970> then<00:00:25.970> you're<00:00:26.150> going<00:00:26.300> to<00:00:26.359> glue

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:27.369 
a dip mark then you're going to glue

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.009 
a dip mark then you're going to glue
where<00:00:28.369> it's<00:00:28.550> dented<00:00:28.849> or<00:00:29.300> you<00:00:29.449> can<00:00:29.599> even<00:00:29.720> mark

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
going to see it and because the glue is

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.960 
going to see it and because the glue is
going<00:00:34.160> to<00:00:34.220> hide<00:00:34.340> over<00:00:34.580> and<00:00:34.700> then<00:00:34.790> all<00:00:34.940> the

layers will hide it and then the diamond

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.740 
layers will hide it and then the diamond
will<00:00:36.980> be<00:00:37.070> on<00:00:37.160> top<00:00:37.340> so<00:00:37.580> if<00:00:37.760> you<00:00:38.360> want<00:00:38.540> to<00:00:38.600> market

going to glue the middle of the flower
with<00:00:48.470> a<00:00:48.650> dot<00:00:49.040> doesn't<00:00:49.640> really<00:00:49.850> matter<00:00:50.590> then

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
with a dot doesn't really matter then

you're<00:01:06.980> going<00:01:07.070> to<00:01:07.130> glue<00:01:07.340> this<00:01:07.550> part<00:01:07.909> again

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
you're going to glue this part again

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
you're going to glue this part again
you're<00:01:08.480> going<00:01:08.600> to<00:01:08.659> fold<00:01:08.810> this<00:01:08.990> side<00:01:09.050> and

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
you're going to fold this side and

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.500 
you're going to fold this side and
you're<00:01:09.470> going<00:01:09.560> to<00:01:09.680> meet<00:01:09.770> halfways<00:01:10.310> push<00:01:11.300> down

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
you're going to meet halfways push down

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.990 
you're going to meet halfways push down
it<00:01:11.690> kind<00:01:12.140> of<00:01:12.320> doesn't<00:01:12.710> burn<00:01:13.100> because<00:01:13.310> I<00:01:13.490> just

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
it kind of doesn't burn because I just

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.600 
it kind of doesn't burn because I just
um<00:01:14.240> weird<00:01:14.720> and<00:01:14.870> I'm<00:01:14.960> used<00:01:14.990> to<00:01:15.290> it<00:01:15.440> then<00:01:16.400> you're

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
um weird and I'm used to it then you're

um weird and I'm used to it then you're
going<00:01:16.729> to<00:01:16.790> glue<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:17.150> middle<00:01:17.750> a<00:01:17.990> little<00:01:18.950> bit

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
going to glue the middle a little bit

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.280 
going to glue the middle a little bit
then<00:01:20.330> you're<00:01:20.510> going<00:01:20.600> to<00:01:20.659> do<00:01:20.810> it<00:01:20.930> to<00:01:21.080> all<00:01:21.260> the

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
then you're going to do it to all the

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:37.810 
then you're going to do it to all the
other<00:01:21.770> ones<00:01:22.130> so<00:01:34.000> fold<00:01:36.040> then<00:01:37.040> you're<00:01:37.490> going<00:01:37.700> to

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
other ones so fold then you're going to

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.750 
other ones so fold then you're going to
get<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:39.200> side<00:01:39.740> where<00:01:39.950> you<00:01:40.100> see<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:40.490> glue<00:01:40.729> and

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
get the side where you see the glue and

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.630 
get the side where you see the glue and
the<00:01:40.970> dent<00:01:41.330> you<00:01:42.200> are<00:01:42.409> going<00:01:42.620> to<00:01:42.740> glue<00:01:43.400> in<00:01:43.549> the

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
the dent you are going to glue in the

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.940 
the dent you are going to glue in the
middle<00:01:45.159> then<00:01:46.159> this<00:01:46.670> side<00:01:47.119> where<00:01:47.479> it<00:01:47.720> this<00:01:48.650> side

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
middle then this side where it this side

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.230 
middle then this side where it this side
where<00:01:49.610> you<00:01:49.790> see<00:01:50.119> how<00:01:50.420> it<00:01:50.690> has<00:01:50.900> glue<00:01:51.590> and<00:01:52.240> it's

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
where you see how it has glue and it's

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.660 
where you see how it has glue and it's
just<00:01:53.690> a<00:01:54.020> kind<00:01:54.350> of<00:01:54.500> like<00:01:54.619> a<00:01:54.740> mess<00:01:54.950> but<00:01:55.159> it's<00:01:55.220> fine

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
just a kind of like a mess but it's fine

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.490 
just a kind of like a mess but it's fine
because<00:01:55.790> you're<00:01:56.000> not<00:01:56.090> going<00:01:56.240> to<00:01:56.299> see<00:01:56.420> it<00:01:56.500> then

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
because you're not going to see it then

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.649 
because you're not going to see it then
you're<00:01:57.680> going<00:01:57.830> to<00:01:57.920> add<00:01:58.100> this<00:01:58.970> layer<00:01:59.420> with<00:01:59.630> a

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
you're going to add this layer with a

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.050 
you're going to add this layer with a
glue<00:01:59.990> on<00:02:00.670> this<00:02:01.670> top<00:02:02.060> of<00:02:02.180> the<00:02:02.270> layer<00:02:02.450> and<00:02:04.060> you're

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
glue on this top of the layer and you're

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.450 
glue on this top of the layer and you're
going<00:02:05.210> to<00:02:05.270> get<00:02:05.390> an<00:02:05.510> X<00:02:05.780> and<00:02:06.110> this<00:02:06.770> is<00:02:06.979> half<00:02:07.280> of

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
going to get an X and this is half of

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.889 
going to get an X and this is half of
your<00:02:07.610> bow<00:02:07.760> your<00:02:07.939> half<00:02:08.149> ways<00:02:08.450> you're<00:02:08.690> almost

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
your bow your half ways you're almost

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.010 
your bow your half ways you're almost
there

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
there

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.790 
there
then<00:02:12.020> you're<00:02:12.170> going<00:02:12.260> to<00:02:12.320> do<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.530> same<00:02:12.560> then

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
going to start adding just just going to

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:33.340 
going to start adding just just going to
get<00:02:23.750> bigger<00:02:23.900> and<00:02:24.170> bigger<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:32.140> then<00:02:33.140> you're

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
get bigger and bigger and then you're

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.860 
get bigger and bigger and then you're
going<00:02:33.470> to<00:02:33.530> glue<00:02:33.710> on<00:02:33.830> top<00:02:34.040> of<00:02:34.160> your<00:02:34.280> phone<00:02:34.460> again

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
going to glue on top of your phone again

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.650 
going to glue on top of your phone again
the<00:02:35.870> middle<00:02:36.170> where<00:02:36.350> it's<00:02:36.470> kind<00:02:37.250> of<00:02:39.040> messy

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
the middle where it's kind of messy

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.800 
the middle where it's kind of messy
you're<00:02:41.660> going<00:02:41.900> to<00:02:41.990> glue<00:02:42.800> a<00:02:42.830> little<00:02:43.130> bit<00:02:43.250> on<00:02:43.810> the

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
you're going to glue a little bit on the

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.320 
you're going to glue a little bit on the
top<00:02:45.020> of<00:02:45.170> this<00:02:45.370> X<00:02:47.260> and<00:02:48.260> you're<00:02:48.470> going<00:02:48.620> to<00:02:49.330> across

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
top of this X and you're going to across

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.450 
top of this X and you're going to across
just<00:02:50.780> like<00:02:51.130> that<00:02:53.380> so<00:02:54.380> it's<00:02:54.560> almost<00:02:54.950> your<00:02:55.220> arm

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
just like that so it's almost your arm

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.180 
just like that so it's almost your arm
is<00:02:55.580> there<00:02:56.590> then<00:02:57.590> you're<00:02:57.800> going<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:57.980> get<00:02:58.070> the

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
is there then you're going to get the

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:21.530 
is there then you're going to get the
other<00:02:58.340> one<00:03:09.670> fold<00:03:10.670> it<00:03:10.850> in<00:03:10.970> half

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.869 

put<00:03:22.200> a<00:03:22.230> little<00:03:22.590> dot<00:03:22.920> I<00:03:23.069> hand<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.430> middle<00:03:23.700> this

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
put a little dot I hand the middle this

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:28.640 
put a little dot I hand the middle this
one<00:03:24.469> then<00:03:25.469> you're<00:03:25.739> going<00:03:25.950> to<00:03:26.989> fold<00:03:27.989> this<00:03:28.170> side

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
one then you're going to fold this side

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.339 
one then you're going to fold this side
down<00:03:29.370> so<00:03:30.980> then<00:03:32.480> right<00:03:33.480> here<00:03:33.510> it<00:03:33.900> doesn't<00:03:34.019> look

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
down so then right here it doesn't look

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.110 
down so then right here it doesn't look
like<00:03:34.409> it<00:03:34.980> just<00:03:35.219> looks<00:03:35.430> like<00:03:35.579> you<00:03:35.730> folded<00:03:36.060> it

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
like it just looks like you folded it

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.670 
like it just looks like you folded it
everywhere<00:03:36.480> so<00:03:36.659> you<00:03:36.719> don't<00:03:36.959> see<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.349> messy

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
everywhere so you don't see the messy

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.360 
everywhere so you don't see the messy
part<00:03:37.709> anymore<00:03:38.220> at<00:03:38.489> all<00:03:38.609> um<00:03:40.129> then<00:03:41.129> you're<00:03:41.280> going

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
part anymore at all um then you're going

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.880 
part anymore at all um then you're going
to<00:03:41.430> add<00:03:41.519> just<00:03:41.640> a<00:03:42.000> drop<00:03:42.599> of<00:03:42.930> glue<00:03:45.650> just<00:03:46.650> like

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
to add just a drop of glue just like

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.509 
to add just a drop of glue just like
that<00:03:48.680> well<00:03:49.680> not<00:03:49.829> just<00:03:49.889> like<00:03:50.189> that<00:03:50.370> does

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
that well not just like that does

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.970 
that well not just like that does
everyone<00:03:50.849> who<00:03:50.909> comes<00:03:51.150> out<00:03:51.359> differently<00:03:51.980> then

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
everyone who comes out differently then

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.589 
everyone who comes out differently then
you're<00:03:53.099> going<00:03:53.189> to<00:03:53.250> get<00:03:53.430> a<00:03:53.609> large<00:03:54.030> diamond<00:03:55.129> this

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
you're going to get a large diamond this

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.429 
you're going to get a large diamond this
large<00:03:57.599> diamond--<00:03:58.260> then<00:03:58.650> you're<00:03:59.609> going<00:03:59.730> to

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:00.439 
large diamond-- then you're going to

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:06.409 
large diamond-- then you're going to
place<00:04:01.439> it<00:04:01.470> in<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.859> middle<00:04:02.239> if<00:04:04.579> you're<00:04:05.579> you<00:04:06.389> can

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
for something but some people tend to

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.969 
for something but some people tend to

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
tend to just you know use them but I

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.349 
tend to just you know use them but I
just<00:04:20.310> use<00:04:20.459> my<00:04:20.609> fingers<00:04:20.639> because<00:04:21.030> I<00:04:21.090> find<00:04:21.269> it

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
just use my fingers because I find it

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:27.230 
just use my fingers because I find it
easier<00:04:21.539> and<00:04:22.910> if<00:04:24.289> your<00:04:25.289> bell<00:04:25.830> looks<00:04:26.190> kind<00:04:26.610> of<00:04:26.789> it

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
easier and if your bell looks kind of it

easier and if your bell looks kind of it
looks<00:04:27.630> good<00:04:28.020> but<00:04:28.650> if<00:04:28.740> like<00:04:28.919> on<00:04:29.130> these<00:04:29.729> parts<00:04:30.030> it

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
looks good but if like on these parts it

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.909 
looks good but if like on these parts it
looks<00:04:30.330> kind<00:04:30.539> of<00:04:30.599> like<00:04:30.690> floppy<00:04:31.169> on<00:04:31.409> one<00:04:31.620> end<00:04:31.800> and

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
looks kind of like floppy on one end and

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.189 
looks kind of like floppy on one end and
the<00:04:32.039> fog<00:04:32.220> and<00:04:32.430> other<00:04:32.610> you<00:04:33.389> could<00:04:33.570> also<00:04:33.750> glue

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
the fog and other you could also glue

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:35.750 
the fog and other you could also glue
them<00:04:34.380> down<00:04:34.409> a<00:04:34.650> little<00:04:34.830> bit<00:04:35.099> and<00:04:35.310> then<00:04:35.400> it'll<00:04:35.729> be

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
them down a little bit and then it'll be

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.600 
them down a little bit and then it'll be
like<00:04:36.180> just<00:04:36.360> cool<00:04:36.720> them<00:04:36.870> down<00:04:37.190> like<00:04:38.190> in<00:04:38.340> some

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
like just cool them down like in some

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.629 
like just cool them down like in some
areas<00:04:40.159> so<00:04:41.159> it<00:04:41.280> stays<00:04:41.520> down<00:04:41.810> dang<00:04:42.810> you're<00:04:42.990> gonna

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
areas so it stays down dang you're gonna

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:50.450 
areas so it stays down dang you're gonna
get<00:04:44.639> a<00:04:44.699> clip<00:04:46.159> none<00:04:47.159> of<00:04:47.190> these<00:04:47.370> little<00:04:48.210> I<00:04:49.460> tend

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
get a clip none of these little I tend

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.760 
get a clip none of these little I tend
to<00:04:50.610> just<00:04:50.729> clip<00:04:51.659> right<00:04:51.840> here<00:04:51.900> and<00:04:52.380> then<00:04:52.500> right

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
to just clip right here and then right

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.600 
here I get both of them like that and I
glue<00:05:15.330> right<00:05:16.080> in<00:05:16.349> the<00:05:16.530> middle<00:05:18.110> then<00:05:19.400> see<00:05:20.400> how<00:05:20.550> i

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
glue right in the middle then see how i

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.070 
glue right in the middle then see how i
have<00:05:20.909> that<00:05:21.120> extra<00:05:22.880> the<00:05:23.880> extra<00:05:24.300> I<00:05:24.509> just<00:05:24.750> glue

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
have that extra the extra I just glue

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.189 
have that extra the extra I just glue
right<00:05:25.259> there<00:05:25.530> so<00:05:26.400> my<00:05:27.000> snowflake<00:05:27.720> doesn't

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 
right there so my snowflake doesn't

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:34.080 
right there so my snowflake doesn't
gather<00:05:28.620> and<00:05:29.180> kind<00:05:30.180> of<00:05:30.300> mess<00:05:30.570> up<00:05:30.779> I<00:05:31.400> just<00:05:32.400> glue

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
gather and kind of mess up I just glue

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:47.390 
gather and kind of mess up I just glue
on<00:05:34.690> both<00:05:34.900> sides<00:05:34.930> then<00:05:38.040> I<00:05:42.419> make<00:05:43.419> a<00:05:43.449> snowflake

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.460
