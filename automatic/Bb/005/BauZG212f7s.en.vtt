complaint about Antonio Gates another
veteran<00:02:52.800> actually<00:02:53.280> I<00:02:53.459> think<00:02:53.940> it<00:02:54.000> got

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
veteran actually I think it got

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.979 
veteran actually I think it got
suspended<00:02:54.510> though<00:02:54.750> for

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
suspended though for

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.510 
suspended though for
performance-enhancing<00:02:55.620> or<00:02:56.190> something<00:02:56.459> like

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
performance-enhancing or something like

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.400 
performance-enhancing or something like
that<00:02:56.580> substance<00:02:57.090> infused<00:02:57.540> I<00:02:57.780> think<00:02:58.200> he<00:02:58.260> took

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
that substance infused I think he took

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.500 
that substance infused I think he took
some<00:02:58.620> bad<00:02:58.770> mojo<00:02:59.100> in<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.459> offseason<00:02:59.610> didn't

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
some bad mojo in the offseason didn't

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.060 
some bad mojo in the offseason didn't
know<00:03:00.600> it<00:03:00.660> was<00:03:00.810> bad<00:03:00.930> mojo<00:03:01.230> so<00:03:01.470> he<00:03:01.590> got<00:03:01.739> suspended

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
know it was bad mojo so he got suspended

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.160 
know it was bad mojo so he got suspended
but<00:03:02.430> he<00:03:02.940> coulda<00:03:03.120> made<00:03:03.270> the<00:03:03.420> list<00:03:03.540> Vernon<00:03:04.020> Davis

made<00:03:31.410> this<00:03:31.500> I<00:03:31.739> guess<00:03:31.950> it<00:03:32.459> could<00:03:32.670> be<00:03:32.700> kind<00:03:32.850> of

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
made this I guess it could be kind of

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.610 
made this I guess it could be kind of
hard<00:03:33.120> to<00:03:33.180> make<00:03:33.360> a<00:03:33.420> top<00:03:33.630> five<00:03:33.810> tidings<00:03:34.350> I<00:03:34.410> think

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
hard to make a top five tidings I think

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.920 
hard to make a top five tidings I think
it's<00:03:34.739> a<00:03:34.769> solid<00:03:35.010> list<00:03:35.280> but<00:03:35.850> I<00:03:35.880> definitely<00:03:36.660> think

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
it's a solid list but I definitely think

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.720 
it's a solid list but I definitely think
Martellus<00:03:37.410> finishes<00:03:37.769> been<00:03:37.920> on<00:03:38.010> it<00:03:38.130> maybe<00:03:38.250> take

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
Martellus finishes been on it maybe take

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.910 
Martellus finishes been on it maybe take
