always like to finish with a final spray

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.980 
always like to finish with a final spray
to<00:04:50.770> set<00:04:50.979> the<00:04:51.130> style<00:04:51.490> as<00:04:51.970> you<00:04:52.090> can<00:04:52.240> see<00:04:52.570> the

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
to set the style as you can see the

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.930 
to set the style as you can see the
waves<00:04:53.199> are<00:04:53.380> larger<00:04:53.860> and<00:04:54.099> flow<00:04:54.430> more<00:04:54.669> freely

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
waves are larger and flow more freely

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.270 
waves are larger and flow more freely
with<00:04:55.270> this<00:04:55.449> section<00:04:55.900> where<00:04:56.590> you<00:04:56.710> have<00:04:56.740> the

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
with this section where you have the

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:05.390 
with this section where you have the
first<00:04:57.580> look

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.159 

the<00:05:06.400> second<00:05:06.820> technique<00:05:07.030> involves<00:05:07.810> using<00:05:08.080> the

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
the second technique involves using the

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.010 
the second technique involves using the
curling<00:05:08.560> wand<00:05:08.620> instead<00:05:09.310> of<00:05:09.400> curling<00:05:09.700> iron<00:05:10.090> the

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
curling wand instead of curling iron the

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.010 
curling wand instead of curling iron the
sets<00:05:11.290> are<00:05:11.470> very<00:05:11.500> similar<00:05:12.840> essentially<00:05:13.840> you're

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
sets are very similar essentially you're

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.200 
sets are very similar essentially you're
wrapping<00:05:14.440> the<00:05:14.560> hair<00:05:14.740> around<00:05:14.800> the<00:05:15.430> wand<00:05:15.580> and

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
wrapping the hair around the wand and

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.350 
wrapping the hair around the wand and
holding<00:05:16.450> it<00:05:16.570> for<00:05:16.750> 5<00:05:16.960> to<00:05:17.139> 7<00:05:17.290> seconds<00:05:17.919> now<00:05:18.700> I<00:05:18.730> find

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
holding it for 5 to 7 seconds now I find

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.970 
holding it for 5 to 7 seconds now I find
that<00:05:19.540> I<00:05:19.600> don't<00:05:19.720> need<00:05:20.020> to<00:05:20.200> spray<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.500> hair<00:05:20.800> with

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:20.980 
that I don't need to spray the hair with

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.220 
that I don't need to spray the hair with
hairspray<00:05:21.220> before<00:05:21.580> curling<00:05:22.120> because<00:05:23.020> with

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.230 
hairspray before curling because with

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.310 
hairspray before curling because with
the<00:05:23.350> one<00:05:23.560> the<00:05:23.770> clothes<00:05:24.070> are<00:05:24.370> much<00:05:24.910> tighter

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
the one the clothes are much tighter

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.350 
the one the clothes are much tighter
into<00:05:26.320> last<00:05:26.530> longer<00:05:26.830> I<00:05:27.280> do<00:05:27.550> like<00:05:27.880> to<00:05:27.910> set<00:05:28.270> it

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
into last longer I do like to set it

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.580 
into last longer I do like to set it
however<00:05:28.510> after<00:05:29.320> I<00:05:29.380> finish<00:05:29.740> the<00:05:29.860> curls

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
however after I finish the curls

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.260 
however after I finish the curls
continue<00:05:32.590> these<00:05:32.740> steps<00:05:32.919> by<00:05:33.520> curling<00:05:34.000> the<00:05:34.240> hair

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
continue these steps by curling the hair

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.750 
continue these steps by curling the hair
in<00:05:34.630> the<00:05:34.720> same<00:05:34.990> direction<00:05:35.230> in<00:05:35.889> parallel

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
in the same direction in parallel

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.129 

the<00:06:39.610> next<00:06:39.970> step<00:06:40.150> is<00:06:40.300> what<00:06:40.419> I<00:06:40.479> find<00:06:40.750> sucks<00:06:40.990> the

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:41.139 
the next step is what I find sucks the

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:42.809 
the next step is what I find sucks the
