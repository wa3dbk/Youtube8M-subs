00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.530
 hello to all the guys that discusses it 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.230
 hope we go especially for a 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.490
 easter egg super easter egg so on the 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.740
 map of video libraries so I you 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.260
 advise to take the destroyer and 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.500
 grenades and play indeed not 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.260
 with a bot one box will suffice and 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.980
 play in rookie trouble will be the 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.960
 best option 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.480
 then you will first go 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.340
 in the secret room a secret room 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.070
 of the one shot card that is found 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.780
 here or pressed x to access this 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.860
 part of the card that is secret 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:51.559
 then with the two grenades you 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.659
 have you go throws where so 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.190
 I do not know how they found this 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:57.050
 secret the people who found but 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.760
 it's really abused so the first 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.019
 grenade fail that's why I want you 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.580
 advise to put some grenades a little 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.559
 everywhere on the map it will serve you 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.700
 roof are for the future is then created 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.350
 a painting portrait falls as well as a 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.090
 little piece of paper with 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.450
 drops of blood you will then have to shoot 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:19.219
 above and a small flame will illuminate 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:22.219
 around this gears logo where he stays 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:24.140
 this flame to light so what wants 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:27.259
 to say that there are still seven paintings to find 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.740
 you'll have to shoot seven little pieces of 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.570
 paper 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.820
 so with the drops of blood as 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.600
 this one to confirm you have 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.439
 shoot on it 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.350
 a black smoke will appear as well as a 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:42.170
 ball in the head of the character that there 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.630
 on the portrait so me 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.429
 personally for this secret I have 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.200
 really tried to look for the little ones 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:50.450
 scraps of paper myself I put 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.429
 a lot of time and there is only one 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.020
 that I have not managed to enthrall even I 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:55.310
 had to go ask on the forums to 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.649
 people because I really did not find 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.850
 not if not all the others it's me who 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.979
 have looked for them from the past really 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.149
 a lot of time so that's why I 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.979
 am still pretty happy 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.049
 after the base all the rest of the secret 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.789
 I really did nothing myself 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.619
 secret released about three days ago 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.720
 so here you see there are portraits 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.970
 with paintings with drops of 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.040
 blood not very hard to be holes and so 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.690
 it's always a portrait with 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.220
 under a small paper with drops 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.640
 of blood sua I put a little time to 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.110
 find it 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.280
 when they were really 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.330
 look and I was aching because there 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.900
 that made several points that renÃ© 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.150
 in front of game 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.769
 do not find and there finally I the 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.329
 just found it downstairs and was not 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.989
 very complicated to find but sometimes 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:34.760
 it is in the simplicity that comes the 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.980
 difficulty then look at this one 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.980
 also in another secret room to 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.540
 the place of incendiary grenades 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.799
 not easy either if he found I 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.269
 had a little trouble and you will see the 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.500
 latest 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.489
 so here I think so ended because 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.900
 I really went around the map 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.420
 and there we see that it misses a small 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.859
 light on 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.269
 so I say to myself ben thin it takes 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:54.560
 absolutely I find it 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.879
 and as your meal I went to see 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.709
 on the forums I was told because 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.440
 it's weird waiting there there is no 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.900
 of painting so suddenly I told myself 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.190
 slim why why he finally has in 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.720
 anyway I have not seen the painting at this 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.739
 place there maybe I have a lot of pain 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.480
 looked at it and so there I shot the 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.370
 last little piece of paper everything is 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.680
 turned on so you come back to the place of 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.079
 one shot in the secret room and there 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.489
 something magical is going to happen on the 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.069
 array is going to have red eyes that 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:26.510
 are going out and the famous reaper is going 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:29.060
 get out the reaper the character that two 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.650
 members a week can control 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.949
 on the xbox live is a character 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.660
 almost invincible and must be killed 

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:38.000
 then you come with your pistol 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.949
 and absolutely fantastic on a 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.409
 multiplayer map you duel 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:44.720
 with the reaper so that's how 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:46.400
 concludes this story is that it takes 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.840
 kill the rippers then I reassure you 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.780
 for those who will try this 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.250
 story hey you're going to be galley like 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.319
 I 'm a writer I had a lot 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.579
 of luck there to kill him because in 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.560
 did he shoot his balls out of 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.599
 grenade launcher the bausch alleud case that 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.340
 have bounced between wall in it 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:04.099
 drew two who came to him 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.049
 that they have greatly weakened otherwise he 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.819
 worth one shot with moves so 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:10.430
 his enemies really I had to try 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.349
 very frankly thirty times 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.099
 to try to kill him so that's it 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:17.570
 I hope before was beautiful the most 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.729
 explicit possible for this little 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.620
 historic lookout not too much seen from 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.620
 commented videos in French 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.990
 French by donation in French for 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.389
 explain this little and ste rule lo 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.070
 for those who are interested in it is 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:33.320
 a little bit of the delirium of a strong guiraud 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.139
 of judgment that rice scared because in 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.060
 do we get a medal if we get it 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.580
 kills online ie there are some 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:47.840
 epic games forums the developer of the 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:49.159
 game that every week and he who says to 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.380
 two people who is him two 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:53.240
 people who elects who is I know 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.240
 not how we say that annoys me two 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:59.060
 random people on the forums of 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.430
 piguet that can control the reaper 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.900
 this almost invincible character who 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.760
 hovers in the air and slides 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.289
 see an owl on the cross and if we 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.719
 gets to meet him in a party 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:10.310
 public and we manage to kill him on 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:12.830
 gets a medal and a camouflage 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.349
 so that's pretty fun and here and there 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.849
 beat me like that so we can have a 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:18.860
 little bit the feel of the meeting and if we 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:21.080
 never saw it and see what it 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.789
 looks like but unfortunately this 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.139
 easter egg does not give the medal nor 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.360
 camouflage but it's still a 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:28.520
 easter egg super nice and especially who has 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.639
 been found almost a month after the 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.440
 exit from the game so really no one 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:35.240
 was expecting it at this little historical 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.700
 it means that you are 3 maps 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.620
 there will be some here too I hope that 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.450
 this video will have pleased you guys I 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.110
 you say next ciao for this will be 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.110
 later
