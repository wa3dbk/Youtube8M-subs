00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
just go away so that's going today seed

like<00:03:51.250> I<00:03:51.370> said<00:03:51.580> this<00:03:51.850> map<00:03:52.150> and<00:03:52.360> the<00:03:52.450> seed<00:03:52.690> is

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
like I said this map and the seed is

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.840 
like I said this map and the seed is
full<00:03:53.440> of<00:03:53.680> mountain<00:03:54.040> ranges<00:03:54.370> is<00:03:54.489> probably<00:03:54.730> the

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
full of mountain ranges is probably the

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.000 
full of mountain ranges is probably the
most<00:03:54.970> mountain<00:03:55.870> range<00:03:56.049> see<00:03:56.500> that<00:03:56.650> I<00:03:56.680> have<00:03:56.799> done

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
most mountain range see that I have done

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.979 
most mountain range see that I have done
yet<00:03:57.280> but<00:03:57.790> I<00:03:57.850> just<00:03:57.970> like<00:03:58.269> it<00:03:58.420> for<00:03:58.540> so<00:03:58.810> many

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
yet but I just like it for so many

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.509 
yet but I just like it for so many
reasons<00:03:59.260> now<00:03:59.680> before<00:03:59.950> I<00:03:59.980> go<00:04:00.099> into<00:04:00.130> the

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
reasons now before I go into the

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.670 
reasons now before I go into the
positives<00:04:00.910> about<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.299> seed<00:04:01.510> there<00:04:02.230> is<00:04:02.260> one

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
positives about the seed there is one

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.289 
positives about the seed there is one
downfall<00:04:03.010> about<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:03.610> see<00:04:03.760> now<00:04:03.940> you'll<00:04:04.120> notice

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
downfall about the see now you'll notice

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.509 
downfall about the see now you'll notice
over<00:04:04.510> here<00:04:04.630> there<00:04:05.349> is<00:04:05.470> a<00:04:05.500> large<00:04:05.860> area<00:04:06.250> of<00:04:06.430> the

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
over here there is a large area of the

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.729 
over here there is a large area of the
trees<00:04:06.880> there<00:04:07.569> isn't<00:04:07.840> many<00:04:07.900> many<00:04:08.170> many<00:04:08.440> trees

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
trees there isn't many many many trees

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.710 
trees there isn't many many many trees
on<00:04:08.890> this<00:04:09.010> map<00:04:09.700> so<00:04:09.730> you<00:04:10.000> can<00:04:10.120> see<00:04:10.330> yourself

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
on this map so you can see yourself

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.150 
on this map so you can see yourself
pretty<00:04:11.049> much<00:04:11.140> mine<00:04:11.440> and<00:04:11.590> all<00:04:11.709> these<00:04:11.920> and

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
pretty much mine and all these and

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.400 
pretty much mine and all these and
replacing<00:04:12.760> a<00:04:12.940> sapling<00:04:13.330> so<00:04:13.750> it's<00:04:13.870> not<00:04:14.049> too<00:04:14.200> hard

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
replacing a sapling so it's not too hard

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.379 
replacing a sapling so it's not too hard
it's<00:04:14.620> kind<00:04:14.830> of<00:04:14.920> it<00:04:15.069> put<00:04:15.790> it<00:04:15.880> this<00:04:15.970> way<00:04:16.120> kind<00:04:16.329> of

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
it's kind of it put it this way kind of

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.690 
it's kind of it put it this way kind of
a<00:04:16.450> challenge<00:04:16.840> typed<00:04:17.109> seed<00:04:17.739> should<00:04:17.950> I<00:04:18.070> say<00:04:18.280> so

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
a challenge typed seed should I say so

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.849 
a challenge typed seed should I say so
like<00:04:19.120> every<00:04:19.450> seed<00:04:19.600> I<00:04:19.690> do<00:04:19.930> they<00:04:20.169> dis<00:04:20.410> does<00:04:20.620> have

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
like every seed I do they dis does have

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.350 
like every seed I do they dis does have
four<00:04:21.130> villages<00:04:21.310> now<00:04:21.640> I'm<00:04:21.760> gonna<00:04:21.910> not<00:04:22.270> gonna

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
four villages now I'm gonna not gonna

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.810 
four villages now I'm gonna not gonna
point<00:04:23.020> out<00:04:23.289> all<00:04:23.620> of<00:04:23.650> them<00:04:23.919> but<00:04:24.280> I<00:04:24.340> will<00:04:24.490> go<00:04:24.610> to<00:04:24.669> a

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
point out all of them but I will go to a

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.159 
point out all of them but I will go to a
few<00:04:25.030> them<00:04:25.150> pretty<00:04:25.450> much<00:04:25.479> locate<00:04:25.900> where<00:04:26.050> they

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
few them pretty much locate where they

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.050 
few them pretty much locate where they
are<00:04:26.289> now<00:04:26.710> I<00:04:26.740> like<00:04:27.010> this<00:04:27.160> seed<00:04:27.370> because<00:04:27.789> it<00:04:27.940> has

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
are now I like this seed because it has

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.850 
are now I like this seed because it has
lots<00:04:28.330> of<00:04:28.479> mountain<00:04:28.750> ranges<00:04:29.020> now<00:04:29.200> when<00:04:29.740> you

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
lots of mountain ranges now when you

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.340 
lots of mountain ranges now when you
have<00:04:29.979> a<00:04:30.039> lots<00:04:30.280> of<00:04:30.430> mountain<00:04:30.729> ranges<00:04:30.760> in<00:04:31.180> a<00:04:32.080> seed

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
have a lots of mountain ranges in a seed

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.230 
have a lots of mountain ranges in a seed
that<00:04:32.710> means<00:04:33.039> there<00:04:33.280> are<00:04:33.310> many<00:04:33.520> cave<00:04:33.820> systems

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
that means there are many cave systems

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.790 
that means there are many cave systems
underneath<00:04:34.720> and<00:04:34.930> that<00:04:35.020> is<00:04:35.140> very<00:04:35.320> true<00:04:35.590> this

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
underneath and that is very true this

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.770 
underneath and that is very true this
one<00:04:35.979> now<00:04:36.100> I<00:04:36.130> will<00:04:36.370> explore<00:04:36.729> and<00:04:36.970> show<00:04:37.450> you<00:04:37.510> what

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
one now I will explore and show you what

about<00:04:40.900> to<00:04:41.229> see<00:04:41.410> now<00:04:41.620> why<00:04:42.190> I<00:04:42.220> like<00:04:42.460> this<00:04:42.580> seed<00:04:42.760> in

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
about to see now why I like this seed in

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.760 
about to see now why I like this seed in
this<00:04:42.970> area<00:04:43.270> is<00:04:43.419> because<00:04:43.570> as<00:04:44.200> you<00:04:44.289> can<00:04:44.440> see<00:04:44.590> this

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
this area is because as you can see this

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.469 
this area is because as you can see this
is<00:04:44.919> the<00:04:45.010> other<00:04:45.039> area<00:04:45.430> where<00:04:45.700> has<00:04:45.910> many<00:04:46.210> many

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
is the other area where has many many

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.140 
is the other area where has many many
trees<00:04:46.720> on<00:04:46.930> my<00:04:46.960> map<00:04:47.200> it<00:04:47.560> all<00:04:47.620> shows<00:04:47.770> us<00:04:47.979> m/s<00:04:48.580> and

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
trees on my map it all shows us m/s and

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.629 
trees on my map it all shows us m/s and
biome<00:04:49.510> and<00:04:49.690> it<00:04:49.810> also<00:04:49.990> has<00:04:50.380> a<00:04:50.680> mushroom<00:04:51.400> biome

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
biome and it also has a mushroom biome

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.100 
biome and it also has a mushroom biome
so<00:04:51.729> you've<00:04:51.850> got<00:04:51.940> three<00:04:52.180> in<00:04:52.300> one<00:04:52.479> location<00:04:52.780> to

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
so you've got three in one location to

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.480 
so you've got three in one location to
complain<00:04:53.350> what<00:04:53.470> punk<00:04:53.919> your<00:04:54.039> house<00:04:54.190> right

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
complain what punk your house right

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.100 
complain what punk your house right
there<00:04:54.729> and<00:04:54.940> then<00:04:55.090> you<00:04:55.210> be<00:04:55.360> soared<00:04:55.630> for<00:04:55.900> many

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
there and then you be soared for many

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.700 
there and then you be soared for many
many<00:04:56.320> things

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
many things

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.790 
many things
now<00:04:57.100> there's<00:04:57.400> always<00:04:57.669> villages<00:04:58.660> on<00:04:58.840> sand<00:04:59.229> but

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
now there's always villages on sand but

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.040 
now there's always villages on sand but
this<00:04:59.889> one<00:05:00.039> is<00:05:00.160> kind<00:05:00.400> of<00:05:00.460> a<00:05:00.610> weird<00:05:01.360> styled

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
this one is kind of a weird styled

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.930 
this one is kind of a weird styled
village<00:05:02.440> because<00:05:02.710> it's<00:05:02.830> half<00:05:03.100> on<00:05:03.340> half<00:05:03.639> off

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
village because it's half on half off

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.090 
village because it's half on half off
water<00:05:04.270> so<00:05:04.660> here<00:05:04.870> it's<00:05:05.229> kind<00:05:05.470> of<00:05:05.530> weird<00:05:05.770> like<00:05:05.979> a

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
water so here it's kind of weird like a

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.430 
water so here it's kind of weird like a
half<00:05:06.280> house<00:05:06.520> right<00:05:06.760> there<00:05:06.970> so<00:05:07.180> all<00:05:07.389> day<00:05:07.990> their

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
half house right there so all day their

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.529 
half house right there so all day their
villages<00:05:09.160> on<00:05:09.310> this<00:05:09.460> one<00:05:09.639> are<00:05:09.850> in<00:05:10.120> the<00:05:10.360> best

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
villages on this one are in the best

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:12.029 
villages on this one are in the best
shape<00:05:10.660> should<00:05:10.930> I<00:05:11.050> say<00:05:11.229> they're<00:05:11.650> very<00:05:11.680> unique

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 
shape should I say they're very unique

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:15.330 
shape should I say they're very unique
in<00:05:12.400> a<00:05:12.430> different<00:05:13.000> place<00:05:13.180> now<00:05:14.039> along<00:05:15.039> with<00:05:15.070> the

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
in a different place now along with the

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.790 
in a different place now along with the
seat<00:05:15.580> having<00:05:15.940> many<00:05:16.210> trees<00:05:16.720> in<00:05:17.020> just<00:05:17.650> one

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
seat having many trees in just one

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.090 
seat having many trees in just one
location<00:05:18.430> it<00:05:18.789> also<00:05:19.060> has<00:05:19.530> lots<00:05:20.530> of<00:05:20.680> flat<00:05:20.919> lands

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
location it also has lots of flat lands

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.350 
location it also has lots of flat lands
as<00:05:21.280> well<00:05:21.430> as<00:05:21.520> mountain<00:05:21.789> ranges<00:05:22.030> now<00:05:22.180> I'm<00:05:22.240> going

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
as well as mountain ranges now I'm going

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.610 
as well as mountain ranges now I'm going
to<00:05:22.419> go<00:05:22.539> over<00:05:22.690> there<00:05:22.810> then<00:05:22.930> we<00:05:23.020> just<00:05:23.200> let<00:05:23.500> the

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
to go over there then we just let the

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.270 
to go over there then we just let the
world<00:05:23.860> general

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
world general

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.390 
world general
quick<00:05:24.880> but<00:05:25.270> it<00:05:25.360> also<00:05:25.480> has<00:05:25.870> on<00:05:26.830> the<00:05:27.100> other<00:05:27.250> side

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
quick but it also has on the other side

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.830 
quick but it also has on the other side
that<00:05:27.430> a<00:05:27.580> map<00:05:27.760> has<00:05:27.940> many<00:05:28.150> many<00:05:28.389> mountains<00:05:28.720> again

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
that a map has many many mountains again

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.510 
that a map has many many mountains again
so<00:05:29.139> it's<00:05:29.320> just<00:05:29.410> full<00:05:29.740> of<00:05:29.770> mountains<00:05:30.190> it's<00:05:30.370> full

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
so it's just full of mountains it's full

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.890 
so it's just full of mountains it's full
of<00:05:30.610> cave<00:05:30.820> systems<00:05:31.210> as<00:05:31.300> you<00:05:31.360> can<00:05:31.540> see<00:05:31.720> down

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
of cave systems as you can see down

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.590 
of cave systems as you can see down
there<00:05:32.139> and<00:05:32.740> it's<00:05:33.430> just<00:05:33.520> it's<00:05:34.030> random<00:05:34.360> seas

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
there and it's just it's random seas

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.240 
there and it's just it's random seas
where<00:05:34.900> you<00:05:35.020> can<00:05:35.200> see<00:05:35.590> yourself<00:05:35.680> living<00:05:36.040> look

you're<00:05:39.580> gonna<00:05:39.639> see<00:05:39.910> cave<00:05:40.150> systems<00:05:40.570> under

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
you're gonna see cave systems under

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.080 
you're gonna see cave systems under
there<00:05:40.930> you've<00:05:41.080> got<00:05:41.110> lots<00:05:41.710> and<00:05:42.010> lots<00:05:42.190> of<00:05:42.340> not

even got off the ravines here just look

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.150 
even got off the ravines here just look
at<00:05:46.840> that<00:05:46.930> would<00:05:47.139> being<00:05:47.350> really<00:05:47.740> really<00:05:47.980> cool

at that would being really really cool

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.040 
at that would being really really cool
cave<00:05:48.550> system<00:05:48.880> over<00:05:49.060> there<00:05:49.210> k<00:05:49.480> sister<00:05:49.810> moment

cave system over there k sister moment

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.930 
cave system over there k sister moment
there<00:05:50.200> and<00:05:50.680> now<00:05:50.800> here<00:05:51.310> is<00:05:51.400> another<00:05:51.430> village

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
there and now here is another village

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.640 
there and now here is another village
now<00:05:52.090> there<00:05:52.210> is<00:05:52.300> actually<00:05:52.660> four<00:05:53.110> villages<00:05:53.320> I

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
now there is actually four villages I

that every single seed I do as you can

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.860 
that every single seed I do as you can
see<00:05:57.430> here's<00:05:57.640> another<00:05:57.669> one<00:05:58.000> half<00:05:58.210> on<00:05:58.450> half<00:05:58.660> off

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
see here's another one half on half off

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.290 
see here's another one half on half off
water<00:05:59.200> I<00:05:59.530> do<00:05:59.830> not<00:06:00.010> know<00:06:00.190> what<00:06:00.370> I<00:06:00.400> did<00:06:00.520> but<00:06:01.180> if
