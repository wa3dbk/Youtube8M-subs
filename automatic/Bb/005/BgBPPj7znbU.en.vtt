00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.950 
the grips are set in words a little bit
which<00:01:41.409> meant<00:01:42.409> I<00:01:43.030> didn't<00:01:44.030> have<00:01:44.210> to<00:01:44.329> change<00:01:44.630> any

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
of the cables which I led to believe I

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.270 
of the cables which I led to believe I
