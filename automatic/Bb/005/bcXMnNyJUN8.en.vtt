00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:15.470 
here's the thing that makes life so

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.130 
here's the thing that makes life so
interesting<00:00:16.419> the<00:00:17.419> theory<00:00:17.900> of<00:00:17.929> evolution

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
interesting the theory of evolution

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.300 
interesting the theory of evolution
claims<00:00:19.099> only<00:00:19.550> the<00:00:19.699> strong<00:00:19.759> shall<00:00:20.419> survive

maybe<00:00:22.310> so<00:00:22.640> maybe<00:00:23.199> so<00:00:25.239> but<00:00:26.239> the<00:00:26.419> theory<00:00:26.869> of

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
maybe so maybe so but the theory of

but what the odds don't know is this
isn't<00:00:51.050> a<00:00:51.109> math<00:00:51.320> test

isn't a math test
this<00:00:53.300> is<00:00:53.570> a<00:00:53.630> completely<00:00:54.290> different<00:00:54.800> kind<00:00:55.100> of

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
this is a completely different kind of

this is a completely different kind of
test<00:00:56.020> one<00:00:57.020> where<00:00:57.310> passion<00:00:58.310> has<00:00:59.210> a<00:00:59.240> funny<00:00:59.630> way

so<00:01:03.070> before<00:01:03.220> you<00:01:03.520> step<00:01:03.820> up<00:01:04.000> to<00:01:04.059> the<00:01:04.239> starting

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750

line before the whistle blows and the

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.250 
line before the whistle blows and the
clock<00:01:08.590> starts<00:01:09.010> ticking<00:01:09.540> just<00:01:10.540> remember<00:01:11.050> out
