Ryan acca do to you know six cubic point

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.550 
Ryan acca do to you know six cubic point
on<00:00:15.360> six<00:00:15.900> point<00:00:16.170> four<00:00:16.410> cubic<00:00:16.920> foot<00:00:17.160> box<00:00:18.560> pushing

a 4000 d and I have yeah 3 batteries

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.620 
a 4000 d and I have yeah 3 batteries
over<00:00:34.020> there<00:00:34.200> one<00:00:35.190> red<00:00:35.430> one<00:00:35.790> yellow<00:00:36.090> over<00:00:36.480> there
