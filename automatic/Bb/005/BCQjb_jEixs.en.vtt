00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
have placed them in a project table and

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.430 
have placed them in a project table and
to<00:00:45.239> make<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.539> stone<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:45.989> which<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.320> first

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
to make the stone on which is the first

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.350 
to make the stone on which is the first
I'm<00:00:46.649> going<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.829> go<00:00:46.950> through<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.760> five<00:00:48.030> stone

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
I'm going to go through it is five stone

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.340 
I'm going to go through it is five stone
bricks<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.350> golem<00:00:49.800> animation<00:00:50.370> call<00:00:51.350> right

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
bricks and a golem animation call right

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.100 
bricks and a golem animation call right
so<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.219> stone<00:00:53.430> golem<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.059> set<00:00:54.300> for<00:00:54.570> oak<00:00:54.870> wood

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
so this stone golem is set for oak wood

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.889 
so this stone golem is set for oak wood
planks<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.680> his<00:00:56.100> target<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.969> color<00:00:57.449> set<00:00:57.780> the

planks and his target is a color set the

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.770 
planks and his target is a color set the
pink<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.289> can<00:00:58.440> change<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.949> like<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.120> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
pink you can change that like so the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.740 
pink you can change that like so the
changes<00:01:01.170> on<00:01:01.350> him<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:02.520> his<00:01:02.789> target<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.300> said<00:01:03.719> to

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
changes on him so his target is said to

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.050 
changes on him so his target is said to
hear<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.739> what<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.040> guy<00:01:05.250> does<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.670> he<00:01:05.790> moves

perception in intelligence coach I'll

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
perception in intelligence coach I'll
show<00:02:47.320> later<00:02:47.850> so<00:02:48.870> I've<00:02:49.870> got<00:02:50.050> average<00:02:50.170> recipe<00:02:50.680> so

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
show later so I've got average recipe so
