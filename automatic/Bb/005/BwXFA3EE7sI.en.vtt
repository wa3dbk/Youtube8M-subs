00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:13.019
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:17.550
 new video from the bed gaming tv today 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.949
 about the gopro hero the new will be on 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.230
 10 10 could be traded 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.450
 I 've got it through today too 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.490
 Luckily that's why I can 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:32.340
 already do the video today and 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:34.410
 uploading is saying that they only 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.649
 insane 150 euro costs so 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.510
 really newcomers to the entry-level segment 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:45.239
 Of course you have yourself 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:48.030
 disadvantages with the specs and that the 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.019
 We have specs here on the left 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.019
 side of the packaging 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:01:01.589
 we have a receptivity of 30 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:02.639
 and 520 ps at 1080p 24p but 60 fps and 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.500
 50 fr 

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:07.229
 that means you could even do a bit 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.049
 slomo with it at 27 fps and 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.810
 always this old review and at 27 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.259
 horses and even the super view at 60 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.820
 and 50 in the photos you have one 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:23.960
 resolution of 5 megapixels in these 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:27.060
 stock exchanges and five pictures per second 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:31.020
 and then we share labs 05 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:35.520
 second interval this time lapse 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.560
 function still have the gopro 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.579
 Of course, software has to be used 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.560
 download 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:49.729
 here is coco briefly described on the 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:57.359
 construction and very important only 32 gb 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:59.880
 SD card at clearest and on the left 

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:02.969
 side of the right side of the packaging 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.399
 then we have the accessories which itself 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:09.240
 still in this small package 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.960
 these are these flat plugs and then 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.860
 the curved one 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:18.220
 the gopro for example on helmets or 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:21.420
 on the motorcycle or other things off 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.420
 now screw the packaging 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.420
 on 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:44.909
 and then 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:51.579
 I feel a little bit sensitive 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:55.299
 pick up so then come right here 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:03:01.299
 contrary to the quick start guide and the 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:05.859
 usual gopro hero stickers the 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:10.239
 Guarantee of the guarantee guide and that was 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:13.329
 it with the written stuff then 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:16.209
 Here we have the roughly per delikt still 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:22.409
 on page the look times later and then 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:22.409
 yes we have the little patch live 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.780
 really just is simple and one 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.950
 bent so you have to be new then 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:39.370
 buy and that's what I think 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:46.359
 back new back for the for the 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:49.870
 gopro and of course a usb cable like that 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:56.729
 then we pack the whole thing thinks 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:56.729
 you on page 2 and the roma 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:11.129
 so that's my first gopro right now 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:16.660
 do not know how to use them 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:20.940
 here is apparently the the stand for 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.940
 the lips around the indent 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.820
 that's what you do with it 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:30.610
 So you make the housing on yes that 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.910
 is yes you can gopro waterproof yes 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:38.710
 not take out of this housing but 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:46.690
 this to the micro sd card purely to 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:51.120
 do and the usb micro mini usb here 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:54.550
 so you can charge the gopro 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:58.500
 That's how you fix it with it 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:02.560
 is she waterproof again yes 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:07.199
 someone can probably find the one 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:10.630
 that adjust the inclination 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.889
 There is nothing more to say here now 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:17.380
 I think I have that a bit 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:25.470
 wrong here already pinched 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:29.320
 better but then she also takes the 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:33.759
 dsd is clear I have my sd 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:37.000
 card not there but only 2 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:39.430
 gigabyte micro sd and fit two 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.460
 minutes on it and that's why you can do that 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:46.960
 also leave directly so that was that 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.220
 unboxing to the new gopro hero i 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.960
 Hope you liked it because there is 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.400
 you liked it gives a thumbs up 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.259
 if your suggestions for improvement 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.699
 I have relatively few videos 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:57.659
 then please make it down to the 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:06:00.699
 comments but really productive 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:02.680
 comments and otherwise I would
