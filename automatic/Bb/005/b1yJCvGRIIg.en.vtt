00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
seen as the most innovative product of

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.740 
seen as the most innovative product of
the<00:00:17.820> ephah<00:00:18.090> 2010<00:00:19.970> by-election<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.539> press

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.349 
the ephah 2010 by-election of the press
so<00:00:21.779> what<00:00:22.470> we<00:00:22.590> see<00:00:22.769> here<00:00:22.800> what<00:00:23.070> makes<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:23.640> so

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
so what we see here what makes so so

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.050 
so what we see here what makes so so
unique<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.900> very<00:00:25.199> science<00:00:26.160> small<00:00:26.789> form

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
unique is a very science small form

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.839 
unique is a very science small form
factor<00:00:27.119> with<00:00:27.680> something<00:00:28.680> around<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:29.070> 20<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.519> 29

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
factor with something around a 20 to 29

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.590 
factor with something around a 20 to 29
grams<00:00:30.210> but<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.140> function<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:34.219> separate

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
grams but the function is to separate

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.760 
grams but the function is to separate
this<00:00:36.600> place<00:00:36.870> being<00:00:37.559> usable<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.399> different

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
this place being usable in different

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.380 
this place being usable in different
different<00:00:40.770> ways<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.640> basically<00:00:42.000> what<00:00:42.239> you

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
different ways so basically what you

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.549 
different ways so basically what you
have<00:00:47.000> and<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.120> whole<00:00:48.239> lower<00:00:48.480> part<00:00:48.840> can<00:00:49.410> be

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
have and the whole lower part can be

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.069 
have and the whole lower part can be
used<00:00:49.739> as<00:00:50.010> additional<00:00:50.550> functions<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.809> for

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
used as additional functions and for

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.049 
used as additional functions and for
example<00:00:52.320> keyboards<00:00:53.129> or<00:00:53.579> different<00:00:53.910> other

generations Michel Platini so let me
just<00:01:33.240> quickly<00:01:33.360> go<00:01:33.659> into<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.990> system<00:01:34.350> here<00:01:34.590> you

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
just quickly go into the system here you

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.149 
just quickly go into the system here you
see<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.820> turn<00:01:36.090> this<00:01:36.570> place<00:01:36.890> here<00:01:37.890> we<00:01:38.040> have

see the to turn this place here we have

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.039 
see the to turn this place here we have
stretched<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.970> whole<00:01:39.090> did<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.479> display<00:01:39.900> has

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
stretched the whole did the display has

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.469 
stretched the whole did the display has
been<00:01:40.259> one<00:01:40.590> desktop<00:01:41.100> what<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.820> can<00:01:42.000> do<00:01:42.119> by<00:01:42.329> are

very<00:02:13.220> easily<00:02:14.019> better<00:02:15.019> than<00:02:15.650> just<00:02:15.920> with<00:02:16.129> the

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
very easily better than just with the

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.250 
very easily better than just with the
small<00:02:16.519> icons<00:02:16.970> of<00:02:17.120> an<00:02:17.269> explorer<00:02:17.660> for<00:02:17.900> example

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
small icons of an explorer for example

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.229 
small icons of an explorer for example
so<00:02:18.410> here<00:02:18.530> that's<00:02:18.739> a<00:02:18.860> very<00:02:19.040> neat<00:02:19.250> thing<00:02:19.519> we<00:02:20.120> have

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
so here that's a very neat thing we have

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.820 
so here that's a very neat thing we have
also<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.660> possibility<00:02:20.720> to<00:02:21.200> use<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.650> real

device not use the regulates my client
is<00:02:45.110> turning<00:02:45.470> off<00:02:45.590> so<00:02:46.160> that<00:02:47.470> basically<00:02:48.470> we<00:02:48.920> have

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
is turning off so that basically we have

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.220 
is turning off so that basically we have
slightly<00:02:49.910> longer<00:02:50.209> battery<00:02:50.510> life<00:02:50.660> this<00:02:51.079> you

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
slightly longer battery life this you

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.490 
slightly longer battery life this you
can<00:02:51.410> just<00:02:51.650> change<00:02:52.250> put<00:02:52.610> it<00:02:52.730> on<00:02:52.879> and<00:02:53.690> so<00:02:54.200> on

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
can just change put it on and so on

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.289 
can just change put it on and so on
so<00:02:54.920> what<00:02:55.069> we<00:02:55.220> see<00:02:55.340> that<00:02:55.370> here<00:02:55.700> is<00:02:55.849> also<00:02:56.060> the
