you can actually hear the tire seal you
can<00:01:16.560> also<00:01:16.770> see<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.130> little<00:01:17.340> air<00:01:17.490> bubbles<00:01:17.820> that

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
can also see the little air bubbles that

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.060 
can also see the little air bubbles that
came<00:01:18.210> up<00:01:18.390> from<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.630> rim<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.170> tire<00:01:21.979> so<00:01:22.979> I'm

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
came up from the rim and the tire so I'm

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.490 
came up from the rim and the tire so I'm
going<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.220> take<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.689> strap<00:01:24.689> off<00:01:24.930> because<00:01:25.290> you

we<00:01:28.619> finished<00:01:29.009> filling<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.460> up

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
we finished filling it up

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.010 
we finished filling it up
if<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.630> tire<00:01:31.079> itself<00:01:31.530> doesn't<00:01:31.740> take<00:01:32.040> much

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
if this tire itself doesn't take much

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.700 
if this tire itself doesn't take much
and<00:01:34.020> I'm<00:01:34.200> using<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.729> pancake<00:01:36.110> style<00:01:37.110> air

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
and I'm using a pancake style air

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.569 
and I'm using a pancake style air
compressor<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.579> gives<00:01:38.790> up<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.030> 140<00:01:39.840> psi<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:41.040> I

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
compressor it gives up to 140 psi and I

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.510 
compressor it gives up to 140 psi and I
just<00:01:41.790> have<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.090> set<00:01:42.329> as<00:01:42.450> high<00:01:42.600> as<00:01:42.659> possible

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
just have this set as high as possible

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.700 
just have this set as high as possible
to<00:01:44.520> initially<00:01:44.880> get<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.210> seal<00:01:45.500> once<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.590> get

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
to initially get the seal once you get

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.230 
to initially get the seal once you get
the<00:01:46.829> seal<00:01:47.009> back<00:01:47.310> off<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.729> pressure<00:01:47.880> because

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
the seal back off the pressure because

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.249 
the seal back off the pressure because
you<00:01:48.270> don't<00:01:48.450> want<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.630> blow<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.930> tire<00:01:51.049> and<00:01:52.049> make

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
you don't want to blow the tire and make

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.190 
you don't want to blow the tire and make
sure<00:01:52.409> it's<00:01:52.619> clean<00:01:52.799> around<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.490> rim<00:01:54.170> and<00:01:55.170> that

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
sure it's clean around the rim and that

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.440 
sure it's clean around the rim and that
between<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.829> tire<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.280> rim<00:01:56.460> before<00:01:57.060> you

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
between the tire and the rim before you

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.760 
between the tire and the rim before you
do<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.079> don't<00:01:58.110> have<00:01:58.290> this<00:01:58.409> problem
