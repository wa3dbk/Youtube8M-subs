00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.410 
and show you what that did now I have a
soil<00:04:27.710> block<00:04:27.950> with<00:04:28.220> a<00:04:28.250> hole<00:04:28.550> in<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:28.760> top<00:04:29.000> that

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
soil block with a hole in the top that

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.190 
soil block with a hole in the top that
just<00:04:29.450> fits<00:04:30.790> my<00:04:31.790> smaller<00:04:32.150> block<00:04:32.450> so<00:04:32.780> I<00:04:32.810> can<00:04:33.020> just

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
just fits my smaller block so I can just

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.650 
just fits my smaller block so I can just
set<00:04:33.410> it<00:04:33.530> in<00:04:33.650> when<00:04:33.860> it's<00:04:33.980> time<00:04:34.190> to<00:04:34.340> transplant

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.600 

so<00:04:39.170> now

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.450 

I<00:04:41.640> have<00:04:42.240> this<00:04:42.420> system<00:04:43.010> make<00:04:44.010> the<00:04:44.160> smaller

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
I have this system make the smaller

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.060 
I have this system make the smaller
blocks<00:04:44.790> about<00:04:45.210> the<00:04:45.390> scenes<00:04:45.690> in<00:04:45.930> it<00:04:46.080> once

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
blocks about the scenes in it once

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.870 
blocks about the scenes in it once
they're<00:04:47.390> sprouted<00:04:48.390> set<00:04:49.230> them<00:04:49.380> in<00:04:49.760> to<00:04:50.760> the

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
they're sprouted set them in to the

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.660 
they're sprouted set them in to the
bigger<00:04:51.060> block<00:04:51.330> and<00:04:52.020> they<00:04:52.560> just<00:04:52.770> slide<00:04:53.640> right

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
bigger block and they just slide right

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.040 
bigger block and they just slide right
in

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.320 

and<00:04:56.170> you're<00:04:56.380> outside<00:04:56.800> all<00:04:57.190> right<00:04:57.910> so<00:04:58.210> what
