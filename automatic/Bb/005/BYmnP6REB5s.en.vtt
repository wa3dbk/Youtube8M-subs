00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Tell me guys, what are you saying, watch well? 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.080
 Welcome to another flashback video 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.660
 we are getting support life from a 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.870
 video and I 'm going to talk about support 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.719
 about the items is how to start what 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.990
 to do where the affair is, by the way, the fight 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.270
 joadson the time of oracle purchase and 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.210
 these things well before talking about the 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.310
 Heroes and what I think of them is everyone 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.859
 the types of supporting heroes to be 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.230
 used have a jana a defensive mode 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.940
 we have the lioness in aggressive mode have a 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.950
 defense accent we have halo with that 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.140
 by her death very powerful for 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.690
 eliminate gay email marketing fight 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.539
 break that catarina when you come back 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.260
 breaking down when you come back does not want 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:52.289
 say we have the trash padak gate we have 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.899
 The blitz strikes he pulls throw himself to 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.270
 Up then you mean support can find 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.489
 that does not make so much difference so it 's a 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.829
 of the main faces in a book 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.710
 flash genes that kerry will carry 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.030
 you damage has the adc that will give 2 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.869
 you have to protect then you mean 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.420
 this what you have to have a support 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.820
 Above this defense for them the decision is 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.460
 and I even consider where the pots 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.560
 discipline with carrie is you and 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.049
 cleaning the same way you have to more 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.799
 protect and protect the team all makes 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.420
 logical function can have a very 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:31.170
 important also beats light beam in the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.869
 zone with the last to break one who 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.090
 barack gate that we give you have the jana 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.659
 which is very defensive and is considered a 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.200
 the best supports on the defensive is to 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.020
 what a bragante to break the one in which 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.700
 give them good talking and I'll talk 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.570
 with him said sometimes I'll start with 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.729
 a pot with two sides excuses and 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.490
 users two video is with that 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.820
 language that has in the mass and yellow in the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.939
 end of the video and also with that 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.000
 speech you win the masses is the 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:11.879
 items are pretty basic you will put 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.380
 the bulwark only has more than one 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.360
 your appetite is very 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.930
 strong the issue put bollatti case 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.430
 you will not need the first item is 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.530
 very good, I kicked him 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.630
 first because Fred still 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.640
 when you have it is 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.000
 a beach hitch has attracted and even 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.190
 Trying to run away is very good so I 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.560
 told coast to the first I star 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.870
 I am the biological father in more than one Appendix 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.000
 I think Bolatti is a magic defense item 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.560
 that gives to everybody in area is logical 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.110
 to step on morumbi but there is resistance 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.790
 but it's bigger then it's worth it 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.240
 we have that item also of 10 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.330
 we have the main item of our bild that 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.940
 It's the one I forgot is ruby ​​a thing that if the 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.620
 his name on my head is he puts 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.380
 almost war has fallen every time you 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.870
 they return to base but do not need a thing 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.300
 it's support never closes the bild it 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.770
 happens with the support of the sport as 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.030
 different from the other heroes 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:12.000
 you carry a down leather boot was 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.460
 of movement 5 is at the discretion of 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.730
 The boot also depends on how you 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.610
 Is the match is her crying is the imt 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:24.030
 whales and always has a video slot 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.580
 the oracle I always carry video and 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.610
 whenever I give the 10 minutes I already 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.550
 I bought an oracle, that's a fight too. 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.210
 up to 8 during the 10 minutes if 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:39.480
 puts June 11 dragon is the fight of it 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:42.990
 is constant and before 20 years 17 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.930
 puts on video also in the baron is son 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:48.990
 crucial points that have television are 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.959
 one thing also about keeping what is 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:54.270
 good to have is to have circulated in the blue onu network 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.820
 enemy character consolation of diego is 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.680
 This is very critical for what you are 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.510
 breaks that great or to know who 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.420
 is going down that is rising 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.380
 usually the game does not win without the 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.380
 booth 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:11.730
 so if you are in the boat you will have 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:13.830
 there is a red or yellow side 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.630
 be on the red side you will have a 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.049
 raid potato 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.450
 so this is key is to have saved 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.000
 is at the end of the video is that the matrix is 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.639
 Now you're seeing is that I'm not here. 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.090
 I'm speaking Latin and fight. 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:32.340
 the last exam in area I find the area more 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.530
 generally not in a position to 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.509
 Got the time to catch everyone that I 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.569
 I fought diagonally 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:42.689
 Ok I used diagonal flash and I used 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:44.490
 thus managing to get everyone's been 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:46.949
 calculated logical game an average of two 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:50.249
 years then for me and I teach routine 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:53.460
 close the tad let kill the face of 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:55.979
 close and help gay so I'm not afraid 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:59.159
 to use flash and integer on the display 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:01.020
 this will be routine if you play and 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:03.270
 support and I want you to have 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.639
 more support because this is already difficult to 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.639
 key may be all political strife by 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.930
 top thank more support i always 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.719
 said he was lazy 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.250
 so it's something has to break we have 

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:16.259
 to do more support I think that who 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.389
 You know you have to go to the 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:20.430
 others because this is totally 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:23.310
 Thank you, thank you. 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:26.580
 so far it's never a small test 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:29.969
 now at the end and at the end will have 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.349
 the macy's and the streets that I use are me 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:34.169
 tell you a little of the things that the 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:37.379
 next is whether you can wear glasses 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:41.610
 ability and defense or regeneration of 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:44.129
 mana and holo per second or power of 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.020
 skill and gold I like to use 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:48.060
 defense of probability when he played 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.520
 heroes that you are with from afar and only lost 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.500
 title is you use common when playing 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.099
 of lioness that I boto from the defense fund 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.539
 and three gold per second and the margins 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:59.909
 are always the same 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:03.860
 well thank you said the video is register 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:03.860
