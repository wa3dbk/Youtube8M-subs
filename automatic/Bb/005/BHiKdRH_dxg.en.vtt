00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
first of all here is the whole system

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.740 
first of all here is the whole system
it's<00:00:35.040> completely<00:00:35.580> done<00:00:35.790> I've<00:00:36.030> got<00:00:36.210> one<00:00:36.450> white

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
it's completely done I've got one white

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.290 
it's completely done I've got one white
barrel<00:00:37.170> up<00:00:37.320> there<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.800> three<00:00:38.579> blue<00:00:38.879> barrels

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
barrel up there and three blue barrels

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.510 
barrel up there and three blue barrels
the<00:00:40.079> white<00:00:40.350> barrel<00:00:40.680> allows<00:00:40.950> me<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.280> see<00:00:41.489> what

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
the white barrel allows me to see what

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.500 
the white barrel allows me to see what
the<00:00:41.850> water<00:00:42.480> level<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.030> right<00:00:45.030> now<00:00:45.239> it's

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
the water level is and right now it's

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.630 
the water level is and right now it's
about<00:00:45.660> one-third<00:00:46.500> full<00:00:46.860> it's<00:00:47.190> been<00:00:47.370> raining

about one-third full it's been raining

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.950 
about one-third full it's been raining
mostly<00:00:48.450> all<00:00:48.629> day<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.399> system<00:00:51.270> allows<00:00:51.570> for

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
mostly all day so the system allows for

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.979 
mostly all day so the system allows for
220<00:00:52.829> gallons<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.340> water<00:00:53.520> total<00:00:54.090> now<00:00:54.600> one<00:00:54.960> thing

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
220 gallons of water total now one thing

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.360 
220 gallons of water total now one thing
I<00:00:55.320> made<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.530> difference<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.160> or<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.820> change<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.660> is

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
I made a difference of or a change to is

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.450 
I made a difference of or a change to is
underneath<00:00:59.370> here<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.930> you<00:01:00.930> can<00:01:01.109> see<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.620> PVC

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
underneath here and you can see the PVC

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.630 
underneath here and you can see the PVC
pipe<00:01:02.699> now<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.930> part<00:01:04.229> right<00:01:04.259> here<00:01:04.610> this<00:01:05.610> this

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
pipe now this part right here this this

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.940 
pipe now this part right here this this
thing<00:01:06.090> right<00:01:06.300> here<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.630> what<00:01:07.020> they<00:01:07.170> call<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.440> PVC

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
thing right here is what they call a PVC

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.550 
thing right here is what they call a PVC
Union<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.819> what<00:01:09.360> this<00:01:09.509> will<00:01:09.780> allow<00:01:09.929> me<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.319> do

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
Union and what this will allow me to do

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.719 
Union and what this will allow me to do
is<00:01:10.890> take<00:01:11.670> apart<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.810> unscrews<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.950> then<00:01:14.610> it

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
is take apart this unscrews and then it

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.400 
is take apart this unscrews and then it
will<00:01:14.910> allow<00:01:15.060> me<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.330> take<00:01:15.509> apart<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.050> barrels

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
will allow me to take apart the barrels

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.800 
will allow me to take apart the barrels
one<00:01:16.649> by<00:01:16.860> one<00:01:17.190> now<00:01:17.819> I<00:01:17.849> had<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.240> do<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:18.569> so<00:01:18.780> I

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
one by one now I had to do this so I

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.150 
one by one now I had to do this so I
could<00:01:19.050> take<00:01:19.229> down<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.440> barrels<00:01:19.950> for

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
could take down the barrels for

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.040 
could take down the barrels for
maintenance<00:01:20.459> and<00:01:20.729> cleaning<00:01:21.090> later<00:01:21.390> on<00:01:21.660> and

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
maintenance and cleaning later on and

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.960 
maintenance and cleaning later on and
the<00:01:22.679> reason<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:23.039> had<00:01:23.190> to<00:01:23.280> put<00:01:23.459> these<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.849> is

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
the reason I had to put these in is

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.690 
the reason I had to put these in is
because<00:01:24.149> where<00:01:25.140> these<00:01:25.349> ties<00:01:25.740> are<00:01:26.069> right<00:01:26.310> here

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
because where these ties are right here

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.389 
because where these ties are right here
where<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.530> where<00:01:28.530> they're<00:01:28.649> going<00:01:29.009> into<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
where the where they're going into the

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.490 
where the where they're going into the
barrels<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.940> was<00:01:30.390> really<00:01:30.660> leaking<00:01:31.140> pretty<00:01:31.380> bad

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
barrels it was really leaking pretty bad

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.469 
barrels it was really leaking pretty bad
right<00:01:31.950> here<00:01:32.009> at<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.429> scene<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:32.940> I<00:01:32.970> had<00:01:33.239> to<00:01:33.270> glue

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
right here at the scene so I had to glue

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.669 
right here at the scene so I had to glue
all<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.959> those<00:01:34.140> together<00:01:35.899> so<00:01:36.899> that's<00:01:37.319> that's

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
all of those together so that's that's

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:39.169 
all of those together so that's that's
basically<00:01:38.130> what<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.489> underneath<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.060> the

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
basically what the underneath of the

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:41.449 
basically what the underneath of the
barrel<00:01:39.450> looks<00:01:39.660> like<00:01:39.899> let's<00:01:40.739> go<00:01:40.920> on<00:01:41.069> top<00:01:41.310> and

00:01:41.449 --> 00:01:41.459 
barrel looks like let's go on top and

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:44.960 
barrel looks like let's go on top and
look<00:01:41.580> at<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.789> top<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.149> barrels<00:01:42.420> now<00:01:43.970> ok

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
look at the top of the barrels now ok

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.309 
look at the top of the barrels now ok
and<00:01:45.149> we're<00:01:45.239> up<00:01:45.390> at<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.599> top<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.989> barrels

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:46.319 
and we're up at the top of the barrels

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:48.440 
and we're up at the top of the barrels
this<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.190> downspout<00:01:47.819> as<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.060> can<00:01:48.239> see<00:01:48.420> I

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
this is the downspout as you can see I

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.719 
this is the downspout as you can see I
have<00:01:48.539> it<00:01:48.840> coming<00:01:49.080> in<00:01:49.349> right<00:01:49.560> there<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.459> it's

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
have it coming in right there and it's

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.180 
have it coming in right there and it's
going<00:01:50.940> right<00:01:51.270> into<00:01:51.569> the<00:01:52.140> barrel<00:01:52.530> now<00:01:53.009> there's

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
going right into the barrel now there's

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.949

well<00:02:12.930> but<00:02:13.800> that's<00:02:13.980> another<00:02:14.250> screen<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:14.970> I

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
well but that's another screen that I

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.070 
well but that's another screen that I
put<00:02:15.270> over<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.840> air<00:02:16.080> holes

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
put over the air holes

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.520 
put over the air holes
in<00:02:17.470> each<00:02:17.920> of<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.280> three<00:02:18.750> blue<00:02:19.750> barrels<00:02:20.230> this

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
in each of the three blue barrels this

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.010 
in each of the three blue barrels this
will<00:02:20.740> allow<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.070> air<00:02:21.550> to<00:02:21.580> escape<00:02:22.000> when<00:02:22.720> the

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
will allow the air to escape when the

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.140 
will allow the air to escape when the
water<00:02:23.380> is<00:02:23.500> filling<00:02:24.010> these<00:02:24.280> barrels<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:25.030> that

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
water is filling these barrels and that

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.570 
water is filling these barrels and that
it<00:02:25.240> will<00:02:25.360> will<00:02:26.170> allow<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:26.800> barrels<00:02:27.280> fill<00:02:27.430> up

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
it will will allow the barrels fill up

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.520 
it will will allow the barrels fill up
to<00:02:27.700> begin<00:02:27.850> left<00:02:28.210> now<00:02:28.900> let's<00:02:29.050> go<00:02:29.170> take<00:02:29.320> a<00:02:29.380> look

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
to begin left now let's go take a look

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.410 
to begin left now let's go take a look
at<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.740> PVC<00:02:30.250> pipe<00:02:30.490> that<00:02:30.760> will<00:02:30.850> allow<00:02:31.060> me<00:02:31.240> to

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
at the PVC pipe that will allow me to

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.250 
at the PVC pipe that will allow me to
use<00:02:31.570> it<00:02:31.720> for<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.930> irrigation<00:02:32.200> system<00:02:34.260> okay

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
use it for the irrigation system okay

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.630 
use it for the irrigation system okay
and<00:02:35.470> for<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:35.680> last<00:02:35.860> bit<00:02:36.160> of<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.280> video<00:02:36.550> here

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
and for the last bit of the video here

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.240 
and for the last bit of the video here
you<00:02:37.060> can<00:02:37.210> see<00:02:37.450> I've<00:02:37.630> got<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:38.080> PVC<00:02:38.710> pipe<00:02:38.980> coming

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
you can see I've got the PVC pipe coming

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.490 
you can see I've got the PVC pipe coming
down<00:02:39.520> it's<00:02:39.760> right<00:02:39.970> there<00:02:40.270> and<00:02:40.570> it<00:02:40.840> curves<00:02:41.110> over

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
down it's right there and it curves over

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.670 
down it's right there and it curves over
and<00:02:41.830> then<00:02:42.430> it<00:02:42.550> goes<00:02:42.760> down<00:02:43.060> like<00:02:43.330> so<00:02:43.750> and<00:02:44.080> in<00:02:44.560> the

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
and then it goes down like so and in the

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.800 
and then it goes down like so and in the
first<00:02:44.950> part<00:02:45.340> right<00:02:45.520> here<00:02:45.550> that's<00:02:46.120> a<00:02:46.300> red<00:02:46.540> ball

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
first part right here that's a red ball

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.560 
first part right here that's a red ball
valve<00:02:47.170> and<00:02:47.470> then<00:02:47.920> I<00:02:48.010> put<00:02:48.190> a<00:02:48.220> 34<00:02:48.850> inch<00:02:49.120> PVC

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
valve and then I put a 34 inch PVC

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.390 
valve and then I put a 34 inch PVC
connector<00:02:50.110> right<00:02:50.620> here<00:02:50.680> it's<00:02:51.100> a<00:02:51.190> male

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
connector right here it's a male

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.370 
connector right here it's a male
threaded<00:02:51.790> and<00:02:52.060> then<00:02:52.420> I<00:02:52.450> can<00:02:52.660> hook<00:02:53.050> a<00:02:53.140> hose<00:02:53.350> to

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
threaded and then I can hook a hose to

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.020 
threaded and then I can hook a hose to
it<00:02:53.650> you<00:02:53.860> can<00:02:53.950> see<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.250> hose<00:02:54.400> going<00:02:54.760> along

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
it you can see the hose going along

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.660 
it you can see the hose going along
there<00:02:55.270> and<00:02:55.510> then<00:02:56.050> as<00:02:56.140> it<00:02:56.260> continues<00:02:56.770> down<00:02:56.800> then

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
there and then as it continues down then

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.130 
there and then as it continues down then
you<00:02:57.760> can<00:02:57.910> see<00:02:58.090> there's<00:02:58.270> another<00:02:58.510> ball<00:02:58.810> valve

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
you can see there's another ball valve

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.870 
you can see there's another ball valve
and<00:02:59.440> this<00:02:59.950> will<00:03:00.130> allow<00:03:00.340> me<00:03:00.580> to<00:03:00.730> do<00:03:00.850> the

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
and this will allow me to do the

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.610 
and this will allow me to do the
irrigation<00:03:01.600> for<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:01.959> back<00:03:02.230> of<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.470> garage

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
irrigation for the back of the garage

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.560 
irrigation for the back of the garage
which<00:03:02.980> is<00:03:03.130> right<00:03:03.340> here<00:03:03.370> this<00:03:03.970> is<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.209> back

this way this part will go all the way

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.990 
this way this part will go all the way
along<00:03:11.320> the<00:03:12.070> back<00:03:12.250> of<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.459> garage<00:03:12.640> and
