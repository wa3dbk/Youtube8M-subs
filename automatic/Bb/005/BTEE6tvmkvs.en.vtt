00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 
but i'm not only the internet and stuff

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:38.600 
but i'm not only the internet and stuff
but<00:06:37.560> i<00:06:37.620> was<00:06:37.830> making<00:06:38.099> someone<00:06:38.339> who<00:06:38.399> you

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610

00:06:40.239 --> 00:06:40.249 
Jarrett's look at that

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:42.249 
Jarrett's look at that
to<00:06:40.459> Luis<00:06:40.609> Suarez<00:06:41.149> who<00:06:41.269> just<00:06:41.629> gets<00:06:41.719> a<00:06:41.899> simple
