assassin brothers but feeling that what

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.210 
assassin brothers but feeling that what
he<00:01:44.750> is<00:01:44.840> doing<00:01:44.869> is<00:01:45.200> right<00:01:45.439> he<00:01:45.619> just<00:01:45.650> felt<00:01:46.009> that

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
he is doing is right he just felt that

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.130 
he is doing is right he just felt that
the<00:01:46.399> Templar<00:01:46.790> order<00:01:46.820> is<00:01:47.149> more<00:01:47.390> correct<00:01:47.869> than

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
the Templar order is more correct than

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.200 
the Templar order is more correct than
what<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.470> assassins<00:01:48.860> are<00:01:48.920> doing<00:01:49.159> so<00:01:49.640> what

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
what the assassins are doing so what

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.429 
what the assassins are doing so what
what's<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.479> approach<00:01:50.840> there<00:01:51.140> because

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
what's the approach there because

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.050 
what's the approach there because
because<00:01:51.799> sometimes<00:01:52.460> you<00:01:52.670> want<00:01:52.820> to<00:01:52.880> tell<00:01:53.030> a

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
story from from the sort of the evo

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.889 
story from from the sort of the evo
perspective<00:01:55.549> sometimes<00:01:56.060> you<00:01:56.420> tell<00:01:56.630> from<00:01:56.780> a

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
perspective sometimes you tell from a

that theme of war throughout for the
exploration<00:05:10.399> actually<00:05:10.969> this<00:05:11.029> was<00:05:11.209> a<00:05:11.239> very

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:11.419 
exploration actually this was a very

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:13.829 
exploration actually this was a very
interesting<00:05:11.929> year<00:05:12.319> around<00:05:12.589> the<00:05:12.709> 1750s<00:05:13.459> we<00:05:13.579> had

00:05:13.829 --> 00:05:13.839 
interesting year around the 1750s we had

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:16.059 
interesting year around the 1750s we had
explorers<00:05:14.839> around<00:05:15.109> the<00:05:15.199> region<00:05:15.409> looking<00:05:15.889> for

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:16.069 
explorers around the region looking for

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:17.829 
explorers around the region looking for
a<00:05:16.099> new<00:05:16.249> location<00:05:17.029> so<00:05:17.389> i<00:05:17.419> think<00:05:17.629> the

00:05:17.829 --> 00:05:17.839 
a new location so i think the

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:19.659 
a new location so i think the
exploration<00:05:18.349> is<00:05:18.469> just<00:05:18.679> as<00:05:18.799> strong<00:05:18.889> as<00:05:19.189> in<00:05:19.549> the

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
exploration is just as strong as in the

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.149 
exploration is just as strong as in the
caribbean<00:05:20.119> a<00:05:20.209> Black<00:05:20.389> Flag<00:05:20.529> so<00:05:21.529> what<00:05:21.949> what's

hope<00:06:46.240> that<00:06:46.270> the<00:06:46.510> fans<00:06:46.750> will<00:06:46.870> see<00:06:47.139> that<00:06:47.320> the<00:06:47.440> two

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.590 
hope that the fans will see that the two

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.560 
hope that the fans will see that the two
stories<00:06:48.010> are<00:06:48.190> complementary<00:06:49.000> and<00:06:49.210> they<00:06:49.450> even

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:49.570 
stories are complementary and they even

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.719 
stories are complementary and they even
overlap<00:06:50.229> in<00:06:50.500> some<00:06:50.710> ways<00:06:50.889> so<00:06:51.070> there<00:06:51.220> will<00:06:51.340> be<00:06:51.370> a

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:51.729 
overlap in some ways so there will be a

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:53.550 
overlap in some ways so there will be a
good<00:06:52.270> experience<00:06:52.330> to<00:06:52.870> have<00:06:53.020> on<00:06:53.139> both<00:06:53.289> games
