00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.890
 you do all guys are rich for 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.200
 last activities italy and if even today 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.680
 with the player review of a man of the 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.280
 match 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.680
 ciro immobile 81 of or more then 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.020
 one seen compared to the version in iv e 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.070
 interesting features on paper 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.149
 but that in game 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.109
 let's see how they were evaluated 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.260
 80 ball control 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:45.760
 I have to honestly say a value to me 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.039
 the ball is badly found 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.530
 quite well enough 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:53.589
 well even palabili then we speak of the 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:57.100
 speed 79 of general value yes 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:58.449
 transforms into 77 of acceleration and 81 of 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.999
 full speed 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.699
 then for me acceleration is neither a 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:05.530
 pros and cons because in the end I have 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.630
 found the first step quite well 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.040
 it was not bad and then also the speed 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.130
 maximum in open field 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.490
 it wasn't so bad we say the value that 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:19.360
 I think it helps a lot and 79 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.070
 of agility because it also did text and 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.140
 left with the ball control with the 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.750
 lever without problems and has me a little 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.330
 amazed and then only has 68 of 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.480
 balance, however, this value 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.910
 value is not so low on the game 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.620
 because at 79 of strength he whistles that 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.140
 it also seemed a little more than this 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.960
 what amazed me a lot because of me 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.300
 I waited as a value without seeing the 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.410
 statistics at least 85 from what 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.710
 I saw in game because really 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:51.460
 it resisted a lot of shoved shoulders 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:55.450
 to tell the truth I was surprised then 62 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.430
 of passages with 50 of long and 72 of 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.970
 short we say the acceptable courts i 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:03.610
 long or used in a two-pronged attack 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.100
 and then community then points to the steps 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.720
 no he used them much if not 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.849
 in the two-way attack a 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.659
 big nothing so great is not 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:15.580
 one against but nothing of that and then 78's 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:17.200
 dribbling unfortunately I have to put the 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.270
 dribbling between encounter because the boys 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.670
 a little bit too complicated 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.580
 it is not a very strong counter we call it 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.460
 so sorry but I marveled 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.620
 that is, not astonished me a little 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.290
 amazed that he had 78 of 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.810
 dribbling but didn't have a dribble 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.760
 so great because oh well what about 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.740
 three star skill so it's a bit 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.630
 however penalized is however ciro 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.750
 immobile and an area striker then 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.690
 we can work around this is not a 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:51.180
 dribbling so high encounter though 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.350
 We do not say I really liked then to a 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.270
 85 withdrawal which we say the 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.990
 feature that raises a little more than 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.580
 curiosity and unfortunately that is not unfortunately 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.090
 in principle it has not me 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.920
 thrilled because it has 84 power 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.600
 shooting that is a great value 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.690
 let's say he was strong enough but 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.730
 not so strong that I didn't expect 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.190
 for me the most deceitful value of this 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.870
 player maybe for others is not so e 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.170
 the 90 finalization 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.390
 you guys for the games I played 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.090
 this was one of the most players 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.130
 scarce at the realization level than me 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.540
 have you ever tried so far you know that 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.000
 I always do with the players 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.220
 many things that I entered well but 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.440
 I really hated this player for 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.130
 the finalization of I would have given 50 of 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.990
 finalization 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.380
 you will see where one click wrong me 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:43.720
 casino of colas face to face with the goalkeeper 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.180
 at least as a bird of prey area I 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.890
 I was waiting for a sign instead of not coming 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.560
 in front of the goalkeeper and avati'm wrong 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.060
 he encounters, however, absurd 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.510
 I don't know, I also tried to place them 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.340
 of precision in any way but him 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.350
 he could not mark them to you 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.830
 had made 10 goals in a match and 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.810
 so i'm saying when i do 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.550
 I always repeat and we all repeat it 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.540
 of the staff the player reviews are always 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:12.340
 subjective and therefore I must tell you how 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.230
 I tried I did seven too 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.950
 matches is not that you don't try it not 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.870
 I used it, however, mine 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.840
 I did not like the realization gift 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.070
 then as an area bird of prey there is because it was 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.070
 always in fact the position 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.180
 positioning that value 91 value 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.130
 very high and I must say that it is 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.230
 absolutely a bit because it was always in 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.070
 position always there to try to score 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.750
 and then even the header is really 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.280
 excellent he made me two three types of head 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.350
 I didn't score but I went there 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.510
 very close and I must say that the coup 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.640
 head is really good 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.470
 and when he received the cross he was always 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.340
 also dangerous for physical strength 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.210
 other value 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.340
 other pro absolute and aggression 83 e 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.710
 he just loses the ball is immediately 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.920
 retrieve the ball and it's really one 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:02.130
 excellent feature that in the plans of 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.380
 these creatures now see the tops and flops 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.720
 among the tops I put a header 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.140
 Positively aggressive physical strength 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.990
 and flo finalization and dribbling vote 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.380
 final a 6.8 because we say we can 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.320
 to stay 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.690
 as a general rule it does not change for me 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.400
 much from the ref 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.040
 I was expecting a little more in the shooting but 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.650
 I was disappointed with medium high work there 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.570
 it is because it always repeats the imposition 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.610
 weak foot stars are good 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.740
 let's say sinister steps and you don't 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.910
 they were evil, however, the other more 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.950
 absolute finalization 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.750
 I told you I didn't like it very much 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.910
 no kids the radio ends here 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.980
 I hope you enjoyed it and nothing 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.110
 we reach at least 200,000 by the for 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:46.550
 national ciro and we see ourselves in a 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.550
 next video hi all guys
