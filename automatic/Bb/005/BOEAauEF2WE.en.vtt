see<00:00:30.300> new<00:00:30.689> weapon<00:00:31.170> but<00:00:31.710> it's<00:00:32.399> only<00:00:32.579> going<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.940> be

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
see new weapon but it's only going to be

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.280 
see new weapon but it's only going to be
the<00:00:33.270> n<00:00:33.360> 9<00:00:33.630> 10<00:00:33.840> 11<00:00:33.870> s<00:00:34.320> tak<00:00:35.180> so<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.899> what<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.170> is

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
the n 9 10 11 s tak so it is what it is

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.010 
the n 9 10 11 s tak so it is what it is
but<00:00:38.100> pretty<00:00:38.579> much<00:00:38.730> what<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.000> m1911<00:00:39.660> s<00:00:39.750> attack

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
but pretty much what the m1911 s attack

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.560 
but pretty much what the m1911 s attack
is<00:00:40.200> it's<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.649> m<00:00:41.100> 9<00:00:41.340> 10<00:00:41.550> 11<00:00:41.579> with<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.000> tactical

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
is it's a m 9 10 11 with a tactical

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.540 
is it's a m 9 10 11 with a tactical
light<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.140> suppressor<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.190> guess<00:00:44.370> that's

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
light and a suppressor so I guess that's

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.330 
light and a suppressor so I guess that's
kind<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:44.940> cool<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.300> was<00:00:45.390> exclusive<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.340> dice
