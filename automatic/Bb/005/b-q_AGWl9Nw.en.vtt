and dating is the same it goes forward
with<00:00:28.740> quality<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:29.400> we<00:00:29.550> have<00:00:29.730> now<00:00:30.019> two<00:00:31.019> players

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
with quality so we have now two players

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.990 
with quality so we have now two players
that<00:00:31.380> can<00:00:31.679> go<00:00:31.830> forward<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.340> they<00:00:32.850> will

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
that can go forward and they will

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.870 
that can go forward and they will
compete<00:00:33.210> for<00:00:33.660> their<00:00:34.230> positions<00:00:34.710> and

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
compete for their positions and

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:47.420 
compete for their positions and
hopefully<00:00:35.880> will<00:00:36.000> be<00:00:36.030> good<00:00:36.270> for<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.540> team<00:00:46.430> yeah

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
hopefully will be good for the team yeah

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.979 
hopefully will be good for the team yeah
i<00:00:47.460> think<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.700> hold<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.480> foreign<00:00:48.780> players

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
i think that hold the foreign players

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.860 
i think that hold the foreign players
they<00:00:49.890> will<00:00:50.070> need<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.250> time<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.789> need<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.539> pension

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
they will need a time I need the pension

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.420 
they will need a time I need the pension
the<00:00:51.899> mentality<00:00:52.379> but<00:00:52.590> both<00:00:52.829> plays<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.280> they

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
the mentality but both plays that they

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.549 
the mentality but both plays that they
are<00:00:53.550> really<00:00:53.730> really<00:00:54.030> good<00:00:54.120> professionals<00:00:54.840> so

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
are really really good professionals so

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.630 
are really really good professionals so
it's<00:00:55.770> one<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.129> things<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.399> we<00:00:56.520> were

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
it's one of the things that we were

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.040 
it's one of the things that we were
looking<00:00:56.670> for<00:00:57.000> place<00:00:57.510> with<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> strong

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
looking for place with a strong

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.639 
looking for place with a strong
mentality<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.789> they<00:00:59.789> can<00:00:59.969> compete<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:01.590> I

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
mentality and they can compete and so I

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.780 
mentality and they can compete and so I
thought<00:01:02.129> they<00:01:02.309> will<00:01:02.460> be<00:01:02.579> ok<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.350> the<00:01:04.350> day<00:01:04.559> to

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
thought they will be ok and the day to

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.179 
thought they will be ok and the day to
champion<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> Italian<00:01:06.950> tournament<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
champion the Italian tournament and the

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.340 
champion the Italian tournament and the
German<00:01:08.670> Turner<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.000> they<00:01:09.090> are<00:01:09.350> really

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
German Turner and they are really

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.440 
German Turner and they are really
difficult<00:01:10.619> tormance<00:01:11.130> high-level<00:01:11.880> strong

difficult tormance high-level strong

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.359 
difficult tormance high-level strong
player<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:12.990> thought<00:01:13.229> they<00:01:13.409> they<00:01:14.040> will<00:01:14.220> be

seen at the sauna maybe he will not play
it<00:01:30.030> up<00:01:30.119> almost<00:01:30.479> sure<00:01:30.750> he<00:01:30.900> will<00:01:31.020> not<00:01:31.170> play

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.950 
it up almost sure he will not play
against<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.880> Tamerlan<00:01:32.880> day<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.750> we<00:01:33.810> are

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
against a Tamerlan day and we are

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.679 
against a Tamerlan day and we are
working<00:01:34.110> now<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.710> we<00:01:35.490> will<00:01:35.640> see<00:01:35.850> but<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.450> terms

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
of the the Premier League I think that

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.090 
of the the Premier League I think that

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
both they can compete they can be ready

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.670 
both they can compete they can be ready
if<00:01:41.310> they<00:01:41.549> trained<00:01:42.090> properly<00:01:42.869> during<00:01:43.500> the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
if they trained properly during the

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.920 
if they trained properly during the
precision

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.410
