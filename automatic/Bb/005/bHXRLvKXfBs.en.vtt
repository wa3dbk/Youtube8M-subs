it you know it fundamentally hasn't

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.210 
it you know it fundamentally hasn't
changed<00:02:03.630> it's<00:02:03.750> still<00:02:03.810> about<00:02:04.229> being<00:02:04.619> physical

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
changed it's still about being physical

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.479

blocking<00:02:05.789> tackling<00:02:06.800> you<00:02:07.800> know<00:02:07.920> playing<00:02:08.310> with

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
blocking tackling you know playing with

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.340 
blocking tackling you know playing with
great<00:02:08.640> technique<00:02:09.209> but<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:09.959> terms<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.229> the

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
great technique but in terms of the

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.170 
great technique but in terms of the
schemes<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:11.009> schemes<00:02:11.310> have<00:02:11.430> become<00:02:11.880> a<00:02:11.910> lot

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
schemes the schemes have become a lot

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.600 
schemes the schemes have become a lot
more<00:02:12.239> complex<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.560> think<00:02:14.130> there's<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.400> lot

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
more complex and I think there's a lot

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.240 
more complex and I think there's a lot
more<00:02:14.670> on<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.120> player's<00:02:15.480> plate<00:02:15.900> today<00:02:16.170> off<00:02:16.950> the

more on a player's plate today off the

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.920 
more on a player's plate today off the

defense and had our blitzes off of it so

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.610 
defense and had our blitzes off of it so
play<00:02:35.790> books<00:02:36.030> are<00:02:36.209> much<00:02:36.239> thicker<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:36.989> there's

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
play books are much thicker and there's

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.710 
play books are much thicker and there's
a<00:02:37.680> lot<00:02:37.830> more<00:02:37.860> study<00:02:38.340> going<00:02:38.700> on<00:02:38.880> and<00:02:39.180> there's<00:02:39.630> a

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
a lot more study going on and there's a

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.950 
a lot more study going on and there's a
lot<00:02:39.900> more<00:02:40.130> meeting<00:02:41.130> time<00:02:41.370> that<00:02:41.579> happened

lot more meeting time that happened

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.600 
lot more meeting time that happened
now<00:02:42.170> which<00:02:42.470> i<00:02:42.620> think<00:02:42.680> is<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.070> hardest<00:02:43.310> thing

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
now which i think is the hardest thing

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.910 
now which i think is the hardest thing
for<00:02:44.000> a<00:02:44.090> young<00:02:44.150> college<00:02:44.600> player<00:02:45.020> to<00:02:45.320> adapt<00:02:45.650> to

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
for a young college player to adapt to

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.040 
for a young college player to adapt to
is<00:02:46.130> how<00:02:46.580> much<00:02:46.790> time<00:02:47.090> actually<00:02:47.390> spend<00:02:47.900> in

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
is how much time actually spend in

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.560 
is how much time actually spend in
