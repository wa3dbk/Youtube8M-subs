00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.310 
suggested that maybe he would feel less
lonely<00:00:14.309> if<00:00:14.730> he's<00:00:14.910> surrounded<00:00:15.299> by<00:00:15.599> both<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.230> the

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
lonely if he's surrounded by both of the

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.769 
lonely if he's surrounded by both of the
pairs<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.980> never<00:00:17.820> really<00:00:18.150> thought<00:00:18.359> about<00:00:18.420> it

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
pairs I never really thought about it

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:19.429 
pairs I never really thought about it
before

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
before

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.800 
before
when<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:20.160> first<00:00:20.369> changed<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.939> cage<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.390> just<00:00:21.600> had

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
when I first changed the cage I just had

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.870 
when I first changed the cage I just had
done<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.170> quickly<00:00:22.560> because<00:00:23.189> Grover<00:00:23.670> was

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
done it quickly because Grover was

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.830 
done it quickly because Grover was
really<00:00:24.180> upset<00:00:24.630> over<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.769> loss<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.220> rugby<00:00:26.810> so<00:00:27.810> I

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
really upset over the loss of rugby so I

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.630 
really upset over the loss of rugby so I
didn't<00:00:28.410> put<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.619> whole<00:00:29.010> lot<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.400> thought<00:00:29.609> into

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
didn't put a whole lot of thought into

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.479 
didn't put a whole lot of thought into
it<00:00:30.029> remember<00:00:30.810> when<00:00:31.109> people<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.590> told<00:00:31.650> meö<00:00:32.130> maybe

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
it remember when people I told meö maybe

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.180 
it remember when people I told meö maybe
he<00:00:32.730> should<00:00:32.940> be<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.180> middle<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:34.040> was<00:00:35.040> like

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
he should be in the middle I was like

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.850 
he should be in the middle I was like
okay<00:00:35.489> maybe<00:00:35.730> I'll<00:00:35.910> think<00:00:36.120> about<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.390> if

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
okay maybe I'll think about that if

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.560 
okay maybe I'll think about that if
things<00:00:37.860> don't<00:00:38.190> go<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.700> great<00:00:38.969> for<00:00:39.239> him<00:00:39.420> on

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
things don't go that great for him on

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.170 
things don't go that great for him on
the<00:00:39.719> side<00:00:40.040> which<00:00:41.040> things<00:00:41.370> were<00:00:41.520> okay<00:00:41.879> but<00:00:41.940> he

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
the side which things were okay but he

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.779 
the side which things were okay but he
still<00:00:42.450> seemed<00:00:42.780> way<00:00:43.079> too<00:00:43.110> hyped<00:00:43.710> up<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.760> I

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
still seemed way too hyped up so I

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.500 
still seemed way too hyped up so I
thought<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.210> was<00:00:45.300> worth<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.690> shot<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:46.829> far<00:00:47.100> I

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
thought it was worth a shot and so far I

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.490 
thought it was worth a shot and so far I
think<00:00:48.510> it's<00:00:48.780> going<00:00:49.020> pretty<00:00:49.050> well

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
think it's going pretty well

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.459 
think it's going pretty well
he<00:00:50.309> still<00:00:50.579> checks<00:00:50.879> over<00:00:51.239> both<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.510> plexiglass

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
he still checks over both the plexiglass

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.420 
he still checks over both the plexiglass
to<00:00:52.860> see<00:00:53.070> who's<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.370> over<00:00:54.149> there<00:00:54.360> but<00:00:55.129> he<00:00:56.129> seems

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
to see who's a over there but he seems

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.299 
to see who's a over there but he seems
pretty<00:00:56.699> calm<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.449> maybe<00:00:57.660> he<00:00:57.870> does<00:00:58.079> feel<00:00:58.350> more

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
pretty calm so maybe he does feel more

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.950 
pretty calm so maybe he does feel more
comfort<00:00:59.879> being<00:01:00.149> in<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.480> center<00:01:02.480> so<00:01:03.480> let's<00:01:03.719> see

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
is $350 so I'm hoping Grover's kind of

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.830 
is $350 so I'm hoping Grover's kind of
stays<00:01:28.920> closed<00:01:29.369> because<00:01:29.729> Calvin's<00:01:30.299> had<00:01:30.479> opened

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840

up and he was scratching it a lot so I

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.160 
up and he was scratching it a lot so I
hope<00:01:35.100> Grover's<00:01:35.689> doesn't<00:01:36.689> cause<00:01:36.869> them<00:01:37.020> any

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
hope Grover's doesn't cause them any

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.370

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
fresh so that's what everything looks

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:49.370 
fresh so that's what everything looks
like<00:02:39.200> now

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.030 

and<00:02:49.980> for<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.370> plexiglas<00:02:51.080> all<00:02:52.080> I<00:02:52.140> had<00:02:52.560> was<00:02:52.830> it

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
and for the plexiglas all I had was it

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.250 
and for the plexiglas all I had was it
made<00:02:53.400> at<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.760> hardware<00:02:54.330> store<00:02:54.390> if<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:54.960> didn't

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
made at the hardware store if you didn't

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.490 
made at the hardware store if you didn't
know<00:02:55.350> they<00:02:56.190> have<00:02:56.370> huge<00:02:56.670> sheets<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:58.380> I

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
know they have huge sheets of it and I

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.050 
know they have huge sheets of it and I
just<00:02:58.710> took<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.040> measurements<00:02:59.640> in<00:02:59.760> and<00:02:59.970> they

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
just took the measurements in and they

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.060 
just took the measurements in and they
cut<00:03:00.300> it<00:03:00.420> for<00:03:00.690> me

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
cut it for me

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.860 
cut it for me
it<00:03:02.070> made<00:03:02.280> sure<00:03:02.310> that<00:03:02.820> it<00:03:03.030> had<00:03:03.270> a<00:03:03.300> little<00:03:03.630> bit<00:03:03.840> of

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
it made sure that it had a little bit of

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.960 
it made sure that it had a little bit of
extra<00:03:04.620> length<00:03:04.770> on<00:03:05.190> either<00:03:05.400> side<00:03:06.890> and<00:03:07.890> they<00:03:08.730> had

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
extra length on either side and they had

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.810 
extra length on either side and they had
to<00:03:09.120> cut<00:03:09.300> out<00:03:09.770> like<00:03:10.770> a<00:03:10.800> little<00:03:11.160> square<00:03:11.550> at<00:03:11.760> the

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
to cut out like a little square at the

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.540 
to cut out like a little square at the
bottom<00:03:12.270> so<00:03:12.570> I'm<00:03:12.630> both<00:03:12.780> sides<00:03:13.110> just<00:03:13.380> so<00:03:13.550> it

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
bottom so I'm both sides just so it

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:25.610 
bottom so I'm both sides just so it
could<00:03:14.820> go<00:03:14.970> over<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.450> connectors<00:03:23.450> and<00:03:24.450> on<00:03:25.350> this

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
could go over the connectors and on this

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.040 
could go over the connectors and on this
one<00:03:25.920> same<00:03:26.730> thing<00:03:27.030> there's<00:03:27.360> some<00:03:27.630> extra<00:03:28.110> length

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
one same thing there's some extra length

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.680 
one same thing there's some extra length
and<00:03:31.050> I<00:03:31.350> put<00:03:31.590> these<00:03:31.820> clothes<00:03:32.820> pins<00:03:33.180> they<00:03:33.540> have

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
and I put these clothes pins they have

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.420 
and I put these clothes pins they have
rubber<00:03:33.990> on<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.410> end<00:03:34.530> so<00:03:34.770> they<00:03:34.890> really<00:03:35.190> hold

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
rubber on the end so they really hold

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.030 
rubber on the end so they really hold
the<00:03:35.610> plexiglass<00:03:36.270> tight<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:36.930> then<00:03:37.590> I<00:03:37.620> shove<00:03:38.010> it

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
the plexiglass tight and then I shove it

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.170 
the plexiglass tight and then I shove it
between<00:03:38.550> the<00:03:39.510> grids<00:03:39.810> there<00:03:40.640> that<00:03:41.640> keeps<00:03:41.940> it

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
between the grids there that keeps it

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.680 
between the grids there that keeps it
nice<00:03:42.330> and<00:03:42.390> snug<00:03:43.700> so<00:03:44.700> now<00:03:44.850> it<00:03:45.000> won't<00:03:45.180> move<00:03:45.450> or

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
nice and snug so now it won't move or

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.900 
nice and snug so now it won't move or
wobble<00:03:46.140> so<00:03:46.860> there's<00:03:47.070> a<00:03:47.160> clothespin<00:03:47.700> there

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
wobble so there's a clothespin there

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.130 
wobble so there's a clothespin there
what<00:03:51.680> and<00:03:53.150> there's<00:03:54.150> a<00:03:54.270> clothespin<00:03:54.810> on<00:03:54.870> the

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
what and there's a clothespin on the

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.730 
what and there's a clothespin on the
other<00:03:55.290> side<00:03:55.680> back<00:03:56.250> there<00:03:56.520> so<00:03:57.210> same<00:03:57.450> thing<00:03:57.750> you

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
other side back there so same thing you

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.680 
other side back there so same thing you
can't<00:03:58.980> even<00:03:59.100> tug<00:03:59.430> it<00:03:59.580> at<00:03:59.700> all<00:03:59.850> it's<00:04:00.090> stuck<00:04:00.420> and

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
can't even tug it at all it's stuck and

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.770 
can't even tug it at all it's stuck and
I<00:04:01.650> checked<00:04:01.950> those<00:04:02.220> every<00:04:03.090> morning<00:04:03.420> and<00:04:03.570> every
