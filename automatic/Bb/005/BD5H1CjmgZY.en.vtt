hey<00:00:03.870> everybody<00:00:04.140> its<00:00:04.290> lawn<00:00:04.440> simon<00:00:04.920> and<00:00:05.040> we're

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
hey everybody its lawn simon and we're

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.920 
hey everybody its lawn simon and we're
back<00:00:05.279> with<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.549> Western<00:00:06.000> Digital<00:00:06.240> my<00:00:06.600> cloud

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
back with the Western Digital my cloud

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.390 
back with the Western Digital my cloud
and<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.200> reason<00:00:07.560> is<00:00:07.710> that<00:00:07.740> a<00:00:07.950> lot<00:00:07.980> of<00:00:08.160> people

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
and the reason is that a lot of people

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.100 
and the reason is that a lot of people
been<00:00:08.550> asking<00:00:08.700> me<00:00:09.120> about<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.570> performance<00:00:10.050> of

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
been asking me about the performance of

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.570 
been asking me about the performance of
the<00:00:10.170> drive<00:00:10.410> I<00:00:10.530> showed<00:00:10.679> how<00:00:10.860> it<00:00:11.010> works<00:00:11.219> but<00:00:11.490> not

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
the drive I showed how it works but not

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.330 
the drive I showed how it works but not
about<00:00:11.849> how<00:00:12.090> fast<00:00:12.540> it<00:00:12.870> might<00:00:13.019> be<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.530> I<00:00:13.799> wanted

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
about how fast it might be and I wanted

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.490 
about how fast it might be and I wanted
to<00:00:14.400> do<00:00:15.030> that<00:00:15.210> for<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.690> because<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.109> had<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.320> lot

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
to do that for you because I had a lot

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.130 
to do that for you because I had a lot
of<00:00:16.560> people<00:00:16.740> asking<00:00:17.190> so<00:00:17.369> here<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.300> is<00:00:18.510> hooked<00:00:19.020> up

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
of people asking so here it is hooked up

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.510 
of people asking so here it is hooked up
right<00:00:19.320> now<00:00:19.470> we<00:00:19.529> have<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:19.920> connected<00:00:20.160> via

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
right now we have it connected via

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.210 
right now we have it connected via
gigabit<00:00:20.939> ethernet<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.650> tp-link<00:00:22.650> switch

the performance of video drives or
drives<00:00:44.129> for<00:00:44.460> recording<00:00:45.000> video<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.600> as<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:46.079> can

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
drives for recording video so as you can

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.119 
drives for recording video so as you can
see<00:00:46.320> here<00:00:46.469> we're<00:00:46.590> not<00:00:46.649> going<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.890> do<00:00:46.980> much

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
see here we're not going to do much

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.279 
see here we're not going to do much
better<00:00:47.370> than<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.969> load<00:00:48.270> F<00:00:48.510> for<00:00:48.750> recording<00:00:49.200> but

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
better than the load F for recording but

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.869 
better than the load F for recording but
that's<00:00:49.410> actually<00:00:49.559> not<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.890> surprise<00:00:50.309> for<00:00:50.520> me<00:00:50.640> I

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
that's actually not a surprise for me I

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.910 
that's actually not a surprise for me I
am<00:00:51.420> actually<00:00:51.719> impressed<00:00:52.410> with<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> speed

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
am actually impressed with the speed

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.010 
am actually impressed with the speed
that<00:00:53.160> we're<00:00:53.280> getting<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:53.850> it's<00:00:54.449> writing<00:00:54.930> to

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
that we're getting so it's writing to

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.680 
that we're getting so it's writing to
the<00:00:55.140> drive<00:00:55.379> at<00:00:55.559> about<00:00:55.800> 25<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.820> 28<00:00:57.120> megabytes

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
the drive at about 25 to 28 megabytes

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.349 
the drive at about 25 to 28 megabytes
per<00:00:57.840> second<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:59.100> translates<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.270> know

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
per second that translates to you know

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.180 
per second that translates to you know
if<00:01:00.420> we<00:01:00.480> say<00:01:00.629> 25<00:01:01.050> megabytes<00:01:01.530> per<00:01:01.680> second<00:01:02.070> about

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
if we say 25 megabytes per second about

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.060 
if we say 25 megabytes per second about
200<00:01:02.789> megabits<00:01:03.270> per<00:01:03.449> second<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.199> we're<00:01:04.799> not<00:01:04.860> of

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
200 megabits per second so we're not of

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.219 
200 megabits per second so we're not of
course<00:01:05.280> writing<00:01:05.549> very<00:01:05.760> fast<00:01:06.150> but<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:07.020> read

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
course writing very fast but the read

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.530 
course writing very fast but the read
speeds<00:01:07.590> were<00:01:07.830> really<00:01:08.189> good<00:01:08.430> we're<00:01:09.240> getting

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
speeds were really good we're getting

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.330 
speeds were really good we're getting
something<00:01:10.409> takes<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.740> little<00:01:10.890> bit<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.189> hit

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
something takes a little bit of a hit

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.710 
something takes a little bit of a hit
here<00:01:11.460> but<00:01:11.549> I've<00:01:11.670> been<00:01:11.760> seeing<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.150> as<00:01:12.270> high<00:01:12.510> as

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
here but I've been seeing it as high as

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.170 
here but I've been seeing it as high as
sixty<00:01:13.110> eight<00:01:13.260> megabytes<00:01:13.710> per<00:01:13.830> second<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:15.000> as

sixty eight megabytes per second and as

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.020 
sixty eight megabytes per second and as
low<00:01:15.390> as<00:01:15.540> around<00:01:15.630> 50<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.530> if<00:01:17.430> you're<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:18.000> know

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
low as around 50 so if you're you know

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.090 
low as around 50 so if you're you know
looking<00:01:18.390> at<00:01:18.570> like<00:01:18.750> 60<00:01:19.140> megabytes<00:01:19.409> per<00:01:19.650> second

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
looking at like 60 megabytes per second

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.490 
looking at like 60 megabytes per second
it's<00:01:20.220> about<00:01:20.340> 480<00:01:21.030> megabits<00:01:21.240> per<00:01:21.780> second<00:01:22.380> of

it's about 480 megabits per second of
read<00:01:23.130> speed<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.700> if<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:23.939> get<00:01:24.090> as<00:01:24.180> high<00:01:24.330> as<00:01:24.360> the

read speed and if you get as high as the
high<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.140> saw<00:01:25.409> earlier<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.890> 68<00:01:26.369> are<00:01:26.790> you

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
high that I saw earlier of 68 are you

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.569 
high that I saw earlier of 68 are you
looking<00:01:27.180> at<00:01:27.299> about<00:01:27.590> 544<00:01:28.590> megabits<00:01:29.070> per<00:01:29.159> second

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
looking at about 544 megabits per second

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.810 
looking at about 544 megabits per second
about<00:01:29.640> half<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.150> what<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.600> gigabit<00:01:31.530> ethernet

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
about half of what that gigabit ethernet

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.280 
about half of what that gigabit ethernet
connection<00:01:32.820> can<00:01:33.090> support<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.810> these

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
connection can support and these

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.810 
connection can support and these
benchmarks<00:01:34.799> are<00:01:34.890> often<00:01:35.159> hard<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.430> do<00:01:35.640> because

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
benchmarks are often hard to do because

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.429 
benchmarks are often hard to do because
there's<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.240> many<00:01:36.329> variables<00:01:36.780> there's<00:01:37.079> cable

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
there's so many variables there's cable

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.319 
there's so many variables there's cable
lengths<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:38.009> switches<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:38.820> all<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.150> kind

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
lengths and switches and all that kind

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.700 
lengths and switches and all that kind
of<00:01:39.360> stuff<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.020> pretty<00:01:40.290> good

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
of stuff so this is a pretty good

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.460 
of stuff so this is a pretty good
vanilla<00:01:41.520> benchmark<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.420> what<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:42.930> can<00:01:43.079> expect

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
vanilla benchmark of what you can expect

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.830 
vanilla benchmark of what you can expect
and<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:44.009> know<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.159> read<00:01:44.520> speed<00:01:44.790> between<00:01:44.970> 55<00:01:45.810> and

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
and you know a read speed between 55 and

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.130 
and you know a read speed between 55 and
65<00:01:46.770> megabytes<00:01:47.579> per<00:01:47.700> second<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.390> really<00:01:48.659> really

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
65 megabytes per second is really really

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.600 
65 megabytes per second is really really
good<00:01:49.470> especially<00:01:49.890> if<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.009> have<00:01:50.100> multiple

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
good especially if you have multiple

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.399 
good especially if you have multiple
people<00:01:51.270> hitting<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.750> drive<00:01:51.990> for<00:01:52.200> video

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
people hitting the drive for video

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.990 
people hitting the drive for video
streaming<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.070> kind<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.310> thing<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:53.729> I'm

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
streaming and that kind of thing so I'm

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.910 
streaming and that kind of thing so I'm
very<00:01:54.390> happy<00:01:54.659> with<00:01:55.020> those<00:01:55.290> speeds<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.740> think

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
very happy with those speeds I think

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.679 
very happy with those speeds I think
it's<00:01:56.040> really<00:01:56.310> decent<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.820> lot<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.299> folks<00:01:57.479> did

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
it's really decent a lot of folks did

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.300 
it's really decent a lot of folks did
write<00:01:57.869> in<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.140> say<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.560> well<00:01:58.740> it's<00:01:58.979> really

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
write in to say that well it's really

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.850 
write in to say that well it's really
lousy<00:01:59.700> on<00:01:59.969> my<00:02:00.119> on<00:02:00.360> my<00:02:00.390> network<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.259> lot<00:02:01.799> of

lousy on my on my network and a lot of

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.080 
lousy on my on my network and a lot of
times<00:02:01.979> when<00:02:02.130> people<00:02:02.159> are<00:02:02.430> streaming<00:02:02.700> over

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
times when people are streaming over

times when people are streaming over
Wireless<00:02:03.630> you're<00:02:03.780> going<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.049> see<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.439> variety

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
Wireless you're going to see a variety

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.889 
Wireless you're going to see a variety
of<00:02:05.399> different<00:02:05.670> performance<00:02:06.360> levels<00:02:06.689> and

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
of different performance levels and

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.330 
of different performance levels and
there's<00:02:07.049> so<00:02:07.350> much<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.680> goes<00:02:07.770> into<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:08.220> how

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
there's so much that goes into that how

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.279 
there's so much that goes into that how
far<00:02:08.640> away<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:08.940> are<00:02:09.090> from<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.450> access<00:02:09.899> point

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
far away you are from the access point

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.290 
far away you are from the access point
what<00:02:10.830> kind<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.129> wireless<00:02:11.520> connection<00:02:12.000> do<00:02:12.209> you

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
what kind of wireless connection do you

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.610 
what kind of wireless connection do you
have<00:02:12.569> how<00:02:12.870> much<00:02:12.959> interference

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
have how much interference

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.009 
have how much interference
getting<00:02:14.040> is<00:02:14.129> a<00:02:14.159> whole<00:02:14.370> host<00:02:15.239> of<00:02:15.390> problems<00:02:15.659> that

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
getting is a whole host of problems that

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.539 
getting is a whole host of problems that
happened<00:02:16.500> there<00:02:16.650> even<00:02:17.129> like<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.400> newer

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
happened there even like the newer

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.820 
happened there even like the newer
wireless<00:02:18.060> end<00:02:18.269> which<00:02:18.420> is<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.569> lot<00:02:18.720> faster<00:02:18.930> the

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
wireless end which is a lot faster the

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.440 
wireless end which is a lot faster the
speed<00:02:20.010> degrades<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.819> further<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.209> get<00:02:21.390> away

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
speed degrades the further you get away

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.649 
speed degrades the further you get away
so<00:02:21.769> you<00:02:22.769> know<00:02:22.860> it's<00:02:23.040> it's<00:02:23.250> often<00:02:23.459> tough<00:02:23.879> to<00:02:24.390> get

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
so you know it's it's often tough to get

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.149 
so you know it's it's often tough to get
these<00:02:24.840> things<00:02:25.110> working<00:02:25.379> properly<00:02:25.739> or<00:02:26.069> at

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
these things working properly or at

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.199 
these things working properly or at
least<00:02:26.280> getting<00:02:26.459> them<00:02:26.610> working<00:02:26.790> very<00:02:27.120> fast

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
least getting them working very fast

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.720 
least getting them working very fast
over<00:02:27.930> wireless<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:28.620> would<00:02:28.769> say<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.159> the

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
over wireless and I would say that the

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.430 
over wireless and I would say that the
best<00:02:30.000> way<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.209> use<00:02:30.540> this<00:02:30.720> thing<00:02:30.959> especially<00:02:31.170> if

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
best way to use this thing especially if

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.960 
best way to use this thing especially if
you<00:02:31.530> want<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.799> get<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.579> full<00:02:32.790> performance

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
you want to get the full performance

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.240 
you want to get the full performance
that<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:33.450> just<00:02:33.599> saw<00:02:33.750> here<00:02:34.140> is<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.739> connect<00:02:35.099> it

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
that you just saw here is to connect it

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.069 
that you just saw here is to connect it
via<00:02:35.329> gigabit<00:02:36.329> ethernet<00:02:36.420> but<00:02:36.840> I'm<00:02:36.930> pretty

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
via gigabit ethernet but I'm pretty

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:38.149 
via gigabit ethernet but I'm pretty
impressed<00:02:37.409> with<00:02:37.470> how<00:02:37.590> it's<00:02:37.709> working<00:02:37.920> I've

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
impressed with how it's working I've

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.380 
impressed with how it's working I've
been<00:02:38.280> running<00:02:38.489> this<00:02:38.579> test<00:02:38.819> now<00:02:38.970> for<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.209> last

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
been running this test now for the last

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.240 
been running this test now for the last
20<00:02:39.659> minutes<00:02:39.810> or<00:02:39.989> so<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.409> it's<00:02:40.500> it's<00:02:41.129> been

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
20 minutes or so and it's it's been

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.000 
20 minutes or so and it's it's been
holding<00:02:41.579> up<00:02:41.730> quite<00:02:42.150> well<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:42.750> no<00:02:43.530> complaints

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
holding up quite well so no complaints

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.650 
holding up quite well so no complaints
there<00:02:44.220> so<00:02:44.519> yeah<00:02:44.909> so<00:02:45.090> I<00:02:45.120> mean<00:02:45.299> I<00:02:45.360> think<00:02:45.420> it's

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
there so yeah so I mean I think it's

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.900 
there so yeah so I mean I think it's
good<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:45.840> mean<00:02:46.019> it's<00:02:46.140> certainly<00:02:46.349> a<00:02:46.440> lot<00:02:46.500> less

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
good I mean it's certainly a lot less

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.759 
good I mean it's certainly a lot less
