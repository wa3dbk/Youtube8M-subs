00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.450 
patterns and I'll show you in a second
when<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.410> step<00:01:40.620> out<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.800> the<00:01:40.920> vehicle<00:01:41.040> there's<00:01:41.400> a

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
when I step out of the vehicle there's a

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.390 
when I step out of the vehicle there's a
little<00:01:42.110> recess<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.440> the<00:01:43.710> back<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.220> unit

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
little recess in the back of the unit

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.280 
little recess in the back of the unit
that's<00:01:45.330> by<00:01:45.720> putting<00:01:46.440> a<00:01:46.560> basically<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.550> pen

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
that's by putting a basically a pen

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.920 
that's by putting a basically a pen
pencil<00:01:49.290> or<00:01:49.350> some<00:01:50.010> small<00:01:50.340> object<00:01:50.910> allows<00:01:51.690> you

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
pencil or some small object allows you

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.690 
pencil or some small object allows you
to<00:01:52.110> set<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.530> flash<00:01:52.770> pattern<00:01:53.010> that<00:01:53.250> suits<00:01:53.520> your

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
to set the flash pattern that suits your

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.320 
to set the flash pattern that suits your
particular<00:01:53.850> need<00:01:54.420> or<00:01:54.660> like<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:57.030> shroud

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
particular need or like the shroud

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.800 
particular need or like the shroud
actually<00:01:57.930> fits<00:01:58.260> over<00:01:58.620> the<00:01:59.630> light<00:02:00.630> it

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
actually fits over the light it

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.260 
actually fits over the light it
basically<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.380> like<00:02:01.410> a<00:02:01.560> boot<00:02:02.430> it's<00:02:02.910> the<00:02:03.060> best

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
basically is like a boot it's the best

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.360 
basically is like a boot it's the best
way<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.390> could<00:02:03.540> describe<00:02:03.660> it<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:05.070> the

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
way I could describe it and the the

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.040 
way I could describe it and the the
original<00:02:05.460> light<00:02:05.820> head<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.060> actually<00:02:06.570> inside

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
original light head is actually inside

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.280 
original light head is actually inside
here<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.740> then<00:02:07.830> this<00:02:07.860> then<00:02:07.980> fits<00:02:08.520> over<00:02:08.760> that

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
here and then this then fits over that

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.260 
here and then this then fits over that
that<00:02:10.290> then<00:02:10.530> allows<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.430> have<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.000> shroud

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
that then allows you to have the shroud

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.470 
that then allows you to have the shroud
on<00:02:12.600> it<00:02:13.350> if<00:02:13.500> you<00:02:13.740> wish<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:14.040> do<00:02:14.190> so<00:02:14.220> now<00:02:15.060> on<00:02:15.270> the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
on it if you wish to do so now on the

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.030 
on it if you wish to do so now on the

by depressing the small little button

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.210 
by depressing the small little button
that's<00:02:21.240> shown<00:02:21.480> inside<00:02:21.840> here<00:02:22.410> it<00:02:22.770> will<00:02:22.950> allow
