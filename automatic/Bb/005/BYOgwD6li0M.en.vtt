00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.320
 if there are game those responsible for the 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:17.060
 sniper costs go into a formula 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.710
 something more subtle and direct than what we 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.880
 they were used to in their new 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:25.160
 proposal for pc xbox 360 and precision 3 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.630
 enemy front while the main 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.250
 triple-a shooters focus on 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.290
 current or future conflicts 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.840
 If there is, take advantage of it to take us 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.250
 new to the second world war 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.630
 thematic that for a long time now 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.960
 serves as inspiration in shooters 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.550
 wars on this occasion we will see and 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.339
 We live through the war robert 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.710
 hopkins an American reporter who does not 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:47.960
 will hesitate at all when it comes to getting 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.730
 in actions in the early stages of 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.800
 game we see hopkins already as a member 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.350
 active of the resistance in the fight 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.059
 against the third reich bought we advance 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.670
 in each of the different versions and 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.109
 like playable flashback we live the 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.789
 episodes that took him from being a 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.769
 reporter looking for the report of his 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.810
 life to be one of the most 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.420
 decisive of all the resistance 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.159
 throughout the 16 missions we will jump 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.320
 to different temporary events that 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.909
 they marked accept decision as well 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.820
 we will know the characters that 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.110
 they make up the group that the enemy joined 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.549
 from allows us to advance as 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.100
 stealth sniper 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.619
 using sabotage or using force 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.509
 gross these actions are possible 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.329
 thanks to the three weapons we carry 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.740
 gun rifle and rifle that we can 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.659
 exchange for others of the same type 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.549
 that we will find in the game area 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.530
 We can also make use of the 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.929
 binoculars to detect enemies 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.729
 throw stones to confuse attacking 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:43.709
 the back take hostages as a shield 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.959
 human throwing grenades with the button 

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:48.360
 top right or cocktails mÃ³lotov with 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:50.970
 the upper left one can each 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.649
 consider your strategy, especially taking 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.539
 note that the scenarios rarely 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.759
 they are narrow offering the possibility 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.409
 to use one style or another to advance 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.810
 in addition to the main missions 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.179
 we can meet other secondary ones if the 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.369
 activate or we find save a 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:08.369
 civil destroy enemy trucks radios 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.370
 caterpillars and so on at certain times it 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.480
 allows us to select one path or another 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.560
 far from taking us to different 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.319
 made this election 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.630
 it refers to where we got to the 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.730
 key point being usually the 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.830
 same objective point let's go where 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.780
 let's go so the replay factor 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.560
 that could have been offered with this 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.050
 decision is diluted almost immediately the 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.640
 rhythm of play is good by presenting a 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.620
 proposal that would be halfway 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.959
 between the most frantic shooters and 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.209
 rhythm sniper games more 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.000
 paused if we use the sniper rifle 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.010
 and we are accurate we will see the trajectory 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.739
 of the bullet typical of the games of yes 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.870
 there is game if we prefer to advance using the 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.180
 more direct action in targeted car not 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.580
 will be of great help in most of 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.470
 Sometimes, sometimes it also fails and 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.170
 points us towards the air 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.360
 the enemies know how to hide but not 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.700
 they are very clever well then we know 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.110
 we look in our heads, almost always 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.269
 appears in the same place 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.739
 so if we die for whatever it is in 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.739
 some time we just have to remember 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.380
 kill and move forward we recover 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.819
 life if we cover ourselves by moving 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.489
 the ground to protect us if we go 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.600
 running and we throw ourselves to the ground 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.650
 we reload ammo automatically 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.689
 going through the ammunition boxes 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.000
 the gameplay we liked more than the 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:26.439
 his previous productions although he is 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.019
 far from being a great game that reaches 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:30.700
 stand out in nothing special there are good 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.890
 intentions and he has gotten a good 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.900
 quality jump in general but remains 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.030
 away from the competition 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.280
 even so we claim that we owe a 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.780
 opportunity because it will please those who are 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.599
 tired of playing the usual 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.730
 deliveries shooters to the story you 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:47.319
 missing a bit more than hook maybe 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.780
 a different order would have been better 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.299
 of the missions explaining in order 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.349
 chronological what happened and not with jumps 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.000
 temporary 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.489
 there are some sentences of script quite 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.409
 absurdities like and you survived the 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.319
 attack for clear and if not I will not be here 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:03.940
 obviously the same happens with the 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.510
 first mission that serves as a tutorial 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.609
 something loose to make a start there 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.379
 hidden treasures to find them 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:14.349
 you will have to enter each house hut and 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:16.060
 hiding catch them all will not be easy 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:18.489
 although it is not that it contributes much 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.370
 find them staying almost in something 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.430
 anecdotal in fact we are not motivated to 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.620
 replay the title or for the reward 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.130
 nor for the game itself, therefore, with finishing one 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.200
 once 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.570
 it is likely that we already have enough 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.460
 in the graphic it has finally been abandoned 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.070
 the use of the chrome engine in favor of 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.170
 crytek cry engine although we do not know 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.490
 that cry engine has been used by 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.100
 results is not that they are 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.680
 shocking this section would receive a 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.940
 Overall rating of remarkable position 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.710
 that there are well- recreated areas that 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.920
 contrast with some others of 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:53.500
 improvable result some textures are 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.000
 bad are you the introductory scenes 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.190
 in which the camera shows the 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.190
 Paused sequence is the most colorful of the 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.350
 game the dub is in English counting 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.420
 with subtitles in Spanish music 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.730
 incidental is encouraged when there are enemies 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.280
 disappearing almost completely when 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.630
 there is no Nazi left in the area 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.160
 title is completed with a multiplayer 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.740
 which has cost us to find 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.110
 players or almost nobody has this game 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.790
 or nobody plays multiplayer or is that 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.490
 the servers go very badly and not 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:23.470
 they find nobody three ways are 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.570
 that we find combat to death combat 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.360
 to death by equipment and radio transmission 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.920
 a kind of area domain where 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.500
 we must activate the radio stations 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.869
 dominated to emit the signal the 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.719
 multiplayer is like 

00:05:33.869 --> 00:05:39.339
 anecdotal being a mere complement 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:41.679
 thirty euros is a good price for 

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:43.569
 this production a game that is more than 

00:05:41.679 --> 00:05:45.639
 correct but you will play once and 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:47.860
 surely little else that has its 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:50.199
 failures and their shortcomings but that moves away 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.869
 of the usual and that manages to maintain a 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:55.889
 own personality improving what is seen 

00:05:52.869 --> 00:05:55.889
 said and game
