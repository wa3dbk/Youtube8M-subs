 Sleep is such a natural cave found throughout the game, including the original so 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.060

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:13.300
 It 's not a natural cave. It's not water. 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.300
 It's not really good water. 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.210

 Let's change it to peace. Now it's a natural cave cup.

 I'll let you know the combination of these items first .

 The Act's gonna Act is five and the withdrawal or limitation of glass and light-emitting Why

 I can make a lantern if I have a flaw in the collection . 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:03.140
 And if you carry this lantern now when you are in the care of the land, 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:07.849
 Honestly, I think 4 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.050

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.940
 And you know when you're going to be okay as escape map 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:24.080
 When my arm to escape when the atmosphere of fear 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:28.310
 But when you want to make that kind of atmosphere, 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.380
 Shop around but instead have put geureongeol lighter plug so that being once 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.820

 And so naohne kaeji 9 but many little time to write, where the sound of water 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:54.260
 I do not think it would be useful for everyone to escape . 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:57.560
 I've been able to find out about the term mode that you have so far with a smile.
