00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
ended up doing was capturing the magnet

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.740 
ended up doing was capturing the magnet
magnetite<00:00:32.189> sand<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.969> naturally<00:00:33.450> occurs<00:00:33.719> on

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
large amount of magnetic sand and it

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.670 
large amount of magnetic sand and it
took<00:00:55.440> me<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:56.329> couple<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.660> minutes<00:00:57.870> pick<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.649> up

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
any science because they knew but the

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.499 
any science because they knew but the
cool<00:01:44.549> thing<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.880> can<00:01:44.939> do<00:01:45.119> down<00:01:45.329> at<00:01:45.450> the

cool thing is you can do down at the
beach<00:01:45.710> Elsa<00:01:46.710> jacket<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:47.040> took<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.579> moment<00:01:47.820> to

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
beach Elsa jacket I took a moment to

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.810 
beach Elsa jacket I took a moment to
explain<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:50.220> reason<00:01:50.250> there<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.700> a

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
explain that the reason there is a

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.050 
explain that the reason there is a
magnetite<00:01:51.509> on<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:51.960> beach<00:01:52.229> when<00:01:52.850> there's<00:01:53.850> no

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
magnetite on this beach when there's no

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.109 
magnetite on this beach when there's no
outcroppings<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.780> iron<00:01:54.990> ore<00:01:55.200> around<00:01:56.119> is

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
outcroppings of iron ore around is

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.120 
outcroppings of iron ore around is
because<00:01:57.329> once<00:01:58.049> upon<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.259> time<00:01:58.500> there<00:01:58.950> was<00:01:59.040> a

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
because once upon a time there was a

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.639 
because once upon a time there was a
glacier<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.640> came<00:01:59.820> right<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.570> props<00:02:00.840> over

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
glacier that came right the props over

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.999 
glacier that came right the props over
here<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.640> ice<00:02:02.969> was<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.509> mile<00:02:04.200> over<00:02:04.500> our

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
here and the ice was a mile over our

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.029 
here and the ice was a mile over our
heads<00:02:05.250> as<00:02:05.490> we<00:02:05.850> sit<00:02:06.060> here<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.710> that's<00:02:07.710> why<00:02:07.829> long

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
heads as we sit here and that's why long

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.800 
heads as we sit here and that's why long
island<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:08.970> way<00:02:09.979> because<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:12.480> mile<00:02:12.660> of

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
island is that way because the mile of

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.790 
island is that way because the mile of
ice<00:02:12.870> pushed<00:02:13.319> all

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
ice pushed all

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.500 
ice pushed all
