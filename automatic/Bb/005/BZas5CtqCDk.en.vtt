00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
batteries the barrel light feature you

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.040 
batteries the barrel light feature you
see<00:02:09.369> is<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.239> electric<00:02:10.539> motor<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:13.420> other<00:02:13.660> side

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
see is the electric motor the other side

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.449 
see is the electric motor the other side
you<00:02:14.410> can't<00:02:14.650> really<00:02:14.800> see<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.130> from<00:02:15.190> here

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
you can't really see it from here

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.070 
you can't really see it from here
there's<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.120> cooling<00:02:16.420> system<00:02:16.810> which<00:02:16.930> is

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
there's the the cooling system which is

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.500 
there's the the cooling system which is
consists<00:02:17.590> of<00:02:17.620> a<00:02:17.709> radiator<00:02:18.100> cooling<00:02:18.880> pump<00:02:19.060> and

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
consists of a radiator cooling pump and

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.600 
consists of a radiator cooling pump and
then<00:02:20.080> also<00:02:20.530> on<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:20.920> other<00:02:20.950> side<00:02:21.310> is<00:02:21.489> the

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
then also on the other side is the

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.320 
then also on the other side is the
system<00:02:21.940> controller<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:24.640> engine<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.120> tells

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
system controller the engine and tells

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:33.630 
system controller the engine and tells
helps<00:02:26.230> coordinate<00:02:27.270> spend<00:02:28.270> intervenor<00:02:32.640> just

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
helps coordinate spend intervenor just

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.670 
helps coordinate spend intervenor just
on<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.910> electric<00:02:34.269> drive

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.979 

it's<00:02:38.189> quiet<00:02:38.549> and<00:02:38.819> there's<00:02:41.450> four<00:02:42.450> straight<00:02:42.810> to

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
it's quiet and there's four straight to

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.649 
it's quiet and there's four straight to
the<00:02:43.110> wheels<00:02:43.489> so<00:02:44.489> this<00:02:44.670> is<00:02:44.819> just<00:02:45.000> train<00:02:45.510> now

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
the wheels so this is just train now

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:47.780 
the wheels so this is just train now
just<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.079> electric<00:02:46.349> motor<00:02:46.620> if<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:47.610> hit<00:02:47.760> that

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
just the electric motor if you hit that

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:57.130 
just the electric motor if you hit that
accelerating<00:02:48.599> torque<00:02:49.230> right<00:02:49.470> to<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.769> right

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.630 

why

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.770 

with<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:02.970> decimal

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.429 

means

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:12.439 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:14.780 

yeah<00:03:13.439> the<00:03:13.620> engine's<00:03:13.920> going<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.159> be<00:03:14.250> quieter<00:03:14.730> I

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
yeah the engine's going to be quieter I

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.399 
yeah the engine's going to be quieter I
don't<00:03:15.060> know<00:03:15.180> if<00:03:15.269> the<00:03:15.420> voice<00:03:15.599> on<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:15.900> website

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
don't know if the voice on the website

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:17.720 
don't know if the voice on the website
the<00:03:16.560> bus<00:03:16.739> when<00:03:16.950> it's<00:03:17.069> full<00:03:17.250> of<00:03:17.370> kids<00:03:17.549> it's

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
the bus when it's full of kids it's

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.760 
the bus when it's full of kids it's
going<00:03:17.879> to<00:03:17.969> be<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:19.340> engine<00:03:20.340> I'll<00:03:20.400> be<00:03:20.519> quiet
