00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.829 
bit of things around here and I started
to<00:00:14.639> think<00:00:14.670> about<00:00:14.910> this<00:00:15.179> topic<00:00:15.450> because

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
to think about this topic because

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.830 
to think about this topic because
capital<00:00:16.529> j<00:00:16.800> put<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.760> video<00:00:18.000> about<00:00:18.240> this<00:00:18.570> so<00:00:18.750> I'm

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
capital j put a video about this so I'm

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.450 
capital j put a video about this so I'm
gonna<00:00:18.930> put<00:00:19.170> his<00:00:19.350> video<00:00:19.650> down<00:00:19.859> below<00:00:20.100> but

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
gonna put his video down below but

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.700 
gonna put his video down below but
essentially<00:00:21.180> he<00:00:21.720> was<00:00:21.869> talking<00:00:22.260> about<00:00:22.350> how

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
essentially he was talking about how

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.609 
essentially he was talking about how
important<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.760> do<00:00:24.330> training<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.350> think

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
important is to do training and I think

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.259 
important is to do training and I think
that's<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.859> huge<00:00:26.279> mistakes<00:00:26.789> that<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.000> lot<00:00:27.240> of

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
that's a huge mistakes that a lot of

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.150 
that's a huge mistakes that a lot of
purpose<00:00:27.750> make<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.439> fact<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.920> lot<00:00:29.099> of

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
purpose make the fact that a lot of

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.900 
purpose make the fact that a lot of
peppers<00:00:29.640> don't<00:00:29.880> do<00:00:30.060> training<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:31.700> again<00:00:32.700> guys

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
peppers don't do training so again guys

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.330 
peppers don't do training so again guys

formal training and I got to tell you

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.010 
formal training and I got to tell you
guys<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.310> critical<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.360> take<00:01:24.600> formal

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
guys it is critical that you take formal

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.670 
guys it is critical that you take formal
training<00:01:25.409> as<00:01:25.500> well<00:01:25.590> now<00:01:26.600> to<00:01:27.600> add<00:01:27.750> up<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.140> 0<00:01:28.170> to

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
training as well now to add up to 0 to

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.090 
training as well now to add up to 0 to
capital<00:01:28.860> j<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.579> training<00:01:30.380> then<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.710> reason

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
capital j on training then the reason

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.100 
capital j on training then the reason
why<00:01:32.220> training<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.090> important<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:34.049> because

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
why training is so important is because

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.460 
why training is so important is because
you<00:01:34.979> are<00:01:35.009> actually<00:01:35.430> making<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.030> best<00:01:36.630> weapon

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
you are actually making the best weapon

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.429 
you are actually making the best weapon
that<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.829> have<00:01:38.150> better<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.840> best<00:01:40.049> weapon
