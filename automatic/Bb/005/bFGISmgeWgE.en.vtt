00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.920
 good 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.920
 yes 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:16.059
 4 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.740
 Hello everyone today, and welcome from 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.390
 new to my channel today I bring you another 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.040
 competitive video you will say but I've 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.050
 thought that it was this other video from 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.640
 competitive is true maybe it's 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.080
 focusing too much my channel to the scope 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.760
 of the competition but calm 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.050
 the debate that I present to you may 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.029
 apply both to the field of 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.220
 competitive as the scope of games 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.129
 public so if you play competitive or 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.780
 you can not help me solve this 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.089
 moral debate to this incessant struggle that 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.220
 it takes place inside my head between 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:45.670
 we must use both in public games 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:49.150
 I repeat as in competitive the jumpsuit 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.510
 another option or not to use either of the two 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.129
 and comment accordingly accordingly 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.290
 what button settings should we 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.659
 use whether the technique or the default 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.949
 Now I'm going to specify a little more in case 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.299
 there are some that you have not understood me 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.979
 in something that is being said 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:05.199
 because you already know that it is fashionable 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:06.970
 lately these super words 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.700
 modern ones that are beginning to be used if 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.650
 james otis another option 'that if you leave 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.460
 cleansing things of those that if the 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.530
 you comment 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.020
 It seems it's good and everything is not me 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.860
 I must admit that I use it 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.110
 words for 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.570
 to confuse the rivals and clear 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.370
 put fear in the left body if 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.790
 you say those words you can feel 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.620
 best in the world even if you are a bank 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.240
 as you see of funds this leaving a 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.620
 competitive game a game nothing 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.150
 that we laugh we were not 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.530
 playing seriously if you have given 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.880
 account was when with solstice 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.650
 was playing with hispania was 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.930
 playing with one of the clan I will leave you the 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.450
 channel in the description of both 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.250
 members of the team good team in 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.600
 which was playing because they have a 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.790
 channel if you want to spend a channel 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.860
 pretty good otherwise I would not oppose 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.660
 obviously then have a laugh 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.160
 with them not those that we were not 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.890
 when cherie as you see we are playing 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.510
 three up three submachine guns and I was 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.330
 playing one and one of them on top was 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.920
 playing with the 9 pm I left choosing without 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.930
 to have seen I was like a hairstyle 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.460
 because they have me marginalism was 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.080
 when back with the air and on top of 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.869
 slayer I know there was not even a defensive 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.850
 so I said these commented 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.110
 permits and you can imagine the 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.580
 result I was not doing it what 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.239
 best possible because they were a few mangoes 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.590
 those of mexico is not cogna the manco is me 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.660
 but there are cases that we're going to start with 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.190
 this debate and among all you can leave 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.200
 in the comments what do you think 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.739
 in this respect let's start for example 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.780
 with the samsung samsung champ shot is a 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.880
 expression in English 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.980
 means shot and the word that is 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.440
 put forward is to express the mode of 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.780
 shot that we are discussing yam chan 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.670
 does it mean skip that means that 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.790
 it will be a shot while we skip what 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.560
 advantages gives us that because several here 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.420
 As you see, they say they kill me with 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.370
 knife kill those of your own team 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.400
 and above the subnormal that does not serve 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:57.260
 nothing wrong that shows the theory 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.260
 that if the team does not do anything to me 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.980
 well the case is that the jumpsuit what 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.810
 will allow us to mislead the 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.830
 enemy is to say not staying 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.330
 static and being able to reach the head of 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.400
 a simpler way is to say 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.840
 try to kill the enemy in a way 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.910
 faster pointing to the head and 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.280
 consequently mislead the enemy 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.480
 as you see here this is a jumpsuit what 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.709
 you have seen has denied the head and 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.000
 over the enemy has misled him 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.830
 because the enemy will be aiming 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.180
 our chest when we see in a 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.590
 hand- to-hand combat and if we jump 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.640
 obviously it's going to be everything 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.920
 crazy 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.720
 what advantages does the assumption that 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.910
 loans to the enemy and that we are going to 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.709
 to be able to reach in an easier way 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.230
 the head is to say we can command a 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.420
 fastest way 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.209
 the set that is the drop cendrÃ³s wants 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.920
 say crouched is to say it will be a shot 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.049
 while we crouched down you have seen my 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.909
 English upper chachi piruli as that 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.980
 we can shoot while we crouch 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:51.850
 what advantage do we gain that because 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.950
 we will go 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.930
 and will mislead the enemy of a 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.280
 brutal way because if you look when 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.980
 let's find an enemy 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.470
 different the fact that we bend over 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.820
 it will leave very confused because no 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.920
 because he's going to have to lower his life here 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:10.060
 I take my solstice revenge dies 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.800
 good bastard the case is that it is the draw 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.120
 that will allow us to throw them out 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.470
 while we shoot and consequently 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.480
 be able to mislead the enemy 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.430
 you want advantage gives us is a good 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.150
 because the fact of Achar is going to 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.560
 make the enemy by animal instinct 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.540
 what he's going to do is lower his sights 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.610
 automatically and that's going to leave us 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.770
 first that you will find in your 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.180
 in your shooting area is going to be the head 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.340
 that means that instead of shooting 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.080
 before we can go before and then 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.719
 you say from other 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.270
 premises fuck the johnson is much better 

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:46.550
 Clear pussy is much harder 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.770
 jones and say it's much harder 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.360
 it requires a lot of practice then clear 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.610
 what button settings should we 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.110
 use both in one shot as the other the 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.000
 drop shott it is obvious that we should use 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.080
 the tactic because if it's not practically 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.719
 impossible 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.180
 that is to say the tactics what allows us 

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:04.400
 be able to bend down with the right joystick 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.039
 pressing the r3 they say in ps3 in 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.330
 xbox I have no idea and the jams is that 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:09.800
 we must use for it in places that do not 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.020
 I have no idea if any expert here does not 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.610
 knows that we should use the default 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.159
 because with the default what we 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.870
 will allow is to be able to use better 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:19.909
 more effective way already the knife but 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.289
 Of course we can not bend down and you will say 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:23.300
 but of course for the champions 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.289
 we need to duck then clear 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.729
 Boys 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:27.500
 they left in the comments to make a 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.969
 samsung I want to practice for 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.909
 make this kind of jump this kind of 

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:33.830
 shot that we should use we should use the 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:35.660
 default so you can use the 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.450
 knife more effectively 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:42.220
 the tactic that will allow us 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:44.750
 charro jump at a time so 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.310
 Button configuration gives us more 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.600
 advantages leave it to the comments 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.430
 because it's a moral debate that I have 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.840
 then of course I'm not going to 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.610
 practice the champions and I do not know what of 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.030
 Button configuration should I use 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.800
 because it would be somehow waste 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.720
 the time so we have here the end is 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.980
 video as you see 21 in the first round 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.320
 as you have seen we are also not 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:07.820
 only here the extension in the next 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:11.710
 I do not think it's serious because I think it 's 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.710
 I left the game because ready 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.700
 the knife 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.910
 goodbye see you later
