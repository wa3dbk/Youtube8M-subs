 you can see the direct download will begin 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.300

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.780
 I'm going to cancel it in my case 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.240
 I brought them previously but you 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.470
 the extraction ends 100% for 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.060

 what it says is the installer cleared 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.760
 gamers do not forget that for the 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.310
 installation of this video game and we have 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.810

 installer 199 we point out what we drag 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.900
 30 and multi we assemble it we hope that it 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.730
 mount and end up giving us contrast 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.830
 little window that we will execute 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.020
 tube but in case you have an angel 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.060
 spend 20 years of eric started team

 or my pc and vehicle units worth zero 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.500

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.870
 terms of agreement and license net 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.690
 Here he asks us for a serial for the serial 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.760
 the medicine we have to go to start 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.590
 team or my pc in the unit where 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.230
 we will have mounted our game of 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.360
 right monster open here we will look for 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.709
 the folder called to replace open the 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.540
 folder here is a notebook that 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.500
 call code we open the notebook now 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.459
 that will be the serial which we copy 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.019
 we minimize this window where is the 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.819
 code a moment because here also 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.590
 there is the medicine that we are going to use 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.860
 or ministers listings this window 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.480
 we paste the code out of our here 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.490

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:03.370
 here we go we will be forming this 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.560
 nation we want the ass or minimum game 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.240
 minimal I think it does not install the 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.070
 cinematic and all that 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.410

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.060
 offer parts or more in the case I'm going to 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.860
 give minimal so that it does not delay 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.930
 both the installation but I you 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.550
 I recommend that those who put sports 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.630
 as I said I 'm going to put it in minimum 

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:26.500
 they are worth we will give in next nets again and 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.500
 start the installation 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.830
 when they finish installations 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.740
 implement and waters in order and now we 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:38.210
 we go to the folder where we copy the 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:41.480
 serial wolf the code the folderlet of ms 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.800
 3s inside it right click to copy 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.630
