yeah and
on<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:07.370> board<00:02:07.690> did<00:02:08.690> you<00:02:08.930> the<00:02:09.260> grip<00:02:09.440> tape<00:02:10.180> the

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
on the board did you the grip tape the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.450 
on the board did you the grip tape the
bad<00:02:11.420> thing<00:02:11.690> about<00:02:11.720> it<00:02:12.020> is<00:02:12.110> cheap<00:02:12.560> me<00:02:13.220> and<00:02:13.370> it

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
bad thing about it is cheap me and it

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.800 
bad thing about it is cheap me and it
doesn't<00:02:13.610> have<00:02:13.820> very<00:02:13.940> good<00:02:14.030> grip<00:02:14.360> on<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.690> dick

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
doesn't have very good grip on the dick

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.220 
doesn't have very good grip on the dick
so<00:02:17.810> it's<00:02:18.050> gonna<00:02:18.140> wear<00:02:18.410> out<00:02:18.650> really<00:02:19.010> fast<00:02:20.230> like

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
so it's gonna wear out really fast like

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.070 
so it's gonna wear out really fast like
maybe<00:02:21.500> probably<00:02:22.310> pretty<00:02:22.670> fast<00:02:22.940> if<00:02:23.750> you're

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
maybe probably pretty fast if you're

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.170 
maybe probably pretty fast if you're
trying<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.500> do<00:02:24.620> dark<00:02:24.890> catches<00:02:25.400> I<00:02:25.640> recommend
