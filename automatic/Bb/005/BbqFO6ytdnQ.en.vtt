hence<00:03:26.770> it<00:03:27.250> is<00:03:27.670> an<00:03:27.820> exception<00:03:29.760> nonmetals<00:03:30.760> in

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
hence it is an exception nonmetals in

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.440 
hence it is an exception nonmetals in
their<00:03:31.690> pure<00:03:31.990> state<00:03:32.470> do<00:03:33.070> not<00:03:33.100> have<00:03:33.580> a<00:03:33.820> shining

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
their pure state do not have a shining

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.350 
their pure state do not have a shining
surface<00:03:35.490> this<00:03:36.490> means<00:03:36.850> they<00:03:37.720> are<00:03:37.750> not<00:03:38.160> lustrous

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
surface this means they are not lustrous

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.460 
surface this means they are not lustrous
for<00:03:40.360> example<00:03:41.050> sulfur<00:03:42.180> iodine<00:03:43.230> which<00:03:44.230> is

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
for example sulfur iodine which is

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.650 
for example sulfur iodine which is
lustrous<00:03:45.220> is<00:03:45.459> an<00:03:45.970> exception<00:03:46.920> also<00:03:48.660> nonmetals

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
lustrous is an exception also nonmetals

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.220 
lustrous is an exception also nonmetals

are non sonorous as they do not produce

00:03:53.230 --> 00:04:01.170 
are non sonorous as they do not produce
sound<00:03:54.450> for<00:03:55.450> example<00:03:56.140> sulfur<00:03:57.070> iodine<00:03:58.170> etc
