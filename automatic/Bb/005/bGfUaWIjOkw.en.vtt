00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 I'll ask to ask questions and 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.379
 what if this player I will not show 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.230
 there you that the partners of europe 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.559
 especially invented what I thought to say 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.990
 whether he would have a place on the Italian team or 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.279
 How to play European football and you 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.949
 go to the player I'm referring to 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.699
 I'd rather watch playing, look, this is the 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.150
 goose 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.550
 look what he looks at this task pen 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:34.230
 now where the hotel is only samoa ball 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:37.440
 Did the goal of the year look only this is the good 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.899
 ronaldo in this game we our director 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.730
 it is not in the victory by charging a narration 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.649
 From here I say again look what he did 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.410
 What he got that kiss, I 'm 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.719
 waiting waiting to happen is to be 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.850
 In this game this ball would have entered 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.300
 I would have said without a doubt and look that he 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.030
 did what he did to make spectacular 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.859
 of the world the series soon this player to 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.399
 success in Europe this style it is 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:10.439
 if that way of him playing unit he 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:12.990
 goes so not because they think no is the 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.650
 different marking I think he has 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.320
 a lot of talent but is this time not 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.590
 can it be like this 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.159
 This player's description of me 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.590
 walking slowly in the field and 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.460
 I met at this rate will not 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.590
 Europe 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.869
 so I think the talent he has 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.829
 it also puts a little more 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.540
 intensity in his game condition 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.729
 game that has the talent he has 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.049
 on foot there but is a differentiated player 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.090
 and few players from midfield has 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.509
 the mobility I have the opportunity that 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.840
 you have to see let's see a big milan 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.210
 and champion hisses what you were doing 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.549
 field had a subtle brasilia cat had 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.460
 by the day you 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.770
 turkey also did not run quite the 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.780
 made the ball run you always get 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.640
 moved around the countryside without him not 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.319
 would be the case because he does not have the 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.810
 dispensing speed characteristic 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.550
 he make the ball go faster 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.370
 he no, I also like to make the ball 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.260
 roll on the stroll 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.080
 the pilot does not seem to make the strings 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.890
 and elly by the position by the game further back 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:29.099
 he will play as a point guard in the front on 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.930
 difference there is cool but he is 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.239
 playing more ahead then europe 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.260
 very strong marking in the area where he 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.720
 play 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.030
 so you get more dynamic or you'll 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.580
 get harder but the man looks 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.069
 You can have zidane for example. 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:49.590
 a player in this slower style in the 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:52.769
 Unites the lyon does not seem more like it 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.170
 Citizenship is very dynamic all the time 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:59.340
 ball control and always on signaling 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:02.730
 the goose for the ball does plays for the ball 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.250
 but he does and when plays first 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.560
 and if possible your talent but I'm 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.170
 speaking of question was specific 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.330
 he will be able to play in Europe so 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.849
 going on in Europe is going to be 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.530
 People talk about Italy, Seedorf has all 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.090
 the reason why a marking system 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.500
 much stronger than it is in the 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.720
 spain for example 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.810
 Now, when we talk about goose 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.760
 goose from these last 12 13 games 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.609
 I think it 's showing an evolution 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.319
 typical of the one who reminds him very much of 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:33.900
 early career goose on the saints 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.910
 which disturbs much goose in terms 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.769
 that this game of this volume 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.489
 dynamics of the middle field are the other 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.620
 players 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.319
 unfortunately the moment of são paulo 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.970
 affectionately saying is 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.230
 are not on the same level then when 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.630
 seedorf takes the ball and has rafael 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.639
 Marques if you have a model on the side you 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.680
 can make the ball spin and arrives with 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:54.750
 quality goose is an oasis there in 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.819
 creating industry sao paulo or speak 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.560
 with junior who played this role of 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.359
 half an hour of missing it is a bit of 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.530
 dynamism, people 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:04.109
 the goose we always have a 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.299
 expectation, especially for the beginning of 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.950
 not saints because talent does not do 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.230
 few players in that meter 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.569
 Square there can pack a 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.880
 solution of a move that is not only 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.130
 the dribble beneath the ice land right 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.560
 but that little ditch he gave her for 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.260
 up the gesture trying to play ball 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.150
 if he buys this can be bought 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.610
 through if he played in this system 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.400
 the right course spoke 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.259
 and that's exactly where he's going to force it. 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.229
 be a little more dynamic than he is 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:36.210
 because he playing his style here 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:37.860
 everybody accepts if he goes to the 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.560
 football where it was much more dynamic 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.659
 much more footprint it will also evolve 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.280
 but then it will end without type eyes 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:46.620
 I thought it was cool starting to talk about 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.900
 italy from down that hurt the spirit 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.750
 Italian called the single declared by the 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:55.770
 task is the first name about goose 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:58.770
 Finally, he said this because jazz 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.599
 The years that we talk about him in Italy 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.419
 We have a lot of admiration for talent. 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:05.699
 he has and I think he also okay 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:10.169
 needing to get out of here he was almost the 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:13.740
 milan and do not leave São Paulo, this is it 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:17.490
 there is something display word that 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:20.759
 also take the goose home where our 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:24.029
 speak to genoveva paulo not only 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:27.379
 the sao paulo managed to keep if for 

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:27.379
 sao paulo leave the chat policy
