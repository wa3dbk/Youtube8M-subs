very high esteem it is going to be

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.560 
very high esteem it is going to be
unique<00:00:16.830> theatrically<00:00:17.789> really<00:00:18.180> interesting

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
unique theatrically really interesting

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.930 
unique theatrically really interesting
because<00:00:18.600> we<00:00:18.960> have<00:00:19.110> non<00:00:19.920> actors<00:00:20.310> acting<00:00:20.760> but

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:20.940 
because we have non actors acting but

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.220 
because we have non actors acting but
they're<00:00:21.060> telling<00:00:21.330> their<00:00:21.420> own<00:00:21.480> stories<00:00:21.960> so<00:00:22.170> it

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
they're telling their own stories so it

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.410 
they're telling their own stories so it
has<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:22.530> real<00:00:22.800> vibrancy<00:00:23.280> and<00:00:23.580> it's

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
has this real vibrancy and it's

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.440 
has this real vibrancy and it's
completely<00:00:25.700> you<00:00:26.700> know<00:00:26.790> hopefully<00:00:27.090> it's<00:00:27.360> going

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:27.450 
completely you know hopefully it's going

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.779 
completely you know hopefully it's going
to<00:00:27.540> be<00:00:27.660> very<00:00:27.780> truthful<00:00:28.200> the<00:00:28.830> play<00:00:29.070> will<00:00:29.550> tell

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
to be very truthful the play will tell

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.389

their<00:00:30.030> stories<00:00:30.450> of<00:00:30.539> survival<00:00:31.200> and<00:00:31.530> set<00:00:32.160> them

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
their stories of survival and set them

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.209 
their stories of survival and set them
on<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.730> new<00:00:33.120> journey<00:00:33.149> for<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.110> future<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.739> think

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
on a new journey for the future I think

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.829 
on a new journey for the future I think
it's<00:00:35.550> important<00:00:35.940> for<00:00:35.999> the<00:00:36.089> people<00:00:36.239> involved

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:36.839 
it's important for the people involved

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:38.540 
it's important for the people involved
in<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.140> project<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:37.710> service<00:00:38.339> men<00:00:38.519> and

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
in the project this service men and

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.209 
in the project this service men and
women<00:00:38.670> because<00:00:39.469> they<00:00:40.469> do<00:00:40.530> feel<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:40.920> their

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
women because they do feel that their

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.340 
women because they do feel that their
story<00:00:41.519> hasn't<00:00:41.760> been<00:00:41.940> told<00:00:42.089> and<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:43.109> think

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
story hasn't been told and I think

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.829 
story hasn't been told and I think
generally<00:00:43.679> people<00:00:43.949> in<00:00:44.699> Australia<00:00:44.839> would

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:45.839 
generally people in Australia would

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:47.599 
generally people in Australia would
perhaps<00:00:46.260> like<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.800> know<00:00:46.920> what<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.219> hell<00:00:47.399> is

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
perhaps like to know what the hell is

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:49.669 
perhaps like to know what the hell is
people<00:00:48.539> have<00:00:48.659> been<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.929> what<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.170> ADF<00:00:49.530> have

theatre with a group of people it was
even<00:01:16.560> more<00:01:16.800> interesting<00:01:17.040> because<00:01:17.340> these

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
even more interesting because these

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.490 
even more interesting because these
people<00:01:17.790> are<00:01:18.000> not<00:01:18.090> professional<00:01:18.570> actors<00:01:18.930> it's

a very different thing I've seen lots of

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.660 
a very different thing I've seen lots of
plays<00:01:21.450> about<00:01:21.950> soldiers<00:01:22.950> done<00:01:23.490> by

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
is that having the real people the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.370 
is that having the real people the
actual<00:01:29.730> people<00:01:30.000> who<00:01:30.360> have<00:01:30.600> been<00:01:30.630> wounded<00:01:31.050> and
