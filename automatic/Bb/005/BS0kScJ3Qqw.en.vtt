bucks<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.790> then<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.150> add<00:02:30.330> these<00:02:30.630> drives<00:02:30.990> and

bucks and then you add these drives and
this<00:02:31.410> is<00:02:31.500> probably<00:02:31.800> 2000<00:02:32.670> ish<00:02:32.820> dollars<00:02:33.240> worth

copy of everything that's on here so

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.170 
copy of everything that's on here so
it's<00:03:27.660> off-site<00:03:28.350> it's<00:03:28.830> an<00:03:28.950> expensive<00:03:29.520> solution

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
it's off-site it's an expensive solution

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.470 
it's off-site it's an expensive solution
yes<00:03:30.510> that's<00:03:30.960> why<00:03:31.140> this<00:03:31.440> at<00:03:31.620> 299<00:03:32.190> isn't<00:03:33.090> a<00:03:33.180> bad

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
yes that's why this at 299 isn't a bad

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.280 
yes that's why this at 299 isn't a bad
solution<00:03:33.750> for<00:03:34.200> 8<00:03:34.550> terabytes<00:03:35.570> on<00:03:36.570> one<00:03:36.840> as<00:03:37.020> long

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
solution for 8 terabytes on one as long

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.690 
solution for 8 terabytes on one as long
as<00:03:37.410> it<00:03:37.500> doesn't<00:03:37.740> fail<00:03:37.920> and<00:03:38.400> we<00:03:38.460> don't<00:03:38.610> know

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
as it doesn't fail and we don't know

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.920 
as it doesn't fail and we don't know
what<00:03:38.820> the<00:03:38.910> fail<00:03:39.120> rates<00:03:39.360> going<00:03:39.510> to<00:03:39.600> be<00:03:39.630> on<00:03:39.780> this

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
what the fail rates going to be on this

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.540 
what the fail rates going to be on this
but<00:03:40.140> this<00:03:40.230> is<00:03:40.410> meant<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.680> be<00:03:40.770> your<00:03:41.040> third

extra<00:03:44.520> backup<00:03:44.730> drive<00:03:45.180> to<00:03:45.360> have<00:03:45.540> so<00:03:45.960> simply<00:03:46.350> I

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
extra backup drive to have so simply I

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.010 
extra backup drive to have so simply I
made<00:03:46.860> this<00:03:47.070> because<00:03:47.580> I<00:03:47.910> just<00:03:48.690> want<00:03:48.840> to<00:03:48.930> make

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.370 
you guys aware of what's going on here
and<00:03:50.760> why<00:03:51.180> I'm<00:03:51.330> looking<00:03:51.480> for<00:03:51.780> different<00:03:52.140> backup

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
and why I'm looking for different backup

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.380 
and why I'm looking for different backup
solutions<00:03:53.130> but<00:03:53.550> because<00:03:53.850> you<00:03:53.940> can<00:03:54.060> never<00:03:54.210> have

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
solutions but because you can never have

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.110 
solutions but because you can never have
enough<00:03:54.590> your<00:03:55.590> data<00:03:55.860> is<00:03:56.070> so<00:03:56.310> important<00:03:56.880> that<00:03:57.000> if

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
enough your data is so important that if

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.510 
enough your data is so important that if
something<00:03:57.450> happens<00:03:57.900> to<00:03:58.140> it<00:03:58.290> you're<00:03:58.710> Sol<00:03:59.130> all

how<00:04:27.690> it<00:04:27.870> works<00:04:28.020> but<00:04:28.230> I<00:04:28.290> bought<00:04:28.530> this<00:04:28.740> one

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
how it works but I bought this one

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.440 
how it works but I bought this one
because<00:04:29.280> 8<00:04:30.060> terabytes<00:04:30.390> at<00:04:31.580> 3.75<00:04:32.580> for<00:04:33.150> whatever

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
because 8 terabytes at 3.75 for whatever

because 8 terabytes at 3.75 for whatever
cents<00:04:33.930> per<00:04:34.290> gig<00:04:34.650> is<00:04:34.890> certainly<00:04:35.520> not<00:04:35.730> bad<00:04:36.030> at

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
cents per gig is certainly not bad at

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.570 
cents per gig is certainly not bad at
all<00:04:36.300> so<00:04:36.750> what<00:04:36.960> is<00:04:37.050> your<00:04:37.290> solution<00:04:37.560> what<00:04:38.460> are

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
all so what is your solution what are

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.670 
all so what is your solution what are
you<00:04:38.760> doing<00:04:39.120> to<00:04:39.210> back<00:04:39.390> up<00:04:39.600> your<00:04:39.720> files<00:04:39.780> you<00:04:40.560> can

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
you doing to back up your files you can

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.380 
you doing to back up your files you can

it is that we wanted to do because
