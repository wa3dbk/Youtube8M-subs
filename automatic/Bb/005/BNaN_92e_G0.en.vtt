00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
but blades edge Matthew I think this is

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.639 
but blades edge Matthew I think this is
very<00:00:30.929> favorable<00:00:31.769> in<00:00:32.040> favor<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:33.360> hilum

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
damage he's gonna go down and that's

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.700 
damage he's gonna go down and that's

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.100 
second round so that does tie us up then
one<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:36.200> one<00:02:36.440> and<00:02:36.620> i<00:02:37.400> sent<00:02:38.120> an<00:02:38.240> advantage<00:02:38.780> maybe

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
one to one and i sent an advantage maybe

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.740 
one to one and i sent an advantage maybe
it<00:02:39.950> didn't<00:02:40.250> seem<00:02:40.430> to<00:02:40.640> play<00:02:41.090> too<00:02:41.450> much<00:02:41.480> an

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
it didn't seem to play too much an

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.949 
it didn't seem to play too much an
advantage<00:02:42.290> in<00:02:42.470> favor<00:02:42.740> of<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.850> hilum<00:02:44.180> but

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
advantage in favor of the hilum but

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.530 
advantage in favor of the hilum but
certainly<00:02:45.170> they<00:02:45.470> did<00:02:45.650> just<00:02:45.980> play<00:02:46.310> better<00:02:46.730> but

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
certainly they did just play better but

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.660 
certainly they did just play better but
the<00:02:47.630> damage<00:02:47.989> is<00:02:48.140> matthew<00:02:48.590> were<00:02:48.980> very<00:02:49.280> similar

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
the damage is matthew were very similar

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.300 
the damage is matthew were very similar
in<00:02:49.850> that<00:02:50.000> round<00:02:50.360> yeah<00:02:51.260> pretty<00:02:51.560> much<00:02:51.709> and<00:02:52.160> i

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
in that round yeah pretty much and i

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.690 
in that round yeah pretty much and i
gotta<00:02:52.850> say<00:02:53.090> hiss<00:02:53.630> with<00:02:53.900> again<00:02:54.410> a<00:02:54.590> dubious<00:02:55.370> play

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
gotta say hiss with again a dubious play

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.390 
gotta say hiss with again a dubious play
I<00:02:55.910> mean<00:02:56.840> he<00:02:57.020> used<00:02:57.230> his<00:02:57.440> cloak<00:02:57.650> of<00:02:57.830> shadows<00:02:57.860> I

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
I mean he used his cloak of shadows I

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.600 
I mean he used his cloak of shadows I
think<00:02:58.750> way<00:02:59.750> too<00:02:59.780> eagerly<00:03:00.530> and<00:03:00.830> he<00:03:01.100> paid<00:03:01.340> for<00:03:01.370> it

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
think way too eagerly and he paid for it

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.460 
think way too eagerly and he paid for it
towards<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.239> end<00:03:02.450> of<00:03:02.540> that<00:03:02.690> game<00:03:02.750> when<00:03:03.140> he

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
towards the end of that game when he

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.199 
towards the end of that game when he
wasn't<00:03:03.709> under<00:03:04.130> that<00:03:04.250> much<00:03:04.400> pressure<00:03:04.459> he<00:03:04.940> used

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
wasn't under that much pressure he used

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.150 
wasn't under that much pressure he used
his<00:03:05.390> cloak<00:03:05.690> and<00:03:05.959> maybe<00:03:06.500> he<00:03:06.709> should<00:03:06.890> have<00:03:06.920> just

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
his cloak and maybe he should have just

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.850 
his cloak and maybe he should have just
saved<00:03:07.400> it<00:03:07.640> until<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.720> latter<00:03:08.930> stages<00:03:09.380> of<00:03:09.739> the

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
saved it until the latter stages of the

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.370 
saved it until the latter stages of the
game<00:03:09.890> you<00:03:10.730> know<00:03:10.880> and<00:03:10.910> he<00:03:11.780> would<00:03:11.930> have<00:03:12.020> survived

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
game you know and he would have survived

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.040 
game you know and he would have survived
you<00:03:12.590> need<00:03:12.800> to<00:03:12.920> be<00:03:13.040> able<00:03:13.160> to<00:03:13.430> you<00:03:14.270> know<00:03:14.390> get<00:03:14.810> rid

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
you need to be able to you know get rid

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.930 
you need to be able to you know get rid
of<00:03:15.080> that<00:03:15.200> you<00:03:15.590> a<00:03:15.620> or<00:03:16.010> after<00:03:16.190> it's<00:03:16.550> been<00:03:16.700> used

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
of that you a or after it's been used

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.479 
of that you a or after it's been used
yeah<00:03:17.540> certainly<00:03:18.260> a<00:03:18.470> case<00:03:18.709> but<00:03:18.890> also<00:03:19.040> the

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
yeah certainly a case but also the

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.520 
yeah certainly a case but also the
opener<00:03:20.030> hiss<00:03:21.519> obviously<00:03:22.519> we<00:03:22.610> had<00:03:22.760> a<00:03:22.790> SAP

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
opener hiss obviously we had a SAP

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.750 
opener hiss obviously we had a SAP
initially<00:03:24.530> but<00:03:24.860> they<00:03:25.010> did<00:03:25.220> they<00:03:25.459> didn't<00:03:25.700> do

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
initially but they did they didn't do

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
but do you think that was the right case

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:33.670 
but do you think that was the right case
should<00:03:32.570> they<00:03:32.660> have<00:03:32.690> not<00:03:32.900> have<00:03:32.989> gone<00:03:33.170> on<00:03:33.380> to<00:03:33.500> the

should they have not have gone on to the
rogue<00:03:33.910> well<00:03:34.910> I<00:03:35.120> think<00:03:35.239> it<00:03:35.570> I<00:03:35.810> think<00:03:36.140> it<00:03:36.440> was<00:03:36.530> a

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
rogue well I think it I think it was a

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.770 
rogue well I think it I think it was a
smart<00:03:37.010> play<00:03:37.220> for<00:03:37.610> beta<00:03:37.790> got<00:03:38.090> to<00:03:38.269> sit<00:03:38.510> out<00:03:38.660> of

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
smart play for beta got to sit out of

smart play for beta got to sit out of
that<00:03:38.870> blind<00:03:39.170> it<00:03:39.739> was<00:03:40.459> a<00:03:40.489> great<00:03:40.670> decision<00:03:40.880> he

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
that blind it was a great decision he

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:42.670 
that blind it was a great decision he
could<00:03:41.420> see<00:03:41.630> that<00:03:41.780> inflamed<00:03:42.110> wasn't<00:03:42.440> under

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.650 
could see that inflamed wasn't under
that<00:03:42.799> much<00:03:42.920> pressure<00:03:42.980> and<00:03:43.549> he<00:03:44.150> just<00:03:44.360> decided

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
that much pressure and he just decided

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.199 
that much pressure and he just decided

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
to sit in it and and it really paid off

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.300 
to sit in it and and it really paid off
