00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.679
 talked about what is a backup 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:28.400
 copy 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:28.400
 I need to watch this video, I recommend 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:44.480
 last 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:44.480
 about where to store and 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.360
 easy enough if 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.110
 backup we have all the data 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.960
 contacts notes calendar and reminders 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.950
 there are many many many other things if 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.950
 do you have programs that 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:35.580
 and if you have 16 photos 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:50.590
 if you have if you have 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:02:06.180
 the opportunity is better for me what you have 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:02:08.530
 every time there is a new old over 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:13.720
 documents tightened 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:16.959
 why samurai ps i don't understand now about 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.330
 tom what could be the problem if you 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.600
 store backup in haikou 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.910
 so I had such a case when I 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.310
 one of the customers called it was 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:33.930
 in the evening she told me that she did not 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.930
 these reasons it was still on 5 firmware 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.250
 all settings 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:53.880
 call you back 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:53.880
 so stayed second 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:02.069
 somehow miraculously happened 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:05.850
 delete all contacts 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.780
 Niggan just dropping the phone 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.380
 rebooted shut down worse miss 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:17.819
 contactor busy remained contact not 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:21.670
 how i restored the perfect copy though 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:24.310
 if this happens to you is deleted 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.260
 all your contacts or something 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.540
 information you are recovering 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.180
 backup computers and you for sure 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.489
 as there's nothing very simple 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.739
 before you restore 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.359
 backup you drive on your 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.090
 device passwords to your 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:41.320
 and put an account and when can 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.390
 find backup 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.609
 the phone can't get out the clouds can't 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.950
 be baikal full per view you 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.760
 click cancel and see all data 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.130
 you saved 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.650
 he does not have time to connect to this 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.069
 clown just and everyone remove this and hot 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.829
 mom 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.810
 so it happened and so here once 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:18.630
 total la soul practice occurred 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:18.630
 but when a friend on the overall picture 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:28.900
 photos contacts 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:34.540
 program documents now have something 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:46.180
 what nuance if you use the example 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:52.030
 you came and it turns out that you have yours 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:54.040
 programs program what happens 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.100
 trained back up 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.680
 on your computer and have affected you 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:03.090
 your questions if you recover 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.090
 backup from your computer 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:18.440
 programs and when your why because 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:34.220
 the guys who do it so it will be 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:41.430
 common problem 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:43.560
 if you use something with tops 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.450
 I tried to accept zaglyuchila not because 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.120
 happened to the device or just 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.560
 lost no matter trust new 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.570
 devices restore from backup 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.460
 copies 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:56.250
 it just asks for it at this moment 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.590
 password from all that is in 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.660
 phone if it contacts notes there 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:06.050
 Glades many new 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:09.620
 if there is an additional request 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:12.440
 password show it just blew off 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.300
 pull all the fields on here there are two things 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.240
 opinion about to really store 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:24.560
 backups if you do everything yourself 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:27.320
 absolutely yourself if you use 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:31.070
 I recommend it to someone elseâ€™s programs 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:33.260
 but somehow difficult to judge all the same became 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:35.570
 give it amazing chords and although 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.970
 would have had some opportunity to save 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:41.030
 given you haven't but something happened a 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:45.130
 it is generally better to keep sedans separate and 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:48.260
 and not rely on any service example 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:51.500
 it turned out that they installed 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:55.550
 programs with you and with us and you are our client 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:58.840
 I recommend backups stored in 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.650
 us first your data you always 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.750
 can recover 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.760
 our system will also be able to recover 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:07.940
 we have them in our computer 

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:10.639
 if you don't have to do it right 

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.710
 since with the altus program such 

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:15.349
 the program is there it allows you to save 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:17.659
 backup even here programs 

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:21.460
 separately back and programs completely 

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:23.889
 no problem and and i think that 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:26.080
 if not write to me and I will try 

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:28.810
 create a video about how to do it 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:32.740
 it is important who the program is directed to and it doesn't matter 

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:35.770
 as it was a wish with pleasure 

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:37.900
 ready to say thank you for coming to ours 

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:40.180
 channel you visit our social networks 

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:44.160
