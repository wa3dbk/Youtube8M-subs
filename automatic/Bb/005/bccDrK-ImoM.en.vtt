00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.900
 hello to your bridlava from the top 100 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.610
 clans stew and in front of us battle on the map 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.270
 pass between clans tinka 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.740
 and the clan apb2 kenko decided 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.230
 demonstrate so through which 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:25.990
 called impudence dpm is a new word 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:28.400
 in the game on the pass they took 15ti st 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.310
 the most optimal composition in my opinion 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.430
 on the pass they are very convenient to disassemble 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:38.900
 DEF based especially if it's a bunch 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:42.230
 and hundredths of mausov well, others less lush 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:46.250
 not heavy tanks and even less so easily 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.980
 understand any of the car goes 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.370
 shine hipster nobody shines 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.730
 arc 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:56.030
 all cars are friendly heaps 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.600
 go over the bridge 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.600
 I was given 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.730
 apparently really letting on 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:07.409
 the base will be very interesting to see 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:11.640
 so it will disassemble shine 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:15.520
 Ostaashko on her shoot back on the go and 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:19.990
 what we see from the point is clear business and 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.030
 will be picked up just passing by the first of 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.979
 the cat will sparkle now I will be on creation 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.789
 but the rest of the car 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:31.590
 usually tried to push someone 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:34.630
 upward getting it out is extremely difficult 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.860
 extremely hard and it really hinders 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:41.080
 under the rally they decided quickly about Rashid 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:47.520
 put the focus on unprotected need powerful 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.520
 machines like ppsh and bring rustle 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.590
 even in their favor after the score 2 1 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.770
 user 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:06.700
 see how well they choose their goal 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:09.490
 these seven are soft side 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.390
 cardboard shears and esteshka 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:16.120
 who took along the way by tp which 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.700
 stand on a big pile of extremely uncomfortable 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.150
 bite and don't shoot your whom they 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.150
 see 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:36.810
 the focus is still on the ptshke focus 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.810
 very competent ambassador not tinkoff 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.550
 wanted to say that no one shoots 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:46.300
 Mawson unfortunately fly into it 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:51.220
 regular projectile score 77 and now all 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:53.410
 will solve the focus and break through the dpm on 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.010
 tinka side hp per side 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.010
 from fb2 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.710
 97 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:11.160
 ma lasa still stopped killing 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:14.720
 dpmee taken away now will be 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.780
 try to kill and this is you and finally 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:22.310
 leave the mouse and 50b which with its 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.310
 a colleague is angry and helps the team 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.580
 11 911 10 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.490
 everything is enough in the balance that is if 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.980
 a little delay a couple of times not to punch 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:40.920
 50 b is charged and can do 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:43.580
 almost immediately two minus 1310 will be 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.320
 take away now most likely the mouse to 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.240
 will take away the mouse and finally leave the beads 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.270
 b 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.390
 Tinka tactics are really very 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.810
 interesting 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.930
 It works far not often but the question 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.850
 I actually have fb2 clans 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.430
 guys if you decide to make them at the base 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.280
 than you draw a card to me easily 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.090
 punch beams hear tensioner if 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.330
 you are here now 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.020
 There were 10 e100 and a couple of some 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.170
 photos 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.710
 well or st chic chick would not be such a rage 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.560
 succeeded 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:19.290
 but all is possible and score feed 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.680
 1st win wins everyone thanks for 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.680
