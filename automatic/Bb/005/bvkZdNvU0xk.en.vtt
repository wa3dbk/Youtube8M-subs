 there are also lots of letters that represent the characters 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.930
 the mishaps that can suffer and the skills and objects that can 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.480
 get day

 the monsters that have a slot in the base where you enter your signing 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.660
 more so that only their names and characteristics are visible 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:12.989
 his face 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.109
 country or consumed some witches zombies free maniacs all you can 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:19.589
 ask a game 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:22.189
 at the start of the game the guardian must decide 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:26.389
 what is your objective deficit by choosing a secret letter in which you describe your 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:30.480
 conditions of victory and those of researchers on ipad the guardian 

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:33.540
 You can read it whenever you want but the researchers will not know how 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.259
 stop him until he has found all the clues today to know where to go and 

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:42.370
 that look for it researchers should follow the thread of the story explained 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:48.809
 for example they venture that she was the owner of the house she used to collect junk 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.359
 they could deduce that the next clue is in a storage room in the basement or in 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:58.409
 the anti k test you have to ask yourself what you should know about the characters in the 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.659
 story for this mansion in particular to get an idea to the front where 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:07.130
 can be the next track takes out the track that you find security of 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.060
 narrative form where to continue the searches 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.790
 the investigative players should discuss their strategy 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.059
 granier all his movements 

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:21.120
 When the researchers discover the last visit to Spain, the 

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:22.180
 final scene 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.299
 the funk at this time the goal of the guardian should be revealed the present is 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.109
 the moment of truth I do not know if the researchers won or if it will 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:34.659
 the guardian while everything is decided in a dramatic and apotheosical way 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:35.080
 The hiv 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.600
 it was a sadness and a final fight other not the game can end in a thousand ways 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.769
 20 years I am very different visceral 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.200
 good in his turn each player investigator has several options 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:49.040
 and possible actions measure forces 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.900
 there are several situations in which the success of an action 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.129
 will depend on the intellect of the researcher in the mansion may have 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.839
 closed doors security briefcases o'barry magistrates 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:06.060
 to break through these obstacles players must solve 

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:10.959
 a careful puzzle for example there is a circuit puzzle 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.599
 pretty cool electric 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:17.739
 first they are formed by placing these square tiles on the table and then they rotate 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.430
 and they change until the wires form a circuit continued the puzzles do not 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.040
 they are resolved with a limited amount of actions that depend on the intellect 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.639
 of the researcher for example a tough guy like corn that macri does not have 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:35.300
 too many possibilities but professor jarvi votes will go much better 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.259
 I remove the guardian has very varied and fun game styles to his 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:41.370
 provision 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.620
 Each turn receives a number of threat tokens based on the number of 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.260
 players can reserve them and wait for the right time to retrace all 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.240
 the dangers of the mansion nicknames and carlos to gradually wear down the 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.220
 investigators with a little bit of pain over here a touch of madness over there if the 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.180
 guardian manages to reduce the sanity of a researcher to zero 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.250
 in his first hole is when he better passed it to the deceased civil guard 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.289
 orphans the combat system classifies the monsters in three 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:14.310
 different humanoid categories 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.150
 three days and arcane creatures 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.940
 unicaja with elvis when you attack a monster you have to try cards of the 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.250
 mallet corresponding to its category itself attacked an arcane creature with a 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.580
 ax stole cards from the deck proved close 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.400
 up to take out a melee weapon crime the letter contains a 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.930
 narrative description of the attack and implement and almost races against the 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.039
 monster 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:40.650
 Astiz and then divide you a force roll to see if your attack has 

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:45.270
 success if you get the roll this will say something like the xerez is still called 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.580
 just one of its tentacles and then it indicates the damage that inflicts figures and 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.999
 faults withdrawal something bad happens 

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:55.229
 I also love the game because it is very narrative 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:06:00.969
 It includes five scenarios but gives much more than five stars urged 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:03.969
 history raises different possible objectives 

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:09.339
 quabit many different things can happen on the same map every time 

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:13.939
 You play explained and if that was not enough, all the boxes in the game contribute to the 

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:17.419
 development of history among nations both those who go to 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:22.300
 guardian co how the two Andean researchers are are hundreds of 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.199
 fragments that combine in many ways to narrate a 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:28.929
 story itself is not a good narrative board game if you like 

00:06:28.929 --> 00:06:34.620
 arcandor the mansions of singer madness will provide an ideal opportunity 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.139
 to see your favorite characters in a different setting at a lower 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:43.110
 national scale even if you do not know sarcasm robbery or the card game of 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.430
 the phone call is still a good game of suspense terror and mystery 

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:52.289
 You can record housing open drawer or without investigating mysteries 

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:58.319
 and reveal secrets design a game of suspense is a challenge but I think 

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:01.189
 that has gone well 

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:05.589
 ecopetrol I hope that in your first game of the emanations of madness 

00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:09.959
 you get on the paper to such an extent that you forget that it is a 

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:13.120
 game yesterday to matches identify with the characters 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.010
 as if I was walking the halls of the mansion collaborating with 

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:21.460
 your companions to survive and unravel the mystery while you 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.479
 you approach our sanity 

00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:27.379
 I would love to live is the game that they let play
