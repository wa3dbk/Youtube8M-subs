and that that's pretty much what I like

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.609 
and that that's pretty much what I like
it<00:02:04.469> for<00:02:05.119> um<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.719> think<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.020> like<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.439> said

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
it for um and I think it like I said

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:08.690 
it for um and I think it like I said
again<00:02:07.829> it's<00:02:08.009> one<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.250> those<00:02:08.310> things<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.670> think

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
again it's one of those things I think

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.350 
again it's one of those things I think
it<00:02:08.970> looks<00:02:09.000> sexy<00:02:09.950> it<00:02:10.950> fits<00:02:11.220> me<00:02:11.400> quite<00:02:11.610> well

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
it looks sexy it fits me quite well

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.640 
it looks sexy it fits me quite well
and<00:02:12.450> um<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.470> then<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.930> GTR<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.200> is<00:02:16.380> just

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
and um and then the the GTR it is just

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.270 
and um and then the the GTR it is just
it<00:02:17.010> is<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.880> supercar<00:02:18.690> like<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.740> you<00:02:20.010> know<00:02:20.130> like

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
it is a supercar like the you know like
