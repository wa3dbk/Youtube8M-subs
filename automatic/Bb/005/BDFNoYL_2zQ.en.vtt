left open for conspiracy theorists and I
did<00:03:52.769> have<00:03:52.890> a<00:03:52.950> theory<00:03:53.400> about<00:03:53.780> this<00:03:54.780> plane<00:03:55.170> right

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
did have a theory about this plane right

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.160 
did have a theory about this plane right
I<00:03:56.220> originally<00:03:56.819> thought<00:03:57.120> hey<00:03:57.540> you<00:03:57.599> know<00:03:57.780> I<00:03:57.900> bet

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
I originally thought hey you know I bet

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.110 
I originally thought hey you know I bet
it's<00:03:58.319> been<00:03:58.440> how<00:03:58.530> I<00:03:58.560> been<00:03:58.709> I<00:03:59.220> bet<00:03:59.519> that<00:03:59.790> there's

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
it's been how I been I bet that there's

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.110 
it's been how I been I bet that there's
been<00:04:00.420> hijacked<00:04:00.900> you<00:04:01.079> know<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:02.370> dodgy

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
been hijacked you know the dodgy

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.479 
been hijacked you know the dodgy
possible<00:04:03.540> people<00:04:03.870> on<00:04:03.989> board<00:04:04.220> they<00:04:05.220> got<00:04:05.370> on

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
possible people on board they got on

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.610 
possible people on board they got on
board<00:04:05.700> they<00:04:06.329> got<00:04:06.480> their<00:04:06.659> turn<00:04:06.900> they<00:04:07.349> turned

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
board they got their turn they turned

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.500 
board they got their turn they turned
the<00:04:07.739> transponder<00:04:08.370> off<00:04:08.430> on<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:08.819> plane<00:04:09.060> so<00:04:09.389> that

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
the transponder off on the plane so that

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.930 
the transponder off on the plane so that
it<00:04:09.659> wasn't<00:04:09.989> showing<00:04:10.170> up<00:04:10.260> on<00:04:10.409> radar<00:04:10.440> and<00:04:11.010> then

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
it wasn't showing up on radar and then

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.119 
it wasn't showing up on radar and then
they<00:04:12.480> hijack<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:13.049> bloggers<00:04:13.290> planes<00:04:13.889> have

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
they hijack the bloggers planes have

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.310 
they hijack the bloggers planes have
black<00:04:14.340> boxes<00:04:14.730> in<00:04:14.849> the<00:04:14.940> cockpit<00:04:15.150> that<00:04:15.540> Republic

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
black boxes in the cockpit that Republic

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.400 
black boxes in the cockpit that Republic
Ord<00:04:16.470> sound<00:04:16.859> and<00:04:17.220> they<00:04:17.970> actually<00:04:18.150> send<00:04:18.690> out<00:04:18.989> a

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
Ord sound and they actually send out a

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.150 
Ord sound and they actually send out a
signal<00:04:20.150> for<00:04:21.150> a<00:04:21.269> doll's<00:04:21.510> to<00:04:21.630> pick<00:04:21.810> up<00:04:21.989> so<00:04:22.830> they

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
signal for a doll's to pick up so they

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.659 
signal for a doll's to pick up so they
know<00:04:23.340> exactly<00:04:23.370> where<00:04:24.180> that<00:04:24.210> plane<00:04:24.570> was<00:04:25.669> even

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
know exactly where that plane was even

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:28.219 
know exactly where that plane was even
if<00:04:26.760> the<00:04:26.880> transponder<00:04:27.419> was<00:04:27.539> turned<00:04:27.780> off<00:04:27.960> right

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
if the transponder was turned off right

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.409 
if the transponder was turned off right
so<00:04:29.130> the<00:04:29.280> other<00:04:29.400> theory<00:04:29.729> was<00:04:30.000> that<00:04:30.030> there's

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
so the other theory was that there's

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.300 
so the other theory was that there's
like<00:04:30.539> another<00:04:30.750> Bermuda<00:04:31.350> Triangle<00:04:31.860> call<00:04:32.190> it

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
like another Bermuda Triangle call it

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.240 
like another Bermuda Triangle call it
like<00:04:32.430> the<00:04:33.229> Asian<00:04:34.229> square<00:04:34.650> or<00:04:34.860> something<00:04:35.160> I

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
like the Asian square or something I

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.159 
like the Asian square or something I
don't<00:04:35.310> freaking<00:04:35.849> know<00:04:35.880> well<00:04:36.510> I<00:04:36.539> reckon<00:04:36.870> that

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
don't freaking know well I reckon that

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.680 
don't freaking know well I reckon that
the<00:04:37.289> whole<00:04:37.500> thing<00:04:37.740> just<00:04:37.919> stinks<00:04:38.699> seriously

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
the whole thing just stinks seriously

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.740 
the whole thing just stinks seriously
there<00:04:40.530> is<00:04:40.650> no<00:04:40.830> way<00:04:41.099> on<00:04:41.130> earth<00:04:41.340> that<00:04:41.820> nobody

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
there is no way on earth that nobody

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
there is no way on earth that nobody
knows<00:04:42.930> where<00:04:43.289> that<00:04:43.320> plane<00:04:43.680> is<00:04:45.530> well<00:04:46.530> she

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
knows where that plane is well she

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:53.309 
knows where that plane is well she
stalled<00:04:47.039> it<00:04:47.360> like<00:04:48.360> a<00:04:48.539> professional
