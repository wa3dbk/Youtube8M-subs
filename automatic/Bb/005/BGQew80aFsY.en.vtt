00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.940
 well today we are going to do the first 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.920
 square 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:12.200
 of 15 x 15 centimeters and in holy point 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.290
 clear with everything first I'm going to 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.690
 explain how they are the points 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:21.800
 just an amount both with two needles 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:24.880
 together to make it better we make a 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.350
 knot a loop 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.990
 a rulito a race 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:36.790
 a curl a spear 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:40.030
 a roll a loop and so on 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.790
 complete the 15 centimeters that in my 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.360
 case are 27 points 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.970
 once we put the 27 points 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.579
 we take out one of the needles and they give the 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.679
 deadly points 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.690
 the clear holy point is made of the 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:59.460
 next way 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:04.309
 we passed the needle under a loop and 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:08.490
 comes out below a loop 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:12.829
 underneath a loop and 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.300
 underneath a sack loop and so on 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:19.090
 until complete 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:23.409
 the whole row 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.200
 I the last point of the row I do not 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.219
 I have 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.219
 so that it is 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:36.049
 more verbose in the termination 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.659
 we fixed the loop underneath and we passed 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.359
 the point without knitting 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.189
 the second row is woven exactly 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:46.820
 same 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:50.580
 we went under a loop 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:56.030
 below the hoe 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.030
 and we're going to weave like that until we complete 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:05.090
 at 15 centimeters it has 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.670
 the square 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:12.920
 once we complete the 15 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:16.180
 centimeters of the square we are going to close 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.180
 all points 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.250
 that is to say 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.940
 we knit a point 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.000
 we weave the second world and assemble the 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.470
 first about the second 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.550
 we weave and assemble 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.550
 in the previous 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:44.050
 in this way we have the closure 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:47.720
 in the form of a chain 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:51.730
 When I hope it's clear to you 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.730
 and here we have the terminal square
