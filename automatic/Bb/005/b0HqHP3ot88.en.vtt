00:00:02.693 --> 00:00:05.291
 We were at the bridge where I saw this crocodile. 

00:00:05.291 --> 00:00:13.291
 I saw myself shoot that National Geographic Channel video of the crocodile that grabs the bird, but he let the bird go. 

00:00:13.473 --> 00:00:17.013
 But no worries, more wildlife in action, later in this video. 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.212
 I drove back to Cairns where I found a Dutch girl, an Italian and a Frenchman to ride with me. 

00:00:22.212 --> 00:00:26.923
 On June 6 we drove to Darwin. As you can see I was well prepared. 

00:00:26.923 --> 00:00:32.913
 I charge almost everything, but after a few hours of driving, I realized .. 

00:00:33.382 --> 00:00:36.382
 that my navigation system let me sit again. 

00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:41.017
 Instead of driving through Townsville, I drove directly from Cairns to Darwin. 

00:00:41.402 --> 00:00:44.785
 Which means, 250 kilometers of unpaved road. 

00:00:45.264 --> 00:00:47.742
 You really don't want to do that without 4WD. 

00:00:47.742 --> 00:00:51.758
 Just like bridges, they are completely flooded. 

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:22.972
 After this 2-day road trip, we arrived in Darwin, but I didn't stay in the city for long. 

00:01:22.388 --> 00:01:28.764
 Because I didn't have much time and there are some beautiful national parks around Darwin that I wanted to visit. 

00:01:28.076 --> 00:01:31.556
 Like this one, Litchfield 

00:01:42.804 --> 00:01:45.910
 After Litchfield we also went to Kakadu. 

00:01:56.334 --> 00:02:00.320
 In addition to the beautiful nature, there is also a lot of Aboriginal history. 

00:02:00.769 --> 00:02:04.050
 Such as murals, in weird places like this. 

00:02:06.272 --> 00:02:08.830
 After our own 2 day Kakadu trip I dropped off the girls in Darwin .. 

00:02:08.827 --> 00:02:12.680
 and I picked up two boys I knew from the east coast. 

00:02:13.824 --> 00:02:18.480
 The three of us traveled south, but I still had to see jumping crocodiles. 

00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:47.560
 After an ice-cold night in the middle of the desert, we continued our way to Alice Springs where we went to this reptile museum. 

00:02:48.127 --> 00:02:51.470
 In addition to different types of lizards, they have this large Olive Python. 

00:02:54.896 --> 00:03:00.900
 And we don't stop here for gas, we drive through a "drive through Liquor store" for a few beers. 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.740
 The next morning we left for Uluru. 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.660
 The giant orange stone that I had to see since I was in Australia. 

00:03:30.497 --> 00:03:37.830
 I was surprised how intensive the climbing was, but of course we reached the top. 

00:03:48.636 --> 00:03:54.480
 With a bag of chips, a beer and hundreds of other tourists we watched the beautiful sunset. 

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:58.160
 The next morning we left for Cooper Pedy. 

00:03:58.161 --> 00:04:01.130
 A small town known for its "Opal Mines" 

00:03:58.161 --> 00:04:01.130
 A small town known for its "Opal Mines" 

00:04:01.758 --> 00:04:05.170
 She demonstrated how they dug the mines, which was quite interesting. 

00:04:16.869 --> 00:04:21.360
 After we had looked into mine, we continued our way to the south. 

00:04:22.369 --> 00:04:26.500
 We stayed in Adelaide for a few days and I dropped off Justin and Martijn in Melbourne. 

00:04:26.496 --> 00:04:32.250
 My plan was to go to New Zealand, but I first wanted to work to save some money. 

00:04:32.623 --> 00:04:37.050
 So why waste my time working if I could go to my home base in Australia. 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.390
 As you can see it was a lot quieter. 

00:04:50.392 --> 00:04:52.650
 Within a few days I had a new job with Irises, Lilies and Tulips. 

00:04:54.737 --> 00:04:58.220
 Are they going to make it? There is no way back! 

00:04:58.992 --> 00:05:03.780
 Because of all the flower farmers with Dutch ancestors you could buy all these traditional Dutch foods such as .. 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:12.110
 What was nice to eat after 8 months and it helped Damian improve his Dutch. 

00:05:16.415 --> 00:05:19.380
 Another good time in Emerald, but I had to continue. 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:27.350
 In the last 8.5 months I had driven more than 12,000 km. 

00:05:27.348 --> 00:05:30.370
 I saw most of the things I wanted to see, so it was time to move on.
