00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:07.149
 what do you know about games translated and voiced 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:09.889
 lower the special of a pair of gamer 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:11.780
 did you know that golden oh should have 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.519
 be a 2d side-scroller for super 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.320
 nintendo 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:17.090
 air recently created at that time 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.980
 donkey kong country deprived that easier 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.880
 all will make a sorcerer and look like 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.890
 tdi casey 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.439
 but they decided to make a rail shooter 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.939
 when you saw the game virtua cop from sega 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.650
 for soon coming out 64bit nintendo 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:33.110
 to create a sorcerer and was collected 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.030
 a team of ten people eight of them 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.010
 never worked on a game before 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.010
 however, this idea promised to be something 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.290
 interesting since they never did 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.870
 games they were not shackled by various patterns 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.310
 framework of the genre 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.110
 the main desire of the developers was 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.720
 make and breast and the most shooter 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.240
 chips like reloading weapons 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.550
 penalties for killing innocent and zoom at 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.410
 pressed from the trigger on the gamepad were 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.780
 added thanks to similar mechanics 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.100
 the game in the yurt shackles the team made years 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.470
 your version of the level with gas 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.630
 warheads but later decided to give the player 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.100
 captivity and control of the movement took the idea 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.570
 into service so how free 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.250
 level moving unlike 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.080
 attachment to the rails did gameplay 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.060
 more wonderful first year of creation 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.830
 fasting was spent on consciousness 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.260
 engine and on creating a model for it 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.440
 testing the main task of designers 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.150
 was the creation of interesting levels 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.700
 tasks and enemies added a little later 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.830
 the team has compiled a list of gang lotions 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.770
 from the movie about that they were made later 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.040
 what levels can be used 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.909
 one of the creators martin hollis said 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.770
 advantage of such careless 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.810
 unplanned approach is that 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.890
 many levels we walked realistic from 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.110
 feelings of linearity 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.420
 realism was that in many 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.159
 the rooms in the game were things that were not 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.020
 there was a need but in reality these 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.880
 the rooms would be empty at all 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.920
 would be an important attachment process 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.860
 mission level tasks was similar to such 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.630
 same process super mario 64 differences in 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.940
 the fact that in the gold for these tasks must 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.040
 were to be performed in one passage 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.659
 much better than restarting level 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.940
 after each of the tasks performed 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.740
 goldener earned senju how 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.209
 market apprentice development kit for 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.670
 nintendo 64 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.470
 the engine was working on the CJ workstation 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.700
 and onyx 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.330
 the game was tested with 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.860
 we update but gamepad from sega saturn 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.510
 after they got bundled to 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.610
 imported tynda they had an idea 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.680
 reloading game weapons with 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.560
 when connecting disconnecting the gamepad to 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.050
 a certain prefix it was attached 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.320
 idealism and gameplay but the idea is not 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.000
 Liked men start level when 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.070
 the camera circles around the bond and then 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.200
 dwelling lamp bulb puts his hand 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.820
 so that the revelation of the clock was made for 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.740
 so that the player more and more 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.580
 felt like a real james 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.530
 Bond is amazing what about multiplayer in 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.950
 Kolpino and at first did not think and did 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.660
 his wool the day before the game's release 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.850
 the brand did not know the character models before 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.760
 the moment the teams didn't show them 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.010
 not river nilin awnings agreed 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.920
 on multiplayer mode despite this 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.290
 he was nevertheless made more surprising 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.570
 online games to reach the release due to the fact 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.060
 that there was a period when the team sat without 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.459
 financing from nintendo for three months 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.020
 nintendo thought the game was too much 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.600
 bugs and ideas not profitable 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.519
 despite and tarir believed in the project and 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.610
 continued funding the team 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.890
 fucking finally came out in 1997 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.110
 after two and a half years of development 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.940
 also developed racing version 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.030
 games before virtual fight but project never 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.830
 came to share 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.930
 three actors who starred james 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.010
 bond previously should have been available in 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.010
 game as a character 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.750
 Shaun Connery Roger Moore and Timothy Dalton 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.430
 should have been in multiplayer but were 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.769
 taken out for fear of litigation 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.480
 voters 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.620
 character models repeated outlines 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.870
 real actors 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.750
 and died there was no right to use them 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.030
 looks you can see the characters 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.790
 on page 20 of the game guide them 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.739
 traces are scattered around gave dat at 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.830
 using game codes you can return 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.150
 their portraits in the character selection menu 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.140
 Bartlett will replace the portrait of the pier cast 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.750
 but 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.519
 game model will remain the same also 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.110
 what is supposed to be here 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.870
 allow you to play for early bonds 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.239
 Aztec Egyptian Bonus Missions 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.220
 screenshots of the beta version of the game showed 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.440
 that portraits will be used 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.450
 individual save slots but in 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.640
 the final version anyway everywhere 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.380
 no formidable all the funds were pushed into 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.200
 golden however there is a reference to them 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.970
 another successful greater perfect dark all 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.520
 four riots can be chosen as 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.320
 characters in a multiplayer game one of 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.270
 other secrets of gold on is 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.050
 running zx in-game emulator 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.540
 spectrum 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.730
 in march 2012 one of the users 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.960
 old shape according to gold on and found 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.450
 emulator in game code 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.730
 emulators was an experiment of one of 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.070
 developer stephane of and he wanted 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.440
 to find out if nintendo 64 can 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.900
 emulate games for their spectrum emulator 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.060
 the piston had to be removed however to 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.150
 from the emulator did not interfere with the game and in 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.980
 a patch was eventually left 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.050
 which allowed the emulator to run from 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.850
 screen with a choice of hitting the kit with 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.710
 emulator went a little toy all of 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.540
 which rer eighties were made 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.320
 years when they were still called the ultimate 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.660
 play the game 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.940
 I was also unused 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.830
 multiplayer levels 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.930
 park statues and crade level of 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.970
 single player campaign also had to 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.010
 be available for multiplayer games 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.050
 using codes to activate these 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.940
 levels in multiplayer level with 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.919
 statues we gave level cray was 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.140
 the position of all items is adjusted and 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.570
 points of resurgence for the players which is not in 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.430
 other single player levels in 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.900
 single cradle campaigns 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.210
 pretty low fps 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.760
 I run it in multiplayer mode fps 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.500
 is even more likely this 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.310
 the reason in which the level was removed from 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.229
 multiplayer 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.110
 as moisture does not allow players to play 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:52.510
 normally it was also assumed that 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.820
 level with statues too dark 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.130
 the atmosphere is not suitable i multiplayer 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.169
 In addition to this, the code of the game has found 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.240
 one used level citadel 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:02.650
 level after all launched it was not 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.780
 similar to no other level 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.940
 multiplayer and stayed in terrible 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.610
 condition since apparently was not built 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.890
 it can also be fully run when 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.320
 help codes but what you see you 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:16.210
 not at all happy player passes through 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.130
 walls instead of going up 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.169
 elevation level citadel 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.820
 was supposed to test the game was 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:23.919
 created at a very early stage of development 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.910
 because it did not stop it 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:26.910
 included in the list in 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:40.070
 gaming to my bed is a man from mdf and 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:43.220
 antilles period did not read a samovar he or 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:45.470
 russian initiative that his mom with 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.760
 writes mother's jackal of might have paid 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:51.490
 my games convention 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.490
 children d i'm gonna leave off as own it
