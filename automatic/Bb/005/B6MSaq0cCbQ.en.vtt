we also do the the other side of the

we also do the the other side of the
spectrum<00:00:24.650> kids<00:00:25.429> treehouses<00:00:25.970> more<00:00:26.539> simple

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:26.929 
spectrum kids treehouses more simple

spectrum kids treehouses more simple
projects<00:00:27.880> often<00:00:29.499> platformer<00:00:30.499> with<00:00:30.769> a<00:00:30.800> with<00:00:31.310> a

roof<00:00:31.609> of<00:00:31.789> some<00:00:31.999> kind<00:00:32.300> I<00:00:32.540> think<00:00:33.020> our<00:00:33.230> our<00:00:33.760> real

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
roof of some kind I think our our real

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.990 
roof of some kind I think our our real
specialty<00:00:35.750> of<00:00:35.960> course<00:00:36.230> is<00:00:36.609> connecting<00:00:37.609> to<00:00:37.789> the

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
specialty of course is connecting to the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.599 
specialty of course is connecting to the
trees<00:00:38.300> and<00:00:38.329> and<00:00:38.840> that<00:00:39.559> interface<00:00:40.100> between<00:00:40.129> the

00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:40.609 
trees and and that interface between the

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:44.349 
trees and and that interface between the
tree<00:00:40.879> and<00:00:40.910> the<00:00:41.510> structure<00:00:42.070> is<00:00:43.070> so<00:00:43.609> important<00:00:44.179> I

00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:44.359 
tree and the structure is so important I

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:46.959 
tree and the structure is so important I
think<00:00:44.780> all<00:00:44.899> kids<00:00:45.109> have<00:00:45.379> that<00:00:45.559> that<00:00:45.920> urge<00:00:46.609> to

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
think all kids have that that urge to

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:48.250 
think all kids have that that urge to
have<00:00:47.059> a<00:00:47.090> treehouse<00:00:47.359> in<00:00:47.690> their<00:00:47.809> life<00:00:47.989> you<00:00:48.019> know

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
have a treehouse in their life you know

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.630 
have a treehouse in their life you know
that<00:00:48.379> little<00:00:48.500> safe<00:00:48.769> spot<00:00:49.070> that<00:00:49.219> they<00:00:49.309> can<00:00:49.460> call

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
that little safe spot that they can call

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.389 
that little safe spot that they can call
their<00:00:49.850> own<00:00:49.879> and<00:00:50.300> and<00:00:51.289> when<00:00:51.739> you<00:00:51.829> grow<00:00:52.039> up<00:00:52.070> you

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
their own and and when you grow up you

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.700 
their own and and when you grow up you
you<00:00:52.640> maybe<00:00:53.089> some<00:00:53.390> people<00:00:53.539> lose<00:00:53.839> that<00:00:54.050> but<00:00:54.260> when

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
you maybe some people lose that but when

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.229 
you maybe some people lose that but when
you<00:00:54.800> get<00:00:54.890> a<00:00:54.949> couple<00:00:55.129> acres<00:00:55.489> of<00:00:55.640> land<00:00:55.820> like<00:00:55.999> this

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
you get a couple acres of land like this

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:57.489 
you get a couple acres of land like this
and<00:00:56.300> you<00:00:56.539> have<00:00:56.570> all<00:00:56.749> these<00:00:56.870> big<00:00:57.050> beautiful

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:57.499 
and you have all these big beautiful

00:00:57.499 --> 00:00:58.959 
and you have all these big beautiful
trees<00:00:57.769> that<00:00:58.039> that<00:00:58.249> little<00:00:58.429> memory<00:00:58.760> that

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
trees that that little memory that

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:00.959 
trees that that little memory that
little<00:00:59.179> warm<00:00:59.539> fuzzy<00:00:59.899> feeling<00:01:00.199> comes<00:01:00.410> back<00:01:00.649> and

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
little warm fuzzy feeling comes back and

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.250 
little warm fuzzy feeling comes back and
so<00:01:01.969> the<00:01:02.120> idea<00:01:02.359> of<00:01:02.420> having<00:01:02.539> a<00:01:02.719> treehouse<00:01:02.929> is

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
so the idea of having a treehouse is

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.960 
so the idea of having a treehouse is
something<00:01:03.620> the<00:01:04.339> day<00:01:04.489> we<00:01:04.610> bought<00:01:04.760> this

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
something the day we bought this

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.520 
something the day we bought this
property<00:01:05.120> I<00:01:05.449> wanted<00:01:05.810> to<00:01:05.870> put<00:01:06.020> a<00:01:06.050> tree<00:01:06.260> house<00:01:06.380> on

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
property I wanted to put a tree house on

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.650

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:13.730 
been talking about it since I was seven

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.790 
been talking about it since I was seven
he<00:01:13.760> said<00:01:14.180> not<00:01:14.840> until<00:01:15.140> we<00:01:15.260> finish<00:01:15.410> the<00:01:15.650> bathroom

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
he said not until we finish the bathroom

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.950 
he said not until we finish the bathroom
not<00:01:16.280> until<00:01:16.550> we<00:01:16.640> finish<00:01:16.760> the<00:01:17.000> well<00:01:17.150> and<00:01:17.600> then

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
not until we finish the well and then

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.140 
not until we finish the well and then
we'll<00:01:18.110> do<00:01:18.230> the<00:01:18.260> tree<00:01:18.530> house<00:01:18.650> and<00:01:19.150> actually

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
we'll do the tree house and actually

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.620 
we'll do the tree house and actually
they<00:01:20.630> haven't<00:01:21.050> finished<00:01:21.170> Oh<00:01:21.880> bathroom<00:01:22.880> mat<00:01:23.300> so

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
they haven't finished Oh bathroom mat so

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.660 
they haven't finished Oh bathroom mat so
we<00:01:23.960> got<00:01:24.110> our<00:01:24.230> tree<00:01:24.380> house<00:01:24.530> before<00:01:24.860> that<00:01:25.040> so<00:01:25.550> the

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
we got our tree house before that so the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.340 
we got our tree house before that so the
idea<00:01:25.910> that<00:01:25.940> I<00:01:26.060> can<00:01:26.150> give<00:01:26.390> my<00:01:26.540> kids<00:01:26.810> that<00:01:27.050> warm

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
idea that I can give my kids that warm

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.040 
idea that I can give my kids that warm
fuzzy<00:01:27.680> kind<00:01:28.070> of<00:01:28.190> safe<00:01:29.120> place<00:01:29.420> for<00:01:29.630> them<00:01:29.780> to<00:01:29.810> be

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
fuzzy kind of safe place for them to be

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.290 
fuzzy kind of safe place for them to be
to<00:01:30.260> someplace<00:01:30.620> they<00:01:30.890> can<00:01:31.040> call<00:01:31.190> their<00:01:31.370> own<00:01:31.400> it

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
to someplace they can call their own it

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.200 
to someplace they can call their own it
is<00:01:32.540> very<00:01:32.840> important<00:01:33.230> to<00:01:33.260> me<00:01:33.410> so<00:01:33.880> when<00:01:34.880> I<00:01:34.910> get<00:01:35.180> a

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
is very important to me so when I get a

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.470 
is very important to me so when I get a
call<00:01:35.510> from<00:01:35.870> a<00:01:36.050> client<00:01:36.880> many<00:01:37.880> times<00:01:38.180> they're

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
call from a client many times they're

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.730 
call from a client many times they're
not<00:01:38.690> sure<00:01:39.230> where<00:01:39.440> to<00:01:39.470> begin<00:01:39.650> and<00:01:41.110> really<00:01:42.110> the

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
not sure where to begin and really the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.570 
not sure where to begin and really the
the<00:01:43.340> trees<00:01:44.560> themselves<00:01:45.560> are<00:01:45.710> the<00:01:46.220> ultimate

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
the trees themselves are the ultimate

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.660 
the trees themselves are the ultimate
designers<00:01:47.540> in<00:01:47.750> this<00:01:47.930> process<00:01:48.440> so<00:01:48.710> my<00:01:49.340> first

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
designers in this process so my first

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.670 
designers in this process so my first
suggestion<00:01:50.150> is<00:01:50.450> that<00:01:50.690> I<00:01:50.720> come<00:01:51.080> out<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:51.500> have<00:01:51.650> a

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
suggestion is that I come out and have a

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.160 
suggestion is that I come out and have a
look<00:01:52.270> see<00:01:53.270> what<00:01:53.300> sort<00:01:53.690> of<00:01:53.750> trees<00:01:53.990> are

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
look see what sort of trees are

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.960 
look see what sort of trees are
available<00:01:54.650> sometimes<00:01:55.400> there's<00:01:55.580> just<00:01:55.670> one

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
available sometimes there's just one

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.910 
available sometimes there's just one
tree<00:01:56.270> sometimes<00:01:56.570> there's<00:01:56.960> there's<00:01:57.500> many

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
tree sometimes there's there's many

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.000 
tree sometimes there's there's many
possibilities<00:01:58.880> and<00:01:59.150> opportunities<00:01:59.920> one<00:02:00.920> of

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
possibilities and opportunities one of

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.530 
possibilities and opportunities one of
the<00:02:01.070> many<00:02:01.220> things<00:02:01.370> we<00:02:01.520> do<00:02:01.760> and<00:02:02.120> offer<00:02:02.300> as

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
the many things we do and offer as

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.390 
the many things we do and offer as
treehouse<00:02:02.840> builders<00:02:03.200> is<00:02:03.380> just<00:02:03.890> to<00:02:04.040> build<00:02:04.220> a

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
safe solid foundation I like to do a lot

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.570 
safe solid foundation I like to do a lot
of<00:02:44.780> work<00:02:44.930> myself<00:02:45.110> and<00:02:45.560> I<00:02:46.160> thought<00:02:46.430> about

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
of work myself and I thought about

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.780 
of work myself and I thought about
putting<00:02:46.700> a<00:02:47.150> tree<00:02:47.540> house<00:02:47.690> in<00:02:48.370> for<00:02:49.370> a<00:02:49.400> while<00:02:49.610> and

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
putting a tree house in for a while and

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.020 
putting a tree house in for a while and
I<00:02:49.850> thought<00:02:50.000> about<00:02:50.090> how<00:02:50.300> I<00:02:50.330> would<00:02:50.480> do<00:02:50.780> it<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.080> I

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
I thought about how I would do it and I

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.180 
I thought about how I would do it and I
kept<00:02:53.030> we<00:02:53.840> had<00:02:53.959> a<00:02:53.990> lot<00:02:54.350> of<00:02:54.380> concern<00:02:54.800> you<00:02:55.070> know

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
kept we had a lot of concern you know

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.410 
kept we had a lot of concern you know
you<00:02:55.250> attach<00:02:55.520> something<00:02:55.910> to<00:02:56.000> a<00:02:56.030> tree<00:02:56.270> and<00:02:56.300> the

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
you attach something to a tree and the

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.670 
you attach something to a tree and the
tree<00:02:56.630> moves<00:02:56.870> and<00:02:56.989> that<00:02:57.080> thing<00:02:57.260> slowly<00:02:57.470> gets

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
tree moves and that thing slowly gets

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.430 
tree moves and that thing slowly gets
broken<00:02:57.890> apart<00:02:58.280> so<00:02:58.850> I<00:02:59.180> called<00:02:59.690> Pete<00:03:00.020> and<00:03:00.200> kind

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
broken apart so I called Pete and kind

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.780 
broken apart so I called Pete and kind
of<00:03:00.500> picked<00:03:00.830> his<00:03:00.980> brain<00:03:01.220> a<00:03:01.250> little<00:03:01.400> bit<00:03:01.610> the

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
of picked his brain a little bit the

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.520 
of picked his brain a little bit the
more<00:03:01.910> he<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:02.120> I<00:03:02.270> talked<00:03:02.600> the<00:03:02.900> more<00:03:03.050> I<00:03:03.110> realized

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
more he and I talked the more I realized

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.740 
more he and I talked the more I realized
that<00:03:03.800> one<00:03:04.610> part<00:03:04.880> where<00:03:05.060> it<00:03:05.150> attaches<00:03:05.360> to<00:03:05.600> the

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
that one part where it attaches to the

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.090 
that one part where it attaches to the
tree<00:03:05.959> needs<00:03:06.110> to<00:03:06.170> be<00:03:06.260> done<00:03:06.470> professionally

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
tree needs to be done professionally

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.010 
tree needs to be done professionally
otherwise<00:03:07.670> all<00:03:08.000> that<00:03:08.180> work<00:03:08.360> I<00:03:08.540> spent<00:03:08.840> on<00:03:08.930> the

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
otherwise all that work I spent on the

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.840 
otherwise all that work I spent on the
rest<00:03:09.200> of<00:03:09.320> the<00:03:09.380> tree<00:03:09.560> house<00:03:09.680> in<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.040> next<00:03:10.400> 10-15

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.729 
rest of the tree house in the next 10-15

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
years just kind of get torn apart as

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.260 
years just kind of get torn apart as

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
that tree moves in the wind how do you

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.449 
that tree moves in the wind how do you
go<00:03:14.390> about<00:03:14.510> building<00:03:14.870> something<00:03:15.470> that's<00:03:16.070> going

go about building something that's going

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.760 
go about building something that's going

in<00:05:09.560> the<00:05:09.620> trees<00:05:09.860> to<00:05:10.130> get<00:05:10.310> you<00:05:10.760> know<00:05:10.850> people<00:05:11.510> and

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
in the trees to get you know people and

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.410 
in the trees to get you know people and
tools<00:05:12.410> and<00:05:12.860> most<00:05:13.340> importantly<00:05:13.880> big<00:05:14.180> heavy

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:14.420 
tools and most importantly big heavy

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:15.940 
tools and most importantly big heavy
carrying<00:05:14.990> beams<00:05:15.260> that<00:05:15.590> are<00:05:15.620> going<00:05:15.740> to<00:05:15.800> carry

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
carrying beams that are going to carry

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.260 
carrying beams that are going to carry
the<00:05:16.130> load<00:05:16.250> of<00:05:16.340> the<00:05:16.400> treehouse<00:05:16.580> up<00:05:16.880> in<00:05:17.000> the<00:05:17.090> tree

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
the load of the treehouse up in the tree

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.690 
the load of the treehouse up in the tree
so<00:05:17.780> we<00:05:17.960> set<00:05:18.170> ropes<00:05:18.470> and<00:05:18.740> blocks<00:05:18.890> and<00:05:19.340> pulleys

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
so we set ropes and blocks and pulleys

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.550 
so we set ropes and blocks and pulleys
and<00:05:19.970> mechanical<00:05:20.480> advantage<00:05:20.930> and<00:05:21.140> come-alongs

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
and mechanical advantage and come-alongs

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.350 
and mechanical advantage and come-alongs
and<00:05:21.770> all<00:05:21.860> this<00:05:22.010> stuff<00:05:22.130> up<00:05:22.370> in<00:05:22.490> the<00:05:22.520> trees<00:05:22.790> in<00:05:23.150> a

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
and all this stuff up in the trees in a

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.690 
and all this stuff up in the trees in a
manner<00:05:23.570> to<00:05:23.690> pick<00:05:24.350> you<00:05:24.620> know<00:05:24.650> 1,200<00:05:25.310> pounds<00:05:25.580> up

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
manner to pick you know 1,200 pounds up

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.820 
manner to pick you know 1,200 pounds up
and<00:05:25.940> perch<00:05:26.150> it<00:05:26.270> on<00:05:26.360> a<00:05:26.390> Geo<00:05:26.660> the<00:05:27.380> way<00:05:27.680> the

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
and perch it on a Geo the way the

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.620 
and perch it on a Geo the way the
structure<00:05:28.400> was<00:05:28.550> built<00:05:28.820> is<00:05:28.970> very<00:05:29.030> important

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
structure was built is very important

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.630 
structure was built is very important
like<00:05:30.140> I<00:05:30.260> said<00:05:30.470> earlier<00:05:30.770> I<00:05:30.980> didn't<00:05:31.400> want<00:05:31.550> it<00:05:31.610> to

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
like I said earlier I didn't want it to

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.970 
like I said earlier I didn't want it to
fall<00:05:31.820> apart<00:05:32.150> I<00:05:32.630> also<00:05:33.020> have<00:05:33.350> the<00:05:33.800> most

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980 
fall apart I also have the most

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.290 
fall apart I also have the most
important<00:05:34.370> thing<00:05:34.460> in<00:05:34.580> my<00:05:34.610> life<00:05:34.850> in<00:05:35.030> there<00:05:35.150> my

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
important thing in my life in there my

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.940 
important thing in my life in there my
kids<00:05:35.360> and<00:05:35.930> so<00:05:36.260> I<00:05:36.290> don't<00:05:36.500> want<00:05:36.620> this<00:05:36.740> thing<00:05:36.800> to

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
kids and so I don't want this thing to

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.500 
kids and so I don't want this thing to
fall<00:05:37.160> apart<00:05:37.430> when<00:05:37.520> they're<00:05:37.970> within<00:05:38.270> there

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
fall apart when they're within there

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.330 
fall apart when they're within there
with<00:05:38.660> their<00:05:38.780> friends<00:05:39.170> so<00:05:39.380> it<00:05:40.070> was<00:05:40.190> very

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
with their friends so it was very

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.660 
with their friends so it was very
important<00:05:40.760> that<00:05:40.910> it<00:05:41.210> be<00:05:41.450> done<00:05:41.600> right<00:05:41.900> and<00:05:42.830> be

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:43.670 
important that it be done right and be

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.250 
important that it be done right and be
done<00:05:43.880> right<00:05:44.000> the<00:05:44.150> first<00:05:44.180> time<00:05:44.450> so<00:05:44.600> the

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
done right the first time so the

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.680 
done right the first time so the
structure<00:05:45.650> is<00:05:45.950> safe<00:05:46.430> sound<00:05:46.880> and<00:05:47.120> strong<00:05:47.300> and

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
structure is safe sound and strong and

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.120 
structure is safe sound and strong and
I'm<00:05:48.020> very<00:05:48.170> happy<00:05:48.350> with<00:05:48.530> what<00:05:48.740> I<00:05:48.770> got<00:05:48.830> out<00:05:49.040> of

that<00:05:49.160> so<00:05:49.880> yeah<00:05:50.090> my<00:05:50.330> inspiration<00:05:50.870> for<00:05:51.020> building

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 
that so yeah my inspiration for building

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.160 
that so yeah my inspiration for building
a<00:05:51.320> treehouse<00:05:51.560> you<00:05:51.860> know<00:05:52.570> and<00:05:53.570> then<00:05:53.720> I<00:05:53.870> get<00:05:54.050> it

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.170 
a treehouse you know and then I get it

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.980 
a treehouse you know and then I get it
after<00:05:54.440> she's<00:05:54.620> done<00:05:54.950> with<00:05:55.130> it<00:05:55.300> so<00:05:56.300> yeah<00:05:56.510> we<00:05:56.690> we

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
after she's done with it so yeah we we

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.550 
after she's done with it so yeah we we
had<00:05:57.200> a<00:05:57.230> we<00:05:57.800> had<00:05:58.040> a<00:05:58.460> busy<00:05:59.150> time<00:05:59.360> and<00:05:59.780> some

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
had a we had a busy time and some

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.890 
had a we had a busy time and some
heavy-duty<00:06:01.160> rain<00:06:01.580> but<00:06:02.000> we<00:06:02.240> really<00:06:02.540> enjoyed

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
heavy-duty rain but we really enjoyed

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.500 
heavy-duty rain but we really enjoyed
ourselves<00:06:03.080> and<00:06:03.620> and<00:06:03.830> I<00:06:04.190> know<00:06:04.250> that's<00:06:05.180> that's

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
ourselves and and I know that's that's

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.420 
ourselves and and I know that's that's
often<00:06:05.900> the<00:06:05.930> case<00:06:06.200> is<00:06:06.440> to<00:06:06.530> get<00:06:06.680> people<00:06:06.980> started

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
often the case is to get people started

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.940 
often the case is to get people started
with<00:06:07.610> their<00:06:07.760> treehouse<00:06:08.180> and<00:06:08.420> do<00:06:09.230> it<00:06:09.380> properly

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:09.950 
with their treehouse and do it properly

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.920 
with their treehouse and do it properly
and<00:06:10.310> have<00:06:11.060> something<00:06:11.330> that's<00:06:11.570> going<00:06:11.660> to<00:06:11.720> last

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
and have something that's going to last

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.770 
and have something that's going to last
a<00:06:12.140> good<00:06:12.290> long<00:06:12.350> time<00:06:12.860> be<00:06:13.490> safe<00:06:13.820> both<00:06:14.210> to<00:06:14.690> the

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780 
a good long time be safe both to the

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.860 
a good long time be safe both to the
people<00:06:15.110> into<00:06:15.560> the<00:06:15.680> tree<00:06:15.950> and<00:06:16.280> and<00:06:16.970> then<00:06:17.480> on<00:06:17.600> top

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870 
people into the tree and and then on top

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.620 
people into the tree and and then on top
of<00:06:18.020> that<00:06:18.110> platform<00:06:18.320> go<00:06:18.800> ahead<00:06:18.980> and<00:06:19.100> build<00:06:19.630> your

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:20.630
