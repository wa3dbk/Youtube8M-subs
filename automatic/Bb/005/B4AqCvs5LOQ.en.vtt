00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.090
 You and your family would board an airplane. 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.510
 knowing he does not have an abs system probably not despite this 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.700
 it is estimated that only 13 percent of cars sold in Brazil 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.369
 are equipped with abs 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.089
 equipment still seen as a luxury item 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:21.630
 to prove that security is not luxury 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.720
 we decided to take two cals to the track and evaluate the performance of these themes 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.720
 like abs and psp mercier 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.960
 the function of the abs has prevented the locking of the wheels during a penalty 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.880
 we evaluated the abs in three trials the first of them was a braking 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.410
 classic at 30 miles per hour on wet with abs the car stopped at 21 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.160
 subway 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.600
 without abs went 26 meters to stop 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.080
 besides the difference of space another advantage of the abs was the maintenance of the 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.330
 maneuverability the second test consisted in the deviation of an obstacle 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.810
 this time we came at 70 kilometers per hour due to braking on the asphalt 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:06.450
 wet 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.910
 in time to dodge a number of things on the line 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.430
 with abs chauffeur scared but can deviate from goals 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.180
 without abs 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.439
 when the wheels caught driver tried to divert another safe car 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.080
 in the third test that stimulated a braking condition on 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.480
 different adhesions 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.890
 this happens for example when a wheel falls on the shoulder when it exists 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.440
 an oil stain on the sink 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.020
 the abs monitors this grip condition which allows braking 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.030
 balanced 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.060
 without abs the driver can not hold the car that skidded over his 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.040
 own axis 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.940
 This is because stores with less adhesion lock and bial as they are 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.990
 the others provoking this vote
