00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.319 
and over again you don't have to throw
it<00:02:49.709> away<00:02:49.769> after<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.609> get<00:02:50.700> done<00:02:50.820> using<00:02:51.000> it<00:02:51.209> this

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
it away after you get done using it this

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.090 
it away after you get done using it this
time<00:02:51.390> but<00:02:51.810> then<00:02:52.320> we're<00:02:52.530> actually<00:02:52.769> going<00:02:53.010> to

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
time but then we're actually going to

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.280 
time but then we're actually going to
use<00:02:53.130> it<00:02:53.310> as<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.430> stamp<00:02:53.760> watch<00:02:54.420> this<00:02:54.690> it<00:02:54.930> is<00:02:55.079> so

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290
