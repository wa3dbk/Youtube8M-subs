00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:07.710
 I think everyone of us knows that 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.720

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.500

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.090
 busy day you want one more 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.630

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:21.030
 So what makes you man, of course, you flaschen 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.670
 is comfortable on the couch but is 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.380
 one does not really relax deeply now 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.700
 really makes the everyday clothes 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.570
 then somehow always a stroke 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.480
 through the bill 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.360
 So you need loose comfortable 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.680
 clothes but sweatpants came yes 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.530
 do not take that yes from the 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.820
 society stigmatizes without end of 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.829
 graduation even a little earlier 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.370
 Mr. what makes you clear 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.809
 you take a cool overall if that 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.340
 just now said so really 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.649
 that's right times 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.680
 but it is clear that our overalls 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.710
 super duper diligent are the existing ones 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.239
 to 35 percent cotton and 65 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.360
 percent of polyester is the cut 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.309
 long time very generous, yes, too 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.049
 be comfortable 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.329
 thanks to the long zipper at the 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.810
 front dressing is only a matter 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:11.810
 from seconds 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.340
 The outfit is completed by two 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.340
 bags and a hood 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.360
 on the front you will find 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.510
 small superman logo on the back 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.850
 a pretty big one there you feel 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.590
 but smooth as a real hero without 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.050
 now put on such a tight costume 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.850
 have to 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.470
 who does not have it with superman 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:46.140
 may be more interested in 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:52.710
 a jumpsuit by batman r2d2 darth 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.670
 vader the typical stormtrooper or 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.460
 also one 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:01.080
 The jumpsuit very important the overalls 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.430
 have a single size and 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.920
 Unit sizes are known to fall 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.090
 is relatively large in the case now 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.800
 not so bad because they should 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.550
 loose sit and be totally comfortable 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.740
 that's why they wanted to be huge 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.690
 one also say that if here is 1 80 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.040
 big fits pretty much but if you 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.500
 let's show there is still a bit of air 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:25.080
 or that's good there you can yes 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.030
 continue to eat safely also relative 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.770
 it is important so that the super duper 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.560
 you should stay meaty 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.560
 overalls at 30 degrees do not wash anymore 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.800
 us comfortable and very warm 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:44.280
 good or bad were good 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:49.700
