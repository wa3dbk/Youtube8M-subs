so<00:00:04.810> next<00:00:05.590> test<00:00:06.220> is<00:00:06.609> going<00:00:06.880> to<00:00:07.149> be<00:00:07.300> with<00:00:07.540> the

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
so next test is going to be with the

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.049 
so next test is going to be with the
sl55<00:00:09.610> to<00:00:10.360> 210<00:00:11.170> millimeter<00:00:11.709> talents<00:00:12.490> made<00:00:12.789> for

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:13.059 
sl55 to 210 millimeter talents made for

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.930 
sl55 to 210 millimeter talents made for
the<00:00:13.180> next<00:00:13.449> cameras<00:00:14.160> this<00:00:15.160> is<00:00:15.340> of<00:00:15.490> course<00:00:15.699> in

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940 
the next cameras this is of course in

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.680 
the next cameras this is of course in
the<00:00:16.059> crop<00:00:16.330> mode<00:00:16.630> now<00:00:17.050> and<00:00:17.970> this<00:00:18.970> is<00:00:19.180> one<00:00:19.359> of<00:00:19.390> the

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:19.690 
the crop mode now and this is one of the

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.320 
the crop mode now and this is one of the
lenses<00:00:20.650> that<00:00:20.680> are<00:00:21.040> known<00:00:21.310> to<00:00:21.610> be<00:00:21.880> quite

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
lenses that are known to be quite

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.450 
lenses that are known to be quite
slowing<00:00:22.990> out<00:00:23.140> of<00:00:23.350> focusing<00:00:23.860> there<00:00:24.040> is<00:00:24.160> a<00:00:24.190> long

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
slowing out of focusing there is a long

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.050 
slowing out of focusing there is a long
throw

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
throw

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.260 
throw
it's<00:00:25.510> a<00:00:25.660> zoom<00:00:25.900> lens<00:00:26.140> it's<00:00:26.950> a<00:00:27.039> cheap<00:00:27.670> zoom<00:00:28.000> once

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 
it's a zoom lens it's a cheap zoom once

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.720 
it's a zoom lens it's a cheap zoom once
I<00:00:28.510> would<00:00:28.690> say<00:00:28.930> the<00:00:29.500> performance<00:00:30.130> is<00:00:30.310> not<00:00:30.340> that

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
I would say the performance is not that

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.430 
I would say the performance is not that
bad<00:00:31.660> at<00:00:31.990> all<00:00:32.910> nevertheless<00:00:33.910> let's<00:00:34.899> see<00:00:35.110> now<00:00:35.260> in

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
bad at all nevertheless let's see now in

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.069 
bad at all nevertheless let's see now in
good<00:00:35.650> light<00:00:35.950> how<00:00:36.579> long<00:00:36.820> it<00:00:37.030> will<00:00:37.180> take<00:00:37.480> it<00:00:37.750> I

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 
good light how long it will take it I

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.400 
good light how long it will take it I
had<00:00:38.620> to<00:00:39.130> focus<00:00:39.340> to<00:00:39.640> the<00:00:39.760> target<00:00:40.210> I<00:00:40.390> put<00:00:41.140> it<00:00:41.260> on

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
had to focus to the target I put it on

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.889 
had to focus to the target I put it on
200<00:00:41.890> millimeters<00:00:42.430> this<00:00:42.610> is<00:00:42.790> I<00:00:42.910> think<00:00:42.970> the<00:00:43.720> most

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
200 millimeters this is I think the most

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:46.770 
200 millimeters this is I think the most
challenging<00:00:44.520> situation<00:00:45.520> so<00:00:45.850> let's<00:00:46.329> see<00:00:46.570> that

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
challenging situation so let's see that

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.560 
challenging situation so let's see that
I<00:00:47.050> have<00:00:47.770> to<00:00:48.690> switch<00:00:49.690> it<00:00:49.899> back<00:00:49.930> to<00:00:50.380> autofocus

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
I have to switch it back to autofocus

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.260 
I have to switch it back to autofocus
now<00:00:52.570> we<00:00:52.809> are<00:00:52.899> ready<00:00:53.110> to<00:00:53.200> start<00:00:53.649> let's<00:00:54.190> start

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.690 

that<00:00:58.270> was<00:00:58.480> it<00:00:58.660> I<00:00:58.840> think<00:00:59.290> not<00:00:59.950> bad<00:01:00.160> at<00:01:00.280> all<00:01:00.430> I

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
that was it I think not bad at all I

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.010 
that was it I think not bad at all I
don't<00:01:00.940> know<00:01:01.149> what<00:01:01.329> you<00:01:01.450> will<00:01:01.600> think<00:01:01.809> but<00:01:01.989> I

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
don't know what you will think but I

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.929 
don't know what you will think but I
think<00:01:02.200> it's<00:01:02.590> it's<00:01:02.890> quite<00:01:03.160> good<00:01:03.190> right<00:01:05.939> and

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
think it's it's quite good right and

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:10.020 
think it's it's quite good right and
once<00:01:07.270> again<00:01:07.509> there<00:01:07.959> is<00:01:08.280> less<00:01:09.280> light<00:01:09.549> now<00:01:09.850> in

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
once again there is less light now in

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.719 
once again there is less light now in
the<00:01:10.179> room<00:01:10.389> and<00:01:10.630> the<00:01:11.350> zoom<00:01:11.560> is<00:01:11.709> still<00:01:11.950> set<00:01:12.340> on

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
the room and the zoom is still set on

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:14.399 
the room and the zoom is still set on
200<00:01:13.600> millimeters

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
200 millimeters

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.949 
200 millimeters
it's<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:16.679> sl55<00:01:17.679> to<00:01:18.249> 210<00:01:18.880> millimeter<00:01:19.119> kit<00:01:19.659> lens

00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:19.959 
it's the sl55 to 210 millimeter kit lens

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:23.519 
it's the sl55 to 210 millimeter kit lens
made<00:01:20.259> for<00:01:20.529> Sony<00:01:20.829> and<00:01:21.509> once<00:01:22.509> again<00:01:22.749> we'll<00:01:23.200> try

00:01:23.519 --> 00:01:23.529 
made for Sony and once again we'll try

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:26.129 
made for Sony and once again we'll try
the<00:01:23.590> focus<00:01:24.189> speed<00:01:24.520> I<00:01:24.670> will<00:01:24.939> first<00:01:25.179> defocus<00:01:26.109> the

00:01:26.129 --> 00:01:26.139 
the focus speed I will first defocus the

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:31.620 
the focus speed I will first defocus the
lens<00:01:26.789> turning<00:01:27.789> it<00:01:27.939> all<00:01:28.359> the<00:01:28.630> way<00:01:28.779> down<00:01:29.249> to<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
lens turning it all the way down to the

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.410 
lens turning it all the way down to the
closest<00:01:32.139> possible<00:01:32.349> focus<00:01:33.159> now<00:01:33.880> I<00:01:33.909> will<00:01:34.270> switch

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
closest possible focus now I will switch

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.499 
closest possible focus now I will switch
it<00:01:34.689> back<00:01:34.869> to<00:01:35.049> the<00:01:35.200> autofocus<00:01:36.009> mode<00:01:36.279> and<00:01:36.579> let's

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
it back to the autofocus mode and let's

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:43.519 
it back to the autofocus mode and let's
see<00:01:37.869> how<00:01:38.200> fast<00:01:38.499> it<00:01:38.740> can<00:01:38.979> be<00:01:39.009> three<00:01:39.849> two<00:01:40.270> one<00:01:40.299> now

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:43.529 

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:47.429 

it<00:01:44.529> still<00:01:44.859> locked<00:01:45.099> the<00:01:45.279> focus<00:01:45.700> in<00:01:46.450> this<00:01:46.659> dim

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
it still locked the focus in this dim

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.120 
it still locked the focus in this dim
light<00:01:47.469> and<00:01:48.009> I<00:01:48.130> would<00:01:48.609> say<00:01:49.109> that<00:01:50.109> this<00:01:50.229> is<00:01:50.289> quite

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
light and I would say that this is quite

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.819 
light and I would say that this is quite
good<00:01:51.189> autofocus<00:01:52.029> performance<00:01:52.599> back<00:01:53.529> to<00:01:53.709> the

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
good autofocus performance back to the

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:55.649 
good autofocus performance back to the
most<00:01:54.039> challenging<00:01:54.639> situation<00:01:55.329> there<00:01:55.509> is<00:01:55.630> no

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
most challenging situation there is no

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.639 
most challenging situation there is no
light<00:01:56.079> in<00:01:56.109> the<00:01:56.409> room<00:01:56.529> almost<00:01:57.159> none<00:01:58.319> let's<00:01:59.319> see

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
light in the room almost none let's see

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.529 
light in the room almost none let's see
if<00:01:59.709> the<00:01:59.919> camera<00:02:00.279> can<00:02:00.520> acquire<00:02:00.849> the<00:02:01.060> focus<00:02:01.389> in

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
if the camera can acquire the focus in

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.260 
if the camera can acquire the focus in
such<00:02:01.749> a<00:02:01.779> dim<00:02:02.739> conditions<00:02:03.459> it's<00:02:03.700> actually<00:02:04.149> the

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
such a dim conditions it's actually the

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.839 
such a dim conditions it's actually the
same<00:02:04.479> conditions<00:02:05.020> as<00:02:05.200> they<00:02:05.409> were<00:02:05.469> with<00:02:05.950> 35

00:02:06.839 --> 00:02:06.849 
same conditions as they were with 35

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:08.370 
same conditions as they were with 35
millimeter<00:02:07.239> lenses<00:02:07.659> but<00:02:07.840> you<00:02:08.050> saw<00:02:08.349> that

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
millimeter lenses but you saw that

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.740 
millimeter lenses but you saw that
little<00:02:08.830> window<00:02:09.039> on<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.520> left<00:02:09.700> side<00:02:09.970> now<00:02:10.690> we

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
little window on the left side now we

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.500 
little window on the left side now we
can<00:02:11.260> see<00:02:11.500> it<00:02:11.560> in<00:02:11.740> the<00:02:11.860> framing<00:02:12.310> so<00:02:12.580> it's<00:02:12.820> see

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
can see it in the framing so it's see

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.760 
can see it in the framing so it's see
now<00:02:13.750> there<00:02:14.080> in<00:02:14.560> reality<00:02:14.860> what<00:02:15.310> you<00:02:15.340> see

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
now there in reality what you see

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.610 
now there in reality what you see
is<00:02:15.860> how<00:02:16.370> much<00:02:16.400> light<00:02:16.820> is<00:02:17.030> in<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.330> room<00:02:17.510> so<00:02:17.780> let

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
is how much light is in the room so let

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.150 
is how much light is in the room so let
me<00:02:18.770> try<00:02:19.010> to<00:02:19.040> defocus<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:19.790> camera<00:02:20.270> first

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
me try to defocus the camera first

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.580 
me try to defocus the camera first
well<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.370> lens<00:02:22.550> actually<00:02:23.420> all<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:24.200> way<00:02:24.230> down

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
well the lens actually all the way down

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.590 
well the lens actually all the way down
I<00:02:24.830> don't<00:02:25.010> think<00:02:25.400> if<00:02:25.550> you<00:02:25.700> see<00:02:25.940> anything<00:02:26.330> on<00:02:26.480> the

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
I don't think if you see anything on the

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.480 
I don't think if you see anything on the
screen<00:02:26.870> but<00:02:28.720> let's<00:02:29.720> try<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:30.770> switch<00:02:31.250> it<00:02:31.460> back

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
screen but let's try to switch it back

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.330 
screen but let's try to switch it back
to<00:02:31.820> the<00:02:31.940> autofocus<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:33.110> let's<00:02:33.770> try<00:02:34.100> now<00:02:34.310> to

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
to the autofocus and let's try now to

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:42.660 
to the autofocus and let's try now to
acquire<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.270> focus<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:39.470> camera<00:02:39.680> is<00:02:39.950> hunting

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.790 

it's<00:02:43.670> still<00:02:44.030> not<00:02:44.210> quite<00:02:44.450> there<00:02:44.780> I<00:02:45.080> would<00:02:45.500> say

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
it's still not quite there I would say

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.670 
it's still not quite there I would say
yeah<00:02:46.580> now<00:02:46.850> it's<00:02:47.090> stopped<00:02:47.540> but<00:02:47.840> I'm<00:02:48.320> not<00:02:48.440> sure

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
yeah now it's stopped but I'm not sure

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.760 
yeah now it's stopped but I'm not sure
that<00:02:48.920> this<00:02:49.070> is<00:02:49.250> a<00:02:49.280> critical<00:02:49.880> focus<00:02:50.060> anyway<00:02:50.770> in

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
that this is a critical focus anyway in

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.800 
that this is a critical focus anyway in
this<00:02:52.100> situation<00:02:52.790> with<00:02:52.940> 200<00:02:53.330> millimeter<00:02:53.780> zoom

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
this situation with 200 millimeter zoom

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.750 
this situation with 200 millimeter zoom
it's<00:02:54.290> not<00:02:54.500> surprising<00:02:54.710> that<00:02:55.160> the<00:02:55.370> camera<00:02:55.670> is

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
it's not surprising that the camera is

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.030 
it's not surprising that the camera is
not<00:02:55.910> able<00:02:56.180> to<00:02:56.330> focus<00:02:56.810> there<00:02:56.960> is<00:02:56.990> really<00:02:57.770> almost

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
not able to focus there is really almost

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.090 
not able to focus there is really almost
no<00:02:58.490> light<00:02:58.700> at<00:02:58.910> all
