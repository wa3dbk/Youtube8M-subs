00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.029 
really so as I said to you guys
yesterday<00:00:17.490> I<00:00:17.760> was<00:00:17.970> soaking<00:00:18.210> some<00:00:18.480> bogwood<00:00:19.039> and

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
yesterday I was soaking some bogwood and

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.950 
yesterday I was soaking some bogwood and
this<00:00:20.670> bog<00:00:20.850> wood<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.150> actually<00:00:21.449> already<00:00:21.570> soaked

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
this bog wood is actually already soaked

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.779 
this bog wood is actually already soaked
his<00:00:22.140> pre-soaked<00:00:22.650> bogwood<00:00:23.010> but<00:00:23.220> it's<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.670> good

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
his pre-soaked bogwood but it's a good

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.310 
his pre-soaked bogwood but it's a good
idea<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.060> soak<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:24.480> anyway<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:24.750> I'd<00:00:25.080> have<00:00:25.109> the

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
idea to soak it anyway so I'd have the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.839 
idea to soak it anyway so I'd have the
second<00:00:25.650> for<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.830> couple<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.220> couple<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.699> days

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
second for a couple of a couple of days

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.939 
second for a couple of a couple of days
usually<00:00:27.449> if<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:27.869> wasn't<00:00:28.199> so<00:00:28.439> she'd<00:00:28.710> want<00:00:28.890> to

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
usually if it wasn't so she'd want to

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.550 
usually if it wasn't so she'd want to
soak<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.250> for<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.400> lot<00:00:29.519> longer<00:00:29.699> than<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.560> so

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
soak it for a lot longer than that so

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.620 
soak it for a lot longer than that so
also<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.160> got<00:00:32.340> some<00:00:32.550> Jupiter<00:00:33.000> rock<00:00:33.210> which<00:00:33.450> is

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
also I got some Jupiter rock which is

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.389 
also I got some Jupiter rock which is
actually<00:00:33.809> exactly<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.559> same<00:00:34.770> as<00:00:34.980> what's<00:00:35.219> in

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
actually exactly the same as what's in

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.430 
actually exactly the same as what's in
my<00:00:35.489> cold<00:00:35.820> water<00:00:36.000> tank<00:00:36.270> there<00:00:36.480> which<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.350> air

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
my cold water tank there which the air

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.030 
my cold water tank there which the air
stone<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.890> under<00:00:39.170> if<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.260> quite<00:00:40.530> liked<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.010> I

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
stone is under if I quite liked it so I

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.889

which I've been groaning this tank from
the<00:01:59.250> start<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.640> cycle<00:02:00.149> that's<00:02:00.899> meaning

the start of the cycle that's meaning
that<00:02:01.290> from<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.590> start<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:02.670> was<00:02:03.060> hoping<00:02:03.240> this

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
that from the start I was hoping this

Bobby<00:02:03.659> would<00:02:03.930> kind<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.170> hide<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.560> heater<00:02:04.799> as

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
Bobby would kind of hide the heater as

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.160 
Bobby would kind of hide the heater as
it<00:02:05.189> goes<00:02:05.460> up<00:02:05.490> but<00:02:06.299> where<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.540> wanted<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.110> just

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
it goes up but where I wanted it just

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.110 
it goes up but where I wanted it just
kind<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.740> didn't<00:02:08.300> like<00:02:10.520> like<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.640> heater<00:02:11.849> and

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
kind of didn't like like the heater and

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.710 
kind of didn't like like the heater and
highly<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:12.599> what<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:12.780> might<00:02:12.959> end<00:02:13.020> up<00:02:13.200> doing

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
highly so what I might end up doing

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.600 
highly so what I might end up doing
moving<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.050> heater<00:02:14.230> over<00:02:14.590> a<00:02:14.650> little<00:02:14.800> bit<00:02:14.980> you

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
moving the heater over a little bit you

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.060 
moving the heater over a little bit you
know<00:02:15.640> it's<00:02:15.850> not<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.000> end<00:02:16.090> of<00:02:16.210> the<00:02:16.270> world<00:02:16.450> um

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
know it's not the end of the world um

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.590 
know it's not the end of the world um
yes<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:18.460> only<00:02:18.640> thing<00:02:18.760> is<00:02:18.880> is<00:02:19.030> that<00:02:19.180> I'm

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
yes the only thing is is that I'm

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.670 
yes the only thing is is that I'm
probably<00:02:19.720> going<00:02:19.960> to<00:02:20.050> end<00:02:20.080> up<00:02:20.200> getting<00:02:20.320> a<00:02:20.470> black

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
probably going to end up getting a black

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.230 
probably going to end up getting a black

the with my lighting here the light
obviously<00:03:06.730> is<00:03:06.790> shaded<00:03:07.180> by<00:03:07.300> that<00:03:07.480> bar<00:03:07.690> there

and doesn't get to the back of the tank
too<00:03:09.490> easily<00:03:09.640> and<00:03:10.000> with<00:03:10.900> this<00:03:10.990> bogwood<00:03:11.350> here

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
too easily and with this bogwood here

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.110 
too easily and with this bogwood here
kind<00:03:11.800> of<00:03:11.860> shades<00:03:12.130> that<00:03:12.310> retailer<00:03:12.700> back<00:03:12.880> there

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
that worries me a little bit it's just

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.750 
that worries me a little bit it's just
generally<00:03:22.989> this<00:03:23.140> Java<00:03:23.709> muscle<00:03:24.220> of<00:03:24.310> making<00:03:24.700> a

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
generally this Java muscle of making a

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.490 
generally this Java muscle of making a
mess<00:03:24.970> in<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.209> tank<00:03:25.420> and<00:03:25.600> taking<00:03:26.019> over<00:03:26.170> stuff

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
mess in the tank and taking over stuff

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.990 
mess in the tank and taking over stuff
but<00:03:27.160> I'm<00:03:27.220> sure<00:03:27.430> everything<00:03:27.700> will<00:03:27.730> be<00:03:27.820> all

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
but I'm sure everything will be all

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.130 
but I'm sure everything will be all
right<00:03:28.590> you<00:03:29.590> know<00:03:29.640> hoping<00:03:30.640> it<00:03:30.790> will<00:03:30.850> be<00:03:30.910> okay<00:03:31.209> so

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
right you know hoping it will be okay so

right you know hoping it will be okay so
I'm<00:03:33.010> gonna<00:03:33.700> try<00:03:34.590> turning<00:03:35.590> up<00:03:35.739> the<00:03:35.769> flow<00:03:36.100> rate

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
I'm gonna try turning up the flow rate

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.560 
I'm gonna try turning up the flow rate
on<00:03:36.400> this<00:03:36.519> filter<00:03:36.820> a<00:03:36.940> little<00:03:37.209> bit<00:03:37.330> today

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
on this filter a little bit today

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.690 
on this filter a little bit today
because<00:03:38.050> i<00:03:38.290> think<00:03:38.680> my<00:03:38.950> bait<00:03:39.100> is<00:03:39.250> fine<00:03:39.489> with<00:03:39.670> it

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
because i think my bait is fine with it

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.360 
because i think my bait is fine with it
I<00:03:40.090> don't<00:03:40.630> think<00:03:40.750> he's<00:03:41.170> bothered<00:03:41.980> about<00:03:42.040> it<00:03:42.310> at

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
I don't think he's bothered about it at

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.920 
I don't think he's bothered about it at
all<00:03:42.459> he<00:03:43.000> does<00:03:43.209> seem<00:03:43.360> to<00:03:43.450> be<00:03:43.540> at<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:43.720> front

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
all he does seem to be at the front

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.750 
all he does seem to be at the front
quite<00:03:44.260> a<00:03:44.290> lot<00:03:44.470> which<00:03:44.680> I<00:03:44.950> don't<00:03:45.310> know<00:03:45.489> if<00:03:45.580> that's

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
quite a lot which I don't know if that's

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.550 
quite a lot which I don't know if that's
because<00:03:45.880> the<00:03:46.269> flow<00:03:46.510> comes<00:03:46.840> from<00:03:47.110> the<00:03:47.230> back<00:03:47.380> to

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
because the flow comes from the back to

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.720 
because the flow comes from the back to
the<00:03:47.590> front<00:03:47.739> of<00:03:47.890> the<00:03:47.950> tank<00:03:48.160> and<00:03:48.340> he's<00:03:48.459> trying<00:03:48.670> to

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
Mike beta pellets but it's a good idea

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.230 
Mike beta pellets but it's a good idea
to<00:04:35.470> feed<00:04:35.650> your<00:04:35.770> beta<00:04:35.950> meaty<00:04:36.220> foods<00:04:36.580> really

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
brings out the color after immune system

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.240 
brings out the color after immune system
know<00:04:39.670> that<00:04:39.850> sort<00:04:40.060> of<00:04:40.090> thing<00:04:40.740> so<00:04:41.740> yeah<00:04:41.890> only

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
know that sort of thing so yeah only

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.110 
know that sort of thing so yeah only
thing<00:04:42.370> we're<00:04:42.460> gonna<00:04:42.580> have<00:04:42.700> to<00:04:42.790> keep<00:04:42.910> an<00:04:43.000> eye<00:04:43.090> on

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
thing we're gonna have to keep an eye on

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.520 
thing we're gonna have to keep an eye on
this<00:04:43.360> tank<00:04:43.540> in<00:04:43.690> the<00:04:43.750> next<00:04:43.930> couple<00:04:44.050> of<00:04:44.200> days<00:04:44.320> is

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
this tank in the next couple of days is

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.230 
this tank in the next couple of days is
pH<00:04:44.890> because<00:04:45.340> of<00:04:45.520> the<00:04:45.580> bog<00:04:45.730> would<00:04:45.940> have<00:04:46.060> just

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
pH because of the bog would have just

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.960 
pH because of the bog would have just
added<00:04:46.710> this<00:04:47.710> gravel<00:04:48.190> here<00:04:48.370> is<00:04:48.550> kind<00:04:48.820> of<00:04:48.880> an

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
added this gravel here is kind of an

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.180 
added this gravel here is kind of an
alkaline<00:04:49.360> buffer<00:04:49.570> so<00:04:50.170> I'm<00:04:50.620> pretty<00:04:50.830> sure<00:04:51.070> we

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
alkaline buffer so I'm pretty sure we

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.190

this<00:04:53.350> bog<00:04:53.560> word<00:04:53.740> because<00:04:54.670> there<00:04:54.790> is<00:04:54.880> quite<00:04:55.030> a

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
this bog word because there is quite a
