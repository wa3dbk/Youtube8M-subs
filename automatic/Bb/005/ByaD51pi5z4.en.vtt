 Cubetti arrives in Rome in 1946 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.539
 I wanted to ask you what the character is or 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.720
 which are the characters among the hundreds 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:22.470
 who drew what he loves most zargar 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.900
 that a masked thief like diabolik 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.730

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:41.030
 dozens of stories 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:06.210
 this character that I make since 56 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.440
 usually when drawing history 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.810
 let's say I make a squaring of 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:17.220
 this kind with maybe in the first one 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.660
 bet the title lines for the 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.580
 perspective if it is a page 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:25.770
 big loses particular and attacking 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.270
 the story I usually never get to 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.009
 know what's in the end then for 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.810
 don't stand there with the nib in your mouth 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.710
 think etc. 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:43.920
 I fill the cartoons in particular 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:45.869
 point salami bone worms for le 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.550
 I was asked for panoramic views 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:52.860
 are colored diets for a matter 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:55.110
 I usually print the page with 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.990
 the usual lines of perspective and 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.450
 begins to draw from below and go 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.150
 forward things are created for me the only one 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.009
 what we say techniques that an overview 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.390
 season and the prospect of English health 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.390
 crazy things stuffed inside 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.940
 jacovitti and as my twin we were born 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.200
 the same day the same month it 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.840
 same year 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.819
 we came up together or separately 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.040
 I as the reader of his first 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.980
 comics on the title oso jacovitti ha 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.230
 revisited the whole adventure with his 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.010
 with his round boys with legs 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.100
 court 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.030
 then in the post-war period the acolytes without 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:43.160
 change his sign he faced the 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.260
 different content has also done a little 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.700
 of political propaganda 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:52.220
 then he created the Italian western 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.250
 on the contrary , he came before him with the 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.950
 Coconut bill character who always drank 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.420
 at the end or in the moments most in moments 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.470
 culminating of his one adventures 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:06.350
 chamomile and this character is that 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.209
 which is more reminiscent of jacovitti 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.790
 which however also made comics by 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.250
 science fiction particular star wars 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.410
 has invented monsters has anticipated a little 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.080
 that's all about Italian comics 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.739
 comic and adventurous i 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.140
 characters can be divided into two 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:28.519
 categories those who call themselves want e 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.650
 bad though the bad ones though if they do 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.030
 of the bad deeds the nations that do 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:38.480
 are those to do for example a 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:41.380
 thin slices a person is not that they bring 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.380
 out of blood 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.900
 the victim 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.280
 in racing I do usually 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.820
 he begins to draw maybe I don't know what 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.340
 what the character does what they have to say 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.460
 etcetera what is born to me directly 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:12.330
 let's say about thinking about making a guy 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.560
 who has his hands up if he was there 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:22.500
 person with his hands up as possible 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:24.630
 a very trivial thing was coming 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.400
 my signature with the fish bone that it was 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.190
 the nickname I had as a boyfriend has it 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.170
 because I was skinny my teammates I 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.090
 they called the herringbone I then from 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.530
 40 years now I've always put 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.530
 herringbone as a stop
