00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.840 

let's<00:00:15.870> draw<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.109> 60-degree<00:00:16.859> angle<00:00:16.890> so<00:00:17.760> the

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
let's draw a 60-degree angle so the

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.849 
let's draw a 60-degree angle so the
first<00:00:18.090> thing<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.330> need<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.510> remember<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.380> that

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
first thing I need to remember is that

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.830 
first thing I need to remember is that
angles<00:00:20.279> are<00:00:20.369> pieces<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:20.730> circle<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.630> first

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
angles are pieces of circle so the first

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.970 
angles are pieces of circle so the first
thing<00:00:22.020> I'm<00:00:22.109> going<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.260> do<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.500> going<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.769> put

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
thing I'm going to do is going to put

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.740 
thing I'm going to do is going to put
the<00:00:23.100> center<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.609> circle<00:00:23.850> on<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.119> page<00:00:24.449> I'm

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
the center of the circle on the page I'm

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.810 
the center of the circle on the page I'm
now<00:00:25.410> going<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.619> put<00:00:25.710> my<00:00:25.920> protractor<00:00:26.369> on<00:00:26.699> the

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
now going to put my protractor on the

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.779 
now going to put my protractor on the
center<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.810> circle<00:00:28.160> so<00:00:29.160> it's<00:00:29.279> on<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.550> dot

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
center of that circle so it's on the dot

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.240 
center of that circle so it's on the dot
now<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.689> have<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.960> decision<00:00:31.140> do<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.650> use<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.009> left

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
now I have a decision do I use the left

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.040 
now I have a decision do I use the left
0<00:00:32.610> or<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.969> right-handed<00:00:33.570> zero<00:00:33.840> on<00:00:33.960> the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
0 or the right-handed zero on the

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.360 
0 or the right-handed zero on the
protractor<00:00:34.649> I'm<00:00:34.920> going<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.130> use<00:00:35.219> the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
protractor I'm going to use the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.740 
protractor I'm going to use the
left-hand<00:00:35.700> zero<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.270> I'm<00:00:36.360> going<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.540> put<00:00:36.719> a

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
left-hand zero so I'm going to put a

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.630 
left-hand zero so I'm going to put a
mark<00:00:37.020> on<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.290> left<00:00:37.500> side<00:00:37.680> then<00:00:38.370> I'm<00:00:38.489> going<00:00:38.610> to

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.609 
counts from 0 to 180 going
counterclockwise<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.170> go<00:01:37.320> through<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
counterclockwise so I go through the

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.770 
counterclockwise so I go through the
same<00:01:37.829> steps<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.369> need<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> dot<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.329> put<00:01:39.659> my

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
same steps I need a dot I put my

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.830 
same steps I need a dot I put my
protractor<00:01:40.140> on<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.650> dot<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:41.130> Markov<00:01:42.030> 0<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.720> I

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
protractor on that dot I Markov 0 and I

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.240 
protractor on that dot I Markov 0 and I
mark<00:01:43.049> off<00:01:43.229> 60<00:01:43.649> degrees<00:01:44.450> okay<00:01:45.450> again<00:01:46.320> remember

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
mark off 60 degrees okay again remember

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.280 
mark off 60 degrees okay again remember
I'm<00:01:47.790> using<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.420> zero<00:01:48.720> on<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.930> right<00:01:49.079> hand

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
I'm using the zero on the right hand

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.920 
I'm using the zero on the right hand
side<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:49.829> I'm<00:01:49.920> going<00:01:49.979> counterclockwise<00:01:50.930> first

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
side so I'm going counterclockwise first

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.840 
side so I'm going counterclockwise first
time<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.200> did<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.770> use<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.159> zero<00:01:53.369> on<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.640> left

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
time I did it I use the zero on the left

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.749 
time I did it I use the zero on the left
hand<00:01:54.060> side<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:55.110> went<00:01:55.380> clockwise<00:01:58.610> I'm<00:01:59.610> going

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
hand side and I went clockwise I'm going

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.100 
hand side and I went clockwise I'm going
to<00:01:59.820> move<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.090> protractor<00:02:00.659> out<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:00.990> way

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
to move the protractor out of the way

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.370 
to move the protractor out of the way
now<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.619> I'm<00:02:02.130> going<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.310> connect<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.659> points

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
now and I'm going to connect the points

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.590 
now and I'm going to connect the points
I<00:02:04.500> put<00:02:04.710> at<00:02:04.829> 0<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.460> 60<00:02:05.909> degrees<00:02:06.240> with<00:02:06.479> the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
I put at 0 and 60 degrees with the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.559 
I put at 0 and 60 degrees with the
center<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.020> circle<00:02:07.940> again<00:02:08.940> I'm<00:02:09.330> going<00:02:09.509> to

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
center of the circle again I'm going to

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.949 
center of the circle again I'm going to
label<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:10.080> put<00:02:10.619> my<00:02:10.739> arrowheads<00:02:11.220> on<00:02:11.900> label<00:02:12.900> the

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
label it put my arrowheads on label the

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.809 
label it put my arrowheads on label the
piece<00:02:13.140> of<00:02:13.319> circle<00:02:13.680> is<00:02:13.800> 60<00:02:14.129> degrees<00:02:14.489> I'm

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
piece of circle is 60 degrees I'm

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.440 
piece of circle is 60 degrees I'm
putting<00:02:15.239> letters<00:02:15.450> on<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.840> endpoints<00:02:16.440> I<00:02:17.450> can

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
putting letters on the endpoints I can

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.240 
putting letters on the endpoints I can
use<00:02:18.569> whatever<00:02:18.870> letters<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.349> want<00:02:19.620> in<00:02:19.890> this<00:02:20.040> case

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
use whatever letters I want in this case

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.330 
use whatever letters I want in this case
I<00:02:20.400> just<00:02:20.430> chose<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.270> B<00:02:21.569> and<00:02:21.720> C<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:22.739> this<00:02:22.890> is<00:02:23.069> angle

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
I just chose a B and C so this is angle

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.070 
I just chose a B and C so this is angle
ABC<00:02:23.640> or<00:02:24.090> angle<00:02:24.360> CBA<00:02:24.860> again<00:02:25.860> recall<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:27.270> B<00:02:27.780> has

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
ABC or angle CBA again recall that B has

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.710 
ABC or angle CBA again recall that B has
to<00:02:28.290> be<00:02:28.319> in<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.680> center<00:02:29.129> because<00:02:29.730> B<00:02:30.209> would<00:02:30.540> be

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
to be in the center because B would be

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:38.740 
to be in the center because B would be
the<00:02:30.930> center<00:02:31.319> of<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.590> circle

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.450 

let's<00:02:39.750> try<00:02:39.990> and<00:02:40.140> measure<00:02:40.290> some<00:02:40.620> pre-existing

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
let's try and measure some pre-existing

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.160 
let's try and measure some pre-existing
angles<00:02:41.820> now<00:02:44.150> so<00:02:45.150> I'm<00:02:45.240> going<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.390> draw<00:02:45.660> an<00:02:45.810> angle

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
angles now so I'm going to draw an angle

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.490 
angles now so I'm going to draw an angle
here<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:48.320> where<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.620> vertex<00:02:50.130> is<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:51.500> where

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
here and where the vertex is that where

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.170 
here and where the vertex is that where
the<00:02:52.620> centre<00:02:52.860> of<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.040> circle<00:02:53.220> is<00:02:53.520> so<00:02:53.850> in<00:02:53.970> this

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
the centre of the circle is so in this

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.630 
the centre of the circle is so in this
case<00:02:54.450> point<00:02:54.900> I<00:02:55.140> is<00:02:55.710> the<00:02:56.010> center<00:02:56.280> of<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.400> circle

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
case point I is the center of the circle

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.420 
case point I is the center of the circle
I'm<00:02:57.390> going<00:02:57.570> to<00:02:57.630> my<00:02:58.020> protractor<00:02:58.530> on<00:02:58.800> point<00:02:59.280> I

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
I'm going to my protractor on point I

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.610 
I'm going to my protractor on point I
but<00:03:00.060> now<00:03:00.210> I<00:03:00.240> need<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:00.720> line<00:03:00.960> up<00:03:00.990> one<00:03:01.380> of<00:03:01.500> the

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
but now I need to line up one of the

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.610 
but now I need to line up one of the
zeros<00:03:01.860> that<00:03:02.310> I<00:03:02.340> have<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:03.270> if<00:03:03.990> you<00:03:04.110> look<00:03:04.350> at<00:03:04.500> it

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
zeros that I have and if you look at it

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.070 
zeros that I have and if you look at it
my<00:03:04.710> zeros<00:03:05.040> not<00:03:05.340> quite<00:03:05.700> lined<00:03:06.030> up<00:03:06.330> so<00:03:06.840> I'm<00:03:06.930> going

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
my zeros not quite lined up so I'm going

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.340 
my zeros not quite lined up so I'm going
to<00:03:07.110> move<00:03:07.320> my<00:03:07.380> protractor<00:03:07.980> ever<00:03:08.490> so<00:03:08.820> slightly

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
to move my protractor ever so slightly

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.910 
to move my protractor ever so slightly
so<00:03:10.350> that<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.560> zero<00:03:11.040> is<00:03:11.310> on<00:03:12.110> now<00:03:13.110> because<00:03:13.770> I'm

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
so that the zero is on now because I'm

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.040 
so that the zero is on now because I'm
using<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.340> zero<00:03:14.580> on<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.820> right<00:03:15.030> hand<00:03:15.330> side<00:03:15.480> I

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
using the zero on the right hand side I

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.430 
using the zero on the right hand side I
have<00:03:16.320> to<00:03:16.860> count<00:03:17.160> from<00:03:17.580> that<00:03:17.820> zero<00:03:18.210> around<00:03:19.080> the

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
have to count from that zero around the

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.390 
have to count from that zero around the
protractor<00:03:20.360> counterclockwise<00:03:22.220> when<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:23.280> do

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
protractor counterclockwise when I do

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.750 
protractor counterclockwise when I do
this<00:03:23.880> I<00:03:24.180> end<00:03:24.780> up<00:03:24.930> finding<00:03:25.230> out<00:03:25.470> that<00:03:25.680> angle<00:03:26.040> PIR

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
this I end up finding out that angle PIR

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.160 
this I end up finding out that angle PIR
or<00:03:27.050> angle<00:03:28.050> are<00:03:28.290> IP<00:03:29.480> happens<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.630> be<00:03:30.720> worth<00:03:32.030> 125

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
or angle are IP happens to be worth 125

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.200 
or angle are IP happens to be worth 125
decimal<00:03:34.170> five<00:03:34.410> degrees<00:03:34.950> it's<00:03:35.550> kind<00:03:35.820> of<00:03:35.910> in<00:03:36.060> the

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
decimal five degrees it's kind of in the

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.020 
decimal five degrees it's kind of in the

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
middle between some degree marks look I

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.970 
middle between some degree marks look I
can<00:03:39.330> use<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.630> other<00:03:39.660> zero<00:03:40.140> on<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.410> protractor

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
can use the other zero on the protractor

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.100 
can use the other zero on the protractor
and<00:03:41.070> get<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.250> exact<00:03:41.580> same<00:03:41.820> answer<00:03:42.270> but<00:03:42.810> I<00:03:42.870> have

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
and get the exact same answer but I have

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.470 
and get the exact same answer but I have
to<00:03:43.260> rotate<00:03:43.530> my<00:03:43.920> protractor<00:03:44.340> so<00:03:44.790> that<00:03:45.000> zero<00:03:45.360> is

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
to rotate my protractor so that zero is

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.750 
to rotate my protractor so that zero is
at<00:03:45.630> least<00:03:45.840> on<00:03:46.110> one<00:03:46.320> part<00:03:46.590> of<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.770> angle<00:03:47.100> this

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
at least on one part of the angle this

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.300 
at least on one part of the angle this
time<00:03:47.820> I'm<00:03:48.210> reading<00:03:48.570> it<00:03:48.690> clockwise<00:03:49.050> and<00:03:49.650> when<00:03:50.280> I

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
time I'm reading it clockwise and when I

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.040 
time I'm reading it clockwise and when I
do<00:03:50.430> that<00:03:50.850> I<00:03:51.090> have<00:03:51.360> to<00:03:51.510> make<00:03:51.660> a<00:03:51.690> slight

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
do that I have to make a slight

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.710 
do that I have to make a slight
adjustment<00:03:52.200> here<00:03:53.040> to<00:03:53.760> make<00:03:53.940> sure<00:03:53.970> my<00:03:54.300> zero<00:03:54.600> is

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
adjustment here to make sure my zero is

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.380 
adjustment here to make sure my zero is
lined<00:03:55.020> up<00:03:55.230> and<00:03:56.100> when<00:03:56.220> I<00:03:56.250> do<00:03:56.340> that<00:03:56.490> same<00:03:56.910> thing<00:03:56.940> I

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
lined up and when I do that same thing I

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.410 
lined up and when I do that same thing I
end<00:03:57.630> up<00:03:57.750> with<00:03:57.870> 125<00:03:58.830> decimal<00:03:59.490> five<00:03:59.730> either<00:04:00.090> way

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
end up with 125 decimal five either way

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.930 
end up with 125 decimal five either way
you<00:04:01.410> can<00:04:01.560> use<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.830> scale<00:04:02.100> on<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.400> inside<00:04:02.760> or

you can use the scale on the inside or
the<00:04:02.970> outside<00:04:03.060> but<00:04:04.020> you<00:04:04.140> have<00:04:04.350> to<00:04:04.530> zero<00:04:04.770> your

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
the outside but you have to zero your

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.300 
the outside but you have to zero your

now try and draw these pause the video
after<00:04:12.840> and<00:04:13.380> you<00:04:14.280> can<00:04:14.430> restart<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.180> video<00:04:15.300> to

after and you can restart the video to
see<00:04:15.900> what<00:04:16.020> the<00:04:16.170> answers<00:04:16.530> are<00:04:16.560> like

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.530 

now<00:04:21.430> you<00:04:21.489> need<00:04:21.670> to<00:04:21.730> understand<00:04:22.210> that<00:04:22.300> these

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
now you need to understand that these

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.000 
now you need to understand that these
answers<00:04:23.050> that<00:04:23.230> you're<00:04:23.320> going<00:04:23.500> to<00:04:23.530> see<00:04:23.740> here

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
answers that you're going to see here

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.400 
answers that you're going to see here
were<00:04:24.160> not<00:04:24.370> measured<00:04:24.820> with<00:04:24.970> a<00:04:25.000> protractor<00:04:25.810> so

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
were not measured with a protractor so

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.050 
were not measured with a protractor so
all<00:04:26.710> you're<00:04:26.890> doing<00:04:27.220> is<00:04:27.340> you're<00:04:27.520> looking<00:04:27.550> to

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
all you're doing is you're looking to

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.780 
all you're doing is you're looking to
see<00:04:28.300> if<00:04:28.540> your<00:04:29.050> answers<00:04:29.650> look<00:04:30.190> similar<00:04:30.580> to

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
see if your answers look similar to

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.330 
see if your answers look similar to
these<00:04:31.150> if<00:04:31.840> your<00:04:32.110> answers<00:04:32.440> don't<00:04:32.680> look<00:04:32.950> similar

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
these if your answers don't look similar

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.640 
these if your answers don't look similar
to<00:04:33.490> these<00:04:33.640> you<00:04:34.000> are<00:04:34.120> probably<00:04:34.810> reading<00:04:35.170> from

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
to these you are probably reading from

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.990 
to these you are probably reading from
the<00:04:35.830> wrong<00:04:35.860> zero<00:04:37.170> now<00:04:38.170> yours<00:04:39.130> could<00:04:39.790> either

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
the wrong zero now yours could either

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.480 
the wrong zero now yours could either
look<00:04:40.390> like<00:04:41.230> the<00:04:41.410> first<00:04:41.620> example<00:04:41.860> or<00:04:42.370> the

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
look like the first example or the

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.520 
look like the first example or the
second<00:04:42.880> example<00:04:43.240> depending<00:04:43.690> on<00:04:43.930> which<00:04:44.140> zero

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
second example depending on which zero

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.300 
second example depending on which zero
you<00:04:44.650> use<00:04:45.040> to<00:04:45.250> draw<00:04:45.690> so<00:04:47.010> 75°<00:04:48.010> looks

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
you use to draw so 75° looks

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.950 
you use to draw so 75° looks
approximately<00:04:48.730> like<00:04:49.300> this<00:04:51.180> 170<00:04:52.180> degrees<00:04:52.570> it's

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
approximately like this 170 degrees it's

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.030 
approximately like this 170 degrees it's
very<00:04:53.320> close<00:04:53.710> to<00:04:53.919> being<00:04:54.100> the<00:04:54.340> full<00:04:54.550> protractor

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
very close to being the full protractor

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.300 
very close to being the full protractor
so<00:04:57.040> your<00:04:57.160> answer<00:04:57.460> should<00:04:57.640> look<00:04:57.850> like<00:04:57.880> this

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
so your answer should look like this

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.090 
so your answer should look like this
if<00:05:00.310> you<00:05:01.180> were<00:05:01.300> reading<00:05:01.540> from<00:05:01.870> the<00:05:01.990> zero<00:05:02.290> on<00:05:02.590> the

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
if you were reading from the zero on the

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.340 
if you were reading from the zero on the
right<00:05:03.340> hand<00:05:03.640> side<00:05:03.790> though<00:05:04.270> your<00:05:04.720> answer<00:05:05.140> will

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
right hand side though your answer will

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.230 
right hand side though your answer will
look<00:05:05.530> more<00:05:05.770> like<00:05:05.830> this<00:05:06.040> so<00:05:08.520> let's<00:05:09.520> draw<00:05:09.790> what

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
look more like this so let's draw what

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.640 
look more like this so let's draw what
it<00:05:10.330> looks<00:05:10.510> like<00:05:10.690> if<00:05:10.840> you're<00:05:11.020> using<00:05:11.050> the<00:05:11.440> right

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
it looks like if you're using the right

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.720 
it looks like if you're using the right
zero<00:05:12.960> in<00:05:13.960> that<00:05:14.050> case<00:05:14.200> your<00:05:14.950> answer<00:05:15.220> would<00:05:15.550> look

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
zero in that case your answer would look

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:23.820 
zero in that case your answer would look
like<00:05:16.120> this<00:05:21.390> all<00:05:22.390> right<00:05:22.630> so<00:05:23.260> let's<00:05:23.440> take<00:05:23.620> a<00:05:23.650> look

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
like this all right so let's take a look

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.219 
like this all right so let's take a look
at<00:05:23.919> 20<00:05:24.280> degrees<00:05:24.580> 20<00:05:25.120> degrees<00:05:25.150> is<00:05:25.600> a<00:05:25.630> really

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
at 20 degrees 20 degrees is a really

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.370 
at 20 degrees 20 degrees is a really
small<00:05:26.680> angle<00:05:27.520> so<00:05:28.360> it's<00:05:28.479> going<00:05:28.660> to<00:05:28.720> be<00:05:28.870> very

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
small angle so it's going to be very

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.440 
small angle so it's going to be very
close<00:05:30.190> to<00:05:30.490> each<00:05:30.520> other<00:05:30.880> it's<00:05:31.150> going<00:05:31.270> to<00:05:31.330> be<00:05:31.419> a

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
close to each other it's going to be a

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
close to each other it's going to be a
small<00:05:31.810> piece<00:05:32.020> of<00:05:32.080> circle<00:05:33.510> okay<00:05:34.510> so<00:05:35.080> can<00:05:35.320> either

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
small piece of circle okay so can either

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.370 
small piece of circle okay so can either
look<00:05:36.070> like<00:05:36.310> this<00:05:36.580> one<00:05:36.820> if<00:05:37.030> you<00:05:38.020> were<00:05:38.140> reading

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
look like this one if you were reading

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.469 
look like this one if you were reading
from<00:05:38.620> the<00:05:38.770> right<00:05:38.950> hand<00:05:39.160> side<00:05:39.430> or<00:05:39.700> if<00:05:40.210> you<00:05:40.330> were

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
from the right hand side or if you were

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:43.800 
from the right hand side or if you were
using<00:05:40.750> the<00:05:41.050> left<00:05:41.290> hand<00:05:41.410> 0<00:05:42.060> then<00:05:43.060> it<00:05:43.479> would<00:05:43.660> look

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
using the left hand 0 then it would look

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.640 
using the left hand 0 then it would look
more<00:05:44.020> like<00:05:44.080> the<00:05:44.350> second<00:05:44.770> example<00:05:46.650> don't

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
more like the second example don't

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.260 
more like the second example don't
forget<00:05:47.950> you<00:05:48.130> can<00:05:48.310> use<00:05:48.340> whatever<00:05:48.760> letters<00:05:49.120> you

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
forget you can use whatever letters you

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.000 
forget you can use whatever letters you
want<00:05:49.510> you<00:05:50.140> don't<00:05:50.229> have<00:05:50.350> to<00:05:50.530> use<00:05:50.650> the<00:05:50.800> same

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
want you don't have to use the same

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.940 
want you don't have to use the same
letters<00:05:51.340> that<00:05:51.490> I'm<00:05:51.610> using<00:05:51.820> here<00:05:52.590> 100<00:05:53.590> degrees

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
letters that I'm using here 100 degrees

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.520 
letters that I'm using here 100 degrees
a<00:05:53.979> little<00:05:54.430> bit<00:05:54.550> more<00:05:54.790> than<00:05:55.000> 90<00:05:55.540> so<00:05:56.290> if<00:05:56.380> you're

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
a little bit more than 90 so if you're

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.409 
a little bit more than 90 so if you're
reading<00:05:56.770> from<00:05:56.890> the<00:05:57.070> left<00:05:57.280> hand<00:05:57.520> 0<00:05:57.880> and<00:05:58.270> you're

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
reading from the left hand 0 and you're

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:00.060 
reading from the left hand 0 and you're
going<00:05:58.810> clockwise<00:05:59.110> it's<00:05:59.710> going<00:05:59.860> to<00:05:59.919> look<00:06:00.010> like

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
going clockwise it's going to look like

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.909 
going clockwise it's going to look like
this<00:06:00.900> second<00:06:01.900> example<00:06:02.229> I've<00:06:02.440> drawn<00:06:02.650> is<00:06:02.830> if

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919 
this second example I've drawn is if

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:04.560 
this second example I've drawn is if
you're<00:06:03.100> using<00:06:03.130> the<00:06:03.520> right<00:06:03.700> hand<00:06:03.760> 0<00:06:04.300> and<00:06:04.479> you're

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570 
you're using the right hand 0 and you're

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.960 
you're using the right hand 0 and you're
going<00:06:04.810> counterclockwise<00:06:05.580> either<00:06:06.580> one<00:06:06.850> is

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:06.970 
going counterclockwise either one is

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.550 
going counterclockwise either one is
correct<00:06:07.300> it<00:06:07.479> doesn't<00:06:07.660> matter<00:06:07.930> which<00:06:08.140> 0<00:06:08.470> you

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
correct it doesn't matter which 0 you

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.440 
correct it doesn't matter which 0 you
use

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.450 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.850 

again<00:06:13.450> you<00:06:13.780> can<00:06:13.930> use<00:06:14.050> whatever<00:06:14.200> letters<00:06:14.740> you

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
again you can use whatever letters you
