just<00:00:19.210> a<00:00:19.240> little<00:00:19.420> back<00:00:19.539> story<00:00:19.690> about<00:00:20.140> backlight

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.770 
just a little back story about backlight

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.999 
just a little back story about backlight
the<00:00:21.039> traditional<00:00:22.000> LED<00:00:22.330> monitor<00:00:22.980> uses<00:00:23.980> a

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:24.009 
the traditional LED monitor uses a

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:25.919 
the traditional LED monitor uses a
backlight<00:00:24.460> that's<00:00:24.699> always<00:00:25.000> on<00:00:25.420> for<00:00:25.810> each

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:25.929 
backlight that's always on for each

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:28.410 
backlight that's always on for each
pixel<00:00:26.259> so<00:00:26.890> even<00:00:27.160> when<00:00:27.250> a<00:00:27.279> pixels<00:00:27.670> displaying<00:00:28.179> a

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
pixel so even when a pixels displaying a

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.060 
pixel so even when a pixels displaying a
black<00:00:28.810> you<00:00:29.380> know<00:00:29.470> supposed<00:00:29.740> to<00:00:29.800> be<00:00:29.859> displaying

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
black you know supposed to be displaying

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.620 
black you know supposed to be displaying
black<00:00:30.339> it's<00:00:30.609> still<00:00:30.820> emitting<00:00:31.089> a<00:00:31.240> small<00:00:31.480> amount

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
black it's still emitting a small amount

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.400 
black it's still emitting a small amount
of<00:00:31.750> light<00:00:31.960> the<00:00:32.650> LED<00:00:33.490> technology<00:00:34.140> allows<00:00:35.140> each

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
of light the LED technology allows each

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.590 
of light the LED technology allows each
pixels<00:00:35.890> backlight<00:00:36.490> to<00:00:36.610> be<00:00:36.730> set<00:00:36.910> individually

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
pixels backlight to be set individually

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.110 
pixels backlight to be set individually
so<00:00:38.020> what<00:00:38.830> that<00:00:38.980> means<00:00:39.160> is<00:00:39.340> that<00:00:39.370> when<00:00:39.640> a<00:00:39.670> pixel

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
so what that means is that when a pixel

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.030 
so what that means is that when a pixel
is<00:00:40.360> supposed<00:00:40.660> to<00:00:40.780> be<00:00:40.870> black<00:00:41.050> the<00:00:41.410> image<00:00:41.830> that

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
is supposed to be black the image that

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.430 
is supposed to be black the image that
or<00:00:42.400> the<00:00:42.580> the<00:00:42.970> pixel<00:00:43.780> is<00:00:43.870> not<00:00:43.960> emitting<00:00:44.320> any

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
or the the pixel is not emitting any

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.800 
or the the pixel is not emitting any
light<00:00:44.710> and<00:00:44.980> the<00:00:45.610> image<00:00:45.850> is<00:00:45.970> actually<00:00:46.120> black<00:00:46.510> I

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:46.810 
light and the image is actually black I

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:47.880 
light and the image is actually black I
don't<00:00:47.050> know<00:00:47.230> if<00:00:47.290> you'll<00:00:47.380> be<00:00:47.440> able<00:00:47.500> to<00:00:47.650> see<00:00:47.800> it

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
don't know if you'll be able to see it

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.790 
don't know if you'll be able to see it
very<00:00:47.920> well<00:00:48.220> but<00:00:48.400> if<00:00:48.520> I<00:00:48.640> if<00:00:48.880> I<00:00:48.940> turn<00:00:49.180> it<00:00:49.270> on

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
very well but if I if I turn it on

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.960 
very well but if I if I turn it on
you'll<00:00:50.800> see<00:00:50.830> the<00:00:51.040> main<00:00:51.340> screen<00:00:51.400> come<00:00:51.700> up<00:00:51.820> and

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
you'll see the main screen come up and

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.580 
you'll see the main screen come up and
you'll<00:00:52.060> see<00:00:52.090> this<00:00:52.360> black<00:00:52.660> versus<00:00:53.140> white<00:00:53.170> here

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
you'll see this black versus white here

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.580 
you'll see this black versus white here
so<00:00:54.190> the<00:00:54.850> that<00:00:55.330> part<00:00:55.660> that<00:00:55.690> was<00:00:55.810> black<00:00:56.050> is<00:00:56.290> you

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
so the that part that was black is you

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.070 
so the that part that was black is you
can<00:00:56.710> tell<00:00:56.830> is<00:00:56.920> not<00:00:57.160> just<00:00:57.670> not<00:00:57.790> glowing<00:00:58.270> at<00:00:58.390> all

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.080 
can tell is not just not glowing at all

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.390 
can tell is not just not glowing at all
there's<00:00:59.470> no<00:00:59.620> none<00:00:59.860> of<00:00:59.890> that<00:00:59.980> traditional

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
there's no none of that traditional

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.830 
there's no none of that traditional
backlight<00:01:00.880> that<00:01:01.030> you<00:01:01.090> used<00:01:01.300> to<00:01:01.420> seeing<00:01:01.630> with<00:01:01.780> a

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
backlight that you used to seeing with a

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.560 
backlight that you used to seeing with a
monitor<00:01:02.320> so<00:01:02.800> what<00:01:03.010> that<00:01:03.070> means<00:01:03.340> is<00:01:03.700> great

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
monitor so what that means is great

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.260 
monitor so what that means is great
color<00:01:04.809> fidelity<00:01:05.130> and<00:01:06.130> just<00:01:06.400> sharp<00:01:06.820> crisp

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
color fidelity and just sharp crisp

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.020 
color fidelity and just sharp crisp

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
the box there's a touch screen interface

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.540 
the box there's a touch screen interface
where<00:01:13.750> in<00:01:14.170> these<00:01:14.350> scroll<00:01:14.680> wheels<00:01:14.920> is<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:15.370> main

where in these scroll wheels is the main

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.920 
where in these scroll wheels is the main
way<00:01:15.700> that<00:01:15.880> this<00:01:15.970> works<00:01:16.240> so<00:01:16.390> you<00:01:16.510> go<00:01:16.750> into<00:01:16.840> the

these however you would like and if you

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.610 
these however you would like and if you
let's<00:01:22.300> say<00:01:22.360> you<00:01:22.480> want<00:01:22.659> to<00:01:22.750> turn<00:01:22.960> your

let's say you want to turn your

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.950 
let's say you want to turn your
vectorscope<00:01:24.130> on<00:01:24.550> or<00:01:25.300> you<00:01:25.420> turn<00:01:25.570> your<00:01:25.720> waveform

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
vectorscope on or you turn your waveform

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.430 
vectorscope on or you turn your waveform
on<00:01:26.530> or<00:01:26.920> off<00:01:27.510> and<00:01:28.510> you<00:01:28.600> can<00:01:28.780> do<00:01:28.930> all<00:01:29.080> this<00:01:29.200> stuff

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
on or off and you can do all this stuff

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.140 
on or off and you can do all this stuff
through<00:01:29.590> there<00:01:29.800> you<00:01:30.580> have<00:01:30.700> your<00:01:30.730> choice<00:01:31.030> of

through there you have your choice of
different<00:01:31.300> batteries<00:01:31.840> we<00:01:32.110> went<00:01:32.320> with<00:01:32.380> the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
different batteries we went with the

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.440 
different batteries we went with the
canons<00:01:32.890> because<00:01:33.159> they're<00:01:33.310> small<00:01:33.640> and<00:01:33.670> that<00:01:34.330> is

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
canons because they're small and that is

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.550 
canons because they're small and that is
something<00:01:34.600> that's<00:01:34.810> really<00:01:34.900> nice<00:01:35.110> about<00:01:35.320> this

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
something that's really nice about this

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.050 
something that's really nice about this
monitor<00:01:35.800> is<00:01:36.070> it's<00:01:36.250> great<00:01:36.580> for<00:01:36.790> hand-holding

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
monitor is it's great for hand-holding

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.020 
monitor is it's great for hand-holding
and<00:01:37.570> then<00:01:38.080> the<00:01:38.290> pro<00:01:38.530> versions<00:01:39.010> have<00:01:39.250> an<00:01:39.490> export

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
and then the pro versions have an export

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.330 
and then the pro versions have an export
accessory<00:01:40.600> on<00:01:40.750> the<00:01:40.870> an<00:01:41.380> export<00:01:41.979> for
