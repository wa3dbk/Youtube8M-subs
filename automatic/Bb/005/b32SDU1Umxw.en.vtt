look<00:00:46.790> at<00:00:46.910> the<00:00:47.030> deal<00:00:49.240> something<00:00:50.240> trick<00:00:50.450> we've

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
look at the deal something trick we've

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.690 
look at the deal something trick we've
done<00:00:50.810> for<00:00:50.840> the<00:00:51.050> customer<00:00:51.530> as<00:00:51.740> a<00:00:51.770> customer's

business<00:00:53.240> was<00:00:53.450> called<00:00:54.020> undercover<00:00:54.620> so<00:00:55.070> we

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
business was called undercover so we

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.040 
business was called undercover so we
made<00:00:55.340> a<00:00:55.370> custom<00:00:55.640> set<00:00:56.000> of<00:00:56.120> billet<00:00:56.420> valve<00:00:56.660> covers

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
made a custom set of billet valve covers

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.860 
made a custom set of billet valve covers
with<00:00:57.230> his<00:00:57.350> logo<00:00:57.710> on<00:00:57.860> it<00:00:58.210> black<00:00:59.210> a<00:00:59.240> node<00:00:59.630> and

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
with his logo on it black a node and

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.560 
with his logo on it black a node and
then<00:00:59.990> machine<00:01:00.500> the<00:01:00.680> an<00:01:01.550> oauth2<00:01:02.030> give<00:01:02.450> it<00:01:02.540> a

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
then machine the an oauth2 give it a

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.830 
then machine the an oauth2 give it a
nice<00:01:02.720> little<00:01:02.750> pop<00:01:03.200> there<00:01:03.530> it's<00:01:04.519> got<00:01:04.670> our

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:04.840 
nice little pop there it's got our

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.679 
nice little pop there it's got our

regulation<00:01:09.229> built<00:01:09.500> in<00:01:09.710> and<00:01:09.979> we've<00:01:10.310> got<00:01:10.520> it

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
regulation built in and we've got it

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.899 
regulation built in and we've got it
flipped<00:01:10.970> 180<00:01:11.390> degrees<00:01:12.310> so<00:01:13.310> the<00:01:13.340> throttle<00:01:13.850> body

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
flipped 180 degrees so the throttle body

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:20.770 
flipped 180 degrees so the throttle body
is<00:01:14.210> pointing<00:01:14.689> toward<00:01:14.899> the<00:01:15.020> back<00:01:19.240> twin<00:01:20.240> 91

millimeter<00:01:21.290> turbochargers<00:01:23.050> I'll<00:01:24.050> give<00:01:24.200> these

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
millimeter turbochargers I'll give these

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.060 
millimeter turbochargers I'll give these
bad<00:01:24.530> boys

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.640 

that's<00:01:29.070> serious<00:01:29.670> hair<00:01:29.880> dryer

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.350 

and<00:01:35.650> on<00:01:36.040> this<00:01:36.159> application<00:01:36.369> assistance<00:01:36.909> going

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
and on this application assistance going

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.180 
and on this application assistance going
into<00:01:37.570> a<00:01:37.600> race<00:01:37.840> car<00:01:38.080> we've<00:01:38.260> got<00:01:38.409> a<00:01:38.440> water<00:01:38.770> to<00:01:38.979> air

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
into a race car we've got a water to air

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.090 
into a race car we've got a water to air
intercooler<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.869> we<00:01:41.020> stack<00:01:41.380> two<00:01:41.680> cords

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
intercooler so we stack two cords

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.930 
intercooler so we stack two cords
together<00:01:42.630> water<00:01:43.630> pools<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.290> core<00:01:44.560> and<00:01:44.940> then

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
together water pools the core and then

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.719 
together water pools the core and then
the<00:01:46.390> pipes<00:01:46.659> go<00:01:47.320> in<00:01:47.500> in<00:01:47.890> through<00:01:48.250> the<00:01:48.369> bottom<00:01:48.490> of

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
the pipes go in in through the bottom of

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.969 
the pipes go in in through the bottom of
the<00:01:48.790> intercooler<00:01:49.270> or<00:01:50.170> actually<00:01:50.470> into<00:01:50.680> the<00:01:50.800> top

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
the intercooler or actually into the top

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.170 
the intercooler or actually into the top
and<00:01:51.130> intercooler<00:01:51.520> and<00:01:51.550> then<00:01:51.790> out<00:01:52.030> of<00:01:52.060> the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
and intercooler and then out of the

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.649 
and intercooler and then out of the
bottom<00:01:52.540> into<00:01:52.780> the<00:01:52.869> throttle<00:01:53.200> body<00:01:53.259> itself

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.910 

cause<00:01:58.659> some<00:01:58.810> trick<00:01:59.049> linkage<00:01:59.470> worked<00:01:59.710> out

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
cause some trick linkage worked out

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.610 
cause some trick linkage worked out
you're<00:02:00.220> shameless<00:02:00.430> trick<00:02:00.790> linkage

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.219 

and<00:02:04.220> again<00:02:04.520> uses<00:02:05.120> the<00:02:05.270> electro-motive<00:02:08.229> dfu

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
and again uses the electro-motive dfu

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.480 
and again uses the electro-motive dfu
packs

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.640 

it's<00:02:14.030> got<00:02:14.240> our<00:02:14.390> built-in<00:02:15.020> trigger<00:02:15.410> wheel

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
it's got our built-in trigger wheel

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.709 
it's got our built-in trigger wheel
damper

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:21.719 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:25.970 

and<00:02:22.739> all<00:02:23.739> the<00:02:23.890> fuel<00:02:24.099> regulators<00:02:24.670> are<00:02:24.819> built-in

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
and all the fuel regulators are built-in

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.300 
and all the fuel regulators are built-in
so<00:02:26.980> you've<00:02:27.249> got<00:02:28.049> secondary<00:02:29.049> fuel<00:02:29.319> primary

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
so you've got secondary fuel primary

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.539 
so you've got secondary fuel primary
fuel<00:02:30.670> your<00:02:31.359> returns<00:02:31.859> the<00:02:32.859> kick<00:02:33.069> ups<00:02:33.249> for<00:02:33.459> the

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
fuel your returns the kick ups for the

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.640 
fuel your returns the kick ups for the
gauges<00:02:33.999> and<00:02:34.299> then<00:02:34.749> these<00:02:34.870> are<00:02:35.049> the<00:02:35.139> regulators

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
gauges and then these are the regulators

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.770 
gauges and then these are the regulators
themselves<00:02:36.189> and<00:02:36.400> then<00:02:37.209> you<00:02:37.359> adjust<00:02:37.450> the

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
themselves and then you adjust the

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.449 
themselves and then you adjust the
pressure<00:02:37.959> here<00:02:38.349> it's<00:02:38.530> all<00:02:38.680> internally<00:02:39.250> boost

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
pressure here it's all internally boost

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.490 
pressure here it's all internally boost

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:41.360
