00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 psol goes in this video if he talks 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.170
 about bullfighting I know it's a theme already a 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.460
 little addressed but I'll say something 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.440
 khan 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.009
 I think it was never said - and I never saw 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.590
 and put up with so authoritarian one yesterday 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.840
 horseman on horseback tractor 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.869
 taffarel today and the people who are in 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.640
 tip and it's obvious I do not know why it's a shot 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.650
 also applaud an animal and 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.890
 suffering but these are the same 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.650
 people who know that one of the matatu 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.600
 your dog to your cat I'll call the 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.800
 sessions for the rights of 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.860
 animals 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.500
 consume police to call things like that 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.570
 makes a lot of sense because these people 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.480
 at the same time it gives a taste to see an animal in the 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.340
 and being tortured with barbs in the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.100
 tortured body is a tradition 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.010
 Portuguese, however, I think not all 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.230
 what is tradition is necessarily good and 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.030
 Bullfighting is not at all good because 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.969
 is to torture an animal 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.230
 basically now i even understand this 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.589
 bullfighting dance 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.720
 but in the 16th century the quinho a scene like this 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.119
 even company the first because the 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.799
 brain at that time was not so include 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.010
 as is the human brain today as well 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.080
 at that time it is via inquisition or 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.970
 also cultural animals but also 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.810
 structural people they did 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.549
 filth 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.680
 therefore that public library a 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:27.150
 I walk the things that I really want 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.729
 say and edilene boy wants to stay is the 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.630
 next the douro 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.360
 do not complain and be it takes the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.170
 Popes, it's not me, but I'm not hurt. 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.520
 I do not scream it's the only way I 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.100
 we have to see that I was not 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.170
 because it will leave as this is for 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.079
 structure an animal 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:53.820
 I think it is encompassing whatever the 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.710
 animal then this was a cat's place 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.350
 bull 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.729
 made a noise did not fear did not scream 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.729
 they did not do any suffering 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.739
 so if it was a car it would be a dog 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.640
 also did not make a noise did not 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.640
 nothing did not complain 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.890
 I'm hoping I want to get one. 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.470
 extinguisher makes only a noise we 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.260
 we can actually build this is the 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.810
 how do the animal suffer there are teams 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.260
 has neither feet nor head and has full 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.780
 21st century is just think that chooses luck 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.930
 of the gdp and ready to shirt and hope 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.390
 did you like it if you agree with the 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.380
 my opinion because it inspires me and I do 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.840
 is the largest number of people 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.420
 because I very sincerely think it natural 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:05.769
 via it ends a crime thing to see 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:08.660
 if this is the first time a kiss on 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.820

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.100
