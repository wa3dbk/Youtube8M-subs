00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
to the bottom of the blade so we had

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.800 
to the bottom of the blade so we had
quite<00:04:20.840> a<00:04:20.900> bit<00:04:21.169> of<00:04:21.370> of<00:04:22.370> we're<00:04:22.940> going<00:04:23.360> on<00:04:23.540> there

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
quite a bit of of we're going on there

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:33.850 
quite a bit of of we're going on there
right<00:04:24.020> there<00:04:31.180> with<00:04:32.180> so<00:04:32.870> you<00:04:32.960> can<00:04:33.140> see<00:04:33.410> how<00:04:33.650> much

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
right there with so you can see how much

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.750 
right there with so you can see how much
material<00:04:34.630> has<00:04:35.630> worn<00:04:36.050> off<00:04:36.320> so<00:04:36.650> by<00:04:37.430> flipping

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
material has worn off so by flipping

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.560 
material has worn off so by flipping
that<00:04:38.090> bottom<00:04:38.600> where<00:04:39.560> edge<00:04:39.800> around<00:04:40.360> we<00:04:41.360> have<00:04:41.540> a

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
that bottom where edge around we have a

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.219 
that bottom where edge around we have a
now<00:04:41.870> fresh<00:04:42.940> cutting<00:04:43.940> surface<00:04:44.390> on<00:04:44.690> the<00:04:44.900> bottom

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
now fresh cutting surface on the bottom

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.500 
now fresh cutting surface on the bottom
and<00:04:45.590> we'll<00:04:46.130> we'll<00:04:46.700> wash<00:04:46.910> that<00:04:47.150> over<00:04:47.390> the<00:04:47.479> next
