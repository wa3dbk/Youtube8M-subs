00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.080
 so sad and sad 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:15.339
 the guys that generate the biggest and with another positive video-lesson and I saw 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:17.380
 what the supposed plot 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.630
 today I will try to show that there was no luck 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.660
 how do we transform it with an image into a drawing 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.230
 It's really cool, this is what I'm going to show here. 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.730
 since I took an image on the internet and any 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.210
 and doubled the layer as he found joanna 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.010
 I will go later 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.970
 turn it into black and white with public ivoti controls 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.770
 then the pair and with her again with the bought 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.770
 soc 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.670
 I go here 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.840
 and transform layer 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.840
 attached to the title 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.510
 tightness 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.710
 now I'm going to infiltrate 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.070
 in dortmund 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.070
 glaucian pain 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.660
 what aquino radios was up here as close as you can see already 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.130
 seeming to generate 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.960
 but on a weak date 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.960
 leave a little more 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.220
 and here not 4 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.380
 no 4-0 daughter gets legal overall 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.150
 the image is all 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.270
 a draw 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.700
 nest rock 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.040
 netanyahu 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.240
 the cool effect 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.240
 It's very simple to do. 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.259
 until the next staff 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:16.909
 effective 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:17.789
 so sad and sad
