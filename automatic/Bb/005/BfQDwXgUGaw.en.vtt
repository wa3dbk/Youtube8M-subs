rotted out I don't even know how the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.030 
rotted out I don't even know how the
thing<00:00:50.220> still<00:00:50.550> can<00:00:50.850> eat<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.329> straight<00:00:51.780> up<00:00:55.040> all

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
thing still can eat it straight up all

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:26.470 
thing still can eat it straight up all
right<00:00:56.129> we'll<00:00:56.309> go<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.640> next<00:00:56.910> post

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.690 

okay<00:01:27.480> so<00:01:27.540> what<00:01:27.930> you're<00:01:28.050> looking<00:01:28.170> at<00:01:28.380> here<00:01:30.500> is

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.200 
okay so what you're looking at here is
it<00:01:32.700> completely<00:01:33.090> rusted<00:01:33.510> out<00:01:33.810> post<00:01:34.200> system

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
it completely rusted out post system

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.180 
it completely rusted out post system
because<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.390> oxygen<00:01:36.540> can<00:01:37.140> get<00:01:37.320> inside<00:01:37.950> the

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
because the oxygen can get inside the

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.250 
because the oxygen can get inside the
post<00:01:40.610> it<00:01:41.610> just<00:01:41.880> eats<00:01:42.090> away<00:01:42.300> the<00:01:42.420> steel<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:42.870> don't

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
post it just eats away the steel I don't

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.100 
post it just eats away the steel I don't
care<00:01:43.470> if<00:01:43.590> it's<00:01:43.860> then<00:01:44.580> powder<00:01:45.210> covers<00:01:45.750> it's

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
care if it's then powder covers it's

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.940 
care if it's then powder covers it's
been<00:01:46.790> galvanized<00:01:47.790> first<00:01:48.450> it's<00:01:49.140> covered<00:01:49.920> with

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
been galvanized first it's covered with

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.310 
been galvanized first it's covered with
tar<00:01:50.400> and<00:01:51.710> if<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:53.040> deal<00:01:53.780> when<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.900> moisture

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.500 
tar and if this deal when the moisture
comes<00:01:55.590> into<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.980> post<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.700> just<00:01:57.030> creates<00:01:57.330> the

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
comes into the post it just creates the

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.810 
comes into the post it just creates the
perfect<00:01:57.750> rust<00:01:58.320> environment<00:01:59.010> but<00:01:59.640> you'll

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
perfect rust environment but you'll

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.280 
perfect rust environment but you'll
notice<00:02:00.300> one<00:02:00.720> thing<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:01.430> inside<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.610> wall<00:02:03.290> like

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
notice one thing is inside the wall like

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.540 
notice one thing is inside the wall like
you<00:02:04.530> can<00:02:04.680> see<00:02:04.830> right<00:02:04.860> here<00:02:05.190> where<00:02:05.400> some

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
you can see right here where some

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.100 
you can see right here where some
concrete<00:02:05.910> got<00:02:06.180> up<00:02:06.300> on<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.480> side<00:02:06.720> of<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.900> post

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
concrete got up on the side of the post

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.040 
concrete got up on the side of the post
it's<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.190> good<00:02:08.369> shape<00:02:08.429> but<00:02:09.060> no<00:02:09.240> oxygen<00:02:09.720> could

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
it's in good shape but no oxygen could

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.110 
it's in good shape but no oxygen could
get<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.350> the<00:02:10.470> steel<00:02:11.030> inside<00:02:12.500> so<00:02:13.880> why<00:02:14.880> not<00:02:14.910> just

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
get to the steel inside so why not just

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.440 
get to the steel inside so why not just
bring<00:02:15.570> it<00:02:15.720> wet<00:02:15.930> glaze<00:02:16.200> all<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.620> way<00:02:16.770> up<00:02:17.040> and

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
bring it wet glaze all the way up and

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.540 
bring it wet glaze all the way up and
that<00:02:18.450> way<00:02:18.660> no<00:02:18.990> oxygen<00:02:19.380> can<00:02:19.920> get<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.130> this<00:02:20.280> deal

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
that way no oxygen can get to this deal

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.370 
that way no oxygen can get to this deal
then<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.910> post<00:02:21.090> will<00:02:21.390> stay<00:02:21.600> strong<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:22.080> won't

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
then the post will stay strong and won't

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.980 
then the post will stay strong and won't
it<00:02:22.830> won't<00:02:23.040> run<00:02:23.280> out<00:02:23.330> but<00:02:24.330> if<00:02:24.420> it's<00:02:24.570> a<00:02:24.720> piece<00:02:24.959> of

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
it won't run out but if it's a piece of

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.740 
it won't run out but if it's a piece of
metal<00:02:25.350> into<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.740> hollow<00:02:26.040> post<00:02:26.540> moisture<00:02:27.540> comes

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
metal into a hollow post moisture comes

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.680 
metal into a hollow post moisture comes
through<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.140> concrete<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:28.830> just<00:02:28.980> rusted<00:02:29.340> out

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
through the concrete and just rusted out

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.290 
through the concrete and just rusted out
so<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:31.160> was<00:02:32.160> also<00:02:32.310> using<00:02:32.580> this<00:02:32.820> little<00:02:33.150> bit<00:02:33.270> of

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
so I was also using this little bit of

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.270 
so I was also using this little bit of
videos<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.930> sound<00:02:34.730> sample<00:02:35.730> of<00:02:35.820> sound<00:02:37.280> how

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
videos the sound sample of sound how

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.840 
videos the sound sample of sound how
much<00:02:38.459> it<00:02:38.610> blocks<00:02:38.880> out<00:02:39.620> what<00:02:40.620> I'll<00:02:40.739> do<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.220> I'll

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
much it blocks out what I'll do is I'll

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.180 
much it blocks out what I'll do is I'll
go<00:02:42.030> inside<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.900> yard

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.410 

and<00:02:46.190> then<00:02:46.310> we'll<00:02:46.460> remove<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.790> glass<00:02:47.060> will<00:02:47.300> see

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
and then we'll remove the glass will see

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.540 
and then we'll remove the glass will see
how<00:02:47.510> much<00:02:47.570> sound<00:02:47.930> comes<00:02:48.170> into<00:02:48.350> the<00:02:48.470> yard<00:02:51.550> help

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
how much sound comes into the yard help

00:02:52.550 --> 00:03:00.460 
how much sound comes into the yard help
me<00:02:52.640> move<00:02:52.760> those<00:02:52.970> two<00:02:53.120> pieces<00:02:53.270> of<00:02:53.510> glass<00:02:59.470> okay

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
me move those two pieces of glass okay

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.410 
me move those two pieces of glass okay
so

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:23.570 

can<00:03:04.420> hear<00:03:04.629> the<00:03:04.780> street<00:03:05.459> somewhat

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:04:47.640 

that<00:03:24.580> most<00:03:24.790> need<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.060> be<00:03:25.180> replaced<00:03:25.420> over<00:03:25.750> there

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.990 

everywhere<00:04:48.650> the<00:04:48.800> concrete<00:04:49.430> touched<00:04:49.790> the

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
everywhere the concrete touched the

00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:47.700 
everywhere the concrete touched the
