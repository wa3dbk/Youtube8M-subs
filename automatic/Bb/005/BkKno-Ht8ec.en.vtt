00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:11.460
 hello everyone with you again text kitchen 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.410
 the most desirable socket 1155 is under 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.740
 his company sapphire released a new 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.270
 motherboard board z77 key despite 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.640
 on the platinum prefix sample 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.199
 budget by paying 150 dollars 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.670
 the user will get the motherboard from 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.380
 moderate overclocking of the processor and 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.090
 opportunity to realize budget 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.619
 crossfire however video card on 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.480
 the initial stage can not take 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.300
 As a rule, all processors are under the socket 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.579
 1155 has a built-in kernel 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.090
 four video outputs for all occasions 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.550
 hdmi display by libya and vijay strange 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.120
 just 6 July vip cars of which 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.160
 only two 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.200
 and beaten 0 but immediately two gigabit 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.840
 fret can precisely this 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.610
 dress power 6 sapports and only two of 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.649
 which version 3 is almost complete 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.600
 budget sata cable snaps included 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.129
 under each port did not regret you can see 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.239
 how casually implemented the connector 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.829
 additional power 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.180
 it will certainly be impossible 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.379
 connect in case of lower location 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.120
 power supply 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.890
 if you figure it out and not 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.519
 need hardly anyone will collect three 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.920
 video cards 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.630
 knowing that 4 ports will be in this case 4 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.760
 speedy so what's up power for 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.590
 checkboxes 2 accelerators are connected by 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.240
 16x 8x pattern 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.070
 and in principle, even for top both 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.110
 enough bandwidth for yourself 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.880
 graphic ports version 30 here and 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.460
 you dig and what from decent on 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.470
 board reset button bios hello and power 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.939
 switch to 2 be as the blast 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.680
 all passcodes are convenient 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.450
 taking advantage of the inner huts 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.369
 connectors can connect up to eight 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.200
 external devices and it tells us about 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.040
 the fact that this board is better suited not 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.750
 for gamers only 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.820
 but also for multimedia computer 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.070
 If it is going to be full-sized 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.020
 case bringing out 6 usb ports 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.759
 card reader can be easily connected 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.200
 various devices manipulators 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.820
 memory card joysticks 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.530
 one of the internal ports can 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.060
 fit under the bar with the kit with 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.799
 two is b3 but which is possible 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.780
 install either in the front panel of the case 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.909
 either into one of the expansion slots on 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.560
 back panel outwardly you are unlikely 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.180
 something will be remembered even the radiator 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.100
 made without other decorations 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.810
 supporter of the effectiveness of minimalism 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.299
 it will be pleasant for them it is working 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.069
 the horse they are interior item computer 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.590
 pleases a good overclocking processor 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.110
 Intel Core i5 2500k example 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.110
 accelerates from 3.7 to 4 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.390
 50 hertz then the bios has all the necessary 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.430
 overclocking tools available 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.740
 power converter with 10 feed circuits 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.050
 and 25 capacitors on the other hand 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.880
 maximum stable tire 6 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.860
 megahertz which may not be enough with 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.040
 some processors for example intel 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.680
 core i7 2600 key rests on a clean 4 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.780
 as much as 70 g hertz although capable with more 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.090
 good mother reach 5 gigahertz 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.920
 however, and the budget overclocking records we 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.630
 and did not wait in the presence of six 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.400
 fan connectors 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.080
 and most of them can be planted 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.750
 on manual or automatic control 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.670
 revolutions through bios maximum volume 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.800
 memory of 32 gigabytes speaks of 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.410
 support for 8 modules 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.920
 gigabyte supported frequency up to 1600 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.780
 megahertz 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.820
 to whom we will advise this fee in 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.630
 principle, you can assemble a game machine with 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.610
 one or two 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.860
 my accelerator in the second case as much 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.720
 sl sim2 cards not officially 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.310
 supported we would advise 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.810
 This solution is for advanced 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.390
 multimedia center and when the system 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.520
 going to these x package fourth 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.410
 application budget system under grown 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.330
 for a start buy simple processes 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.920
 video use inline then 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.220
 to upgrade but powerful processor 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.310
 buy a video card then the second such 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.930
 board sapphire for 77 gay flesh well and with you 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.930
 was dina to new meetings 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.739
 the dress 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:46.000
 treated and dresses mean
