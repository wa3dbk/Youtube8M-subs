for<00:01:59.369> almost<00:02:00.369> all<00:02:00.610> Yamaha<00:02:01.420> twats<00:02:02.220> you<00:02:03.220> just

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
for almost all Yamaha twats you just

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.460 
for almost all Yamaha twats you just
have<00:02:03.640> to<00:02:04.860> do<00:02:05.860> it<00:02:05.890> a<00:02:06.070> different<00:02:06.100> way<00:02:06.580> because

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
have to do it a different way because

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.800 
have to do it a different way because
this<00:02:08.470> is<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.800> way<00:02:09.300> I'm<00:02:10.300> just<00:02:10.360> going<00:02:10.690> to<00:02:10.840> say<00:02:10.959> um

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
this is the way I'm just going to say um

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.180 
this is the way I'm just going to say um
you<00:02:13.810> got<00:02:13.989> to<00:02:14.110> find<00:02:14.320> a<00:02:14.410> way<00:02:14.530> to<00:02:14.560> get<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:15.070> the

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
you got to find a way to get to the

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.570 
you got to find a way to get to the
ignition<00:02:15.430> on<00:02:15.850> a<00:02:16.300> different<00:02:16.720> four-wheeler<00:02:17.580> and

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
ignition on a different four-wheeler and

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.170 
ignition on a different four-wheeler and
this<00:02:19.360> works<00:02:19.570> for<00:02:19.720> Yamahas<00:02:20.320> as<00:02:20.590> well<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:21.180> mean

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
this works for Yamahas as well I mean

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.680 
this works for Yamahas as well I mean
our<00:02:22.330> Honda's<00:02:23.670> Honda's<00:02:24.670> and<00:02:24.940> Yamaha<00:02:25.360> this

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
our Honda's Honda's and Yamaha this

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.660 
our Honda's Honda's and Yamaha this
works<00:02:25.930> for<00:02:26.430> anything<00:02:27.430> else<00:02:27.790> I<00:02:28.000> don't<00:02:28.060> know<00:02:28.650> but

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
works for anything else I don't know but

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.460 
works for anything else I don't know but
that's<00:02:30.670> why<00:02:30.970> I<00:02:31.000> know<00:02:31.120> it<00:02:31.360> works<00:02:31.570> for<00:02:31.810> the

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
that's why I know it works for the

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.870 
that's why I know it works for the
ignitions<00:02:32.890> you<00:02:33.010> just<00:02:33.250> can<00:02:33.340> plug<00:02:33.580> them<00:02:33.730> they

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
ignitions you just can plug them they

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:47.610 
ignitions you just can plug them they
will<00:02:34.030> start<00:02:34.420> because<00:02:34.750> if<00:02:34.900> it's<00:02:35.020> a<00:02:35.250> circuit<00:02:46.620> my

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
will start because if it's a circuit my

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.509 
will start because if it's a circuit my
Blaster<00:02:48.070> is<00:02:48.130> 98<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:50.290> o3s<00:02:50.769> have<00:02:51.010> a<00:02:51.040> different

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
Blaster is 98 the o3s have a different

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:57.449 
Blaster is 98 the o3s have a different
plug<00:02:52.299> to<00:02:52.630> them<00:02:53.730> 206<00:02:54.959> but<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.980> still<00:02:57.310> can

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
plug to them 206 but you still can

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:18.830 
plug to them 206 but you still can
unplug<00:02:57.700> them<00:02:57.940> let's<00:02:58.330> start
