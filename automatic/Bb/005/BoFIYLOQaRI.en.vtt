lot of stuff going on here not sure what

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.719 
lot of stuff going on here not sure what
the<00:01:10.049> significance<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.770> yet<00:01:11.220> but<00:01:11.250> does<00:01:11.580> this

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
the significance is yet but does this

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.609 
the significance is yet but does this
mean<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.030> Steven<00:01:12.659> can<00:01:12.840> find<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.170> key<00:01:13.380> to

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
animations here I am really really

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.460 
animations here I am really really
liking<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.540> improvement<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.259> they're

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
liking the improvement that they're

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.080 
liking the improvement that they're
having<00:01:49.590> for<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.920> battle<00:01:50.189> animations<00:01:50.369> there

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
having for the battle animations there

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.240 
having for the battle animations there
is<00:01:51.360> Archie<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.200> people<00:01:52.470> keep<00:01:52.619> suspecting

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
is Archie and people keep suspecting

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.910 
is Archie and people keep suspecting
that<00:01:53.280> they<00:01:53.490> do<00:01:53.549> have<00:01:54.030> mega<00:01:55.020> stone<00:01:55.470> somewhere

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
that they do have mega stone somewhere

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.530 
that they do have mega stone somewhere
on<00:01:56.219> them<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:56.579> hopefully<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.329> case

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
on them so hopefully that is the case

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.109 
on them so hopefully that is the case

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
forms in Pokemon and me they're very

that<00:02:39.500> had<00:02:39.709> these<00:02:40.370> in<00:02:40.550> it<00:02:40.640> as<00:02:40.790> well<00:02:40.819> but<00:02:41.300> I<00:02:41.630> think

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
that had these in it as well but I think

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.320 
that had these in it as well but I think
it<00:02:42.110> extends<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:42.920> gameplay<00:02:43.430> a<00:02:43.459> bitter<00:02:43.730> extends

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
it extends the gameplay a bitter extends

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.390 
it extends the gameplay a bitter extends
what<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:44.600> actually<00:02:44.840> has<00:02:45.560> shown<00:02:45.920> before<00:02:46.160> it

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
what it actually has shown before it

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.300 
what it actually has shown before it
adds<00:02:46.580> on<00:02:46.940> to<00:02:47.560> whatever<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.769> trailer<00:02:49.130> had

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
adds on to whatever the trailer had

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.160 
adds on to whatever the trailer had
before<00:02:49.700> it's<00:02:50.000> got<00:02:50.209> a<00:02:50.239> little<00:02:50.390> bit<00:02:50.630> extra<00:02:50.900> in

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170
