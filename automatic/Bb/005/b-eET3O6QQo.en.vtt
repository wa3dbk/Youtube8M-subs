nail-biter<00:07:07.440> this<00:07:07.710> one<00:07:07.920> we<00:07:08.100> have<00:07:08.310> some<00:07:08.520> really

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:08.760 
nail-biter this one we have some really

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.970 
nail-biter this one we have some really
tense<00:07:09.030> moments<00:07:09.480> right<00:07:09.690> to<00:07:09.840> the<00:07:09.960> end<00:07:10.110> but<00:07:10.830> the

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:10.980 
tense moments right to the end but the

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.190 
tense moments right to the end but the
team<00:07:11.220> managed<00:07:11.610> to<00:07:11.760> hold<00:07:11.910> out<00:07:12.090> though<00:07:12.330> yeah<00:07:13.020> and

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:13.200 
team managed to hold out though yeah and

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.260 
team managed to hold out though yeah and
I<00:07:13.290> think<00:07:13.440> after<00:07:13.620> -<00:07:13.890> solji's<00:07:14.430> second<00:07:14.790> half<00:07:14.970> gold

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:15.270 
I think after - solji's second half gold

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.600 
I think after - solji's second half gold
they<00:07:15.450> did<00:07:15.660> one<00:07:15.840> local<00:07:16.260> teams<00:07:16.500> do<00:07:16.740> protected

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:17.610 
they did one local teams do protected

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.500 
they did one local teams do protected
