00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.190
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.459
 flash and 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:13.350
 This guide on privat minecraft seemed 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:16.740
 would be private in minecraft 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.680
 easier but there are people who do not know how 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.650
 privatize and write off for them this guide 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.720
 well let's start 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.689
 in this we will turn to this 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.820
 here is the house and we need it 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.180
 wooden fence which is in my hand 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.250
 you can craft it or just lead it 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.800
 team in and and will give you such 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.200
 wooden ax 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.840
 to zaprivatit you need to hit 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.840
 left click on one block 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.580
 and right-click on another block 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.020
 and there is such a mesh 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.990
 inside which all the blocks will be 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.330
 locked in if you pay attention then 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.960
 Now this grid steamed from only two 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.770
 block 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.369
 even one no 2 after all 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.969
 and at this stage, people talk 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.329
 begin to invent a bicycle they 

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:14.369
 start building here such here would become 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:19.469
 so that later you would hit 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:22.020
 ax and the net will rise but not only 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:23.999
 what is a rule violation and moderator 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.359
 can you wind up such a pillar from his 

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:29.490
 you will not remove it in most cases 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:30.950
 such would forget to clean and then 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.149
 turns out to be banned 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.950
 so as not to build would have 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:39.329
 special team team called 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.799
 Expand that is, we will be this team and 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:48.270
 a value of 20, that is, 20 cells and 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:52.079
 direction up ie cup and our 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:57.170
 the grid goes up by 20 up by 20 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.170
 cells up did the same thing down and 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.709
 our grid of 20 cells goes away 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:06.940
 down further we just into one rgdb team 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:09.010
 glue and name regions 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.370
 inside i will have you will have your 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:14.440
 the region and all you zaprivatil now i 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.540
 the most such question is how to choose 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.100
 this grid which is dazzled in the eyes and 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.090
 in general, she is somehow strange 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.280
 You can certainly restart but this is nonsense 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.560
 so there is again a special 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.680
 team team sat down to say this team 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.460
 and and all this there are three more no further 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.740
 how to check if this region is for 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.440
 whether he was brought you can hit 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.510
 coal 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.580
 hit and you showed that you were here some 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.500
 the region, you can make a right 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.490
 you will just stand in it children 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:51.880
 commander rg sat down and will show you the grid 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:56.500
 region is very useful if you forget 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:59.800
 how are you and where is privately region and and so 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.720
 death so with coal just enter this 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.880
 the team 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.970
 if you suddenly live not alone and you need 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.610
 will your friend be able to break the blocks 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.640
 in your area, you must enter it 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:17.680

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:20.050

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.690
 Then check out all you have got 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:26.650
 displays all commands dear info name 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:30.400

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:34.030
 his lags are katarna him are the owner then 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.640

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.470
 get him out of there 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.840
 little do you look shock series or else 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:55.480
