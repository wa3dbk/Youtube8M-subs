00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:07.460

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:11.070
 stage tasty extraordinary 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.120
 we will need 200 grams of already cleaned 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.630
 walnuts 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.619
 however you can any other nuts that 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.119
 you will have stavropol and 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.640
 walnuts grow at every turn 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.490
 you can gather them clean and 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:31.349
 enjoy all winter in order to save 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.870
 time you can buy already peeled me 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.780
 I will chop nuts with a blender 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.590
 can be given to the poison with a meat grinder or 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.520
 same just 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.190
 the ceiling of the usual wooden tolkushkoy 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:47.760
 The ceiling will be about the same as we add 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:52.129
 sugar to taste 3 5 tablespoons of sugar 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.690
 and together with sugar grinding nuts 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.899
 this filling is done very quickly 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:02.070
 literally 5 minutes if you already have 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:06.659
 cleaned and the nuts are so small 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.650
 sugar nut can be 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.479
 there were pieces and go a little bigger 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:16.560
 I grease the baking sheet with margarine and you can 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.350
 start making dough patties 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.200
 spread on the table diluted by hand 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.750
 so that it takes the form of a square and cut 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.650
 this square is diagonal by four 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.590
 triangle 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:33.090
 and then we divide each triangle in half 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:37.350
 and the resulting triangles divide again 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.970
 in half and that we get 16 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.590
 parts 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:46.290
 I do not need to roll out here I take 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.829
 a piece of dough and just spreading it 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.630
 I stretch my arms to the sides 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:55.140
 to have a place to fill our 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.799
 the stuffing is pretty large 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:02.759
 pies full dessert spoon I put 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.950
 the fillings from three sides raise the edges to 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.619
 the middle 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.619
 we make a triangular pie 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.900
 the dough is very soft and supple tender 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.900
 working with him is very easy 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.460
 look again quite simply this 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.460
 is done 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.620
 I fit on a baking sheet 9 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:44.730
 pies are not suitable yet will be distributed 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.750
 such big pies large reel 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.750
 their raw egg 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.570
 so that they become rosy and shiny and 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.730
 put the oven in the oven for two hundred 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.380
 fifty degrees 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.440
 heating in my oven comes from the top 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.990
 and below it is electric but in ordinary 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.060
 gas oven on fire are obtained accurately 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.180
 same pies and i pike 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.980
 tried and punished on different plates 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.310
 on electrical in principle the same 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:15.110
 it turns out and there and there the remaining dough 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.940
 I moved add a little flour and 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.610
 now I want to do the same triangular 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.790
 pies are only twice as small 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.610
 I don't know why, but here's the little cakes 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.060
 I always seem tastier compared to 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:33.209
 big and already eat like candy 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.940
 such a delicacy and now it seems more than smaller 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.040
 the tastier 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.019
 moreover, they will be smaller the more 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.340
 you can probably eat them 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:46.080
 so they seem 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:49.080
 taste a bit of them if more 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.380
 so you get pleasure to sculpt 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:55.200
 they need just like big ones 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:58.440
 divide the dough into 16 card triangles 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.170
 we stretch a piece we put a teaspoon 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.200
 stuffing and cover the pie with three 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.200
 parties 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:17.470
 that's because such a small triangular 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:19.600
 pyramid and on a baking sheet right in my 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.730
 even a child can handle it easily 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.760
 because it is very similar to the game in 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:27.820
 Sandbox also here lepish such stab 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.870
 Kekule tiki and all very quickly very 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.870
 easy it turns out 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:48.789
 and while the first batch is baked we 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:55.009
 have time to stick 2 baking pies 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:58.720
 It took 10 minutes to get and see what 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:02.060
 we got what they became 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:07.479
 browned with a crispy crust 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.479
 and inside the airy dough and nuts 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.530
 impossible already 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:16.729
 can't stand to not 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:20.150
 try first pie my oven i 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:22.580
 don't even turn it off because it's already time 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.919
 put there 2 pan left 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:29.449
 egg our future 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:32.120
 nut candy and I turned it down 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:34.880
 temperature up to 200 degrees 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:38.599
 so that these pies babes more or less 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.690
 Clamp the plaintiffs on the bottom and here they are 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:44.210
 have turned out 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:47.150
 let's see what's inside the sugar 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.580
 melted and the nuts ended up in this 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:53.199
