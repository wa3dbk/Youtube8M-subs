and on the west side of the corn field
gives<00:00:40.950> will<00:00:41.070> find<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.700> kind<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:42.000> pathway

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
gives will find this kind of pathway

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.760 
gives will find this kind of pathway
he's<00:00:42.600> going<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.809> follow<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.110> pathway<00:00:43.530> and

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
he's going to follow the pathway and

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.369 
he's going to follow the pathway and
once<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.340> turns<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.180> kind<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.420> turns<00:00:45.719> in

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
once it turns so it kind of turns in

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.590 
once it turns so it kind of turns in
kind<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.250> clockwise<00:00:47.700> motion<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.300> guys<00:00:48.390> got

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
kind of a clockwise motion you guys got

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.940 
kind of a clockwise motion you guys got
to<00:00:48.660> see<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.840> goes<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.230> right<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.860> guys

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
to see it goes to the right you guys

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.279 
to see it goes to the right you guys
will<00:00:50.070> find<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.370> little<00:00:50.579> pathway<00:00:51.050> pretty<00:00:52.050> close

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
will find a little pathway pretty close

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.260 
will find a little pathway pretty close
to<00:00:52.530> what<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.770> turn<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.579> right<00:00:54.000> there<00:00:54.180> will

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
to what a turn is and right there will

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.910 
to what a turn is and right there will
be<00:00:54.360> knocked<00:00:54.690> now<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.230> think<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.739> very

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
be knocked now I think this is a very

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
incorporated a lot of zombie maps into

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.330 
incorporated a lot of zombie maps into
transit<00:01:00.660> itself<00:01:01.020> for<00:01:01.500> instance<00:01:01.559> shi<00:01:01.949> no<00:01:02.039> numa

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
transit itself for instance shi no numa

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.709 
transit itself for instance shi no numa
there's<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.609> hut<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.030> kind<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.239> resembled<00:01:03.600> it
