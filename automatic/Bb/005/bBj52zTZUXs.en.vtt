00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049

my<00:01:40.079> eyes<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.430> non-comedogenic<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.840> it's

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
my eyes it is non-comedogenic and it's

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.639 
my eyes it is non-comedogenic and it's
dermatologist<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:43.950> ophthalmologist<00:01:44.700> tested

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
dermatologist and ophthalmologist tested

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.330

any<00:02:53.680> translation<00:02:54.340> here<00:02:55.150> as<00:02:55.389> far<00:02:55.750> as<00:02:56.790> well<00:02:57.790> that

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
any translation here as far as well that

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.960 
any translation here as far as well that
converts<00:02:58.359> to<00:02:58.780> for<00:02:59.230> us<00:02:59.379> here<00:02:59.769> in<00:02:59.920> the<00:02:59.950> US<00:03:00.489> but

converts to for us here in the US but

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.660 
converts to for us here in the US but
this<00:03:01.150> is<00:03:01.269> 200<00:03:02.250> actually<00:03:03.250> because<00:03:03.400> this<00:03:03.489> has

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
this is 200 actually because this has

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.879 
this is 200 actually because this has
the<00:03:03.819> milliliters<00:03:04.269> on<00:03:04.420> it<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.629> NARS<00:03:04.840> and<00:03:05.290> so

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:05.889 
the milliliters on it the NARS and so

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:09.780 
the milliliters on it the NARS and so
this<00:03:06.099> one<00:03:07.230> is<00:03:08.230> 250<00:03:09.159> so<00:03:09.280> you<00:03:09.370> do<00:03:09.489> get<00:03:09.579> a<00:03:09.639> little

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
this one is 250 so you do get a little

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.740 
this one is 250 so you do get a little
bit<00:03:10.000> more<00:03:10.120> product<00:03:10.599> not<00:03:11.260> a<00:03:11.290> ton<00:03:12.480> if<00:03:13.480> they're

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
bit more product not a ton if they're

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.710 
bit more product not a ton if they're
both<00:03:13.900> clear<00:03:14.410> and<00:03:15.060> from<00:03:16.060> some<00:03:16.510> of<00:03:16.629> the

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
both clear and from some of the

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.240 
both clear and from some of the
ingredients<00:03:16.840> that<00:03:17.349> I<00:03:17.410> can<00:03:17.560> kind<00:03:17.799> of<00:03:17.889> read<00:03:18.099> on

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
ingredients that I can kind of read on

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.229 
ingredients that I can kind of read on
here<00:03:18.609> I<00:03:18.760> see<00:03:19.629> water<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:20.590> I<00:03:21.400> do<00:03:21.459> see<00:03:21.849> that<00:03:22.000> this

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
here I see water and I do see that this

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.520 
here I see water and I do see that this
has<00:03:22.480> cucumber<00:03:22.750> in<00:03:23.169> it<00:03:23.260> as<00:03:23.440> well<00:03:23.470> so<00:03:25.470> they<00:03:26.470> do

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
has cucumber in it as well so they do

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.319 
has cucumber in it as well so they do
have<00:03:26.799> several<00:03:27.310> of<00:03:27.669> the<00:03:27.819> same<00:03:28.060> ingredients<00:03:29.099> a

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
have several of the same ingredients a

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.250 
have several of the same ingredients a
really<00:03:31.329> weird<00:03:31.510> thing<00:03:31.599> is<00:03:31.870> that<00:03:31.900> it<00:03:32.109> has

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
really weird thing is that it has

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.589 
really weird thing is that it has
mannitol<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.010> xylitol<00:03:33.699> which<00:03:33.910> I<00:03:34.239> think<00:03:34.449> are

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
mannitol and xylitol which I think are

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.720 
mannitol and xylitol which I think are
and<00:03:34.840> fruit<00:03:35.709> extract<00:03:36.280> those<00:03:37.209> other<00:03:37.510> two<00:03:37.810> are<00:03:38.079> I

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
and fruit extract those other two are I

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.420 
and fruit extract those other two are I
think<00:03:39.730> sugar<00:03:40.569> type<00:03:41.220> artificial<00:03:42.220> ingredients

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
think sugar type artificial ingredients

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.789 
think sugar type artificial ingredients
so<00:03:42.970> that's<00:03:43.150> kind<00:03:43.389> of<00:03:43.449> weird<00:03:43.599> that<00:03:43.870> that's<00:03:44.530> in

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
so that's kind of weird that that's in

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.890 
so that's kind of weird that that's in
there<00:03:44.949> I<00:03:44.980> never<00:03:45.310> really<00:03:45.579> noticed<00:03:45.730> that<00:03:46.060> but<00:03:46.780> if

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
there I never really noticed that but if

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.140 
there I never really noticed that but if
I<00:03:46.989> had<00:03:47.199> to<00:03:47.230> compare<00:03:47.349> and<00:03:47.919> tell<00:03:48.129> you<00:03:48.310> I<00:03:48.519> do<00:03:48.760> like

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
I had to compare and tell you I do like

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.059 
I had to compare and tell you I do like
the<00:03:49.209> bioderma<00:03:49.780> a<00:03:50.019> lot<00:03:50.230> I<00:03:50.440> have<00:03:50.590> to<00:03:50.739> be<00:03:50.859> very

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
the bioderma a lot I have to be very

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.490 
the bioderma a lot I have to be very
careful<00:03:51.430> with<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:51.849> bioderma<00:03:52.359> because<00:03:52.780> for

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
careful with the bioderma because for

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.360 
careful with the bioderma because for
some<00:03:53.709> reason<00:03:53.739> when<00:03:54.639> this<00:03:54.790> gets<00:03:55.030> into<00:03:55.299> my<00:03:55.840> eyes

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
some reason when this gets into my eyes

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.699 
some reason when this gets into my eyes
in<00:03:57.370> any<00:03:57.940> type<00:03:58.239> of<00:03:58.269> quantity<00:03:58.959> it<00:03:59.169> makes<00:03:59.470> my<00:03:59.680> eyes

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
in any type of quantity it makes my eyes

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.390 
in any type of quantity it makes my eyes
burn<00:04:00.280> really<00:04:01.090> really<00:04:01.510> bad<00:04:02.049> and<00:04:02.409> I<00:04:02.739> haven't

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
burn really really bad and I haven't

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.059 
burn really really bad and I haven't
found<00:04:03.639> that<00:04:03.790> within<00:04:04.030> ours<00:04:04.299> at<00:04:04.569> all<00:04:04.750> so<00:04:05.620> I<00:04:05.650> am

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
found that within ours at all so I am

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.430 
found that within ours at all so I am
very<00:04:06.099> careful<00:04:06.579> with<00:04:06.849> the<00:04:06.970> bioderma<00:04:07.449> um<00:04:07.810> I<00:04:08.199> do

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440
