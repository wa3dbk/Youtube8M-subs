you've been keeping track like I have we
have<00:00:08.940> had<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.210> large<00:00:09.570> uptick<00:00:10.170> and<00:00:10.410> meteors

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
have had a large uptick and meteors

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.700 
have had a large uptick and meteors
meteorites<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:12.090> fireballs<00:00:12.179> in<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.230> last<00:00:13.500> two

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
meteorites and fireballs in the last two

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.930 
meteorites and fireballs in the last two
years<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.250> number<00:00:14.460> has<00:00:14.730> gone<00:00:14.880> up

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
years the number has gone up

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.210 
years the number has gone up
exponentially<00:00:15.599> now<00:00:16.139> several<00:00:16.650> people<00:00:17.039> will

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
exponentially now several people will

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.640 
exponentially now several people will
point<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.060> fact<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.449> our<00:00:18.840> cameras<00:00:19.500> have

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
point to the fact that our cameras have

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.380 
point to the fact that our cameras have
gotten<00:00:19.890> better<00:00:20.070> technologies<00:00:20.880> gotten<00:00:21.240> better

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
gotten better technologies gotten better

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.990 
gotten better technologies gotten better
so<00:00:21.810> somehow<00:00:22.080> in<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.769> last<00:00:22.980> two<00:00:23.160> years<00:00:23.189> better

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
so somehow in the last two years better

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.779 
so somehow in the last two years better
cameras<00:00:24.570> have<00:00:24.840> caused<00:00:25.470> us<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.949> see<00:00:26.189> fireballs

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
cameras have caused us to see fireballs

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.540 
cameras have caused us to see fireballs
in<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.029> sky<00:00:27.090> with<00:00:27.869> our<00:00:28.019> eyes<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.800> um<00:00:29.099> caused

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
in the sky with our eyes and um caused

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.700 
in the sky with our eyes and um caused
it<00:00:29.820> 2,000%<00:00:30.599> uptick<00:00:31.080> in<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.289> last<00:00:31.500> few<00:00:31.650> years

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
it 2,000% uptick in the last few years

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.650 
it 2,000% uptick in the last few years

seem<00:00:35.730> like<00:00:35.880> anything<00:00:36.090> in<00:00:36.270> our<00:00:36.329> society<00:00:36.780> makes

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
seem like anything in our society makes

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.720 
seem like anything in our society makes
me<00:00:37.110> damned<00:00:37.380> since<00:00:37.680> anymore<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.550> I'm<00:00:38.640> gonna

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
me damned since anymore so I'm gonna

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.369 
me damned since anymore so I'm gonna
throw<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> theory<00:00:39.329> out<00:00:39.360> there<00:00:39.480> it's<00:00:40.050> just<00:00:40.290> a

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
throw a theory out there it's just a

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.990 
throw a theory out there it's just a
theory<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:41.100> can<00:00:41.219> debunk<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.700> all<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:41.969> want

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
theory you can debunk it all you want

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.510 
theory you can debunk it all you want
baby<00:00:42.360> but<00:00:42.809> I'm<00:00:43.140> guessing<00:00:43.649> maybe<00:00:44.070> it's<00:00:44.340> the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
baby but I'm guessing maybe it's the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.389 
baby but I'm guessing maybe it's the
alignment<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.510> co<00:00:45.930> orbits<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.620> Ceres<00:00:47.370> and

large<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.390> super-sized<00:01:48.869> some<00:01:49.259> are<00:01:49.380> very

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
large and super-sized some are very

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.889 
large and super-sized some are very
small<00:01:49.860> less<00:01:50.460> than<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.700> mile<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.390> someone<00:01:51.720> quite

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
small less than a mile is someone quite

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.170 
small less than a mile is someone quite
large<00:01:52.170> like<00:01:52.799> Sarah's<00:01:53.310> which<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.000> about

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
large like Sarah's which is about

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.719 
large like Sarah's which is about
one-quarter<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.780> size<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:55.320> our<00:01:55.380> moon<00:01:55.649> well<00:01:56.189> so

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
one-quarter the size of our moon well so

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.249 
one-quarter the size of our moon well so
I'm<00:01:56.880> gonna<00:01:57.000> go<00:01:57.090> ahead<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.270> guessed<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.810> if<00:01:57.990> we

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
I'm gonna go ahead and guessed it if we

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.590 
I'm gonna go ahead and guessed it if we
look<00:01:58.380> at<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.619> orbits<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.189> Sarah's<00:01:59.670> invested

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
look at the orbits of Sarah's invested

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.179 
look at the orbits of Sarah's invested
with<00:02:00.750> them<00:02:00.899> almost<00:02:01.079> being<00:02:01.409> side<00:02:01.740> by<00:02:01.920> side

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
with them almost being side by side

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.580 
with them almost being side by side
together<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.540> Sarah's<00:02:03.960> investor<00:02:04.439> are

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
together so Sarah's investor are

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.260 
together so Sarah's investor are
knocking<00:02:05.070> crap<00:02:05.310> out<00:02:05.549> or<00:02:05.729> they<00:02:05.790> are<00:02:05.880> like<00:02:06.030> two

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
knocking crap out or they are like two

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.789 
knocking crap out or they are like two
bowling<00:02:06.509> balls<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.320> part<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.770> reason

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
bowling balls and part of the reason

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.070 
bowling balls and part of the reason
that<00:02:08.039> Ceres<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:08.789> Vesta<00:02:08.970> were<00:02:09.660> not<00:02:09.869> made

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
that Ceres and Vesta were not made

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.070 
that Ceres and Vesta were not made
planets<00:02:10.619> when<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.190> IAU<00:02:11.879> science<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:12.900> not

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
planets when the IAU science you not

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.850 
planets when the IAU science you not
make<00:02:13.230> them<00:02:13.349> planets

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
make them planets

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.250 
make them planets
after<00:02:14.100> consideration<00:02:14.580> in<00:02:14.820> 2006<00:02:15.600> is<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:16.020> fact

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
after consideration in 2006 is the fact

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.620 
after consideration in 2006 is the fact
that<00:02:16.380> they<00:02:16.740> hadn't<00:02:17.070> cleared<00:02:17.610> their<00:02:17.940> orbit<00:02:18.390> now

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
that they hadn't cleared their orbit now

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.720 
that they hadn't cleared their orbit now
clearing<00:02:19.260> your<00:02:19.350> orbit<00:02:19.710> is<00:02:19.860> really<00:02:20.310> kind<00:02:20.580> of

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
clearing your orbit is really kind of

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.520 
clearing your orbit is really kind of
bogus<00:02:20.940> because<00:02:21.510> if<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.900> earth<00:02:21.990> keeps<00:02:22.230> getting

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
bogus because if the earth keeps getting

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.080 
bogus because if the earth keeps getting
hit<00:02:22.680> with<00:02:22.770> crap<00:02:23.070> is<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.490> can<00:02:23.670> we<00:02:23.760> really<00:02:24.000> say

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
hit with crap is it can we really say

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.270 
hit with crap is it can we really say
that<00:02:24.420> we've<00:02:24.570> cleared<00:02:24.750> all<00:02:24.990> our<00:02:25.320> orbit<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.100> mean

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
that we've cleared all our orbit I mean

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.760 
that we've cleared all our orbit I mean
you're<00:02:26.700> ever<00:02:26.880> really<00:02:27.300> clear<00:02:27.660> in<00:02:27.780> orbit<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.290> know

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
you're ever really clear in orbit I know

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.820 
you're ever really clear in orbit I know
so<00:02:29.250> I'm<00:02:29.580> proposing<00:02:30.240> that<00:02:30.270> I'm<00:02:30.750> saying<00:02:31.200> due<00:02:31.710> to

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
so I'm proposing that I'm saying due to

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.710 
so I'm proposing that I'm saying due to
the<00:02:31.920> orbits<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.400> Ceres<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:32.760> Vesta<00:02:32.910> side<00:02:33.540> by

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
the orbits of Ceres and Vesta side by

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.410 
the orbits of Ceres and Vesta side by
side<00:02:33.990> they<00:02:34.590> are<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.950> ones<00:02:35.100> knocking<00:02:35.910> crap<00:02:36.150> out

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
side they are the ones knocking crap out

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.180 
side they are the ones knocking crap out
of<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.600> asteroid<00:02:37.020> belt<00:02:37.050> cuz<00:02:37.620> they're<00:02:37.890> in<00:02:38.070> the

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
of the asteroid belt cuz they're in the

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.940 
of the asteroid belt cuz they're in the
process<00:02:38.520> of<00:02:39.180> clearing<00:02:39.510> their<00:02:39.810> orbit<00:02:40.230> um<00:02:40.410> I

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
process of clearing their orbit um I

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.850 
process of clearing their orbit um I
know<00:02:41.220> nASA<00:02:41.490> has<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.790> lot<00:02:42.030> of<00:02:42.060> highfalutin<00:02:43.050> fancy

in<00:03:54.720> diameter<00:03:54.900> though<00:03:55.470> I<00:03:55.500> would<00:03:55.920> guess<00:03:56.130> that

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
in diameter though I would guess that

in diameter though I would guess that
Sarah's<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:56.970> size<00:03:57.239> here<00:03:58.140> is<00:03:58.380> an<00:03:58.560> estimation

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
Sarah's the size here is an estimation

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.830 
Sarah's the size here is an estimation
considering<00:03:59.850> we<00:04:00.030> haven't<00:04:00.239> gotten<00:04:00.570> a<00:04:00.690> new

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
considering we haven't gotten a new

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.140 
considering we haven't gotten a new
photograph<00:04:01.320> of<00:04:01.500> it<00:04:01.650> in<00:04:01.799> nine<00:04:02.010> years<00:04:02.250> but<00:04:03.030> we

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
photograph of it in nine years but we

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.449 
photograph of it in nine years but we
covered<00:04:03.450> that<00:04:03.480> in<00:04:03.630> the<00:04:03.959> other<00:04:04.170> video<00:04:04.560> so<00:04:05.340> yeah

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
covered that in the other video so yeah

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.840 
covered that in the other video so yeah
that's<00:04:05.610> just<00:04:05.880> it<00:04:06.060> that's<00:04:06.299> my<00:04:06.450> guess<00:04:06.530> that

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
that's just it that's my guess that

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.940 
that's just it that's my guess that
these<00:04:08.850> two<00:04:09.150> giant<00:04:09.720> planetoids<00:04:10.380> are<00:04:10.500> coming

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
these two giant planetoids are coming

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.350 
these two giant planetoids are coming
around<00:04:11.130> the<00:04:11.340> bend<00:04:11.579> coming<00:04:12.090> around<00:04:12.209> the

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
around the bend coming around the

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.270 
around the bend coming around the
mountain<00:04:12.390> if<00:04:12.780> you<00:04:12.900> will<00:04:13.079> together<00:04:13.440> side<00:04:14.250> by

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
mountain if you will together side by

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.490 
mountain if you will together side by
side<00:04:14.820> and<00:04:15.209> there's<00:04:15.390> a<00:04:15.480> chance<00:04:15.510> maybe<00:04:16.019> they're

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
side and there's a chance maybe they're

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.580 
side and there's a chance maybe they're
knocking<00:04:16.859> crap<00:04:17.220> out<00:04:17.430> and<00:04:17.640> one<00:04:17.940> of<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.090> reasons

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
knocking crap out and one of the reasons

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.140 
knocking crap out and one of the reasons
and<00:04:19.590> one<00:04:19.859> thing<00:04:20.070> that<00:04:20.100> makes<00:04:20.370> me<00:04:20.459> think<00:04:20.790> I<00:04:20.910> may

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
and one thing that makes me think I may

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.270 
and one thing that makes me think I may
have<00:04:21.180> hit<00:04:21.479> a<00:04:21.510> hot<00:04:21.810> button<00:04:22.080> here<00:04:22.500> is<00:04:22.650> that<00:04:22.979> one

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
have hit a hot button here is that one

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.310 
have hit a hot button here is that one
of<00:04:23.340> the<00:04:23.430> reason<00:04:23.729> the<00:04:23.970> Dawn<00:04:24.210> spacecraft<00:04:24.320> was

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
of the reason the Dawn spacecraft was

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.650 
of the reason the Dawn spacecraft was
first<00:04:25.620> sent<00:04:26.160> to<00:04:26.430> Vesta<00:04:27.150> and

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
first sent to Vesta and

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.460 
first sent to Vesta and
and<00:04:27.720> will<00:04:27.840> be<00:04:27.960> sent<00:04:28.230> to<00:04:28.440> sarahs<00:04:29.130> in<00:04:29.310> 2015<00:04:30.180> is

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
and will be sent to sarahs in 2015 is

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.560 
and will be sent to sarahs in 2015 is
scientists<00:04:31.470> wanted<00:04:32.190> to<00:04:32.370> get<00:04:32.520> vestas<00:04:33.180> exact

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
scientists wanted to get vestas exact

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.080 
scientists wanted to get vestas exact
mass<00:04:33.870> so<00:04:34.500> they<00:04:34.620> can<00:04:34.770> study<00:04:35.090> gravitational

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
mass so they can study gravitational

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.420 
mass so they can study gravitational
interactions<00:04:36.900> better<00:04:37.230> so<00:04:37.560> that<00:04:37.590> scientists

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
interactions better so that scientists

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.640 
interactions better so that scientists
could<00:04:38.580> refine<00:04:39.000> the<00:04:39.510> mass<00:04:39.780> estimates<00:04:40.350> of

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
could refine the mass estimates of

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.310 
could refine the mass estimates of
asteroids<00:04:41.340> that<00:04:41.460> are<00:04:41.610> in<00:04:41.790> term<00:04:42.090> perturbed<00:04:42.990> by

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
asteroids that are in term perturbed by

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.200 
asteroids that are in term perturbed by
Vesta<00:04:43.830> and<00:04:43.860> Ceres<00:04:44.070> so<00:04:44.730> part<00:04:44.970> of<00:04:45.030> the<00:04:45.090> main

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
Vesta and Ceres so part of the main

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.700 
Vesta and Ceres so part of the main
mission<00:04:45.600> that<00:04:45.690> they<00:04:45.840> sent<00:04:46.080> down<00:04:46.290> over<00:04:46.620> there

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
mission that they sent down over there

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.400 
mission that they sent down over there
for<00:04:46.980> is<00:04:47.190> to<00:04:47.250> see<00:04:47.820> on<00:04:48.090> what<00:04:48.450> level<00:04:48.660> and<00:04:49.050> what

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
for is to see on what level and what

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.070 
for is to see on what level and what
scope<00:04:49.770> that<00:04:50.130> series<00:04:50.700> ambassador<00:04:51.570> would<00:04:51.870> be

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
scope that series ambassador would be

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.770 
scope that series ambassador would be
disrupting<00:04:52.860> the<00:04:53.010> asteroid<00:04:53.430> belt<00:04:53.460> so<00:04:54.000> NASA<00:04:54.450> was

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
disrupting the asteroid belt so NASA was

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.270 
disrupting the asteroid belt so NASA was
kind<00:04:54.960> of<00:04:55.020> worried<00:04:55.290> about<00:04:55.380> these<00:04:55.680> two<00:04:55.890> large

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
kind of worried about these two large

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.700 
kind of worried about these two large
solar<00:04:56.640> bodies<00:04:57.170> disrupting<00:04:58.170> stuff<00:04:58.470> in<00:04:58.590> the

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
solar bodies disrupting stuff in the

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.770 
solar bodies disrupting stuff in the
asteroid<00:04:59.040> belt<00:04:59.070> well<00:04:59.550> then<00:04:59.910> that's<00:05:00.120> that's<00:05:00.390> a

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
asteroid belt well then that's that's a

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.690 
asteroid belt well then that's that's a
good<00:05:00.930> reason<00:05:01.080> to<00:05:01.320> think<00:05:01.470> that<00:05:01.590> hey<00:05:01.890> maybe<00:05:02.160> they

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
good reason to think that hey maybe they

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.400 
good reason to think that hey maybe they
are<00:05:02.910> disrupting<00:05:03.570> stuff<00:05:03.810> from<00:05:03.930> the<00:05:04.110> asteroid

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
are disrupting stuff from the asteroid

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.590 
are disrupting stuff from the asteroid
belt<00:05:04.530> now<00:05:05.040> this<00:05:05.460> is<00:05:05.640> way<00:05:05.820> less<00:05:06.030> do<00:05:06.300> me<00:05:06.450> than<00:05:06.570> a

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
belt now this is way less do me than a

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.510 
belt now this is way less do me than a
planet<00:05:06.990> x<00:05:07.140> scenario<00:05:07.650> it<00:05:07.890> just<00:05:08.250> means<00:05:08.400> that

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
planet x scenario it just means that

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.130 
planet x scenario it just means that
these<00:05:08.820> two<00:05:09.030> planets<00:05:09.420> women<00:05:09.870> who<00:05:09.930> aren't

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
these two planets women who aren't

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.450 
these two planets women who aren't
getting<00:05:10.410> enough<00:05:10.500> attention<00:05:10.710> we're<00:05:11.280> gonna<00:05:11.370> be

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
getting enough attention we're gonna be

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.890 
getting enough attention we're gonna be
causing<00:05:12.030> a<00:05:12.060> little<00:05:12.210> bit<00:05:12.300> of<00:05:12.330> trouble<00:05:12.480> here<00:05:12.690> on
