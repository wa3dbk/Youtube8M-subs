00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.420
 this is the worst of a good cv sure 90 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.740
 the arpeggio is both the beginning of the song 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.079
 here that at the end 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:12.679
 sound 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.610
 the introduction as shown on the paper in the guitars newspaper 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.150
 but remhq 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.530
 the peugeot itself has two final notes which then allow for solar 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.560
 in a cyclical way the arpeggio also because it has a very long finish 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.169
 on the disc and this peugeot just repeated with additional notes 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.900
 this the introduction 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.500
 lumsa anna mi 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.230

 login 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.250
 center 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.550
 changing the guitar involves giving thanks to the instrument store 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.820
 musical ciampi di roma 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.380
 it has also become the first official store use in Europe 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.700
 because as a supplier of xon epiphone he kindly granted us 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.550
 the use of the epiphone casino because we used in the examples 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.810
 previous 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.810
 this is michelle's intro also this is 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.210
 nitro particularly difficult to understand in the transcription phase 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.890
 because there is certainly after 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.370
 the initial guitar dinner, certainly another one probably in trial 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:24.180
 also a bass 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.859
 however there are more tools 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:28.740
 the part let's say a sum 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.090
 of the two of the two of the two guitars that are heard 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.090
 re to try to make 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.420
 if we say sexi we want solar alone this part this can be a good one 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.340
 way to get closer to the 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.340
 to the total 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.820
 rate 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.079
 beautiful phrases sushiko siw 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.140
 another one of those 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.299
 me things 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.190
 details giving guitarist of giorgieri solo 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.579
 which are all very strange parts other leaders is earl skillfully 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:11.249
 they would not have played 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:15.689
 eheheh sonata happy cordi on the lower part of the guitar then also in 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:18.689
 this room its bar its particularity 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:23.429
 huh 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:28.339
 huh 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:34.119
 the only non-original song I wrote a copy of the name carlo 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:38.549
 Russian tilde unique passage of the musical examples we propose 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.879
 played with the classical guitar is one of the parts 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.000
 by far the most complex cage photo george harrison 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.130
 rather difficult to understand and with a couple of very interesting elements 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.130
 inside such as the closing agreement 

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:58.289
 cute immediately before the song in fa and there is a fa sharp seventh has more than one 

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:00.209
 typical agreement with the sonata position 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.919
 reads the mind from the gessisti 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:06.849
 this also shows how the different influences sooo days only had 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.569
 then had a fairly profound impact 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.209
 fun 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.509
 not 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:16.509
 not 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.739
 this is the same as his part.

 the second example from sergent pepper is the fixed forum solo 

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:59.159

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:03.599
