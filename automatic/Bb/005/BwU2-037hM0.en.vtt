hi<00:01:04.339> in<00:01:05.089> this<00:01:05.329> video<00:01:05.540> I'm<00:01:05.810> going<00:01:05.990> to<00:01:06.079> talk<00:01:06.170> a

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
hi in this video I'm going to talk a

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.819 
hi in this video I'm going to talk a
little<00:01:06.590> bit<00:01:06.770> about<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:07.369> a<00:01:07.399> minor<00:01:07.909> blues<00:01:08.829> I'm

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:09.829 
little bit about the a minor blues I'm

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:11.590 
little bit about the a minor blues I'm
going<00:01:10.040> to<00:01:10.159> start<00:01:10.430> with<00:01:10.670> a<00:01:10.729> basic<00:01:11.119> set<00:01:11.540> of

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
going to start with a basic set of

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.380 
going to start with a basic set of
chords<00:01:12.140> it'll<00:01:12.979> be<00:01:13.130> a<00:01:13.159> 12<00:01:13.549> bar<00:01:13.759> chord

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
chords it'll be a 12 bar chord

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.780 
chords it'll be a 12 bar chord
progression<00:01:14.900> and<00:01:15.049> then<00:01:15.860> we'll<00:01:16.190> develop<00:01:16.490> the

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
progression and then we'll develop the

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.000 
progression and then we'll develop the
progression<00:01:17.299> by<00:01:17.780> adding<00:01:18.170> in<00:01:18.260> some<00:01:18.290> bass<00:01:18.680> notes

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
progression by adding in some bass notes

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.800 
progression by adding in some bass notes
and<00:01:19.310> this<00:01:19.400> will<00:01:19.549> create<00:01:19.670> like<00:01:19.970> a<00:01:20.000> walking<00:01:20.570> bass

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
and this will create like a walking bass

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.260 
and this will create like a walking bass
type<00:01:21.260> of<00:01:21.440> effect<00:01:21.770> and<00:01:22.040> that<00:01:22.150> can<00:01:23.150> be<00:01:23.180> very

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
type of effect and that can be very

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.100 
type of effect and that can be very
useful<00:01:23.510> if<00:01:24.229> you're<00:01:24.350> working<00:01:24.560> in<00:01:24.860> say<00:01:25.130> a<00:01:25.159> Jew

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110

blues<00:01:55.070> in<00:01:55.759> a<00:01:56.420> major<00:01:56.750> we'd<00:01:57.229> have<00:01:57.350> four<00:01:57.650> bars<00:01:57.890> of

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
blues in a major we'd have four bars of

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:05.140 
blues in a major we'd have four bars of
a<00:01:58.990> two<00:01:59.990> bars<00:02:00.229> of<00:02:00.409> d<00:02:01.450> two<00:02:02.450> bars<00:02:02.720> of<00:02:02.869> a<00:02:03.909> two<00:02:04.909> bars

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
a two bars of d two bars of a two bars

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:13.210 
a two bars of d two bars of a two bars
of<00:02:05.390> E<00:02:05.630> and<00:02:06.130> then<00:02:07.130> back<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:07.490> two<00:02:07.700> bars<00:02:07.939> of<00:02:08.119> a

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.160 

now<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.280> convert<00:02:14.819> that<00:02:15.030> progression<00:02:15.480> over<00:02:15.959> to

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
now to convert that progression over to

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.670 
now to convert that progression over to
the<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.470> minor<00:02:17.160> blues<00:02:18.150> chord<00:02:18.599> progression<00:02:19.140> all

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
the a minor blues chord progression all

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.979 
the a minor blues chord progression all
I'm<00:02:19.830> going<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.160> do<00:02:20.340> is<00:02:20.640> change<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.300> chords

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
I'm going to do is change the a chords

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.200 
I'm going to do is change the a chords
into<00:02:22.319> a<00:02:22.349> minor

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.330 

so<00:02:26.870> that<00:02:27.020> means<00:02:27.260> our<00:02:27.440> chord<00:02:27.710> progression<00:02:28.190> will

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
so that means our chord progression will

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.200 
so that means our chord progression will
be<00:02:28.460> four<00:02:28.730> bars<00:02:29.000> of<00:02:29.240> a<00:02:29.420> minor<00:02:30.850> then<00:02:31.850> I'm<00:02:32.000> going

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
be four bars of a minor then I'm going

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:39.000 
be four bars of a minor then I'm going
to<00:02:32.330> change<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:33.260> D<00:02:33.830> chords<00:02:34.340> into<00:02:34.700> D<00:02:34.880> minor

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.449 

two<00:02:39.700> bars<00:02:39.939> of<00:02:40.120> d<00:02:40.420> minor<00:02:40.750> then<00:02:41.680> back<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.220> two

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
two bars of d minor then back to two

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:48.230 
two bars of d minor then back to two
bars<00:02:42.700> of<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.329> minor

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.720 

the<00:02:49.240> E<00:02:49.510> major<00:02:49.840> chords<00:02:50.500> I'm<00:02:50.740> going<00:02:51.250> to<00:02:51.400> change

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
the E major chords I'm going to change

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.809 
the E major chords I'm going to change
to<00:02:52.000> e7

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.250 

so<00:02:55.480> that<00:02:55.659> will<00:02:55.810> be<00:02:55.900> two<00:02:56.140> bars<00:02:56.379> of<00:02:56.560> e<00:02:56.709> seventh

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
so that will be two bars of e seventh

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.530 
so that will be two bars of e seventh
then<00:02:59.260> coming<00:03:00.010> back<00:03:00.040> to<00:03:00.459> finish<00:03:00.609> on<00:03:00.969> two<00:03:01.299> bars

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
then coming back to finish on two bars

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.660 
then coming back to finish on two bars
of<00:03:01.719> a<00:03:01.870> minor

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.250 

so<00:03:06.670> that's<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.240> progression<00:03:07.810> you'll<00:03:07.930> see<00:03:08.140> in

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
so that's the progression you'll see in

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.559 
so that's the progression you'll see in
front<00:03:08.440> of<00:03:08.560> you<00:03:08.620> on<00:03:08.800> the<00:03:08.920> screen<00:03:09.150> four<00:03:10.150> bars<00:03:10.390> of

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
two bars of a minor and here's how the a

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.710 
two bars of a minor and here's how the a
minor<00:03:20.140> blues<00:03:20.470> chord<00:03:20.980> progression<00:03:21.520> sounds<00:03:22.030> one

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
minor blues chord progression sounds one

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:34.140

two<00:03:23.319> three<00:03:23.650> four

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.160 

Damon

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:46.369 

I'm

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:58.690 

I

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.940 

the<00:03:59.700> next<00:04:00.000> step<00:04:00.180> is<00:04:00.450> to<00:04:00.510> spice<00:04:00.990> up<00:04:01.020> that<00:04:01.440> basic

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
the next step is to spice up that basic

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.440 
the next step is to spice up that basic
chord<00:04:02.220> progression<00:04:02.790> with<00:04:03.030> a<00:04:03.060> few<00:04:03.360> little
