00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.940
 hello to all and sarenza that can be learned 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.009
 as today we are going 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.420
 focus on the online drop a lot 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.730
 asked me the question how do you do to 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.380
 whenever a drop and admire in 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.480
 line is she is really 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.670
 the interest of this right for me if you 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.199
 can see so in snap units 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.240
 again I took just 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.680
 several brands we see a little bit 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.330
 all races so the medivac loaded 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.920
 the transfer prism changed I took 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.500
 several over to show you a 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.090
 little bit obviously a no nicer 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.550
 right just what are you going to be very 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.110
 simple with a nice idea it takes 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.180
 know how to manage it by confers a doubt 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.219
 in the opposing base so it's very 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.840
 healthy to have the concept of following 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.700
 then we will take the conventional media 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.059
 so it's loaded no end if you 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.309
 want to drop and your units a way 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.050
 classic complete not here you have 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.760
 so your shortcut your shortcut 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.710
 keyboard cd you click on your page 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.589
 pressed on tracks pressed on 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.229
 so that's classic or move hockey 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.360
 mom &amp; stop we want loads and we 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.740
 press on that we do that we click 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.729
 on our medivacs and his small discharge 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.869
 little advice if you want to 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.360
 stop fully in full charge 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.159
 unloading the punishment is and at 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.229
 final our last nick and we did not 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.479
 been unloaded so if for example you 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.530
 you have drop and three units you 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.689
 do not see this is not the right moment 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.700

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.049

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.619
 little advice in the council 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.090
 goodbye so go trampoline 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.890

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.350
 when pressing on echoes click on 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.750
 the imac sa discharge so always the same 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.590

 imagine we want to drop and online 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.399

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.350
 the medivac loads online everything 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.210
 simply up to his point 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.500

 out of 7 out of 7 shock 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.940
 we always arrive with this famous 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.570
 merrimack we're going in cop behind and 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.120
 are entitled online until the end and you 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.860
 can continue to guide your your 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.480
 your medivacs there is no problem 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.620
 you do not necessarily have to let go 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.240
 the arms are classified that is to say we 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.580
 press on medivacs you can 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.540
 do we can make clear what 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.890
 we want an ace 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.210
 practice what you want is everything 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.110
 possible here for the online drop 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.250
 alone now it does not work there are 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.360
 for the transfer prism for those 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.610
 who are asking the question ie 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.209
 that here we press on and that makes 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.980
 exactly the same thing now the 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.260
 the main interest is located at the corner 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.209
 is it internal or glass 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.870
 for example on a place it's from 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.760
 just manage this right guru in the 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.770
 base well online to avoid the storm 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.390
 it is the interest of May 2, for example, 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.510
 grand prize has emptied all the ancestors 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.740
 which could be very badly mines 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.720
 everything that will really be able to by very 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.450
 very clever a classic drop that would 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.190
 package so you really interest it from 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.310
 this famous opening when we're not going on 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.200
 so go look for a cave that 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.600
 you spoke in this case 6 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.500
 we're not going to stay pack 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.100
 like that it's still pretty 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.050
 cool tube 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.690
 so when you are going to want to drop and 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:26.400
 to make it easy for you space 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.360
 is a little bit we select we go 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.950
 and you will arrive in the base 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.940
 adverse 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.989
 we press each time and we 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.019
 select all over to go 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.400
 search each time the drop online 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.530
 and behind that you avoid a lady 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.100
 disabled all the stands in the 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.330
 short teeth avoid tupac and who would 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.160
 still a little disastrous if 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.940
 Well, here we go, please keep it 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.980
