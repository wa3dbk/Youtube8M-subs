to<00:00:57.930> upgrade<00:00:58.440> my<00:00:58.680> air<00:00:58.949> defence<00:00:59.340> was<00:00:59.699> level<00:01:00.149> 23

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
to upgrade my air defence was level 23

waste<00:01:03.660> hours<00:01:03.960> everything<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.530> underdeveloped

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
waste hours everything is underdeveloped

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.370 
waste hours everything is underdeveloped
but<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.060> was<00:01:06.150> my<00:01:06.299> strategy<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.990> max<00:01:07.200> out

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
but that was my strategy to max out

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.890 
but that was my strategy to max out
walls<00:01:07.680> as<00:01:07.950> soon<00:01:08.100> as<00:01:08.220> possible<00:01:08.729> jump<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.840> the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
walls as soon as possible jump to the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.230 
walls as soon as possible jump to the
next<00:01:09.960> town<00:01:10.290> hall<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.799> then<00:01:11.430> upgrade<00:01:11.909> all<00:01:12.119> of

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
next town hall and then upgrade all of

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.300 
next town hall and then upgrade all of
my<00:01:12.360> weapons<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.439> reached<00:01:13.830> on<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.100> whole
