00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.099
 very good and every time and this and who 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.289
 it's about the stone guard for 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:22.560
 this combat is necessary two tanks 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.270
 between 2 and 3 hillers and 56 pesos 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.060
 depending on how much giles we are going to 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.310
 wear 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.320
 This combat is mostly tanks 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.580
 they have to be super attentive to 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.579
 change them so that we can 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.410
 survive are four dogs but 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.480
 there will always be three so it goes 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.660
 depending on the week maybe one 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.910
 of amethyst fourth and jade and the week 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.640
 that comes out the cobalt a jade and 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.680
 jasper one thing to be clear is that the 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.620
 tanks have to be separated 12 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.530
 meters that 's always a brush tank 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.409
 aa two dogs one of them lit up and 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.930
 the other inactive and the other tank is 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:02.869
 catch what is left practically 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.210
 will not do anything a tank always stays 

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:07.310
 with the dog lit and with another dog 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.170
 more and the second tank will stay with 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.979
 the dog that is now that will only do 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.780
 hurt 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.330
 the enlightened dog always has to 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.790
 be next to another dog so when 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.460
 reach the maximum energy will explode 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.590
 doing little damage to be illuminated if 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.290
 by chance he has the tank of two 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.630
 dogs nothing happens but if the dog 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.640
 illuminated is the dog that is alone 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.780
 tanks should change it so that it is 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.060
 accompanied the lit and other 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.159
 in this fight there are always going to be two 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.979
 active dogs that is two dogs 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.470
 generating energy therefore the tank 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.210
 one has to make a change 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.119
 tank one will stay with the dog 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.830
 lit up and will change the second dog the 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.170
 that is not shining for his 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.290
 inactive partner when you have 40 of 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.690
 energy if you do not do this will burst the 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.850
 Illuminated dog that will hardly hurt 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.260
 the root but broken but surely not 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.540
 mate 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.760
 is the most important thing that the 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.310
 tanks in all the combat to part of 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.470
 dodge areas and such the castells and 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.310
 giles will have to be super attentive to 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.170
 the purple areas or ice chains 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.990
 amethyst keeper leaves a puddle of 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.360
 the shadows move away and point if the 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.640
 Illuminated dog is from the amethyst 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.650
 puddles will hardly hurt us the 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.690
 guardian of spread leaves a kind of 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.420
 big blue area that if we stay 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.880
 inside will come a crystal that will make us 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.520
 a lot of damage and above we will leave a nova 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.650
 what is this fight bleu and if I tell you 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.450
 that normally once you have a nova 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.660
 puts a puddle of amethyst for you 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.790
 bother better eat us one but it's 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.190
 the guardian of cobalt is illuminated 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.380
 we must eat the cobalt mines 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.240
 you will understand me when you are in front 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.180
 of the boss and the whole saga is full of 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.610
 cobalt mines that yes once perhaps 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.040
 the mine is gone 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.250
 jade guardian this hurts 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.710
 of nature and is inevitable and guardian 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.320
 from jasper the jasper chains are a 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.450
 absolute delicate we have to join 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.970
 quickly that we bet the chains 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.310
 from normal located at a hitler to a 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.440
 castell will join who have the 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.050
 another string for example if it is a psm 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.390
 l If'm two caster as we board and 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.450
 two is even simpler but above all 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.670
 that be very fast the time it lasts 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.860
 we will have to be united with that person 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.650
 and everywhere we go we will go 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.020
 we with them but we will have 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.110
 tics of 90 houses that surely we 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.209
 kill in a few seconds and once this 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.580
 dog is illuminated we will take advantage of 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.550
 separate for 15 seconds and 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.010
 eliminate the chains is received little damage 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.170
 and it's easy to heal and that's all 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.060
 have more stories of you I tell you 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.650
 how would we do it if the worst came out 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.349
 combination 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.819
 tank 1 seville 2 dogs and tank 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.220
 2 a dog 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.260
 tank 1 is with one illuminated and another 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.540
 inactive and the other tank with a dog 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.939
 we will all dodge the areas that 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.950
 they are coming out on the ground and we will go 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:08.530
 advancing up the opposite stairs 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.930
 once we get there we will return little to 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.030
 little where we started like that we get 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.609
 have more space in the room and be more 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.739
 to taste the vÃ©lez we throw it nothing else 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:19.870
 start well we take advantage that the room 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.900
 is clean and some can be put on 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.460
 turret mode to give the boss tab 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.010
 while if for example it is illuminated 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.229
 the boss of the cobalt will go getting 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.840
 in the blue areas with crystals for 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:34.389
 remove the deer illuminated in the 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.070
 amethyst we will simply pass then only 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:38.530
 we will receive less damage but not 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.229
 we will eliminate the purple areas and if 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:44.050
 the chains come out we do not move away to 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:45.639
 to be able to get rid of this again 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.680
 only when the guardian of that 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.500
 active skill not before because if not 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.389
 we will die and even the tanks are going 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.400
 changing depending on the needs 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.830
 of the boss if he has to be alone 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.810
 accompanied and a lot of eye simply 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.150
 the sketching phase and you will fall fast 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.550
 I hope you have served us all if 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.860
 you have doubts, you know, do not doubt 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.660
 ask it you give the ai that 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.160
 favorites and subscribe to the 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.160
