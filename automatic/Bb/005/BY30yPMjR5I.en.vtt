00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.910

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.380

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.620
 of the face and this area than the lateral 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:39.000
 the light to this area I will use 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:44.160
 a shadow that beige shadow of the trio of 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.510
 chocolate shadows qix let's open 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:52.739
 here I'll pick up with the same brush 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:56.100
 from here in this hopscotch a tone 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:00.180
 half beige and we will pass the time 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.660
 here on top of the apple is fine 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.220
 so to give a legal and enlightened 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.250
 now you 're going to make a neighbor go to 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:13.619
 Hey, that's it. 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.530
 Good, I'm going to the eye now. 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.110
 I'll use that pencil first. 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.619
 silver shadow 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:25.740
 Let's go through all this region here. 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:31.979
 people or that part here that is 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:34.070
 making a circle come to that other 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.070
 side 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:44.130
 to fix this shadow that we make the 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:47.250
 Pozinho picks up the powder with his finger and 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:53.940
 then you spread throughout the region 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:55.560
 You passed the shade this way. 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.150
 team in this part 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.330
 I go to the black pencil eyeliner pencil 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:06.229
 black saw my people 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:12.380
 so the bike that I'm going to do here picks up 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:17.370
 this rate that is so close to the eyelashes 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:19.410
 Pass here and I'll throw up 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:27.270
 I do it this way even though I go 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:32.150
 it's so foggy south march 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:36.060
 well, practice is coming back to that 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.660
 smoky good now I 'm going to this shadow 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:43.050
 black brush passing here in the shade 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.700
 precisely to correct this match 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.190
 I had to be past what I went through 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.900
 with black eyeliner pencil 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.130
 so we'll pass your only bug 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.940
 take the excess here in hand but so 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.940
 What am I going on here? 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:05.650
 Do you give a disguise or going through this 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:09.680
 region here 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:14.000
 And you better get a pencil too. 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:19.190
 black eyeliner and go down here 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:23.900
 to get darker your wolf will not 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:27.370
 here it goes down so sweet well 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.370
 to the eyelashes actually 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:35.350
 if you want until last month with finger 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:37.960
 can mass O who stayed here so 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:44.180
 that looks the difference was very good 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:47.120
 here the black eye neither rocks 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.640
 Well I ''m' looking here this here not 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:56.140
 It's so smoky so pick up the brush. 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:59.000
 and we will force more ta smoke for the 2 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.760
 Be in peace 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.540
 now I think it gave a 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.410
 two nÃ© gave me equal good ends the 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.550
 eye 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:17.239
 I'll just pass the stretching mask to 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:21.010
 to stretch my eyelashes 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:25.580
 jeitinho signs up to a freak show and here 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:30.430
 well at the beginning of the eyelashes here at the root and 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.430
 I get up and go the other way 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.950
 I do the same thing mine 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:49.340
 now I've finished my eye 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:51.770
 I will then get a lip gloss with 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.810
 Law even because this one is the pepper has 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:05:02.090
 a special taste 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:06.640
 I'll go just to give a final touch to the 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.640
 to command a fair sidewalk the difference 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.220
 and now it's ready 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:19.620
 your eye is overrated 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.620
 You're beautiful, ready with a rock show.
