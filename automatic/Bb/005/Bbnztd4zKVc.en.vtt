00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:40.940 
more but before the game what was
thinking<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.140> just<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.469> thought<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.800> could<00:00:40.920> be

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
thinking in just the thought it could be

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.709 
thinking in just the thought it could be
your<00:00:41.219> last<00:00:41.340> game<00:00:41.579> or<00:00:41.879> what<00:00:42.059> what<00:00:42.450> sort<00:00:42.690> of

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
your last game or what what sort of

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.940 
your last game or what what sort of
thing<00:00:42.899> yeah<00:00:43.610> well<00:00:45.710> hmm<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:48.410> just<00:00:49.410> said<00:00:49.649> there's

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
thing yeah well hmm I just said there's

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.029 
thing yeah well hmm I just said there's
there's<00:00:50.670> always<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:52.489> chance<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.730> change<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.629> I

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
there's always a chance of change and I

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
were we're coming to this game there was

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.570 
were we're coming to this game there was
there's<00:02:59.390> a<00:02:59.450> lot<00:02:59.540> of<00:02:59.570> energy<00:02:59.750> in<00:02:59.989> the<00:03:00.080> building

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
there's a lot of energy in the building

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.160 
there's a lot of energy in the building
the<00:03:01.580> points<00:03:01.940> were<00:03:02.060> important<00:03:02.720> for<00:03:02.840> their<00:03:02.959> team

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
the points were important for their team

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.850 
the points were important for their team
and<00:03:03.350> they<00:03:04.340> want<00:03:04.640> to<00:03:04.730> obviously<00:03:05.330> finishes<00:03:05.989> with

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
and they want to obviously finishes with

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.320 
and they want to obviously finishes with
as<00:03:06.950> many<00:03:07.100> as<00:03:07.280> they<00:03:07.400> possibly<00:03:07.610> can<00:03:08.000> going<00:03:08.239> into

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
as many as they possibly can going into

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.780 
as many as they possibly can going into
playoffs<00:03:08.660> but<00:03:08.959> I<00:03:09.019> thought<00:03:09.230> that<00:03:09.410> our<00:03:09.530> team<00:03:09.790> we

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
playoffs but I thought that our team we

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.310 
playoffs but I thought that our team we
handled<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.180> professional<00:03:11.930> and<00:03:11.989> we<00:03:12.110> played

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
handled the professional and we played

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.470 
handled the professional and we played
it<00:03:12.470> out<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:13.130> way<00:03:13.250> it<00:03:13.340> should<00:03:13.400> be<00:03:13.549> done<00:03:13.670> great

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
it out the way it should be done great

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.449 
it out the way it should be done great
to<00:03:14.630> see<00:03:14.660> Colton<00:03:15.380> out<00:03:15.590> there<00:03:15.799> tonight<00:03:16.160> you<00:03:16.340> had

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
to see Colton out there tonight you had

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.070 
to see Colton out there tonight you had
another<00:03:16.730> nice<00:03:16.940> body<00:03:17.239> check<00:03:17.570> and<00:03:17.750> normally

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
another nice body check and normally

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.479 
another nice body check and normally
there<00:03:18.230> might<00:03:18.410> have<00:03:18.440> been<00:03:18.590> a<00:03:18.739> fight<00:03:19.040> but<00:03:19.250> there

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
there might have been a fight but there

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.759 
there might have been a fight but there
wasn't<00:03:19.910> in<00:03:20.090> that<00:03:20.120> particular<00:03:20.420> shift<00:03:21.049> did<00:03:21.650> he

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
wasn't in that particular shift did he

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.570 
wasn't in that particular shift did he
play<00:03:21.950> a<00:03:21.980> role<00:03:22.190> I<00:03:22.930> got<00:03:23.930> I've<00:03:24.530> got<00:03:24.590> a<00:03:25.040> lot<00:03:25.549> of

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
play a role I got I've got a lot of

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.900 
play a role I got I've got a lot of
respect<00:03:26.420> for<00:03:26.630> Colt<00:03:27.140> Norn<00:03:27.549> he's<00:03:28.549> been<00:03:28.700> a<00:03:28.760> great

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
respect for Colt Norn he's been a great

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.720 
respect for Colt Norn he's been a great
teammate<00:03:29.390> of<00:03:29.660> mine<00:03:30.110> for<00:03:30.709> a<00:03:30.890> lot<00:03:31.220> of<00:03:31.310> years<00:03:31.489> here

teammate of mine for a lot of years here
so<00:03:32.000> I<00:03:32.209> thought<00:03:32.720> it<00:03:32.840> was<00:03:33.130> great<00:03:34.130> to<00:03:34.400> see<00:03:34.580> him<00:03:34.610> be

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
obviously didn't have the year that he

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.410 
obviously didn't have the year that he
