hey<00:00:23.960> guys<00:00:24.230> there's<00:00:24.710> a<00:00:24.800> follow-up<00:00:25.160> to<00:00:25.310> the

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
hey guys there's a follow-up to the

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.670 
hey guys there's a follow-up to the
transcranial<00:00:26.060> magnetic<00:00:26.300> stimulation<00:00:27.170> video

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
transcranial magnetic stimulation video

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.890 
transcranial magnetic stimulation video
that<00:00:27.890> I<00:00:27.950> made<00:00:28.190> as<00:00:29.030> you<00:00:29.090> can<00:00:29.390> see<00:00:29.600> I<00:00:29.630> was

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
that I made as you can see I was

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.480 
that I made as you can see I was
successful<00:00:30.440> in<00:00:30.560> getting<00:00:30.590> neuronal

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
successful in getting neuronal

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.970 
successful in getting neuronal
stimulation<00:00:32.300> Here<00:00:33.020> I<00:00:33.050> am<00:00:33.200> stimulating<00:00:33.830> my

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
stimulation Here I am stimulating my

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.580 
stimulation Here I am stimulating my
primary<00:00:34.550> motor<00:00:34.790> cortex<00:00:35.110> which<00:00:36.110> is<00:00:36.260> a<00:00:36.290> piece<00:00:36.560> of

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
primary motor cortex which is a piece of

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.450 
primary motor cortex which is a piece of
the<00:00:36.830> brain<00:00:37.040> that<00:00:37.250> controls<00:00:37.809> skeletal<00:00:38.809> muscles

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
the brain that controls skeletal muscles

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.760 
the brain that controls skeletal muscles
so<00:00:40.460> I<00:00:40.489> work<00:00:40.730> with<00:00:40.910> TMS<00:00:41.330> a<00:00:41.390> bit<00:00:41.989> for<00:00:42.200> my<00:00:42.290> day<00:00:42.350> job

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
so I work with TMS a bit for my day job

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.860 
so I work with TMS a bit for my day job
so<00:00:42.800> I've<00:00:43.100> seen<00:00:43.309> this<00:00:43.430> done<00:00:43.670> a<00:00:43.970> number<00:00:44.480> of<00:00:44.570> times

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
so I've seen this done a number of times

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.140 
so I've seen this done a number of times
and<00:00:45.309> typically<00:00:46.309> when<00:00:46.460> first<00:00:46.700> getting<00:00:47.059> a

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
and typically when first getting a

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.740 
and typically when first getting a
person<00:00:47.510> set<00:00:47.750> up<00:00:47.870> for<00:00:48.739> a<00:00:48.770> TMS<00:00:49.220> experiment<00:00:49.940> the

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
person set up for a TMS experiment the

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.840 
person set up for a TMS experiment the
primary<00:00:51.170> motor<00:00:51.379> cortex<00:00:51.470> is<00:00:52.100> a<00:00:52.129> good<00:00:52.340> area<00:00:52.520> to

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
primary motor cortex is a good area to

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.390 
primary motor cortex is a good area to
target<00:00:53.270> because<00:00:53.660> its<00:00:54.170> effects<00:00:54.590> are<00:00:54.710> obvious

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
target because its effects are obvious

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.090 
target because its effects are obvious
so<00:00:56.030> by<00:00:56.300> stimulating<00:00:57.290> this<00:00:57.440> area<00:00:57.800> you<00:00:57.980> can

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
so by stimulating this area you can

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.010 
so by stimulating this area you can
cause<00:00:58.340> certain<00:00:58.700> skeletal<00:00:59.300> muscles<00:00:59.690> on<00:00:59.930> the

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
cause certain skeletal muscles on the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.319 
cause certain skeletal muscles on the
body<00:01:00.230> to<00:01:00.590> twitch<00:01:00.920> and<00:01:01.790> then<00:01:01.910> you<00:01:02.000> know<00:01:02.150> that

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
body to twitch and then you know that

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:03.580 
body to twitch and then you know that
you're<00:01:02.420> actually<00:01:02.570> stimulating<00:01:03.230> the<00:01:03.350> brain

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
you're actually stimulating the brain

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.260 
you're actually stimulating the brain
and<00:01:03.800> can<00:01:03.860> move<00:01:04.009> to<00:01:04.190> other<00:01:04.309> areas<00:01:04.430> that<00:01:05.059> are

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
and can move to other areas that are

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:11.770 
and can move to other areas that are
less<00:01:05.710> obvious<00:01:07.300> memory<00:01:08.300> or<00:01:08.570> whatever<00:01:09.640> so<00:01:10.780> you

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
less obvious memory or whatever so you

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.690 
less obvious memory or whatever so you
may<00:01:11.990> know<00:01:12.200> if<00:01:12.530> you've<00:01:12.710> taken<00:01:12.920> any<00:01:13.190> Anatomy

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
may know if you've taken any Anatomy

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.580 
may know if you've taken any Anatomy
classes<00:01:13.850> that<00:01:14.270> the<00:01:14.420> brain<00:01:14.630> is<00:01:14.660> flipped<00:01:15.290> left

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
classes that the brain is flipped left

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.070 
classes that the brain is flipped left
right<00:01:15.920> relative<00:01:16.580> to<00:01:16.910> the<00:01:17.000> body<00:01:17.210> so<00:01:17.930> by

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
right relative to the body so by

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.930 
right relative to the body so by
stimulating<00:01:18.680> the<00:01:18.710> right<00:01:19.040> side<00:01:19.340> of<00:01:19.520> my<00:01:19.670> head

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
stimulating the right side of my head

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.090 
stimulating the right side of my head
it's<00:01:20.660> actually<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:21.110> left<00:01:21.320> side<00:01:21.590> of<00:01:21.740> my<00:01:21.890> body

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
it's actually the left side of my body

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.230 
it's actually the left side of my body
that<00:01:22.280> moves<00:01:22.700> because<00:01:23.380> because<00:01:24.380> it's<00:01:24.530> flipped

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
that moves because because it's flipped

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.419 
that moves because because it's flipped
so<00:01:26.240> at<00:01:26.390> first<00:01:26.630> I<00:01:26.780> used<00:01:27.020> my<00:01:27.470> butterfly<00:01:28.069> coil

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:28.429 
so at first I used my butterfly coil

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:31.749 
so at first I used my butterfly coil
which<00:01:29.000> was<00:01:29.210> two<00:01:29.420> turns<00:01:29.720> of<00:01:30.020> 15<00:01:30.830> or<00:01:31.100> two<00:01:31.399> coils

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
which was two turns of 15 or two coils

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.930 
which was two turns of 15 or two coils
of<00:01:32.149> 15<00:01:32.569> turns<00:01:32.929> each<00:01:33.380> and<00:01:33.649> wasn't<00:01:34.520> getting<00:01:34.850> a

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
of 15 turns each and wasn't getting a

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.190 
of 15 turns each and wasn't getting a
whole<00:01:35.119> lot<00:01:35.300> with<00:01:35.450> that<00:01:35.660> I<00:01:35.690> was<00:01:35.929> able<00:01:36.050> to

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
whole lot with that I was able to

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.969 
whole lot with that I was able to
stimulate<00:01:36.470> peripheral<00:01:37.250> nerves<00:01:37.490> on<00:01:37.850> my<00:01:38.450> arm

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
stimulate peripheral nerves on my arm

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.650 
stimulate peripheral nerves on my arm
but<00:01:39.979> when<00:01:40.369> using<00:01:40.550> it<00:01:40.729> on<00:01:40.850> my<00:01:40.880> head<00:01:41.300> there<00:01:41.509> just

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
but when using it on my head there just

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.050 
but when using it on my head there just
wasn't<00:01:41.840> enough<00:01:42.160> oomph<00:01:43.160> I<00:01:43.399> didn't<00:01:43.759> really<00:01:43.940> get

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
wasn't enough oomph I didn't really get

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.969 
wasn't enough oomph I didn't really get
anything<00:01:44.300> out<00:01:44.569> of<00:01:44.600> it<00:01:44.810> so<00:01:45.319> I<00:01:45.350> went<00:01:45.530> back<00:01:45.709> to<00:01:45.860> the

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
anything out of it so I went back to the

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.520 
anything out of it so I went back to the
single<00:01:46.340> coil<00:01:46.640> this<00:01:47.420> is<00:01:47.479> just<00:01:47.780> one<00:01:48.020> coil<00:01:48.350> of

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
single coil this is just one coil of

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.120 
single coil this is just one coil of
about<00:01:48.800> 15<00:01:49.220> turns<00:01:49.610> and<00:01:50.110> was<00:01:51.110> using<00:01:51.470> voltages<00:01:51.950> of

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
about 15 turns and was using voltages of

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.529 
about 15 turns and was using voltages of
about<00:01:52.390> 1,700<00:01:53.390> volts<00:01:54.110> and<00:01:54.910> same<00:01:55.910> capacitor

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
about 1,700 volts and same capacitor

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.040 
about 1,700 volts and same capacitor
bank<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.729> wiring<00:01:59.149> that<00:01:59.240> I<00:01:59.330> used<00:01:59.569> is<00:01:59.840> like

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
bank the the wiring that I used is like

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.889 
bank the the wiring that I used is like
a<00:02:00.130> grounding<00:02:01.130> braid<00:02:01.459> but<00:02:02.149> I<00:02:02.179> got<00:02:02.360> it<00:02:02.479> halted

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
a grounding braid but I got it halted

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.820 
a grounding braid but I got it halted
and<00:02:03.170> I<00:02:03.289> wrapped<00:02:04.130> it<00:02:04.340> in<00:02:05.050> gaffers<00:02:06.050> tape<00:02:06.170> just

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
and I wrapped it in gaffers tape just

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.190 
and I wrapped it in gaffers tape just
insulated<00:02:07.520> and<00:02:07.670> then<00:02:08.330> just<00:02:08.479> coil<00:02:08.720> it<00:02:08.869> up<00:02:08.959> so

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
insulated and then just coil it up so

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.320 
insulated and then just coil it up so
that<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.950> shape<00:02:10.220> of<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.580> of<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:10.880> wire<00:02:11.030> makes

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
that the shape of the of the wire makes

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.059 
that the shape of the of the wire makes
it<00:02:11.480> easy<00:02:11.630> to<00:02:11.810> coil<00:02:12.170> up<00:02:12.319> like<00:02:12.590> this<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:15.800> peak

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
it easy to coil up like this the peak

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.880 
it easy to coil up like this the peak
current<00:02:16.490> through<00:02:17.209> the<00:02:17.330> butterfly<00:02:17.780> coil<00:02:18.110> was

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
current through the butterfly coil was

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.300 
current through the butterfly coil was
maybe<00:02:19.130> about<00:02:19.370> 5,000<00:02:20.090> dams<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:21.680> but<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.160> rise

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
maybe about 5,000 dams and but the rise

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.010 
maybe about 5,000 dams and but the rise
time<00:02:22.640> was<00:02:22.819> still<00:02:23.030> much<00:02:23.270> faster<00:02:23.810> than<00:02:23.900> I

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
time was still much faster than I

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.920 
time was still much faster than I
thought<00:02:24.260> I<00:02:24.319> was<00:02:24.620> getting<00:02:24.740> about<00:02:25.780> what<00:02:26.780> do<00:02:26.870> you

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
thought I was getting about what do you

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.720 
thought I was getting about what do you
have<00:02:27.080> for<00:02:27.349> microseconds<00:02:28.160> or<00:02:28.250> something<00:02:28.580> like

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
have for microseconds or something like

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.569 
have for microseconds or something like
that<00:02:28.790> which<00:02:29.750> is<00:02:29.780> really<00:02:30.230> much<00:02:31.069> less<00:02:31.400> than

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
that which is really much less than

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:33.250 
that which is really much less than
commercial<00:02:31.939> TMS<00:02:32.510> machines<00:02:32.959> which<00:02:33.140> are

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
commercial TMS machines which are

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.570 
commercial TMS machines which are
typically<00:02:33.620> about<00:02:33.769> 50<00:02:34.189> Mike

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
typically about 50 Mike

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.420 
typically about 50 Mike
seconds<00:02:35.000> rise<00:02:35.210> time<00:02:35.680> so<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:37.130> only<00:02:37.160> way<00:02:37.400> I

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
seconds rise time so the only way I

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.920 
seconds rise time so the only way I
figure<00:02:37.850> that<00:02:38.000> we<00:02:38.090> can<00:02:38.210> change<00:02:38.390> that<00:02:38.660> is<00:02:38.810> to

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
figure that we can change that is to

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.630 
figure that we can change that is to
increase<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.410> inductance<00:02:39.920> even<00:02:40.220> more<00:02:40.430> which

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
increase the inductance even more which

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.390 
increase the inductance even more which
doesn't<00:02:40.970> seem<00:02:41.090> right<00:02:41.300> to<00:02:41.600> me<00:02:41.860> or<00:02:42.860> increase<00:02:43.250> the

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
doesn't seem right to me or increase the

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.160 
doesn't seem right to me or increase the
capacitance<00:02:43.970> of<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.300> bank<00:02:44.510> since<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:44.990> time

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
capacitance of the bank since the time

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.240 
capacitance of the bank since the time
constant<00:02:45.740> is<00:02:45.920> some<00:02:46.360> square<00:02:47.360> root<00:02:47.540> LC<00:02:48.160> but<00:02:49.160> I'm

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
constant is some square root LC but I'm

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.300 
constant is some square root LC but I'm
not<00:02:49.370> going<00:02:49.520> to<00:02:49.580> buy<00:02:49.670> more<00:02:49.910> capacitors<00:02:50.480> because

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
not going to buy more capacitors because

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.800 
not going to buy more capacitors because
they're<00:02:52.310> kind<00:02:52.520> of<00:02:52.550> pricey<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:53.090> this<00:02:53.180> may<00:02:53.780> be

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
they're kind of pricey and this may be

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.710 
they're kind of pricey and this may be
basically<00:02:54.320> this<00:02:54.410> experiments<00:02:54.950> done<00:02:55.100> so<00:02:55.690> so<00:02:56.690> I

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
basically this experiments done so so I

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.140 
basically this experiments done so so I
was<00:02:57.080> happy<00:02:57.980> enough<00:02:58.190> to<00:02:58.340> get<00:02:58.490> some<00:02:58.730> skeletal

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
was happy enough to get some skeletal

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.760 
was happy enough to get some skeletal
muscle<00:02:59.450> stimulation<00:02:59.960> and<00:03:00.260> I<00:03:00.290> think<00:03:00.500> I'll<00:03:00.590> call

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
muscle stimulation and I think I'll call

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.000 
muscle stimulation and I think I'll call
it<00:03:00.950> quits<00:03:00.980> I<00:03:01.570> also<00:03:02.570> tried<00:03:02.960> the<00:03:03.230> back<00:03:03.650> of<00:03:03.860> my

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
it quits I also tried the back of my

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.680 
it quits I also tried the back of my
head<00:03:04.220> where<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:04.430> occipital<00:03:04.760> lobes<00:03:05.150> are<00:03:05.450> and

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
head where the occipital lobes are and

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.870 
head where the occipital lobes are and
was<00:03:06.320> trying<00:03:06.590> to<00:03:06.650> get<00:03:06.800> some<00:03:06.980> visual<00:03:07.160> cortex

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
was trying to get some visual cortex

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.660 
was trying to get some visual cortex
stimulation<00:03:08.270> apparently<00:03:09.020> you<00:03:09.110> can<00:03:09.260> see

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
stimulation apparently you can see

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.730 
stimulation apparently you can see
phosphines<00:03:10.670> or<00:03:10.910> like<00:03:11.000> glowing<00:03:11.270> regions<00:03:11.840> in

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
phosphines or like glowing regions in

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.500 
phosphines or like glowing regions in
the<00:03:12.890> visual<00:03:13.250> field<00:03:13.280> by<00:03:13.820> stimulating<00:03:14.390> the

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
the visual field by stimulating the

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.170 
the visual field by stimulating the
visual<00:03:15.380> cortex<00:03:15.650> I<00:03:16.130> didn't<00:03:16.700> really<00:03:16.880> get<00:03:17.000> much

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
visual cortex I didn't really get much

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.990 
visual cortex I didn't really get much
of<00:03:17.240> that<00:03:17.510> but<00:03:17.720> I<00:03:17.750> got<00:03:17.930> a<00:03:17.959> few<00:03:18.320> really<00:03:19.000> intense

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
of that but I got a few really intense

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.980 
of that but I got a few really intense
neck<00:03:20.300> twitches<00:03:20.780> and<00:03:20.990> so<00:03:21.230> I<00:03:22.720> had<00:03:23.720> enough

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
neck twitches and so I had enough

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:29.730 
neck twitches and so I had enough
basically<00:03:25.660> alright<00:03:26.660> guys<00:03:26.870> see<00:03:27.530> you<00:03:27.590> next<00:03:27.620> time

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
basically alright guys see you next time

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.770 
basically alright guys see you next time
Oh
