00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:03.540
 why the project 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.850
 it's not in numbers he said 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.679
 and if this season 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:10.899
 the names of fashion 

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:13.899
 the returnable costumes 

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:17.339
 I went 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:19.039
 northern recharge 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.779
 an ankle 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:22.119
 she will be six 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:23.900
 number is increasing 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.900
 the bretons 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.649
 his seat 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.300
 even though the Algerian market 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.780
 this one 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.000
 the festival 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 even if he evacuated 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.580
 to see more clearly 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.620
 what we understand 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.730
 Drogba at the velodrome 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.720
 Why 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.540
 The original band 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.540
 it's time for it to stop 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.920
 chelsea which is fixed at this weekend 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.000
 other bad sign 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.750
 argentine in group b 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.750
 on the other hand first three 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.490
 this district of gilo 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.940
 BNP Paribas 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.940
 since July 6 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.159
 obama must not be ripped off 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:17.549
 too complex 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:18.749
 he is Jewish 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:20.959

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:33.099
 and yet 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.099

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:13.590
 after voting 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.729
 it makes 

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:17.729
 it's their money 

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:28.399
 Tehran has little to do with that 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.099
 the strikers 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:34.899

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:55.779
 called to the bar 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:03:59.729
