used<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.800> underhanded<00:00:47.579> tactics<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.200> think

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
used the underhanded tactics I think

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.430

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
that I was trying to do the same things

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.970 
that I was trying to do the same things
that<00:00:52.530> he<00:00:52.649> was<00:00:52.860> doing<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:54.559> it<00:00:55.559> just<00:00:55.770> didn't

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
that he was doing and it just didn't

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.010 
that he was doing and it just didn't
work<00:00:56.070> out<00:00:56.250> for<00:00:56.309> me<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.730> just<00:00:57.420> wasn't<00:00:57.629> used<00:00:57.809> to

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
work out for me I just wasn't used to
