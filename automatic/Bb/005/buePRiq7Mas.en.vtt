doing it flip to make sure that minions
are<00:03:44.829> already<00:03:45.220> being<00:03:45.970> attacked<00:03:46.329> by<00:03:46.510> the<00:03:46.569> tower

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
are already being attacked by the tower

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.720 
are already being attacked by the tower
so<00:03:47.379> that<00:03:47.500> you<00:03:47.620> don't<00:03:47.769> pull<00:03:47.919> aggro<00:03:48.099> right<00:03:48.489> away

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
so that you don't pull aggro right away

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.610 
so that you don't pull aggro right away
if<00:03:49.389> this<00:03:49.540> happens<00:03:49.930> to<00:03:50.019> you<00:03:50.109> you're<00:03:50.319> gonna<00:03:50.440> get

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
if this happens to you you're gonna get

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.800 
if this happens to you you're gonna get
chunked<00:03:51.010> really<00:03:51.310> hard<00:03:51.519> and<00:03:51.790> possibly<00:03:52.389> lose

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
chunked really hard and possibly lose

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.509 
chunked really hard and possibly lose
the<00:03:52.930> lane<00:03:53.109> because<00:03:53.290> you<00:03:53.470> have<00:03:53.560> to<00:03:53.650> back<00:03:53.829> early
