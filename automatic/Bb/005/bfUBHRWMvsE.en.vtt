00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:04.660
 hello then here I am for this little 

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:05.950
 video so I'll explain so 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.750
 especially for boys but also 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.099
 for girls who have hair 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.709
 short of course little because I have hair 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:13.059
 short so I can advise well 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:14.799
 obviously a greenhouse that I'm going to 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.420
 show just now and so here I 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.099
 will explain to you how to style 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.369
 obviously with the company all 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:24.160
 simply a banal wax of commerce 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.410
 to make a real were all good 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.910
 rather for men but who also works 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.500
 for women especially so that's it then 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.330
 here is the wax that I will use so 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:39.340
 it's a cyrax so a matte effect syrah 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.950
 so why choose from syrah their 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.640
 tight sets the one a consistency a 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:49.230
 little stronger than others I would say 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:52.150
 because she's never buying others and 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.220
 I really had a crush on 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.810
 this one because she believes a lot 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.620
 better and for the hair and b that's 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.840
 very very good 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.280
 so I have my hair and b and c 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.620
 is not very well done by against 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.119
 but to wax with them wax 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.649
 everything is just like that 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.750
 it's very very very very good and it's 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:09.210
 Holds great 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.009
 so that's the wax 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.509
 shows you my hair that is life 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.479
 of course because I already had some 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.789
 wax so you can see they are 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.789
 of course a blonde color because I 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:23.170
 faded recently I have 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:24.759
 very very thick hair that is 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.700
 especially so they start to 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.049
 push back obviously and so I 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.789
 will show you to keep some of the 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.979
 battle it's every morning that I 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.390
 me what you see the etienne really 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.590
 not alone so I do not know anymore 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.390
 how to do so simply to 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.229
 to style hair like this 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.280
 will make them flat so like me 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.079
 so you have to put them flat 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:54.100
 like this then we will come to collect 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:58.329
 with a wax right and so we're going 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.219
 come here rubbed in our hands but 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:02.850
 as I am on the whole hand well 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:02.850
 obviously 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.210
 and so we will come to the hair 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.750
 so always raise them with the 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.820
 wax impregnating them comes from everywhere 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:18.770
 so then on the spot it is obvious 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:21.960
 that it gives a greasy hair effect 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.960
 it is true that it is unpleasant but 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.640
 so once the graded end the fat 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:32.730
 this new bourgeois work against that 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:34.620
 then once the wax is at home 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:39.200
 you will not have that effect two 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.700
 just fat on the hair 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.770
 so then I'm also using a 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.100
 brush and more so that's the most of 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:50.430
 more just to come to me masters 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:54.150
 normal for not that they are too much 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.740
 to style is quickly done so here is 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.590
 I use I make this hairstyle 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.810
 every morning it takes me about five 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.630
 minutes chrono so I flattened behind 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.630
 also and so here I have my hairstyle 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.239
 to go for a walk or whatever 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.440
 so here I hope I helped you 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.440
 and I'll see you soon
