00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
one situation where you're basically

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.880 
one situation where you're basically
doing<00:04:16.359> when<00:04:16.630> your<00:04:16.780> shotgun<00:04:17.229> dancing<00:04:17.709> is

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
doing when your shotgun dancing is

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.039 
doing when your shotgun dancing is
moving<00:04:18.400> your<00:04:18.549> character<00:04:19.060> back<00:04:19.330> in<00:04:19.359> for<00:04:19.810> four

side<00:04:20.320> to<00:04:20.500> side<00:04:20.709> so<00:04:21.370> it<00:04:21.489> is<00:04:21.549> shimmying<00:04:21.820> and

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
side to side so it is shimmying and

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.200 
side to side so it is shimmying and
moving<00:04:22.630> in<00:04:22.720> a<00:04:22.840> v8<00:04:23.410> sort<00:04:23.800> of<00:04:23.890> motion<00:04:24.340> this<00:04:25.000> can

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
moving in a v8 sort of motion this can

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.030 
moving in a v8 sort of motion this can
really<00:04:25.360> throw<00:04:25.840> your<00:04:26.050> opponent<00:04:26.080> shots<00:04:26.770> off
