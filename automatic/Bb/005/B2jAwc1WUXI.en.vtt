control about the start of the game the

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.010 
control about the start of the game the
fantasy<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.640> lineup<00:03:11.090> I<00:03:11.209> see<00:03:11.390> the<00:03:11.480> teams<00:03:11.750> they

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
fantasy the lineup I see the teams they

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.410 
fantasy the lineup I see the teams they
see<00:03:12.200> that<00:03:12.410> hand<00:03:12.620> shaking<00:03:12.920> it<00:03:13.760> gives<00:03:14.000> a<00:03:14.120> start

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
see that hand shaking it gives a start

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.510 
see that hand shaking it gives a start
of<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.630> game<00:03:14.810> but<00:03:15.170> more<00:03:15.320> presence<00:03:15.770> referees

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
of the game but more presence referees

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.699 
of the game but more presence referees
now<00:03:16.730> got<00:03:16.940> a<00:03:16.970> bit<00:03:17.120> more<00:03:17.270> controlled<00:03:17.720> by<00:03:18.290> talking

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
now got a bit more controlled by talking

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:30.810 
now got a bit more controlled by talking
to<00:03:18.740> the<00:03:18.890> captains

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.640 

before<00:03:31.820> it<00:03:32.060> came<00:03:32.330> into<00:03:32.480> place<00:03:32.810> they're

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
before it came into place they're

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.920 
before it came into place they're
probably<00:03:33.890> more<00:03:34.190> sending<00:03:34.790> offs<00:03:35.000> or<00:03:35.270> less

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
probably more sending offs or less

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.500 
probably more sending offs or less
respect<00:03:36.410> to<00:03:36.770> players<00:03:37.040> whereas<00:03:37.820> now<00:03:38.000> I<00:03:38.060> think

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
respect to players whereas now I think

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.350 
respect to players whereas now I think
it<00:03:38.720> helps<00:03:39.310> referees<00:03:40.310> official<00:03:40.550> damn<00:03:41.090> players

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
it helps referees official damn players

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.810 
it helps referees official damn players
to<00:03:41.600> take<00:03:41.750> on<00:03:41.990> the<00:03:42.200> idea<00:03:43.130> that<00:03:43.430> they've<00:03:43.550> got<00:03:43.760> to

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
to take on the idea that they've got to

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.740 
to take on the idea that they've got to
respect<00:03:44.060> each<00:03:44.240> other

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.300 

I've<00:03:49.230> seen<00:03:49.440> a<00:03:49.500> lot<00:03:49.590> more<00:03:49.800> younger<00:03:50.040> that's

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
I've seen a lot more younger that's

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.070 
I've seen a lot more younger that's
coming<00:03:50.940> into<00:03:51.300> the<00:03:51.480> game<00:03:51.600> to<00:03:51.870> disrespect

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
coming into the game to disrespect

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.770 
coming into the game to disrespect
campaigns<00:03:52.740> know<00:03:52.920> about<00:03:53.190> which<00:03:53.970> I<00:03:54.180> think<00:03:54.390> he<00:03:54.480> is

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
campaigns know about which I think he is

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.020 
campaigns know about which I think he is
good<00:03:55.050> because<00:03:55.230> you<00:03:55.440> never<00:03:55.530> see<00:03:55.620> that<00:03:56.370> the

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
good because you never see that the

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.000 
good because you never see that the
young<00:03:57.180> wife's<00:03:57.420> coming<00:03:57.600> food<00:03:57.870> and<00:03:58.110> we've<00:03:58.860> got

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
young wife's coming food and we've got

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.280 
young wife's coming food and we've got
no<00:03:59.160> game<00:03:59.400> really<00:03:59.790> so<00:04:00.060> we<00:04:00.330> need<00:04:00.540> him<00:04:00.660> in<00:04:00.900> my

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
no game really so we need him in my

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.620 
no game really so we need him in my
count<00:04:01.710> even<00:04:02.100> at<00:04:02.160> 22<00:04:02.220> percent<00:04:03.000> increase<00:04:03.210> in

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
count even at 22 percent increase in

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.600 
count even at 22 percent increase in
referees<00:04:04.320> which<00:04:04.920> is<00:04:05.070> great<00:04:05.340> and<00:04:05.430> a<00:04:05.460> lot<00:04:05.490> of

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
referees which is great and a lot of

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.130 
referees which is great and a lot of
those<00:04:05.760> who<00:04:05.940> young<00:04:06.090> referees<00:04:06.540> who<00:04:06.690> want<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:06.960> get

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
those who young referees who want to get

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.810 
those who young referees who want to get
involved<00:04:07.440> I<00:04:07.710> think<00:04:07.770> that<00:04:08.160> that's<00:04:08.340> just<00:04:08.610> got<00:04:08.730> to

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
involved I think that that's just got to

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.400 
involved I think that that's just got to
be<00:04:08.910> good<00:04:08.940> for<00:04:09.240> refereeing<00:04:09.660> and<00:04:09.840> good<00:04:10.140> for<00:04:10.320> the

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
be good for refereeing and good for the

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:24.700 
be good for refereeing and good for the
future<00:04:10.650> of<00:04:10.800> book

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.219 

the<00:04:25.370> respect<00:04:25.759> campaign<00:04:26.150> is<00:04:26.419> a<00:04:26.449> good<00:04:26.750> thing<00:04:26.960> for

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
the respect campaign is a good thing for

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:28.930 
the respect campaign is a good thing for
the<00:04:27.350> game<00:04:27.500> because<00:04:27.740> it's<00:04:28.039> all<00:04:28.280> players<00:04:28.550> expect

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
the game because it's all players expect

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.400 
the game because it's all players expect
the<00:04:29.000> referee<00:04:29.330> then<00:04:29.570> you<00:04:29.660> can<00:04:29.840> concentrate<00:04:30.199> on

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
the referee then you can concentrate on

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.200 
the referee then you can concentrate on
vital<00:04:31.400> decisions

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.629 

from<00:04:35.930> top<00:04:36.259> flight<00:04:36.560> to<00:04:36.740> grassroots<00:04:36.979> we've<00:04:37.430> seen

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
from top flight to grassroots we've seen

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:38.890 
from top flight to grassroots we've seen
a<00:04:37.669> decrease<00:04:38.000> in<00:04:38.150> the<00:04:38.419> number<00:04:38.449> of<00:04:38.690> yellow

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
a decrease in the number of yellow

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.330 
a decrease in the number of yellow
clouds<00:04:39.320> for<00:04:39.560> descent<00:04:39.889> which<00:04:40.100> has<00:04:40.220> been

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
clouds for descent which has been

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.560 
clouds for descent which has been
wonderful<00:04:40.550> because<00:04:41.030> that<00:04:41.180> was<00:04:41.300> one<00:04:41.419> of<00:04:41.449> the

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
wonderful because that was one of the

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.330 
wonderful because that was one of the
reasons<00:04:41.930> why<00:04:42.050> people<00:04:42.080> were<00:04:42.590> leaving<00:04:42.770> football

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
reasons why people were leaving football

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.890 
reasons why people were leaving football
especially<00:04:43.789> referee<00:04:44.360> and<00:04:44.570> people<00:04:44.840> were

especially referee and people were
leaving<00:04:45.020> refereeing<00:04:45.560> because<00:04:45.889> they<00:04:46.430> were

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
leaving refereeing because they were
