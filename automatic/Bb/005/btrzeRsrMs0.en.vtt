channels<00:04:30.450> to<00:04:30.630> reduce<00:04:30.960> the<00:04:31.169> space<00:04:31.440> taken<00:04:31.740> by

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010

the<00:04:32.070> waveforms<00:04:33.290> once<00:04:34.290> ready<00:04:34.700> start<00:04:35.700> the

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
application as you see when I vary the

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.260 
application as you see when I vary the
firing<00:04:40.290> angle<00:04:40.440> of<00:04:40.710> the<00:04:40.830> thyristors<00:04:41.430> I<00:04:41.669> get<00:04:42.120> the

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
firing angle of the thyristors I get the

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.520 
firing angle of the thyristors I get the

time<00:04:48.360> this<00:04:49.350> function<00:04:49.830> becomes<00:04:49.980> very<00:04:50.430> useful

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
time this function becomes very useful

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.330
