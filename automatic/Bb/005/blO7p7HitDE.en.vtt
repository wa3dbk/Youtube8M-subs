00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
hey everybody this is unknown demon and

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.849 
hey everybody this is unknown demon and
recently<00:00:03.240> i<00:00:03.330> got<00:00:03.720> a<00:00:03.750> request<00:00:03.899> to<00:00:04.290> teach<00:00:04.589> how<00:00:04.799> to

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
recently i got a request to teach how to

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.470 
recently i got a request to teach how to
make<00:00:05.420> yunying<00:00:06.420> circles<00:00:06.980> so<00:00:07.980> that<00:00:08.730> requests<00:00:09.360> us

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
make yunying circles so that requests us

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.770 
make yunying circles so that requests us
from<00:00:09.690> z<00:00:10.050> dom<00:00:10.290> HD<00:00:10.830> but<00:00:11.700> honestly<00:00:12.330> you<00:00:12.509> can't

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
from z dom HD but honestly you can't

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.990 
from z dom HD but honestly you can't
teach<00:00:13.049> someone<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.620> make<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:14.040> unique<00:00:14.519> circle

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
teach someone to make a unique circle

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.510 
teach someone to make a unique circle
there's<00:00:15.480> some<00:00:15.719> key<00:00:15.900> points<00:00:16.230> in<00:00:16.590> where<00:00:17.220> it

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
there's some key points in where it

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.359 
there's some key points in where it
would<00:00:17.670> help<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:18.000> make<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:18.510> but<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.890> main<00:00:20.340> thing

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
would help to make it but the main thing

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.769 
would help to make it but the main thing
about<00:00:20.699> unity<00:00:21.060> circle<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.420> more<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.689> an

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
about unity circle is more of an

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.769 
about unity circle is more of an
artistic<00:00:22.109> view<00:00:22.680> like<00:00:23.010> yeah<00:00:23.250> do<00:00:23.640> go<00:00:24.060> back<00:00:24.449> like

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
artistic view like yeah do go back like

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.140 
artistic view like yeah do go back like
to<00:00:25.080> probably<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.160> point<00:00:26.490> where<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:26.820> can<00:00:26.970> see

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
to probably a point where you can see

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.370 
to probably a point where you can see
the<00:00:27.240> whole<00:00:27.330> circle<00:00:27.750> make<00:00:27.960> sure<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.199> looks

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
the whole circle make sure it looks

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.370 
the whole circle make sure it looks
right<00:00:28.500> but<00:00:29.179> i<00:00:30.179> guess<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.779> i<00:00:30.869> can<00:00:31.109> tell<00:00:31.289> you

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
right but i guess that i can tell you

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.400 
right but i guess that i can tell you
the<00:00:31.500> key<00:00:31.710> points<00:00:32.040> for<00:00:32.219> how<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.399> make<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.640> circle

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
the key points for how to make a circle

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.889 
the key points for how to make a circle
basically<00:00:34.410> what<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:34.980> want<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.600> what<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.719> do

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
basically what you want is what you do

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.900 
basically what you want is what you do
the<00:00:37.020> one<00:00:37.200> side<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.620> do<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.219> other<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.790> way

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
the one side you do to the other the way

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.940 
the one side you do to the other the way
i<00:00:38.940> started<00:00:39.450> out<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.690> make<00:00:39.870> this<00:00:40.020> circle<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.620> i

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
i started out to make this circle is i

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.700 
i started out to make this circle is i
literally<00:00:41.820> cut<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.270> circle<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:42.840> half<00:00:42.899> and

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
literally cut the circle in half and

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.400 
literally cut the circle in half and
then<00:00:44.460> what<00:00:44.969> when<00:00:45.239> i<00:00:45.270> broke<00:00:45.600> off<00:00:45.809> on<00:00:46.020> block<00:00:46.230> and

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
then what when i broke off on block and

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.840 
then what when i broke off on block and
replace<00:00:46.469> at<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.890> different<00:00:47.219> one<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.430> went<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.670> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
replace at a different one I went to the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.420 
replace at a different one I went to the
exact<00:00:48.090> opposite<00:00:48.660> side<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.320> did<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.399> same

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
exact opposite side and did the same

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.360 
exact opposite side and did the same
thing<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:51.239> give<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.289> black<00:00:52.469> background<00:00:52.800> but

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
thing I give it a black background but

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.389 
thing I give it a black background but
this<00:00:53.670> circle<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.660> initially<00:00:56.149> symmetrical

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
this circle is initially symmetrical

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.340 
this circle is initially symmetrical
also<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.820> midpoint<00:01:00.329> over<00:01:00.629> here<00:01:00.989> if<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.320> see

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
also the midpoint over here if you see

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.750 
also the midpoint over here if you see
it<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.030> middle<00:01:03.300> circle<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.930> when

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
it this is the middle circle is when

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.380 
it this is the middle circle is when
basically<00:01:05.869> the<00:01:06.869> exact<00:01:07.680> sides<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.970> unique

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
basically the exact sides of the unique

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.750 
basically the exact sides of the unique
circle<00:01:09.960> cross<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.619> they<00:01:11.010> basically<00:01:11.189> start

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
circle cross and they basically start

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.539 
circle cross and they basically start
forming<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.240> curve<00:01:13.200> going<00:01:13.650> back<00:01:14.040> into<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
forming that curve going back into the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.820 
forming that curve going back into the
middle<00:01:15.000> instead<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.990> making<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.350> circular

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
middle instead of making the circular

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.719 
middle instead of making the circular
curve<00:01:17.040> going<00:01:17.369> out<00:01:17.810> so<00:01:18.810> it's<00:01:19.560> just<00:01:20.189> like<00:01:20.310> how

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
curve going out so it's just like how

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.399 
curve going out so it's just like how
unique<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.360> supposed<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.780> be<00:01:21.900> what<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.170> do<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
unique is supposed to be what you do the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.890 
unique is supposed to be what you do the
one<00:01:22.560> thing<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.920> do<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.250> another<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.909> for<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
one thing you do to another and for the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.560 
one thing you do to another and for the
dots<00:01:25.140> well<00:01:25.700> like<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.820> said<00:01:26.880> it's<00:01:27.180> more<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.479> an

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
dots well like I said it's more of an

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.960 
dots well like I said it's more of an
artistic<00:01:27.900> view<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:29.040> have<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.460> go<00:01:29.579> up<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.939> a

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
artistic view so you have to go up to a

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.060 
artistic view so you have to go up to a
point<00:01:30.210> make<00:01:30.570> sure<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.840> looks<00:01:30.900> right<00:01:31.170> despite

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
point make sure it looks right despite

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.100 
point make sure it looks right despite
your<00:01:32.280> own<00:01:32.460> point<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:32.939> view<00:01:33.000> like<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.869> can't

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
your own point of view like you can't

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.719 
your own point of view like you can't
teach<00:01:34.409> somebody<00:01:34.710> how<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.100> make<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.400> ending

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
teach somebody how to make the ending

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.950 
teach somebody how to make the ending
circle<00:01:36.030> it's<00:01:36.840> just<00:01:37.770> by<00:01:37.979> looking<00:01:38.520> at<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.960> so

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
circle it's just by looking at it so

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.149 
circle it's just by looking at it so
there<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.619> go<00:01:40.799> z<00:01:41.430> Dom<00:01:41.700> HD<00:01:42.770> you<00:01:43.770> can't<00:01:44.009> really

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
there you go z Dom HD you can't really

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.609 
there you go z Dom HD you can't really
teach<00:01:44.460> up<00:01:44.729> on<00:01:44.939> how<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.390> make<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.600> unique<00:01:46.259> circle

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
teach up on how to make a unique circle

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.200 
teach up on how to make a unique circle
that's<00:01:46.710> why<00:01:46.890> there's<00:01:47.070> no<00:01:47.250> tutorials<00:01:47.640> on<00:01:48.060> it

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
that's why there's no tutorials on it

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.780 
that's why there's no tutorials on it
it's<00:01:48.720> more<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.110> just<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.470> looking<00:01:50.159> feel<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.759> it

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
it's more of just a looking feel to it

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.600 
it's more of just a looking feel to it
like<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.810> can<00:01:51.990> start<00:01:52.200> with<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.380> circle<00:01:52.680> cut<00:01:53.430> in

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
like you can start with a circle cut in

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.300 
like you can start with a circle cut in
half<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.090> do<00:01:54.270> one<00:01:54.600> side<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.140> other<00:01:55.310> that's

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
half and do one side to the other that's
