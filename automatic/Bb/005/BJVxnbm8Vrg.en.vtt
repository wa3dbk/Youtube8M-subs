transfer compound on there but not too
much<00:00:58.750> because<00:00:58.930> what<00:00:59.260> it'll<00:00:59.379> do<00:00:59.559> is<00:00:59.770> it'll<00:00:59.950> kind

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
much because what it'll do is it'll kind

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.819 
much because what it'll do is it'll kind
of<00:01:00.270> goop<00:01:01.270> out<00:01:01.480> from<00:01:01.690> wrong<00:01:01.930> along<00:01:02.410> the<00:01:02.590> sides

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
of goop out from wrong along the sides

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.450 
of goop out from wrong along the sides
it<00:01:04.229> won't<00:01:05.229> make<00:01:05.379> the<00:01:05.530> heat<00:01:05.710> transfer<00:01:06.310> any

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
it won't make the heat transfer any

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.150 
it won't make the heat transfer any
better<00:01:06.729> it'll<00:01:06.970> just<00:01:07.150> make<00:01:07.330> a<00:01:07.390> mess<00:01:08.009> it's<00:01:09.009> gonna

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
better it'll just make a mess it's gonna

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.499 
better it'll just make a mess it's gonna
make<00:01:09.340> a<00:01:09.369> bit<00:01:09.580> of<00:01:09.670> a<00:01:09.729> mess<00:01:09.910> anyway<00:01:10.060> because<00:01:10.420> it

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
make a bit of a mess anyway because it

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:30.270 
make a bit of a mess anyway because it
always<00:01:10.630> does<00:01:10.979> when<00:01:11.979> wear<00:01:12.160> any<00:01:12.310> clothes

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.180 

the<00:01:30.820> city<00:01:31.120> car<00:01:31.360> was<00:01:31.510> built<00:01:31.630> in<00:01:31.840> 1976<00:01:32.770> and

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
the city car was built in 1976 and

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.610 
the city car was built in 1976 and
originally<00:01:33.640> where<00:01:34.420> these<00:01:34.660> components<00:01:35.530> were

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
originally where these components were

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.460 
originally where these components were
like<00:01:35.800> here<00:01:36.330> the<00:01:38.190> they<00:01:39.190> had<00:01:39.370> this<00:01:39.640> yeah<00:01:40.570> main<00:01:41.260> so

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
like here the they had this yeah main so

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.050 
like here the they had this yeah main so
like<00:01:41.740> was<00:01:41.920> over<00:01:42.160> where<00:01:42.580> the<00:01:42.640> all<00:01:42.760> tracks

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
like was over where the all tracks

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.180 
like was over where the all tracks
controller<00:01:43.450> is<00:01:43.660> and<00:01:44.200> this<00:01:44.860> particular

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
controller is and this particular

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.950 
controller is and this particular
vehicle<00:01:46.200> had<00:01:47.200> the<00:01:47.470> series<00:01:48.420> parallel<00:01:49.420> circuit

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
vehicle had the series parallel circuit

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.590 
vehicle had the series parallel circuit
and<00:01:50.770> what<00:01:50.979> it<00:01:51.130> did<00:01:51.340> was<00:01:51.400> it<00:01:51.640> had<00:01:51.910> three<00:01:52.240> speeds

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
and what it did was it had three speeds

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.359 
and what it did was it had three speeds
the<00:01:53.560> first<00:01:54.070> speed<00:01:54.550> was<00:01:54.880> a<00:01:54.910> was<00:01:55.540> a<00:01:55.570> low<00:01:55.840> speed

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
the first speed was a was a low speed

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.520 
the first speed was a was a low speed
that<00:01:57.369> ran<00:01:57.610> through<00:01:57.880> a<00:01:57.940> resistor<00:01:58.570> which<00:01:59.350> is<00:01:59.380> a

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
that ran through a resistor which is a

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.820 
that ran through a resistor which is a
big<00:02:00.450> half<00:02:01.450> inch<00:02:01.720> wide<00:02:01.930> flat<00:02:02.440> piece<00:02:02.680> of

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
big half inch wide flat piece of

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.020 
big half inch wide flat piece of
nichrome<00:02:03.340> wire<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:04.619> on<00:02:05.619> the<00:02:05.740> first<00:02:05.979> gear<00:02:06.280> it

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
nichrome wire and on the first gear it

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.210 
nichrome wire and on the first gear it
allowed<00:02:07.330> you<00:02:07.540> to<00:02:07.600> go<00:02:07.810> about<00:02:08.050> nine<00:02:08.739> miles<00:02:09.009> an

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
allowed you to go about nine miles an

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.960 
allowed you to go about nine miles an
hour<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.989> second<00:02:11.380> speed<00:02:11.620> was<00:02:11.890> 24<00:02:12.730> volt

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
hour the second speed was 24 volt

six-bed eight batteries tool that the go

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.570 
six-bed eight batteries tool that the go
for<00:02:22.180> about<00:02:22.450> so<00:02:22.780> maybe<00:02:23.260> 19<00:02:23.739> miles<00:02:23.950> an<00:02:24.190> hour<00:02:24.310> or

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
for about so maybe 19 miles an hour or

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:31.820 
for about so maybe 19 miles an hour or
so<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.550> third<00:02:28.060> position<00:02:28.270> was<00:02:29.080> a<00:02:29.700> 48<00:02:30.700> volts

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
so and the third position was a 48 volts

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.180 
so and the third position was a 48 volts
and<00:02:32.830> what<00:02:33.100> it<00:02:33.220> did<00:02:33.340> in<00:02:33.430> 48<00:02:33.850> well<00:02:34.060> it<00:02:34.570> did<00:02:34.780> about

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
and what it did in 48 well it did about

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.150 
and what it did in 48 well it did about
35<00:02:36.190> 38<00:02:36.760> miles<00:02:37.030> an<00:02:37.209> hour<00:02:37.330> depending<00:02:37.690> on<00:02:37.900> the

factors<00:02:43.500> this<00:02:44.500> particular<00:02:44.799> vehicle<00:02:45.130> in<00:02:46.090> a

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
factors this particular vehicle in a

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.910 
factors this particular vehicle in a
summer<00:02:46.390> when<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.140> batteries<00:02:47.440> are<00:02:47.470> nice<00:02:47.709> and

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
summer when the batteries are nice and

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.880 
summer when the batteries are nice and
warm<00:02:48.040> it<00:02:48.220> goes<00:02:48.370> about<00:02:48.549> 36<00:02:49.180> miles<00:02:49.390> an<00:02:49.600> hour<00:02:49.890> and

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
warm it goes about 36 miles an hour and

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.160 
warm it goes about 36 miles an hour and
then<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.160> winter<00:02:51.370> it<00:02:51.549> goes<00:02:51.700> a<00:02:51.730> little<00:02:51.790> slower

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
then the winter it goes a little slower

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.940 
then the winter it goes a little slower
it<00:02:53.170> goes<00:02:53.230> about<00:02:53.590> 33<00:02:54.100> or<00:02:54.130> 74<00:02:54.670> miles<00:02:54.850> an<00:02:55.060> hour<00:02:55.950> and

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
it goes about 33 or 74 miles an hour and

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.390 
it goes about 33 or 74 miles an hour and
believe<00:02:57.850> me<00:02:58.060> a<00:02:58.330> little<00:02:59.140> car<00:02:59.350> like<00:02:59.530> this<00:02:59.709> a<00:03:00.010> mile

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
believe me a little car like this a mile

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.039 
believe me a little car like this a mile
or<00:03:00.579> two<00:03:00.610> hour<00:03:00.910> a<00:03:01.060> difference<00:03:01.480> makes<00:03:01.720> a<00:03:01.900> big

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
or two hour a difference makes a big

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.920 
or two hour a difference makes a big
difference

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.710 

okay<00:03:07.930> let's<00:03:08.379> roll<00:03:08.680> in

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
okay let's roll in

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.050 
okay let's roll in
now<00:03:10.980> this<00:03:11.980> first<00:03:12.190> way<00:03:12.400> I'm<00:03:12.550> going<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:12.760> put<00:03:12.910> on

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
now this first way I'm going to put on

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.820 
now this first way I'm going to put on
let's<00:03:13.870> see<00:03:14.019> which<00:03:14.170> ones<00:03:14.379> I<00:03:14.470> should<00:03:14.530> put<00:03:14.769> on

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
let's see which ones I should put on

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.220 
let's see which ones I should put on
first<00:03:15.160> to<00:03:15.340> make<00:03:15.489> sure<00:03:15.640> I<00:03:15.670> don't<00:03:15.900> get<00:03:16.900> in<00:03:17.050> the

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
first to make sure I don't get in the

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.729 
first to make sure I don't get in the
way<00:03:17.349> of<00:03:17.500> any<00:03:17.680> volts<00:03:18.810> I've<00:03:19.810> got<00:03:19.989> the<00:03:20.110> main<00:03:20.470> power

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
way of any volts I've got the main power

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.190 
way of any volts I've got the main power
wire<00:03:20.830> disconnected<00:03:21.640> so<00:03:21.819> that's<00:03:22.030> why<00:03:22.239> I'm<00:03:23.019> not

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
wire disconnected so that's why I'm not

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.949 
wire disconnected so that's why I'm not
too<00:03:23.380> concerned<00:03:23.620> about<00:03:23.920> it<00:03:24.099> let's<00:03:24.880> see<00:03:25.090> first

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
too concerned about it let's see first

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.910 
too concerned about it let's see first
I'm<00:03:26.200> going<00:03:26.319> to<00:03:26.410> put<00:03:26.590> on<00:03:26.819> is<00:03:27.819> this<00:03:28.120> one<00:03:28.360> here

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
I'm going to put on is this one here

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.009 
I'm going to put on is this one here
this<00:03:29.920> is<00:03:30.099> the<00:03:30.250> main<00:03:30.430> battery<00:03:31.060> power<00:03:31.360> in<00:03:31.690> that

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
this is the main battery power in that

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:45.750 
this is the main battery power in that
comes<00:03:32.530> from<00:03:32.769> the<00:03:32.950> main<00:03:33.280> solar<00:03:33.610> power<00:03:33.989> saw<00:03:34.989> it

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.869 

take<00:03:46.660> off<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:47.050> stickers<00:03:47.530> here<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:51.250> second

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:51.879 
take off the stickers here the second

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:59.780 
take off the stickers here the second
one<00:03:51.970> I'm<00:03:52.060> going<00:03:52.120> to<00:03:52.300> put<00:03:52.420> on<00:03:52.890> is<00:03:53.890> the<00:03:55.410> 48<00:03:56.410> volt<00:03:56.790> -

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
one I'm going to put on is the 48 volt -

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.070 
one I'm going to put on is the 48 volt -
well<00:04:00.790> actually<00:04:00.940> this<00:04:01.180> is<00:04:01.239> the<00:04:01.420> Elana<00:04:01.660> goes<00:04:01.870> to

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
well actually this is the Elana goes to

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.570 
well actually this is the Elana goes to
the<00:04:02.310> motor

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
the motor

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:30.959 
the motor
-

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:30.969 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:32.859 

and<00:04:31.969> to<00:04:32.059> put<00:04:32.209> them<00:04:32.300> on<00:04:32.360> the<00:04:32.449> loose<00:04:32.599> here<00:04:32.779> at

00:04:32.859 --> 00:04:32.869 
and to put them on the loose here at

00:04:32.869 --> 00:04:34.329 
and to put them on the loose here at
first<00:04:33.110> to<00:04:33.289> make<00:04:33.409> sure<00:04:33.559> everything's<00:04:33.949> lined<00:04:34.189> up

00:04:34.329 --> 00:04:34.339 
first to make sure everything's lined up

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:36.989 
first to make sure everything's lined up
correctly<00:04:34.869> they<00:04:35.869> have<00:04:36.050> enough<00:04:36.319> space<00:04:36.559> for<00:04:36.589> the

00:04:36.989 --> 00:04:36.999 
correctly they have enough space for the

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:42.279 
correctly they have enough space for the
the<00:04:37.999> other<00:04:38.119> small<00:04:38.419> control<00:04:38.869> wires<00:04:40.749> yeah<00:04:41.749> this

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
the other small control wires yeah this

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.079 
the other small control wires yeah this
one<00:04:42.499> here<00:04:42.800> is<00:04:43.099> actually<00:04:43.339> this<00:04:43.759> is<00:04:43.909> the<00:04:43.969> one

00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:44.089 
one here is actually this is the one

00:04:44.089 --> 00:05:15.080 
one here is actually this is the one
that<00:04:44.179> goes<00:04:44.300> to<00:04:44.360> be<00:04:44.629> a<00:04:44.659> battery<00:04:45.110> miners

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.969 

and<00:05:16.090> these<00:05:16.240> little<00:05:16.600> control<00:05:17.020> wires<00:05:17.229> this

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
and these little control wires this

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:20.760 
and these little control wires this
first<00:05:18.310> one<00:05:18.520> with<00:05:19.240> a<00:05:19.270> diode<00:05:19.539> on<00:05:19.900> it<00:05:20.020> here<00:05:20.229> that

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
first one with a diode on it here that

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.850 
first one with a diode on it here that
is<00:05:21.009> the<00:05:21.160> the<00:05:21.729> power<00:05:21.970> that<00:05:22.270> turns<00:05:22.539> on<00:05:22.750> the<00:05:22.860> CPU

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
is the the power that turns on the CPU

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.640 
is the the power that turns on the CPU
inside<00:05:24.550> the<00:05:25.000> all<00:05:25.539> tracks<00:05:25.900> controller<00:05:26.320> and

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
inside the all tracks controller and

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.920 
inside the all tracks controller and
then<00:05:27.460> these<00:05:27.610> two<00:05:27.850> the<00:05:28.240> black<00:05:28.509> and<00:05:28.720> the<00:05:28.780> green

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
then these two the black and the green

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.370 
then these two the black and the green
one<00:05:29.169> these<00:05:29.949> go<00:05:30.220> to<00:05:30.280> a<00:05:30.570> thing<00:05:31.570> called<00:05:31.600> a<00:05:31.840> pot<00:05:32.080> box

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
one these go to a thing called a pot box

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.570 
one these go to a thing called a pot box
it's<00:05:32.800> a<00:05:33.210> it's<00:05:34.210> a<00:05:34.830> resistor<00:05:35.830> the<00:05:36.220> variable

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
it's a it's a resistor the variable

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.400 
it's a it's a resistor the variable
resistor<00:05:36.639> that<00:05:37.120> goes<00:05:37.270> to<00:05:37.539> your<00:05:37.690> soldering

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
resistor that goes to your soldering

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:43.860 
resistor that goes to your soldering
fellow<00:05:39.210> and<00:05:40.210> what<00:05:40.419> that<00:05:40.600> does<00:05:41.160> is<00:05:42.360> as<00:05:43.360> a<00:05:43.419> change

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
fellow and what that does is as a change

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.080 
fellow and what that does is as a change
resistance<00:05:44.289> that<00:05:45.039> tells<00:05:45.370> the<00:05:45.550> controller

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
resistance that tells the controller

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:54.200 
resistance that tells the controller
that<00:05:46.680> to<00:05:47.680> go<00:05:47.830> faster<00:05:48.250> or<00:05:48.280> slower

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.909 

there's<00:05:55.210> an<00:05:55.360> additional<00:05:55.750> fourth<00:05:56.050> contact<00:05:56.740> on

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 
there's an additional fourth contact on

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:58.830 
there's an additional fourth contact on
here<00:05:57.160> that<00:05:57.190> I'm<00:05:57.400> not<00:05:57.430> going<00:05:57.580> to<00:05:57.759> use<00:05:57.970> that<00:05:58.300> you

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
here that I'm not going to use that you

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.159 
here that I'm not going to use that you
can<00:05:59.050> use<00:05:59.199> for<00:05:59.590> a<00:05:59.650> half<00:06:00.220> speed<00:06:00.780> in<00:06:01.780> case<00:06:01.990> you

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.169 
can use for a half speed in case you

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:05.790 
can use for a half speed in case you
want<00:06:02.349> to<00:06:03.870> not<00:06:04.870> have<00:06:05.110> full<00:06:05.380> speed<00:06:05.650> in<00:06:05.710> Reverse

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
want to not have full speed in Reverse

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.010 
want to not have full speed in Reverse
those<00:06:06.310> are<00:06:06.430> generally<00:06:06.699> used<00:06:06.880> on<00:06:07.210> golf<00:06:07.389> carts

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
those are generally used on golf carts

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.680 
those are generally used on golf carts
so<00:06:08.680> you<00:06:08.770> won't<00:06:08.949> go<00:06:09.099> turning<00:06:09.910> up<00:06:10.030> backwards<00:06:10.300> on

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:10.690 
so you won't go turning up backwards on

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:11.999 
so you won't go turning up backwards on
the<00:06:10.840> golf<00:06:11.139> cart<00:06:11.349> you<00:06:11.530> don't<00:06:11.650> have<00:06:11.770> full

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:43.290 
like to use the heat sink compound that

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.620 
like to use the heat sink compound that
I<00:06:43.410> got<00:06:43.680> not<00:06:44.520> a<00:06:44.550> bottle<00:06:44.940> of<00:06:44.970> about<00:06:45.180> an<00:06:45.300> ounce<00:06:45.420> or

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:45.630 
I got not a bottle of about an ounce or

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.800 
I got not a bottle of about an ounce or
so<00:06:45.690> was<00:06:46.500> a<00:06:47.060> $7.99<00:06:48.060> so<00:06:48.390> it's<00:06:48.540> not<00:06:48.630> that

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:48.810 
so was a $7.99 so it's not that

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:49.580

piece you can get em cheap or some
places<00:06:53.900> just<00:06:54.900> make<00:06:55.320> sure<00:06:55.470> you<00:06:55.620> observe<00:06:56.520> the

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:56.870 
places just make sure you observe the

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:02.090 
places just make sure you observe the
right<00:06:57.870> polarity<00:06:58.440> ohm<00:06:58.580> and<00:06:59.580> also<00:07:00.090> the<00:07:01.100> right

right polarity ohm and also the right

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.180 
right polarity ohm and also the right
voltage<00:07:02.370> because<00:07:03.030> you<00:07:03.180> don't<00:07:03.330> want<00:07:03.480> to<00:07:04.190> run

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:05.190 
voltage because you don't want to run

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.190 
voltage because you don't want to run
less<00:07:05.460> than<00:07:05.640> 48<00:07:06.030> volts<00:07:06.450> this<00:07:06.600> is<00:07:06.750> a<00:07:06.810> 48<00:07:07.140> volt

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:07.200 
less than 48 volts this is a 48 volt

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.000 
less than 48 volts this is a 48 volt
system<00:07:07.650> here<00:07:07.860> with<00:07:08.130> all<00:07:08.490> tracks<00:07:08.760> 48:44<00:07:10.010> okay

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:11.010 
system here with all tracks 48:44 okay

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.010 
system here with all tracks 48:44 okay
so<00:07:11.070> this<00:07:11.340> one<00:07:11.580> is<00:07:11.880> actually<00:07:12.210> the<00:07:12.450> the<00:07:12.870> main

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.020 
so this one is actually the the main

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.810 
so this one is actually the the main
power<00:07:13.290> for<00:07:13.470> the<00:07:13.530> CPU<00:07:13.890> all<00:07:14.310> the<00:07:14.520> way<00:07:14.580> over<00:07:14.700> on

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:14.820 
power for the CPU all the way over on

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:20.420 
power for the CPU all the way over on
this<00:07:14.970> side<00:07:15.860> next<00:07:16.860> one<00:07:17.010> is<00:07:17.220> the<00:07:19.130> one<00:07:20.130> of<00:07:20.280> the

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:20.430 
this side next one is the one of the

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:24.110 
this side next one is the one of the
throttle<00:07:21.180> top<00:07:22.050> boxes<00:07:22.470> half<00:07:23.460> of<00:07:23.610> it<00:07:23.730> and<00:07:23.940> here's

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 
throttle top boxes half of it and here's

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.400 
throttle top boxes half of it and here's
the<00:07:24.270> other<00:07:24.360> half<00:07:24.800> in<00:07:25.800> position<00:07:26.310> for<00:07:27.230> which<00:07:28.230> I'm

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:28.410 
the other half in position for which I'm

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:29.600 
the other half in position for which I'm
going<00:07:28.500> to<00:07:28.560> leave<00:07:28.710> open<00:07:28.860> like<00:07:29.130> I<00:07:29.160> said<00:07:29.460> as<00:07:29.550> a

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:29.610 
going to leave open like I said as a

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.050 
going to leave open like I said as a
half<00:07:29.790> speed<00:07:30.000> throttle<00:07:31.070> that's<00:07:32.070> as<00:07:32.520> easy<00:07:32.760> it<00:07:32.970> is

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:33.060 
half speed throttle that's as easy it is

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:38.970 
half speed throttle that's as easy it is
for<00:07:33.090> putting<00:07:33.480> up<00:07:33.690> the<00:07:33.810> all<00:07:33.990> tracks<00:07:34.260> controller

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:42.250 
go ahead and start up and see what

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:45.179 
go ahead and start up and see what
happens<00:07:42.610> here

00:07:45.179 --> 00:07:45.189 

00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:47.499 

that's<00:07:46.189> the<00:07:46.370> main<00:07:46.550> power<00:07:46.819> relay<00:07:47.150> and<00:07:47.419> the

that's the main power relay and the

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:49.659 
that's the main power relay and the
first<00:07:47.780> of<00:07:47.930> all<00:07:47.990> blank<00:07:48.289> means<00:07:48.560> it's<00:07:48.949> booting<00:07:49.580> up

00:07:49.659 --> 00:07:49.669 
first of all blank means it's booting up

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:59.640 
first of all blank means it's booting up
the<00:07:49.939> second<00:07:50.300> link<00:07:50.449> means<00:07:50.749> it's<00:07:51.050> green
