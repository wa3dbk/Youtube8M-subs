to earn it back by doing challenges

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.780 
to earn it back by doing challenges
another<00:00:31.650> important<00:00:32.070> thing<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.550> only

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
another important thing is that you only

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.310 
another important thing is that you only
have<00:00:32.910> three<00:00:33.120> them<00:00:33.210> at<00:00:33.329> one<00:00:33.510> time<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:34.140> these

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
have three them at one time so these

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.780 
have three them at one time so these
will<00:00:34.440> actually<00:00:34.559> be<00:00:34.829> taken<00:00:35.130> into<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.430> game<00:00:35.610> and

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
will actually be taken into the game and

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.190 
will actually be taken into the game and
you<00:00:35.820> just<00:00:35.940> can<00:00:36.059> actually<00:00:36.450> use<00:00:36.540> these<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:36.960> game

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
you just can actually use these in game

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.690 
you just can actually use these in game
you<00:00:37.620> can't<00:00:37.890> take<00:00:38.040> all<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.250> them<00:00:38.430> at<00:00:38.520> one<00:00:38.670> time

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
you can't take all of them at one time

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.760 
you can't take all of them at one time
you<00:00:39.059> guess<00:00:39.149> we'll<00:00:39.300> use<00:00:39.450> three<00:00:39.750> so<00:00:40.590> right<00:00:40.739> here

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.890 
idea though about burn cards is as long
as<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.670> guys<00:01:11.760> are<00:01:11.820> alive<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.450> guys<00:01:12.540> will<00:01:12.689> keep

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
as you guys are alive you guys will keep

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.510 
as you guys are alive you guys will keep
the<00:01:12.990> ability<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.740> for<00:01:13.920> instance<00:01:13.950> if<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.400> guys

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
the ability so for instance if you guys

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.160 
the ability so for instance if you guys
are<00:01:14.640> destroyed<00:01:15.000> doing<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.360> great<00:01:15.659> job<00:01:15.689> in

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170
