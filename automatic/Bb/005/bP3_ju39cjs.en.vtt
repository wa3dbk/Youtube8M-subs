00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
like like it's nothing to do about that

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.130 
like like it's nothing to do about that
now<00:01:49.409> i<00:01:49.590> just<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.159> move<00:01:50.310> on<00:01:50.490> i<00:01:50.880> think<00:01:51.479> i<00:01:51.540> did

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
results and then it puts pressure on it

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.389 
results and then it puts pressure on it
and<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.450> gaff<00:02:00.600> own<00:02:01.009> puts<00:02:02.009> pressure<00:02:02.159> on<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399
