 the desserts cover 30% of the surface of the land mass of the 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.090
 nation after the oceans are the largest carbon sink on earth 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.090
 although a vital part of the planet's natural carbon balance 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.770
 ripley deforestation on a global scale continues at an alarming rate 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.160
 although it mostly affects charros that is tropical of those things 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.590
 in europe our forest mass 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.160
 increased in an area close to the size of Greece check the fifteen years 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.520
 elapsed since 1990 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.440
 to 2005 kenchil and that growth is not continuous at a rate of 661 thousand 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.760
 hectares per year about the size of three football fields 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.930
 every hour of the day and night 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.640
 york on the European forests in the end it was a carbon storage 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.080
 between 150 thousand and 200 billion tons of carbon dioxide in the 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.590
 country to which are added one thousand 500 million tons with ax 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.880
 about 10% of global carbon dioxide emissions chis 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.090
 -pri- produces more than 90% of all the wood we use in Europe 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.960
 what is the best way to use Europe's growing forest mass to 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.250
 help fight climate change 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.630
 use more wood 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.570
 if the trees that grow by photosynthesis as we grow 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.840
 they absorb carbon dioxide and product in oxygen returns to when it is made 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.490
 a forest harvest the majority of the carbon dioxide stored in the 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.930
 tree 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.350
 remains in the product made with wood recession without because the 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.970
 European forests continue to expand vote the carbon 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.240
 stored in the log made with wood represents a clear benefit 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.270
 added the sic this is the carbon sink effect which implies that 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.870
 wood is better than a material with zero carbon emission from scooters and that 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.179
 The more wood that is used in the building, the smaller the footprint of the 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.849
 carbon in europe 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.999
 The carbon stored in wood products eliminates 220 million 

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:18.280
 tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.690
 The stud amount that increases annually amounts to 20 million 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.160
 tons of carbon dioxide as the volume of products from 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.670
 wood or metal was present the use of more wood also 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.260
 helps to increase the carbon sink effect of forests because 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.940
 mature trees that absorb less carbon dioxide co2 are replaced 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.330
 by new and vigorous trees for as demanded by law throughout Europe and 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.510
 the prosperous market 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.730
 encourage investment in the future growth of Spain third the 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.260
 use of products of their materials at home even greater for the 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.800
 reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in construction 

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:57.419
 because wood products are better than so-called products 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:01.129
 natural resources in carbon, the more wood from managed forests 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.989
 sustainable way we use more carbon dioxide will be eliminated from 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.119
 the atmosphere must be added to this saving carbon dioxide derivative 

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:12.129
 of the preferences of the use of the wood before materials of high consumption 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.780
 Beni energy as concrete bricks steel spa 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.430
 wood products can cause a significant effect on the emissions of 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.100
 greenhouse gases raptors every cubic meter of wood used 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.340
 instead of another construction material it reduces around one 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.389
 ton of carbon dioxide 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.989
 the benefits of using wood that can be improved with all the 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.829
 extending the life of the product through a good design without 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.639
 regular maintenance managed to reuse be of products such as pallets on stage 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.199
 two panels and beams floor recycling 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:44.680
 and by using wood waste as a biomass fuel 

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:47.679
 without emotion of carbon 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:52.579
 the wood is that it is the natural solution for a low carbon construction 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.610
 The Edinburgh Center for Carbon Management has developed an indicator 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:57.230
 carbon 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.700
 to identify the carbon savings rate using 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.279
 different materials 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:06.899
 He explained that although he won three bedroom townhouse built in brick 

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:10.849
 and concrete offers a carbon footprint of 20 tons of carbon dioxide 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.429
 explained that just by replacing the concrete blocks with a structure 

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:18.709
 of wood, three tons of hashish are emitted because one can 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.159
 lower emission through greater use of wood from both the interior and the 

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:26.370
 exterior floors, windows and dry wood paneling are included 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.919
 86 percent less emissions 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.009
 this in this school has been used solid wood for its structure 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.909
 The carbon indicator has shown a carbon footprint of the materials 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:41.659
 negative of -40 eat 9 tons of carbon dioxide thanks to wood 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:43.699
 solid 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:47.930
 melzer a study in sweden has compared the figures of carbon dioxide between 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.870
 two four-storey buildings some with wooden structure and the other with 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.139
 Concrete structure for a period of one hundred years 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.419
 the concrete building showed emissions of around 96 tons 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:03.729
 of carbon dioxide while the wooden building showed a kidnapping 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:06.729
 total of 150 tons of carbon dioxide 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.419
 Due to the low natural thermal conductivity of wood, using wood is 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.499
 a very competitive way to achieve buildings with high thermal efficiency 

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:20.080
 so a greater use of wood is one of the simplest forms of 

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:23.699
 build a low carbon economy and help fight change 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:27.889
 climatic create healthy and durable precious products 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.130
 promotes sustainable forest management and offers significant reductions in 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.889
 carbon dioxide emissions 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:38.789
 Faced with climate change inf uses wood
