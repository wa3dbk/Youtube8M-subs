i'm researching the bezel ER and that

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.890 
i'm researching the bezel ER and that
becomes<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.910> range<00:00:24.119> unit<00:00:24.449> which<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:24.750> actually

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
becomes a range unit which is actually

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.410 
becomes a range unit which is actually
in<00:00:25.109> fortree<00:00:25.470> unit<00:00:25.740> but<00:00:26.550> in<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.939> Lightman<00:00:27.269> age

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
the problem with this resource this base

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.090 
the problem with this resource this base
layout<00:01:29.830> it's<00:01:30.130> actually<00:01:30.460> nothing<00:01:30.640> that<00:01:31.030> at<00:01:31.120> all

his<00:02:18.440> archers<00:02:20.230> see<00:02:21.230> how<00:02:21.320> to<00:02:21.380> understand<00:02:21.830> this

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
his archers see how to understand this

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.190 
his archers see how to understand this
it<00:02:22.100> says<00:02:22.250> one<00:02:22.430> star<00:02:22.730> but<00:02:23.330> he<00:02:23.690> got<00:02:23.810> seventy<00:02:24.050> four

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
it says one star but he got seventy four

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.980 
it says one star but he got seventy four
percent<00:02:24.230> so<00:02:24.650> that<00:02:24.800> should<00:02:24.950> be<00:02:24.980> four<00:02:25.280> stars<00:02:25.990> who

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
percent so that should be four stars who

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.120 
percent so that should be four stars who
knows<00:02:27.200> why<00:02:27.440> it's<00:02:28.340> pi<00:02:28.550> just<00:02:28.610> a<00:02:28.880> glitch<00:02:29.090> yeah

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
knows why it's pi just a glitch yeah

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.070 
knows why it's pi just a glitch yeah
because<00:02:31.130> he<00:02:31.310> definitely<00:02:31.630> he<00:02:32.630> definitely<00:02:32.780> got

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
because he definitely he definitely got

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.630 
because he definitely he definitely got
I<00:02:33.260> think<00:02:33.530> he<00:02:33.590> got<00:02:33.710> the<00:02:33.800> quick<00:02:33.920> victory<00:02:34.190> he

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
I think he got the quick victory he

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.320 
I think he got the quick victory he
should<00:02:34.850> have<00:02:35.000> at<00:02:35.120> least<00:02:35.150> in<00:02:35.780> my<00:02:35.930> opinion<00:02:37.330> okay

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
should have at least in my opinion okay

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.870 
should have at least in my opinion okay
so<00:02:38.390> let's<00:02:38.840> see<00:02:39.020> the<00:02:39.350> another<00:02:39.560> replay<00:02:39.860> I<00:02:40.160> don't

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
so let's see the another replay I don't

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.070 
so let's see the another replay I don't
have<00:02:40.970> I<00:02:41.120> don't<00:02:41.150> have<00:02:41.300> that<00:02:41.510> many<00:02:41.600> replays

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
have I don't have that many replays

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.540 
have I don't have that many replays
actually<00:02:42.590> because<00:02:43.070> you<00:02:43.190> know<00:02:43.310> they<00:02:43.430> get

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
actually because you know they get

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.500 
actually because you know they get
deleted<00:02:43.850> after<00:02:44.150> a<00:02:44.330> while<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:44.840> so<00:02:45.680> this<00:02:45.980> one

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
deleted after a while and so this one

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.480 
deleted after a while and so this one
and<00:02:47.510> he<00:02:47.660> five<00:02:47.870> stars<00:02:48.140> me<00:02:48.320> and<00:02:48.530> I<00:02:49.070> remember<00:02:49.370> this

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
and he five stars me and I remember this

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.390 
and he five stars me and I remember this
guy<00:02:49.670> because<00:02:50.060> he<00:02:50.210> was<00:02:50.300> loved<00:02:50.510> one<00:02:50.630> hundred<00:02:51.020> and

great<00:03:43.640> strategy<00:03:44.090> I<00:03:44.330> should<00:03:44.660> start<00:03:44.870> using<00:03:44.960> it

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
great strategy I should start using it

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.590 
great strategy I should start using it
more<00:03:45.260> it<00:03:45.680> would<00:03:45.740> be<00:03:45.860> very<00:03:46.220> useful<00:03:46.340> I<00:03:46.730> think<00:03:46.970> he

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
more it would be very useful I think he

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.540 
more it would be very useful I think he
used<00:03:47.780> to<00:03:47.840> protect<00:03:48.170> in<00:03:48.320> the<00:03:48.410> middle<00:03:48.680> I'm<00:03:49.400> not

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
used to protect in the middle I'm not

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.580 
used to protect in the middle I'm not
sure<00:03:49.610> why<00:03:49.940> though<00:03:50.150> because<00:03:50.420> this<00:03:51.320> trip<00:03:51.470> she

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
sure why though because this trip she

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.710 
sure why though because this trip she
didn't<00:03:51.830> find<00:03:51.950> in<00:03:52.100> the<00:03:52.190> middle<00:03:52.459> I<00:03:52.490> mean<00:03:52.730> the

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
didn't find in the middle I mean the

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.850 
didn't find in the middle I mean the
only<00:03:53.780> do<00:03:53.990> that<00:03:54.110> might<00:03:54.290> be<00:03:54.410> able<00:03:54.470> to<00:03:54.590> take<00:03:54.709> them

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
only do that might be able to take them

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.980 
only do that might be able to take them
out<00:03:54.980> as<00:03:55.130> my<00:03:55.280> castle<00:03:55.850> but<00:03:56.120> my<00:03:56.480> mortar<00:03:56.840> is

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
out as my castle but my mortar is

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.199 
out as my castle but my mortar is
definitely<00:03:57.470> not<00:03:57.560> gonna<00:03:57.709> kill<00:03:57.920> itself<00:03:58.250> and

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
definitely not gonna kill itself and

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:00.430 
definitely not gonna kill itself and
it's<00:03:59.570> gonna<00:03:59.690> take<00:03:59.840> a<00:03:59.870> while<00:04:00.050> for<00:04:00.110> them<00:04:00.380> to

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
it's gonna take a while for them to

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.100 
it's gonna take a while for them to
break<00:04:00.680> the<00:04:00.800> wall<00:04:00.950> anyways<00:04:01.400> so<00:04:01.900> his<00:04:02.900> other

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
break the wall anyways so his other

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.350 
break the wall anyways so his other
troops<00:04:03.380> are<00:04:03.500> making<00:04:03.830> way<00:04:04.130> around<00:04:04.459> you<00:04:05.090> know<00:04:05.209> my

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
base basically so unless I take up these

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.210 
base basically so unless I take up these
two<00:04:08.120> units<00:04:08.480> right<00:04:08.630> here<00:04:08.900> you<00:04:09.530> know<00:04:09.650> the<00:04:09.860> mortar

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
two units right here you know the mortar

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.250
