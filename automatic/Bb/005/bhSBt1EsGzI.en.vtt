 Will in any shape or color 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.819
 put number 4 maybe I was a powerful 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.069
 akatsuki member who captured 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.680
 successfully to the jean script and the zombie 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.709
 rossi by itself despite pointing 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.569
 the exceptional powers of his opponent 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.700
 it was a difficult struggle on its own 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.519
 admission maybe I just complained that 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.980
 he was a little tired he was also able 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.019
 of killing his former master despite 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.959
 that his superior had to be healthy in that 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.209
 moment put 'number three' death was 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.090
 trained by the very same will kill that 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.889
 he spent most of his techniques 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.170
 knowledge and attitude towards him as 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.939
 adult death became a ninja 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.620
 very powerful and dangerous with their 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:52.470
 skills of being an image almost 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.189
 speculate about killing the job itself 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.439
 number 2 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:57.900
 hitachi was a great connoisseur of all 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:03:00.359
 clan or chia techniques especially 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.040
 the capabilities of sharing in 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:04.319
 hitachi techniques was like a 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.019
 presence of bodies both in the unjust 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.030
 as in the genius for example was able 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.159
 of creating a clone that was greatly divided 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.380
 number of bodies and these attacked the 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:15.900
 opponent with several shuriken 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.180
 and finally the number one position as 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.980
 leader of akatsuki nothing all was a ninja 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.050
 extremely powerful who was 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.330
 considered by the other members as 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.280
 the strongest in the organization of 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.560
 cats has been seen using the course 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.420
 change of shape that allows you to hang 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.280
 members of akatsuki using 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.140
 human sacrifices that those same 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.870
 members control and can use 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.080
 to face enemies instead 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.300
 ring egan far exceeds the sharing an 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.330
 and this is all this is my opinion about 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.370
 the strongest akatsuki says which 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.190
 are for you the akatsuki is stronger or 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.340
 if you agree with my opinion up 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.340
 then
