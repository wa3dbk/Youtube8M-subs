00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:12.000

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.340

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.260
 I want to pass on to you first as 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.600
 and I got my first surfboard to 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.020
 My first board is I asked. 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.369
 I was 11 years old when I won 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.050
 My first board I filled the bag. 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.910
 from my father to me not to fill the 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.160
 work only that he came to me and spoke 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.710
 You 're a guy who makes many kinds of 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.680
 sport every hour to drop the sport does 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.230
 basketball favor he does soccer and quits 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.570
 Back I'm not going to give you a new board 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.309
 for you to play the clipboard put to 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.050
 skip what I can do for you and 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.100
 give a used surfboard and you start with 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.710
 a judge 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.050
 I went to the water learning to surf with 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.910
 her I started surfing yes for you 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.610
 have an idea so what I recommend 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.160
 that you do this first 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.829
 instance is not to invest in a board 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.420
 New is because you do not know if you do not 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.550
 like to surf 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.729
 I 'll tell you the same thing as mine. 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.430
 Dad told me that it worked. 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.680
 It's true that it works, it's not everyone. 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.830
 What are you going to like in the sofa? 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.630
 So buy a used plank starts 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.180
 with a used surfboard you do not know if 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.610
 will start to like the sofa over time 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.650
 You'll learn this board the six 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.290
 eight months if you saw that it really is this 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.540
 you will want to do this that 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.299
 sofa and will want to have a fright as your 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.880
 sport then you will learn to surf 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.280
 this board used for a while right 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.939
 Are you going to buy her tea? I liked the sofa. 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.890
 and exchange the used board with a new one 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.720
 week later do not do it there will not 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.600
 it's worth you bought this 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.070
 The board used so much uses its 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.110
 first board this first board 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.630
 What are you going to buy later? 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.820
 a year later, and then you 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.890
 change because the board interferes 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.380
 its dirty but how are you getting 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.790
 surfing starting to learn just not 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.310
 it's worth you to buy a surfboard 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.009
 new one really is not worth it's me 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.750
 I have and I try several friends. 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.439
 shapes are professionals who make 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.100
 board 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:13.070
 Can you be sure that I know what? 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.660
 talking and they even talk recommend the 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.910
 same thing for beginners 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.740
 because the new plank a plank o 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.300
 investment is much more expensive leaves 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.850
 to buy your first new board 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.640
 when you actually want to date you 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.730
 surf this board she has to come by 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.310
 less comdec is the deck is that part 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.260
 behind the board where it is an influenza 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.870
 before the deck is nothing more than the old 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.490
 occupant or pec you kick is the foot that goes 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.630
 stay behind so if you kick with the 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.630
 left 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.940
 This is the foot that will be behind on the beach. 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.340
 So that foot and it will stay on the plank he 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.780
 need to have supported a deck have people 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.140
 who does not surf comdec 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.060
 but are people who are already there and already am a fan 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.400
 long time already knowing for you that you are 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.620
 starting you need to have a deck there is 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.450
 What is this anti-flu before I show? 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.850
 that on the screen now that is the deck where he 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.590
 stay there 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.540
 you have to decide whether you should or 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.590
 no if you have not you will buy one 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.410
 deck're 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.630
 the deck one costs more than it's a deck 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.250
 good will like it can not cost more than 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.840
 that 50 to 60 reais 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.210
 The last thing you 'll buy is just the 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.280
 strep is a string that you tie in 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.740
 foot and this has no mystery will also be 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.200
 pays another 30 40 reais to the board one of 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.720
 value of the board the board can buy 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.750
 a board of up to 200 reais 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.420
 It's great, great, if you think 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.120
 JosÃ © dos dos reis a board is seminova 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.280
 What users are not using you can 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.500
 up to 150 and 170 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.560
 You can look for a good deal on lx. 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.720
 a Facebook surfing group that has 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.960
 enough there you will be able to find 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.240
 planks used in good condition or 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.590
 do you go someone who already surfs who has 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.170
 a loophole to buy your first 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.700
 board to take a look at the province 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.710
 board not reformed 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.830
 if she does not have a time that we 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.990
 flame is when the practice has already been is every 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.480
 A haven to have broken has already hit a 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.370
 work somewhere and broke and the 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.560
 The person who repaired left some 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.870
 faults so you can see if 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.650
 was actually fixed or not 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.419
 Plank has been the concert not so 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.700
 avoid press that were broken 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.590
 totally the middle is you owe a mark 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.440
 half of the board that forms the board 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.240
 that you call someone to see this 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.760
 plank to see if she's cool if not 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.740
 Is this board you going to buy? 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.720
 I'd rather you buy one already. 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.710
 the board with which it does not have a 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.270
 problem to stay is to fit keel is 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.160
 buying keel 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.590
 if they do not pay the 100 reais more or 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.350
 least on a set of islands 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.490
 so buy a board that already already 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.340
 come the keels 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.590

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.010
 You kick the cord, we call it stress. 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.650

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:07.590
