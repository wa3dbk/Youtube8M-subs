I believe that the picture quality

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.709 
I believe that the picture quality
itself<00:00:38.110> is<00:00:39.250> really<00:00:40.250> impressive<00:00:40.910> for<00:00:41.120> that

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
itself is really impressive for that

kind of price range video quality was a
little<00:00:46.700> more<00:00:47.180> so<00:00:47.480> so<00:00:48.670> kind<00:00:49.670> of<00:00:49.760> mediocre<00:00:50.000> with

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
little more so so kind of mediocre with

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.299 
little more so so kind of mediocre with
the<00:00:50.629> best<00:00:50.870> in<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:51.110> world<00:00:53.050> but<00:00:54.050> video<00:00:54.379> you<00:00:54.500> need

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309

good audio and this thing that not got

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.630 
good audio and this thing that not got
the<00:00:57.829> best<00:00:58.100> audio<00:00:58.550> in<00:00:58.820> the<00:00:58.940> world<00:01:00.160> it's<00:01:01.160> okay

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640

this<00:01:04.879> camera<00:01:05.360> to<00:01:05.600> me<00:01:05.840> is<00:01:06.140> primarily<00:01:07.070> made<00:01:07.910> for

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
this camera to me is primarily made for

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.890 
this camera to me is primarily made for
taking<00:01:09.440> pictures<00:01:10.180> and<00:01:11.180> maybe<00:01:11.420> the<00:01:11.600> occasional

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
taking pictures and maybe the occasional

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.010 
taking pictures and maybe the occasional
video<00:01:12.610> but<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:13.700> audio<00:01:13.729> quality<00:01:14.240> is<00:01:14.630> not<00:01:14.810> very

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
video but the audio quality is not very

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.750 
video but the audio quality is not very
good<00:01:15.460> in<00:01:16.460> my<00:01:16.729> opinion<00:01:17.240> is<00:01:17.360> kind<00:01:17.600> of<00:01:17.659> bad<00:01:18.760> flash

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
good in my opinion is kind of bad flash

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.630 
good in my opinion is kind of bad flash
works<00:01:20.150> really<00:01:20.510> good<00:01:21.070> have<00:01:22.070> no<00:01:22.189> problem<00:01:22.580> with

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
works really good have no problem with

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.280 
works really good have no problem with
flash<00:01:22.939> the<00:01:23.210> only<00:01:23.450> problem<00:01:23.869> that<00:01:23.900> I<00:01:24.049> ran<00:01:24.259> into

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
flash the only problem that I ran into

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.219 
flash the only problem that I ran into
was<00:01:24.920> those<00:01:25.100> times<00:01:25.520> when<00:01:25.759> I<00:01:25.850> was<00:01:26.659> recording<00:01:27.049> the

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
was those times when I was recording the

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.950 
was those times when I was recording the
video<00:01:27.590> and<00:01:28.220> I<00:01:28.490> would<00:01:28.700> push<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.210> button<00:01:29.869> to

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
video and I would push the button to

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.539 
video and I would push the button to
stop<00:01:30.229> it<00:01:30.470> and<00:01:30.619> the<00:01:30.770> camera<00:01:31.070> would<00:01:31.189> just<00:01:31.340> cut

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
stop it and the camera would just cut

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.810 
stop it and the camera would just cut
off<00:01:31.729> and<00:01:32.920> you<00:01:33.920> have<00:01:34.100> to<00:01:34.280> open<00:01:34.549> the<00:01:34.610> battery

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
off and you have to open the battery

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.210 
off and you have to open the battery
door<00:01:35.030> and<00:01:35.570> shut<00:01:35.960> it<00:01:36.049> back<00:01:36.259> begin<00:01:36.680> to<00:01:36.860> cut<00:01:37.009> back

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
door and shut it back begin to cut back

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.030 
door and shut it back begin to cut back
on<00:01:37.430> but<00:01:37.729> at<00:01:37.820> least<00:01:37.970> it<00:01:38.180> did<00:01:38.329> save<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.780> video<00:01:39.040> so

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
on but at least it did save the video so

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.810 
on but at least it did save the video so
that<00:01:40.310> was<00:01:40.490> a<00:01:40.520> good<00:01:40.850> thing<00:01:41.030> but<00:01:42.579> that's<00:01:43.579> just

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
that was a good thing but that's just

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.539 
that was a good thing but that's just
one<00:01:44.000> little<00:01:44.150> minor<00:01:44.390> problem<00:01:44.930> that<00:01:45.049> I<00:01:45.079> have<00:01:45.549> but

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
one little minor problem that I have but

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.700 
one little minor problem that I have but
yeah<00:01:46.729> I<00:01:47.000> really<00:01:47.329> think<00:01:47.630> this<00:01:47.720> is<00:01:47.900> a<00:01:47.930> good

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
yeah I really think this is a good

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.730
