so let's try here the waffles um this

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.100 
so let's try here the waffles um this
one<00:02:03.100> is<00:02:03.220> the<00:02:03.340> partial<00:02:03.580> one<00:02:03.880> I<00:02:04.060> usually<00:02:04.930> like<00:02:05.080> to

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
one is the partial one I usually like to

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.440 
one is the partial one I usually like to
spread<00:02:05.500> it<00:02:05.650> put<00:02:06.580> a<00:02:06.610> little<00:02:06.820> better<00:02:07.030> on<00:02:07.119> them

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
spread it put a little better on them

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.430 
spread it put a little better on them
and<00:02:07.690> then<00:02:08.679> I<00:02:08.920> use<00:02:09.130> maple<00:02:09.880> syrup<00:02:10.290> you<00:02:11.290> don't

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
and then I use maple syrup you don't

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.750 
and then I use maple syrup you don't
need<00:02:11.590> to<00:02:11.680> use<00:02:11.800> an<00:02:11.920> absorber<00:02:12.280> of<00:02:12.370> course<00:02:12.610> you

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
need to use an absorber of course you

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.250 
need to use an absorber of course you
can<00:02:12.910> just<00:02:13.060> use<00:02:13.180> fresh<00:02:13.569> fruit<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:13.870> honey
