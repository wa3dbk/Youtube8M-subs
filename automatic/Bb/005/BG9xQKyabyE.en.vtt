 Spanish then I want to take it out for 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.379

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.239
 useful and as in the title mediafire people 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.420

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.340
 he introduced them to us well we speak 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.440
 make us get closer to 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.539
 the screen to see this first in the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.190
 austro you can find here is the 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.559
 nidia fire application what can you 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.019
 download completely free and what 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.480

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.020
 there is no other company that offers you 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.910
 50 gb free now completely the 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.100
 limitations are how big are the 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.680
 files that you can upload then 2 to 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.900
 200 megabytes quite small you can 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.930
 pay service to have a bigger 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.510
 but if they are only documents or songs 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.720
 or things like that you're more than good with that 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:39.390
 space to upload 200 megabytes and have 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.370
 50 gigabytes of total access to what is 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.780
 something is this application is not for 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.710
 android is also wants to show that 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.470

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.000
 little bit more inside I have my account and 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.130
 I sometimes go up things like they see 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.810
 here if you want to go download my song 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.820
 is in the description because to fight to 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.490
 through mediafire when not yet 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.860
 is for ios here I have my song 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.960
 and I can completely access the 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.770
 song now let's see if we can 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.770
 play here 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.879
 you can listen to what my song is 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:18.319
 completely super super well I know that in 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.480
 the screen is seeing black right now 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.120
 but on my screen it just says connected 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.800
 to what is the system is in the but 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.920
 If you can listen, let's see if 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.050
 yes no no no no I will not be able to disconnect it 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.440
 but that way you can practically see the screen 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.240
 when is another piece of video that 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.550
 I was recording for another channel to 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.010
 you are seeing it black 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.600
 there you are watching is the video inside the 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.580
 clear phone the image comes out for 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.650
 that you all can see what it is 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.720
 that image but good people there 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.690
 you can practically understand me 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.640
 how to access all this apart from that 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.190
 has many very good options if 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.690
 you touch the blue button allows you to 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:03.000
 upload any photo directly to you 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.580
 likewise upload photos or download here 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.280

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.680
 create files then out also I 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.290
 like what it is to all the others 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.880
 options you can send by mail what 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.860
 which is the link for people to go 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.260
 to download you can do it and I 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.050
 you can copy the link you can do to 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.850
 change the name if you do not like it 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.710

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.540

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.970
 put in file you can move it 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.470
 you can delete that is the application 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.640
 it works super well and is completely 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.790
