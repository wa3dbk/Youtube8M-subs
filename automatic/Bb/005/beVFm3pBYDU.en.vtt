00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
that the reason this is done is so you

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.219 
that the reason this is done is so you
can't<00:01:47.579> just<00:01:47.729> simply<00:01:48.030> drop<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.869> full<00:01:49.079> auto

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
that to go full auto you'd also need a

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.950

let<00:02:01.439> me<00:02:01.530> see<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:02.119> could<00:02:03.119> show<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.299> guys<00:02:03.390> here<00:02:03.780> to

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
let me see I could show you guys here to

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.289 
let me see I could show you guys here to
see<00:02:03.930> this<00:02:04.020> part<00:02:04.320> where<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.500> screw<00:02:04.680> driver<00:02:04.799> is

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
see this part where the screw driver is

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.660 
see this part where the screw driver is
and<00:02:06.299> I'm<00:02:06.360> going<00:02:06.570> in<00:02:06.689> there<00:02:07.310> like<00:02:08.310> right<00:02:08.489> here

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
and I'm going in there like right here

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.510 
and I'm going in there like right here
this<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.910> milled<00:02:09.209> out<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:10.379> you'd<00:02:11.340> have<00:02:11.370> a

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
this is milled out so you'd have a

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.220 
this is milled out so you'd have a
trigger<00:02:11.849> retarder

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
trigger retarder

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.780 
trigger retarder
there's<00:02:13.709> a<00:02:13.770> little<00:02:13.920> bit<00:02:14.069> of<00:02:14.099> metal<00:02:14.610> shavings

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
there's a little bit of metal shavings

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.270 
there's a little bit of metal shavings
in<00:02:15.060> there<00:02:15.360> your<00:02:15.900> trigger<00:02:16.170> if<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:16.739> did<00:02:17.250> just

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
in there your trigger if you did just

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.680 
in there your trigger if you did just
throw<00:02:17.610> in<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.760> full<00:02:17.940> auto<00:02:18.090> trigger<00:02:18.269> group<00:02:18.540> it

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
throw in a full auto trigger group it

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.720 
throw in a full auto trigger group it
wouldn't<00:02:18.900> go<00:02:18.989> full<00:02:19.200> anyway<00:02:19.560> because<00:02:20.370> their

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
wouldn't go full anyway because their

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.020 
wouldn't go full anyway because their
trigger<00:02:21.360> retarder<00:02:21.870> isn't<00:02:22.110> activating<00:02:22.590> the

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
trigger retarder isn't activating the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.540 
trigger retarder isn't activating the
disconnect<00:02:24.030> er<00:02:24.200> but<00:02:25.200> still<00:02:25.620> if<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:26.190> do<00:02:26.370> buy<00:02:26.519> a

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
disconnect er but still if you do buy a

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.960 
disconnect er but still if you do buy a
full<00:02:26.849> auto<00:02:27.030> trigger<00:02:27.360> group<00:02:27.980> it<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:29.670> you

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
full auto trigger group it you you you

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.970 
full auto trigger group it you you you
are<00:02:30.060> still<00:02:30.300> violating<00:02:30.930> NFA<00:02:31.349> rule<00:02:31.620> so<00:02:31.830> if<00:02:31.890> you

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
are still violating NFA rule so if you

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.180 
are still violating NFA rule so if you
put<00:02:32.160> it<00:02:32.280> in<00:02:32.370> your<00:02:32.430> gun<00:02:32.900> I<00:02:33.900> just<00:02:34.890> bought<00:02:35.040> the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
put it in your gun I just bought the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.110 
put it in your gun I just bought the
shell<00:02:35.400> just<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.760> be<00:02:35.849> in<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.030> safe<00:02:36.209> side<00:02:36.470> so<00:02:37.470> I

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
shell just to be in the safe side so I

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.640 
shell just to be in the safe side so I
like<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.239> said<00:02:39.450> there's<00:02:39.660> this<00:02:39.959> has<00:02:40.200> no<00:02:40.380> trigger

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
like I said there's this has no trigger

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.930 
like I said there's this has no trigger
retarder<00:02:41.130> in<00:02:41.220> there<00:02:41.340> as<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.459> can<00:02:41.549> clearly<00:02:41.819> see

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
retarder in there as you can clearly see

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.089 
retarder in there as you can clearly see
it's<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.930> semi<00:02:43.170> only<00:02:43.530> trigger<00:02:43.799> group<00:02:45.950> but<00:02:46.950> what

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
it's a semi only trigger group but what

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.830 
it's a semi only trigger group but what
I<00:02:47.130> had<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.400> do<00:02:47.519> here<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.819> make<00:02:48.000> this<00:02:48.180> fit<00:02:48.480> is

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
I had to do here to make this fit is

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.330 
I had to do here to make this fit is
when<00:02:49.110> this<00:02:49.290> comes<00:02:49.560> there's<00:02:49.860> just<00:02:50.069> a<00:02:50.130> little

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
when this comes there's just a little

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.940 
when this comes there's just a little
square<00:02:50.610> hole<00:02:50.849> there<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:52.079> have<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.349> file<00:02:52.620> this

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
square hole there you have to file this

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.039 
square hole there you have to file this
down<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.060> metal<00:02:54.329> cut<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.690> metal<00:02:54.840> out

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
down to the metal cut the metal out

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.470 
down to the metal cut the metal out
right<00:02:55.260> here<00:02:55.349> cut<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.680> metal<00:02:55.829> out<00:02:56.040> right<00:02:56.190> there

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
right here cut the metal out right there

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.020 
right here cut the metal out right there
file<00:02:57.480> these<00:02:57.720> even<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.349> measure<00:02:58.590> so<00:02:59.340> it<00:02:59.549> you

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
file these even and measure so it you

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.069 
file these even and measure so it you
know<00:03:00.150> there<00:03:00.360> isn't<00:03:00.450> wobble

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
know there isn't wobble

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.319 
know there isn't wobble
it's<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.069> quite<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.370> process<00:03:02.940> it<00:03:03.060> took<00:03:03.209> me

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
it's the quite a process it took me

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:08.300 
it's the quite a process it took me
about<00:03:03.480> three<00:03:03.810> hours<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:04.290> do<00:03:05.090> like<00:03:06.090> I<00:03:06.239> said<00:03:07.310> it's

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
about three hours to do like I said it's

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.680 
about three hours to do like I said it's
not<00:03:08.459> something<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:09.000> should<00:03:09.030> do<00:03:09.360> if<00:03:09.540> you're

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
not something you should do if you're

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.770 
not something you should do if you're
not<00:03:09.840> experienced<00:03:10.440> with<00:03:10.470> gunsmithing

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
not experienced with gunsmithing

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.050 
not experienced with gunsmithing
Wow<00:03:12.780> but<00:03:13.500> it<00:03:13.590> does<00:03:13.799> make<00:03:13.980> my<00:03:14.160> g3<00:03:14.579> look<00:03:14.760> really

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
Wow but it does make my g3 look really

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.729 
Wow but it does make my g3 look really
badass<00:03:15.269> and<00:03:15.780> it<00:03:15.840> goes<00:03:15.989> really<00:03:16.290> good<00:03:16.560> at<00:03:16.680> the

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
badass and it goes really good at the

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.120 
badass and it goes really good at the
Hellfire<00:03:17.130> trigger<00:03:17.430> you<00:03:18.389> know<00:03:18.889> if<00:03:19.889> you<00:03:20.010> know

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
Hellfire trigger you know if you know

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.379 
Hellfire trigger you know if you know
what<00:03:20.190> that<00:03:20.370> is<00:03:20.549> that's<00:03:20.700> a<00:03:20.880> trigger

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
what that is that's a trigger

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.509 
what that is that's a trigger
manipulator<00:03:22.079> it<00:03:22.290> is<00:03:22.410> legal<00:03:22.829> I<00:03:23.069> got<00:03:23.430> the

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
manipulator it is legal I got the

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.800 
manipulator it is legal I got the
paperwork<00:03:23.850> for<00:03:24.150> it<00:03:25.100> it<00:03:26.100> pretty<00:03:26.940> much<00:03:27.150> is<00:03:27.480> fully

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
paperwork for it it pretty much is fully

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.750 
paperwork for it it pretty much is fully
automatic<00:03:28.200> with<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.769> trip<00:03:29.069> Hellfire<00:03:29.459> trigger

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
automatic with the trip Hellfire trigger

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.000 
automatic with the trip Hellfire trigger
it's<00:03:30.389> just<00:03:30.569> what<00:03:30.720> it<00:03:30.810> does<00:03:30.989> is<00:03:31.109> it<00:03:31.230> like<00:03:31.769> pulls

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
it's just what it does is it like pulls

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.800 
it's just what it does is it like pulls
the<00:03:32.100> trigger<00:03:32.220> extremely<00:03:32.850> fast<00:03:33.090> so<00:03:33.450> the

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
the trigger extremely fast so the

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.120 
the trigger extremely fast so the
triggers<00:03:34.139> still<00:03:34.230> being<00:03:34.500> pulled<00:03:34.709> each<00:03:34.859> time

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
triggers still being pulled each time

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.530 
triggers still being pulled each time
for<00:03:35.160> each<00:03:35.400> shot<00:03:35.670> it's<00:03:36.329> just<00:03:36.480> really<00:03:36.630> fast<00:03:38.540> but

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
for each shot it's just really fast but

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.180 
for each shot it's just really fast but
uh<00:03:41.030> yeah<00:03:42.030> what<00:03:42.930> I'm<00:03:43.049> doing<00:03:43.350> here<00:03:43.590> is<00:03:43.739> still

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
uh yeah what I'm doing here is still

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.979 
uh yeah what I'm doing here is still
compliant<00:03:44.910> because<00:03:45.269> this<00:03:45.569> is<00:03:45.750> still

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
compliant because this is still

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.750 
compliant because this is still
semi-automatic<00:03:47.840> just<00:03:48.840> keep<00:03:48.989> that<00:03:49.139> in<00:03:49.260> mind

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
semi-automatic just keep that in mind

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.590 
semi-automatic just keep that in mind
but<00:03:50.760> it<00:03:51.030> does<00:03:51.239> make<00:03:51.450> your<00:03:51.600> g3<00:03:52.079> PGI<00:03:52.440> 91<00:03:52.920> hk91<00:03:53.670> you

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
but it does make your g3 PGI 91 hk91 you

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.890
