headquarters were very stovepipe as

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.730 
headquarters were very stovepipe as
their<00:00:17.150> work<00:00:18.150> style<00:00:18.600> started<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.110> shift<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.590> be

their work style started to shift to be

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.270 
their work style started to shift to be
more<00:00:19.920> collaborative<00:00:20.690> the<00:00:21.690> space<00:00:22.350> really<00:00:22.890> was

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:23.280 
more collaborative the space really was

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.260 
more collaborative the space really was
not<00:00:23.690> supporting<00:00:24.690> that<00:00:24.870> ship<00:00:25.260> at<00:00:25.970> 7:45<00:00:26.970> it's

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.270 
not supporting that ship at 7:45 it's

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.150 
not supporting that ship at 7:45 it's
just<00:00:27.660> really<00:00:27.900> high<00:00:28.170> cubes<00:00:28.620> they're<00:00:28.860> really

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
just really high cubes they're really

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.700 
just really high cubes they're really
gray<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.850> it's<00:00:30.330> dark<00:00:30.960> because<00:00:31.200> there's<00:00:31.530> not<00:00:31.650> a

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
gray and it's dark because there's not a

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.790 
gray and it's dark because there's not a
lot<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:31.920> natural<00:00:32.160> sunlight<00:00:32.579> one<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.480> my<00:00:33.800> real

lot of natural sunlight one of my real
hopes<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:36.510> we<00:00:36.900> have<00:00:37.170> an<00:00:37.620> office<00:00:38.070> that

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:38.490 
hopes is that we have an office that

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.600 
hopes is that we have an office that
reflects<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.780> brand<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.739> Iron<00:00:41.070> Mountain<00:00:41.430> and

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
reflects the brand of Iron Mountain and

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.810 
reflects the brand of Iron Mountain and
it's<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.270> place<00:00:42.540> where<00:00:43.070> we're<00:00:44.070> proud<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.400> bring

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820

customers one of the key goals for us
was<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:48.030> make<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> space<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:49.200> really<00:00:49.950> enable

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
was to make a space that really enable

some<00:00:57.630> kind<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.899> mobile<00:00:58.260> work<00:00:58.470> program<00:00:59.430> that

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
some kind of mobile work program that

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.720 
some kind of mobile work program that
would<00:01:00.180> reduce<00:01:00.510> our<00:01:00.780> demand<00:01:01.020> for<00:01:01.980> space<00:01:02.219> MoMA

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
would reduce our demand for space MoMA

the space is going to be very adaptable
to<00:01:17.810> our<00:01:19.220> requirements<00:01:20.220> because<00:01:20.820> there's<00:01:21.150> so

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
to our requirements because there's so

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.620 
to our requirements because there's so

here<00:01:27.000> at<00:01:27.060> one<00:01:27.180> fed<00:01:27.450> are<00:01:28.080> very<00:01:28.350> large<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:29.490> we<00:01:29.760> it

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
here at one fed are very large so we it

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.420 
here at one fed are very large so we it
was<00:01:30.360> he<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:31.380> break<00:01:31.560> them<00:01:31.710> down<00:01:31.860> in<00:01:32.010> such<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.189> way

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.090 
fine line for a GC the staircase was a
good<00:02:03.600> example<00:02:03.900> of<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.140> there's<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.740> beautiful

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
good example of that there's a beautiful

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.830 
good example of that there's a beautiful
design<00:02:05.369> put<00:02:05.579> out<00:02:05.700> there<00:02:05.880> by<00:02:06.000> MPA<00:02:06.329> but<00:02:06.750> we

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
design put out there by MPA but we

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.270 
design put out there by MPA but we
really<00:02:07.049> need<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.200> scale<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.740> back<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.189> I<00:02:08.220> think

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
really need to scale it back and I think

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.639 
really need to scale it back and I think

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
beautiful looking stair but it took some

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.180 
beautiful looking stair but it took some
Nevada<00:02:13.840> engineering<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:14.680> get<00:02:14.770> that<00:02:14.980> back<00:02:15.160> to

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190
