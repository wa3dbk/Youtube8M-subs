hear that ladies three times a day keeps
me<00:01:22.540> sane<00:01:22.960> so<00:01:23.950> it<00:01:24.070> does<00:01:24.250> help<00:01:24.520> with<00:01:24.610> that<00:01:24.760> but

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
me sane so it does help with that but

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.970 
me sane so it does help with that but
see<00:01:25.180> in<00:01:25.390> women<00:01:25.930> especially<00:01:26.110> and<00:01:26.560> it<00:01:26.620> works<00:01:26.800> in

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:26.980 
see in women especially and it works in

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.800 
see in women especially and it works in
men<00:01:27.130> too<00:01:27.370> but<00:01:27.580> in<00:01:27.670> women<00:01:27.910> especially<00:01:28.120> the<00:01:28.600> the

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
men too but in women especially the the

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.140 
men too but in women especially the the
excess<00:01:29.560> stress<00:01:29.950> increases<00:01:30.550> cortisol

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
excess stress increases cortisol

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.270 
excess stress increases cortisol
production<00:01:31.210> and<00:01:32.050> cortisol<00:01:32.560> does<00:01:32.770> one<00:01:33.010> thing

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
production and cortisol does one thing

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.190 
production and cortisol does one thing
and<00:01:33.400> that's<00:01:33.580> make<00:01:33.820> our<00:01:33.970> belly<00:01:34.180> go<00:01:34.390> out<00:01:34.540> really

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
and that's make our belly go out really

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.170 
and that's make our belly go out really
when<00:01:35.410> you<00:01:35.560> take<00:01:35.800> for<00:01:36.010> Laura<00:01:36.220> certainly<00:01:36.790> stress

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
when you take for Laura certainly stress

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.180 
when you take for Laura certainly stress
goes<00:01:37.510> down<00:01:37.810> so<00:01:38.170> people<00:01:38.200> say<00:01:38.560> stress<00:01:38.890> eating

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
goes down so people say stress eating

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.400 
goes down so people say stress eating
decreases<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:40.180> it<00:01:40.360> does<00:01:40.540> but<00:01:41.140> it<00:01:41.230> also

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
decreases and it does but it also

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.380 
decreases and it does but it also
decreases<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.490> production<00:01:42.820> of<00:01:42.880> course<00:01:43.150> all

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
decreases the production of course all

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.690 
decreases the production of course all
so<00:01:43.990> with<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.740> decrease<00:01:45.160> of<00:01:45.190> production

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
so with the the decrease of production

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.820 
so with the the decrease of production
of<00:01:45.790> cortisol<00:01:46.150> literally<00:01:46.660> the<00:01:46.840> belly<00:01:47.140> goes

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
of cortisol literally the belly goes

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.670 
of cortisol literally the belly goes
down<00:01:48.310> when<00:01:48.700> you<00:01:48.820> take<00:01:49.090> relora<00:01:49.750> so<00:01:50.140> stress
