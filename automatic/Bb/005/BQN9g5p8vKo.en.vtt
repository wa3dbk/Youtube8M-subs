00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
believe you said that it's not against a

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.359 
believe you said that it's not against a
rule<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.000> be<00:01:03.629> on<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.080> 07<00:01:04.439> servers<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.189> day

i received like new skills and such and
i<00:03:19.769> do<00:03:19.980> think<00:03:20.130> that's<00:03:20.519> kind<00:03:21.120> of<00:03:21.150> something<00:03:21.359> I

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
i do think that's kind of something I

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.400 
i do think that's kind of something I
want<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:22.220> join<00:03:23.220> in<00:03:23.459> on<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:23.940> look<00:03:24.299> and<00:03:24.660> try<00:03:25.200> out

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
want to join in on and look and try out

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.550 
want to join in on and look and try out
basically<00:03:25.889> but<00:03:26.819> if<00:03:27.090> I'm<00:03:27.630> not<00:03:27.870> confident

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
basically but if I'm not confident

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.199 
basically but if I'm not confident
concentrating<00:03:29.190> on<00:03:29.310> that<00:03:29.430> game<00:03:29.670> of<00:03:29.790> focusing

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
community is important in the game you

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.370 
community is important in the game you
know<00:03:58.769> it's<00:03:59.010> like<00:03:59.400> what<00:03:59.700> kind<00:04:00.329> of<00:04:00.359> defines<00:04:01.200> the

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
because both of the games will have some

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.779

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
of them will eventually go opportunity

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.800 
of them will eventually go opportunity
to

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
to

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.960

27 skip service and it will continue
like<00:04:30.450> this<00:04:30.480> and<00:04:30.990> I'm<00:04:31.080> not<00:04:31.230> really<00:04:31.410> sure<00:04:31.639> if

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
like this and I'm not really sure if

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.850 
like this and I'm not really sure if
that<00:04:33.240> is<00:04:33.270> a<00:04:33.419> valid<00:04:33.660> excuse<00:04:34.260> but<00:04:34.470> at<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:34.650> same

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
that is a valid excuse but at the same

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.860 
that is a valid excuse but at the same
time<00:04:35.160> it<00:04:35.460> is<00:04:35.639> come<00:04:36.180> to<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.330> best<00:04:36.480> reason<00:04:36.660> I've

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
time it is come to the best reason I've

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.560 
time it is come to the best reason I've
