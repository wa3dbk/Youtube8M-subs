works like it's supposed to it has a

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.609 
works like it's supposed to it has a
much<00:01:51.400> better<00:01:51.700> improved<00:01:52.270> controller<00:01:52.810> and<00:01:53.140> it

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
much better improved controller and it

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.429 
much better improved controller and it
has<00:01:53.799> some<00:01:54.220> good<00:01:54.580> games<00:01:54.909> so<00:01:55.540> I<00:01:55.600> understand<00:01:56.260> why

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
has some good games so I understand why

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.039

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
people fail to realize is that the

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.950 
people fail to realize is that the
consoles<00:02:06.250> launched<00:02:06.700> a<00:02:06.850> couple<00:02:07.570> months<00:02:07.720> ago

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
these consoles are babies and like I've

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.720 
these consoles are babies and like I've

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
contributed to buying both consoles and

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.220 
contributed to buying both consoles and
that's<00:03:13.490> why<00:03:13.730> this<00:03:13.790> whole<00:03:14.090> console<00:03:14.660> war<00:03:14.960> thing

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
that's why this whole console war thing

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.830 
that's why this whole console war thing
is<00:03:15.410> just<00:03:15.680> dumb<00:03:16.040> because<00:03:16.730> that's<00:03:17.450> what's<00:03:17.690> going

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
is just dumb because that's what's going

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.660 
is just dumb because that's what's going
to<00:03:17.930> happen<00:03:18.260> the<00:03:18.710> numbers<00:03:19.040> are<00:03:19.160> going<00:03:19.280> to<00:03:19.340> even

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
to happen the numbers are going to even

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.730 
to happen the numbers are going to even
out<00:03:19.790> in<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.420> end<00:03:20.570> it's<00:03:21.230> going<00:03:21.410> to<00:03:21.500> look<00:03:21.710> like

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 
out in the end it's going to look like

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.770 
out in the end it's going to look like
they<00:03:22.010> had<00:03:22.160> about<00:03:22.460> the<00:03:22.700> same<00:03:22.730> sales<00:03:23.390> over<00:03:23.750> the

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
they had about the same sales over the

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.050 
they had about the same sales over the
lifespan<00:03:24.050> of<00:03:24.380> the<00:03:24.500> consoles<00:03:25.070> and<00:03:25.340> everyone's

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
lifespan of the consoles and everyone's

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.240 
lifespan of the consoles and everyone's
going<00:03:26.240> to<00:03:26.300> move<00:03:26.450> on<00:03:26.630> to<00:03:26.840> the<00:03:26.960> next<00:03:26.990> console<00:03:27.920> war

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
going to move on to the next console war

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.750 
going to move on to the next console war
or<00:03:28.520> whatever<00:03:29.120> comes<00:03:29.810> after<00:03:30.140> these<00:03:30.980> consoles

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
or whatever comes after these consoles

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.670 
or whatever comes after these consoles
so<00:03:32.270> that's<00:03:32.510> really<00:03:32.750> why<00:03:32.930> don't<00:03:33.050> get<00:03:33.470> into

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
so that's really why don't get into

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.860 
so that's really why don't get into
numbers<00:03:34.040> guys<00:03:34.250> I<00:03:34.280> don't<00:03:34.610> think<00:03:35.180> it's<00:03:35.420> relevant

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
numbers guys I don't think it's relevant

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.990 
numbers guys I don't think it's relevant
I<00:03:36.350> don't<00:03:36.680> think<00:03:36.950> it<00:03:37.040> matters<00:03:37.340> at<00:03:37.730> this<00:03:37.880> point

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
I don't think it matters at this point

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.610 
I don't think it matters at this point
and<00:03:38.330> I<00:03:38.420> don't<00:03:38.600> like<00:03:38.780> making<00:03:39.050> videos<00:03:39.230> about

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
and I don't like making videos about

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.220 
and I don't like making videos about
things<00:03:40.310> that<00:03:40.400> don't<00:03:40.550> matter<00:03:40.970> now<00:03:41.840> let's<00:03:42.080> say

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
things that don't matter now let's say

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.620 
things that don't matter now let's say

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
the exact number but they're in a bunch

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.220 
the exact number but they're in a bunch
more<00:04:03.800> countries<00:04:04.340> the<00:04:04.790> week<00:04:05.030> head<00:04:05.300> start<00:04:05.720> the

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
more countries the week head start the

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.590 
more countries the week head start the
lower<00:04:06.500> price<00:04:06.890> point<00:04:07.310> there's<00:04:08.060> just<00:04:08.330> so<00:04:08.510> many

things<00:04:08.720> going<00:04:09.080> for<00:04:09.560> the<00:04:09.620> PlayStation<00:04:10.160> 4<00:04:10.370> right

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
things going for the PlayStation 4 right

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.910 
things going for the PlayStation 4 right
now<00:04:10.760> and<00:04:11.000> I<00:04:11.390> think<00:04:11.420> III<00:04:12.080> could<00:04:12.380> change<00:04:12.650> that

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
now and I think III could change that

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.800 
now and I think III could change that
and<00:04:13.160> I<00:04:13.580> think<00:04:13.610> things<00:04:14.090> could<00:04:14.300> change<00:04:14.330> for<00:04:14.720> the

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
and I think things could change for the

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.810 
and I think things could change for the
better<00:04:14.959> for<00:04:15.140> the<00:04:15.290> playstation<00:04:15.890> 4<00:04:16.190> and<00:04:16.340> that's

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
better for the playstation 4 and that's

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.240 
better for the playstation 4 and that's
the<00:04:17.030> whole<00:04:17.209> point<00:04:17.480> here<00:04:17.630> we<00:04:18.290> have<00:04:18.470> absolutely

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
the whole point here we have absolutely

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.130 
the whole point here we have absolutely
no<00:04:19.400> clue<00:04:19.580> what's<00:04:19.850> going<00:04:20.030> to<00:04:20.090> happen<00:04:20.450> there

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
no clue what's going to happen there

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.330 
no clue what's going to happen there
could<00:04:21.260> be<00:04:21.290> hardware<00:04:21.739> problems<00:04:22.100> there<00:04:22.220> could

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
could be hardware problems there could

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.190 
could be hardware problems there could
be<00:04:22.370> a<00:04:22.460> list<00:04:22.820> of<00:04:23.090> things<00:04:23.360> to<00:04:23.660> happen<00:04:23.840> to<00:04:24.169> either
