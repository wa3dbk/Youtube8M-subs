00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.130
 to episode 21 of our engine was not only 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.990
 with milan but from now on too 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.090
 with portugal as he had promised 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.719
 we reached the 150 stores until 6 am 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.990
 evening 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.609
 I was the one who was on May 6 a voice video 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.470
 and I chaste 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.300
 we were invited to train the 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.730
 Portuguese team and how could it not 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.180
 stop being me and let's go 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.670
 now the analysis of the squad and let's 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.830
 so is also to make some goals 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.320
 for our selection 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.420
 Ok guys, I 'm playing now 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.640
 live than controlling the team live 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.219
 you make this analysis easier 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.050
 well I 've already had a great 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.969
 the players of the profiles of 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.140
 national selection if more attention is paid to 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.570
 to have so are no longer good for which 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.399
 I'll use at least until I do more or 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.949
 less the qualification for the European of 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:02.100
 2016 how you were already gone world 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:03.629
 is that in the game so much is to seek in 433 think 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.339
 that it is later that more efficient for 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.680
 our selection with rui patricio at goal 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.470
 Joao Pereira's right back Luis Net 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.750
 pepsi central left side coent 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.640
 miguel bosé the adriano and offensive midfielder 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.530
 joão moutinho of the best chances neither 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.799
 on one side ronaldo the other and webber on 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.720
 front is I'm still a car in itself 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.640
 position to leave more indecisive and 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.520
 here everton is nelson 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.040
 Oliveira the national and goes even younger 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.640
 raul and more ball control but 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.070
 cast is seeing has much more physical strength 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.320
 It's faster or see but I did not leave 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.000
 one your opinion and another thing 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.240
 also considers it quite important is the 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.119
 fact of having strength and 15 forcing the future 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.820
 national air transport has only three 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.590
 will that maybe I do not know how 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.390
 I'll stay on the streets, but I will 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.210
 enduring father two or three years old nelson 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.159
 olive tree maybe will get much worse 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.060
 because he's still going to laugh a lot more than 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.860
 was in principle the rest of the level that 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.659
 elements are similar to our number 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.619
 has been bad both at the 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.899
 technician 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.899
 nelson oliveira even stronger but the 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.510
 Physical level is much better 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.760
 also as you can see here for this 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.560
 this crime 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.120
 are choices per cent but I tell you 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.220
 opinion in the comments to colleagues 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.650
 There is no much discussion team. 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.830
 maybe we can talk maybe the Andrew 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.980
 martins here is in adrian no place 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.410
 but it's a matter of seeing us 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.150
 show is technical level can see here 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.890
 the student andré martins is much more 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.800
 but at a technical level they can see 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.360
 here with Adrian is very strong even 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.090
 André Martins is good too but I think 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.620
 that even then the Adrian give more 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.900
 consistency in the midfield because the 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.000
 physical level is that andré martins only 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.980
 loses much strength and emotion tears in the 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.120
 east of gain in almost everything 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.580
 so do not leave it are choices 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.560
 rest I do not think a big 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.049
 discussion until we have here in not double 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.700
 I know why you 're here but when there is 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.260
 any call or any other 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.400
 way and deepen what it improves 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.880
 I can not do it now either. 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.340
 therefore this eleven more 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.260
 strong that I have is to use 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.000
 this time in my opinion leaves the 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.680
 fish yet your opinions 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.230
 have any opinion contrary to my 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.459
 woman in the comments but when we go 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.980
 now they will look at the classification 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.380
 because we did not go in the beginning 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.209
 qualification for the European to see 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.900
 How is it, then? 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.000
 situation 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.329
 Ok folks as we can see here we are 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.940
 in second place along with Russia 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:37.829
 in this in our group we have italy 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.040
 first and then we still have 90 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:42.810
 eponina brand in our group are missing six 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.340
 games for which I have the qualification we have 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.340
 more than possibility is all in 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.709
 open in direct convulsive confrontation 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.389
 I feel we have to be bahia 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.709
 all the chances of winning 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:56.100
 and against Italy and see if we can 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:58.280
 tomorrow I think it's difficult to 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.900
 this certainty is going to be a difficult game 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.389
 but I still think it 's possible 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.160
 Dilma wants a box, some think we have 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:08.370
 ability to go to european think so 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.410
 I think with the sanction we have the best 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.319
 player in the world we have them 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.000
 works all the obligation to go to the 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.870
 and make a good figure more 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.579
 production 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.519
 Let's just finish this. 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:23.039
 Bonus episode is to see what our 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.140
 first matches for the Portuguese team 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:27.120
 well, the first game for our 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.389
 selection goes 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.220
 partner only in February via 7th and 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.020
 will be a double commitment that we 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.270
 Let's get the call announcement soon and then 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.430
 of the brand so soon our first 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.400
 game will only be a difficult test 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.650
 find italy but for one side ash 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.930
 slow is very positive because we'll see 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.820
 we will be able to evaluate how serious it is 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.320
 what is our selection how the 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.139
 our players how the team 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.120
 plays together but is more important than 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.940
 this is still that we can make a 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.040
 with the same points 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.740
 that Italy in the first place of the group 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.419
 and then against denmark a game 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.380
 It's also going to be difficult, though. 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:09.600
 that we have almost I would say the obligation 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.470
 winning but ready sol is essentially 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.180
 to make goals here very short 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.669
 the Portuguese federation with which the 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.320
 plate reach the final half of the European 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.419
 it is clear to have our qualification 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.550
 in this group stage but I sincerely 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:25.770
 I think that's the ultimate goal. 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.440
 correct to take anyway anyway 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.600
 missing some time with you was in until 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.690
 20 the European is missing an animal and therefore 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:36.660
 I'm going to have to finish this season and only in the 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.220
 end of the next season is that we will have the 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.020
 opportunity to challenge the European 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.539
 so I'll go ahead when I have 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.220
 closer to the European is that I will speak 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:48.690
 more on the objectives with credit in 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:50.190
 relation to the european championship is 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.479
 now we have to focus on 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.979
 qualify but it is not 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:54.630
 it's not worth doing, you can expose 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:56.849
 for 100 years to qualify for the 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:59.789
 Points when you enjoyed this 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:01.169
 surprise of this new adventure we go 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:03.570
 to have in the career mode train our 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:05.820
 great selection train our great 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.590
 cristiano ronaldo leave here as what 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.310
 Very personal help, I 'll stay. 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.150
 around here 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.150
 A big hug to everyone.
