00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
all throughout here it's it's a nice

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.700 
all throughout here it's it's a nice
little<00:01:42.630> combination<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.350> doesn't<00:01:43.560> give<00:01:43.649> you

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
little combination it doesn't give you

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.100 
little combination it doesn't give you
the<00:01:43.829> full<00:01:44.040> kind<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.520> full<00:01:45.299> conical<00:01:45.750> feel<00:01:45.960> all

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
the full kind of full conical feel all

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.749 
the full kind of full conical feel all
the<00:01:46.200> way<00:01:46.259> through<00:01:46.530> but<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.770> gives<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.009> enough

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
the way through but it gives you enough

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.460 
the way through but it gives you enough
where<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.060> get<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.329> nice<00:01:48.570> gritty<00:01:48.990> tread<00:01:49.320> and

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
where you get that nice gritty tread and

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.630 
where you get that nice gritty tread and
then<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.649> get<00:01:49.770> these<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.130> on<00:01:50.520> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
then you get these on the on the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.429 
then you get these on the on the
outskirts<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.360> boot<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.990> gives<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.380> a

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
outskirts of the boot so it gives you a

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.710 
outskirts of the boot so it gives you a
little<00:01:52.619> bit<00:01:52.799> more<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.399> don't<00:01:53.880> say<00:01:54.149> balance<00:01:54.540> but

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
little bit more I don't say balance but

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.480 
little bit more I don't say balance but
just<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.930> little<00:01:55.020> bit<00:01:55.170> more<00:01:55.380> diversity<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.399> it

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
just a little bit more diversity and it

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.649 
just a little bit more diversity and it
just<00:01:56.610> feels<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.880> little<00:01:56.969> more<00:01:57.090> comfortable<00:01:57.210> you

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
just feels a little more comfortable you

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.690 
just feels a little more comfortable you
don't<00:01:57.810> feel<00:01:57.960> any<00:01:58.350> type<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:58.920> pressure<00:01:59.369> with

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
don't feel any type of pressure with

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.550 
don't feel any type of pressure with
these<00:01:59.820> turfs<00:02:00.090> at<00:02:00.299> all<00:02:00.420> honestly<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.380> think

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
these turfs at all honestly and I think

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.490 
these turfs at all honestly and I think
that<00:02:01.680> might<00:02:01.799> be<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.920> lot<00:02:02.100> due<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.990> kind

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
that might be a lot due to the the kind

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.170 
that might be a lot due to the the kind
of<00:02:04.590> fin<00:02:04.770> like<00:02:04.950> studs<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.369> know<00:02:05.460> what<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.700> 11pro

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
of fin like studs I know what the 11pro

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.059 
of fin like studs I know what the 11pro
is<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.540> if<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:07.200> watch<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.469> review<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.740> wasn't<00:02:08.009> a

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
is I if you watch the review I wasn't a

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.160 
is I if you watch the review I wasn't a
huge<00:02:08.280> fan<00:02:08.310> but<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.390> regular<00:02:09.629> studs<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:09.959> felt

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
huge fan but the regular studs I felt

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.630 
huge fan but the regular studs I felt
they<00:02:10.259> gave<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.440> lot<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.649> outer<00:02:10.890> pressure<00:02:11.340> but

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
they gave a lot of outer pressure but

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.619 
they gave a lot of outer pressure but
with<00:02:11.730> these<00:02:11.849> turfs<00:02:12.150> they<00:02:12.239> did<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.450> pretty

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
with these turfs they did it pretty

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.190 
with these turfs they did it pretty
right<00:02:12.840> with

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
right with

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.110

with the thin like turf that definitely

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.610 
with the thin like turf that definitely
adds<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:16.040> adds<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:19.050> quality<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.500> the

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
well I'm obviously I haven't worn them

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.039 
well I'm obviously I haven't worn them
for<00:03:01.920> a<00:03:01.950> huge<00:03:02.130> amout<00:03:02.640> of<00:03:02.730> time<00:03:02.880> so<00:03:03.060> I<00:03:03.120> don't<00:03:03.299> know

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
for a huge amout of time so I don't know

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.509 
for a huge amout of time so I don't know
that<00:03:04.290> for<00:03:04.620> certain<00:03:04.680> that<00:03:05.100> it<00:03:05.250> will<00:03:05.370> never

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
that for certain that it will never

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.490 
that for certain that it will never
happen<00:03:05.640> but<00:03:06.090> it<00:03:06.239> seems<00:03:06.450> like<00:03:06.630> they've<00:03:06.780> kind<00:03:07.410> of

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
happen but it seems like they've kind of

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.080 
happen but it seems like they've kind of
took<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.739> steps<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.190> really<00:03:08.310> make<00:03:08.580> it<00:03:08.610> so<00:03:08.970> it's

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
took the steps to really make it so it's

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.160 
took the steps to really make it so it's
a<00:03:09.150> little<00:03:09.209> bit<00:03:09.420> soft<00:03:09.630> there<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:09.930> little<00:03:10.080> bit

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
a little bit soft there and a little bit

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.680 
a little bit soft there and a little bit
nicer<00:03:10.440> feel<00:03:10.650> for<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:11.390> that's<00:03:12.390> pretty<00:03:12.600> much

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
nicer feel for you that's pretty much

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.750 
nicer feel for you that's pretty much
