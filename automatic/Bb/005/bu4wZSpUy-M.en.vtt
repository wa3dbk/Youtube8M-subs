sound checks and such and we were
running<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:15.690> from<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.990> board<00:00:16.230> which<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.590> board

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
running it from a board which the board

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.840 
running it from a board which the board
was<00:00:16.920> over<00:00:17.100> on<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.250> table<00:00:17.460> over<00:00:17.550> here<00:00:17.640> and

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
was over on the table over here and

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.720 
was over on the table over here and
we're<00:00:18.300> running<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.660> through<00:00:18.690> by<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.140> XLR<00:00:19.949> into

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
we're running it through by a XLR into

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.939 
we're running it through by a XLR into
the<00:00:20.820> sub<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:22.109> then<00:00:22.230> we<00:00:22.380> were<00:00:22.500> jumping<00:00:22.800> up<00:00:22.920> to

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
the sub I and then we were jumping up to

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.740 
the sub I and then we were jumping up to
the<00:00:23.160> top<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.730> we<00:00:23.939> hadn't<00:00:24.150> both<00:00:24.240> sets<00:00:24.510> so<00:00:24.630> they

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
the top and we hadn't both sets so they

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.880 
the top and we hadn't both sets so they
were<00:00:24.810> doing<00:00:25.080> their<00:00:25.199> things<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.650> everything

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
were doing their things and everything

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.800 
were doing their things and everything
was<00:00:25.980> happy<00:00:26.250> well<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:26.789> wanted<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.240> try<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.510> I

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
was happy well I wanted to try it I

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.269 
was happy well I wanted to try it I
pushed<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.529> pretty<00:00:28.680> hard<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.010> board<00:00:29.220> I

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
pushed a pretty hard to the board I

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.669 
pushed a pretty hard to the board I
wanted<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.580> try<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:29.820> going<00:00:30.240> directly<00:00:30.750> in<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:31.650> I

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
wanted to try it going directly in so I

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.350 
wanted to try it going directly in so I
changed<00:00:32.369> my<00:00:32.520> connections<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> little<00:00:33.239> bit<00:00:33.329> I

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
changed my connections a little bit I

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.660 
changed my connections a little bit I
went<00:00:33.570> right<00:00:33.870> for<00:00:34.079> my<00:00:34.200> tablet<00:00:34.649> right<00:00:34.800> into<00:00:35.550> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
went right for my tablet right into the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.200 
went right for my tablet right into the
back<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.809> ek<00:00:37.500> x12<00:00:38.129> P<00:00:38.399> then<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.030> went

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
back of the the ek x12 P then I went

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.860 
back of the the ek x12 P then I went
from<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.450> output<00:00:39.899> in<00:00:40.160> to<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.280> sub<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.969> this

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
from the output in to the sub and this

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.779 
from the output in to the sub and this
is<00:00:43.079> just<00:00:43.230> for<00:00:43.320> me<00:00:43.379> other<00:00:43.530> testing<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:43.980> such<00:00:44.100> so

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
is just for me other testing and such so

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.389 
is just for me other testing and such so
now<00:00:45.149> we<00:00:45.210> kind<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.750> reverse<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.559> flow<00:00:46.710> before

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
now we kind of reverse the flow before

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.650 
now we kind of reverse the flow before
we<00:00:47.520> were<00:00:47.579> coming<00:00:47.850> into<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.120> sub<00:00:48.360> then<00:00:48.510> we're

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
we were coming into the sub then we're

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.750 
we were coming into the sub then we're
jumping<00:00:48.840> up<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.350> 12<00:00:49.680> P<00:00:50.100> now<00:00:50.370> are<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.579> going

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
jumping up to the 12 P now are you going

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.639 
jumping up to the 12 P now are you going
into<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.180> copy<00:00:51.390> but<00:00:51.629> we're<00:00:51.750> doing<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.110> with

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
into the copy but we're doing it with

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.049 
into the copy but we're doing it with
our<00:00:52.680> CA<00:00:53.129> connections<00:00:53.760> we're<00:00:54.300> doing<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.750> with

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
our CA connections we're doing it with

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.819 
our CA connections we're doing it with
the<00:00:57.059> little<00:00:57.199> connections<00:00:58.199> going<00:00:58.350> right<00:00:58.680> from

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
the little connections going right from

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.880 
the little connections going right from
my<00:00:59.010> tablet<00:00:59.070> into<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.090> end<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.750> 12<00:01:00.989> P<00:01:01.199> now

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
my tablet into the end of the 12 P now

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.579 
my tablet into the end of the 12 P now
the<00:01:01.949> sound<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.730> such<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.120> expect<00:01:03.870> truthfully<00:01:04.409> a

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
the sound and such I expect truthfully a

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.020 
the sound and such I expect truthfully a
difference<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.189> sound<00:01:05.339> because<00:01:05.670> we're<00:01:05.820> coming

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
difference in sound because we're coming

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.340 
difference in sound because we're coming
from<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.210> really<00:01:06.420> high<00:01:06.540> quality<00:01:06.600> board<00:01:07.170> before

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
from a really high quality board before

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.929 
from a really high quality board before
and<00:01:07.740> hooked<00:01:08.340> up<00:01:08.460> one<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.909> know

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
and hooked up one of the you know

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.070 
and hooked up one of the you know
digitally<00:01:09.390> hooked<00:01:09.570> up<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:09.930> thought

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
digitally hooked up and I thought

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.510 
digitally hooked up and I thought
everything<00:01:10.409> would<00:01:10.590> sound<00:01:10.830> much<00:01:11.010> better<00:01:11.220> and

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
everything would sound much better and

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.010 
everything would sound much better and
then<00:01:12.200> we<00:01:13.200> ran<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.619> m'boy<00:01:14.520> for<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.150> backup

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
then we ran this m'boy for a backup

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.960 
then we ran this m'boy for a backup
sound<00:01:16.380> system<00:01:16.740> where<00:01:16.860> an<00:01:17.460> emergency

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
sound system where an emergency

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.580 
sound system where an emergency
situation<00:01:18.509> where<00:01:18.630> my<00:01:18.900> board<00:01:19.170> would<00:01:19.320> have<00:01:19.409> died

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
situation where my board would have died

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.740 
situation where my board would have died
I<00:01:20.009> could<00:01:20.460> plug<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.909> mean<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.090> had<00:01:21.330> my<00:01:21.420> iPad

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
I could plug in I mean I had my iPad

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.260 
I could plug in I mean I had my iPad
hooked<00:01:22.080> up<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.729> volume<00:01:23.729> wise<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.119> was

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
hooked up to this and volume wise I was

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.030 
hooked up to this and volume wise I was
right<00:01:24.570> there<00:01:24.840> pretty<00:01:25.200> close<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.830> board

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
right there pretty close so the board

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.649 
right there pretty close so the board
did<00:01:26.189> have<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.369> little<00:01:26.640> bit<00:01:26.729> more<00:01:26.939> but<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.570> was

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
did have a little bit more but it was

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.569 
did have a little bit more but it was
really<00:01:27.960> really<00:01:28.080> quite<00:01:28.380> close<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.860> turned<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.490> on

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
really really quite close I turned it on

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.219 
really really quite close I turned it on
and<00:01:29.820> push<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.150> iPad<00:01:30.420> up<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.659> where<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.869> was<00:01:30.900> at

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
and push the iPad up to where it was at

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.080 
and push the iPad up to where it was at
for<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.740> same<00:01:31.950> levels<00:01:32.310> as<00:01:32.520> far<00:01:32.729> as<00:01:32.820> volume

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
for the same levels as far as volume

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.120 
for the same levels as far as volume
wise<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.659> iPad<00:01:33.990> was<00:01:34.170> maxed<00:01:34.560> out<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.920> board

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
wise the iPad was maxed out the board

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.560 
wise the iPad was maxed out the board
still<00:01:35.369> had<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> little<00:01:35.579> more<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.909> go<00:01:36.000> but

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
still had a little more to go but

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.270 
still had a little more to go but
volume-wise<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.290> was<00:01:37.439> covering<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.950> large

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
volume-wise it was covering a large

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.270 
volume-wise it was covering a large
large<00:01:38.640> area<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.060> my<00:01:40.049> suggestion<00:01:40.799> if<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.070> are

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
large area so my suggestion if you are

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.819 
large area so my suggestion if you are
buying<00:01:41.460> speakers<00:01:42.000> make<00:01:42.479> sure<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:43.320> they<00:01:43.649> are

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
buying speakers make sure that they are

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.080 
buying speakers make sure that they are
high<00:01:43.979> quality<00:01:44.040> speakers<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.820> then<00:01:44.939> they've

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
high quality speakers and then they've

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.630 
high quality speakers and then they've
got<00:01:45.329> an<00:01:45.509> RCA<00:01:45.930> input<00:01:46.409> because<00:01:46.680> RCA<00:01:47.130> inputs<00:01:47.460> are

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
got an RCA input because RCA inputs are

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.429 
got an RCA input because RCA inputs are
