00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:16.030
 appreciated for example in Catalonia 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:18.369
 the genus lactarius because because it has 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.290

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.779
 prepared or if the camera is appreciated 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.850

 it's like very ugly as very, very weird 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.030

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:02.260

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.229
 when you usually collect to sell 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.530
 it is caught is cut and taken from here and it 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:11.140
 put directly into the basket 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.760
 without touching the plates so that later 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.830
 have more presence when after 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.980

 a greenish color when it comes to having 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.310
 a greenish color that means that it is 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.370

 to know if it's good 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.980

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.780
 be red is fine 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.040
 the true níscalo that is called 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.020
 anise with the true one of lactarios 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.850

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.550
 others other lactarius that you usually 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.520
 call them chanterelles but it's not the níscalo 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.320

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.680
 put it I for example just put the 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.470
 iron I like to put the níscalo to 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.970
 The iron and the ones I like the most are 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.380
 the closed chanterelles that are more 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.380
