this<00:00:25.279> is<00:00:25.460> a<00:00:25.490> turbo<00:00:25.849> generation<00:00:26.599> 3<00:00:26.869> as<00:00:27.230> you<00:00:27.380> all

00:00:27.549 --> 00:00:27.559 
this is a turbo generation 3 as you all

this is a turbo generation 3 as you all
know<00:00:28.509> he<00:00:29.509> volunteer<00:00:30.200> in<00:00:30.349> Waterloo<00:00:30.800> had

know he volunteer in Waterloo had

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:33.270 
know he volunteer in Waterloo had
already<00:00:31.369> set<00:00:31.790> the<00:00:31.939> bar<00:00:32.119> really<00:00:32.390> high<00:00:32.509> for

principle<00:00:36.640> as<00:00:37.640> a<00:00:38.059> review<00:00:38.570> the<00:00:39.140> Terkel

principle as a review the Terkel

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.010 
principle as a review the Terkel
principle<00:00:40.040> is<00:00:40.309> really<00:00:40.730> that<00:00:41.360> the<00:00:41.539> burners

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
principle is really that the burners

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.500 
principle is really that the burners

here so this is our our addition of the

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.000 
here so this is our our addition of the
piggyback<00:02:42.340> this<00:02:43.120> was<00:02:43.300> a<00:02:43.330> product<00:02:43.660> as<00:02:44.080> we<00:02:44.860> have

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
piggyback this was a product as we have

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.610 
piggyback this was a product as we have
the<00:02:45.220> class<00:02:45.519> that<00:02:45.790> has<00:02:45.910> been<00:02:45.940> reintroduced<00:02:46.620> so

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
the class that has been reintroduced so

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.600 
the class that has been reintroduced so
for<00:02:48.010> those<00:02:48.160> that<00:02:49.049> go<00:02:50.049> toward<00:02:50.349> this<00:02:50.890> words<00:02:51.220> is

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
for those that go toward this words is

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.630 
for those that go toward this words is
basically<00:02:52.209> to<00:02:52.510> extract<00:02:53.099> the<00:02:54.099> remaining

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
basically to extract the remaining

basically to extract the remaining
energy<00:02:55.330> out<00:02:55.540> of<00:02:55.569> the<00:02:55.810> steam<00:02:56.140> that<00:02:56.829> is<00:02:56.890> being

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
energy out of the steam that is being

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.990 
energy out of the steam that is being
exhausted<00:02:58.239> of<00:02:58.420> your<00:02:58.599> sugar<00:02:58.750> house<00:02:59.370> so<00:03:00.370> we<00:03:00.730> mix

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
exhausted of your sugar house so we mix

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.830 
exhausted of your sugar house so we mix
together<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:02.380> steam<00:03:02.739> the<00:03:03.670> water<00:03:03.910> is<00:03:04.150> being

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
together the steam the water is being

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.559 
together the steam the water is being
created<00:03:05.440> that<00:03:05.590> steam<00:03:06.069> and<00:03:06.370> then<00:03:06.670> we<00:03:07.360> inject

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
created that steam and then we inject

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.360 
created that steam and then we inject
hair<00:03:08.170> despite<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.849> bubble<00:03:10.269> the<00:03:11.370> remaining

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
hair despite to bubble the remaining

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.460 
hair despite to bubble the remaining
steam<00:03:12.610> away<00:03:12.900> this<00:03:13.900> extract<00:03:15.120> this<00:03:16.120> extract<00:03:16.690> and

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
steam away this extract this extract and

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.220 
steam away this extract this extract and
extra<00:03:17.829> percentage<00:03:18.400> of<00:03:18.549> energy<00:03:18.940> out<00:03:19.450> of<00:03:19.510> the

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
extra percentage of energy out of the

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.819 
extra percentage of energy out of the
