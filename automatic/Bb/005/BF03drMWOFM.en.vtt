00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.680 
we try to do a lot is to see a bunch of

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.770 
we try to do a lot is to see a bunch of
different<00:00:29.920> ingredients<00:00:29.980> that<00:00:30.610> have<00:00:31.390> a<00:00:31.420> lot<00:00:31.660> of

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:31.780 
different ingredients that have a lot of

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.200 
different ingredients that have a lot of
similarity<00:00:32.410> to<00:00:32.760> but<00:00:33.760> they're<00:00:33.850> all<00:00:34.000> from

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
similarity to but they're all from

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.370 
similarity to but they're all from
different<00:00:34.330> places<00:00:34.570> they<00:00:35.050> all<00:00:35.170> have<00:00:35.350> different

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.380 
different places they all have different

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.700 
different places they all have different
textures<00:00:36.010> on<00:00:36.250> the<00:00:36.400> fillings<00:00:37.000> but<00:00:37.780> they<00:00:37.900> have<00:00:38.680> a

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
textures on the fillings but they have a

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.010 
textures on the fillings but they have a
fun<00:00:39.130> way<00:00:39.580> of<00:00:39.610> playing<00:00:40.090> with<00:00:40.360> each<00:00:40.480> other

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
fun way of playing with each other

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.100 
fun way of playing with each other
they<00:00:41.410> all<00:00:41.530> look<00:00:41.710> very<00:00:41.739> similar<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:43.510> the<00:00:43.809> idea

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
they all look very similar and the idea

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.240 
they all look very similar and the idea
is<00:00:44.230> at<00:00:44.440> the<00:00:44.559> end<00:00:44.710> when<00:00:44.830> you're<00:00:44.920> done<00:00:45.070> eating

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:18.330 
main so it's almost as if we're doing
like<00:01:08.680> a<00:01:08.710> very<00:01:09.160> small<00:01:09.880> flower<00:01:10.770> layer

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.899 

acknowledgment<00:01:19.340> lightly<00:01:19.549> people

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
acknowledgment lightly people

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.459 
acknowledgment lightly people
just<00:01:21.179> been<00:01:21.299> lightly<00:01:21.570> soap<00:01:22.049> or<00:01:22.320> they're<00:01:22.439> just

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:22.469 
just been lightly soap or they're just

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:26.389 
just been lightly soap or they're just
begin<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.009> sprout<00:01:24.859> picks<00:01:25.859> up<00:01:26.009> something<00:01:26.249> in

begin to sprout picks up something in

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.000 
begin to sprout picks up something in
age

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:02:07.570 

the<00:01:29.130> harshness

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.370 

so<00:02:07.970> this<00:02:08.150> is<00:02:08.330> a<00:02:08.360> dish<00:02:08.630> that<00:02:08.660> we've<00:02:08.960> had<00:02:09.110> a<00:02:09.140> bunch

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
so this is a dish that we've had a bunch

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.750 
so this is a dish that we've had a bunch
of<00:02:09.500> different<00:02:09.770> iterations<00:02:10.310> throughout<00:02:10.640> of

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
of different iterations throughout of
