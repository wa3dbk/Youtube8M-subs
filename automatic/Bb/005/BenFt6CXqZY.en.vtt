put the second and third catch together
I<00:01:42.590> taught<00:01:43.040> this<00:01:43.250> by<00:01:43.430> cueing<00:01:43.820> him<00:01:43.970> to<00:01:44.120> drop<00:01:44.360> the

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
I taught this by cueing him to drop the

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.990 
I taught this by cueing him to drop the
disk<00:01:44.780> and<00:01:44.990> then<00:01:45.110> cued<00:01:45.500> go<00:01:45.830> which<00:01:46.430> he<00:01:46.670> already

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
disk and then cued go which he already

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.540 
disk and then cued go which he already
knew<00:01:47.360> to<00:01:47.630> mean<00:01:47.900> keep<00:01:48.440> moving<00:01:48.830> forward<00:01:49.310> and

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
knew to mean keep moving forward and

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.000 
knew to mean keep moving forward and
then<00:01:50.060> I<00:01:50.300> would<00:01:50.450> throw<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.900> next<00:01:51.110> disc<00:01:51.470> for<00:01:51.800> him

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
then I would throw the next disc for him

00:01:52.010 --> 00:02:05.590 
then I would throw the next disc for him
to<00:01:52.190> catch<00:02:04.060> step<00:02:05.060> 4

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
to catch step 4

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.210 
to catch step 4
practice<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.290> third<00:02:06.530> and<00:02:06.710> fourth<00:02:06.920> throw

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
practice the third and fourth throw

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.000 
practice the third and fourth throw
together<00:02:07.490> this<00:02:08.240> is<00:02:08.450> just<00:02:08.690> a<00:02:08.840> basic<00:02:09.110> two<00:02:09.560> disc

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.010 
together this is just a basic two disc

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.400 
together this is just a basic two disc
type<00:02:10.310> throw<00:02:10.670> where<00:02:11.270> you<00:02:11.390> throw<00:02:11.630> one<00:02:11.870> direction

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
type throw where you throw one direction

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.380 
type throw where you throw one direction
and<00:02:12.650> when<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:12.920> dog<00:02:13.070> catches<00:02:13.550> it<00:02:13.730> he<00:02:14.150> moves

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
and when the dog catches it he moves

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.199 
and when the dog catches it he moves
back<00:02:14.630> towards<00:02:15.050> you<00:02:15.470> for<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.130> next<00:02:16.459> disc<00:02:16.700> which

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
back towards you for the next disc which

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:33.410 
back towards you for the next disc which
will<00:02:17.390> be<00:02:17.510> going<00:02:17.690> in<00:02:17.990> the<00:02:18.110> opposite<00:02:18.590> direction

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.720 

Step<00:02:34.420> five<00:02:34.450> put<00:02:35.349> it<00:02:35.440> all<00:02:35.590> together<00:02:35.830> you<00:02:36.550> might

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
Step five put it all together you might
