00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello everyone with you and not a maniac and it 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.540
 quite spontaneously and the video where I express 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.400
 your opinion on the first two episodes 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.500
 season two of the animated series rick and morty 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.269
 and about the show itself in particular 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.610
 it is by no means full 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.529
 review and just a recommendation and by the way 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.930
 saying answering all those who ask me 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.420
 do reviews on series like 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.949
 adventure time in gravity falls 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.869
 steven universe and so on and so on 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.720
 I donâ€™t see the point. 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.609
 because it has already replaced others 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.040
 people did pretty high quality and 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.590
 okay my opinion would be different from theirs 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.579
 opinions but no i absolutely also love and 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.680
 I love these shows 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.180
 the only exception was with 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.070
 I just wanted a side out of my chest 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.829
 speak up what 's finished with it 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.600
 let's get down to business what is rik and morty 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.610
 if i were asked to describe this 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.489
 animated series in a nutshell I would say 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.410
 so this is back to the future plus doctor who 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.300
 with peter kapaldi mixed with 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.340
 plenty of strong alcohol and 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.469
 black humor in proportion to about one 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.359
 to two and unsurprisingly because rik and morty 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.460
 there were originally parodies of the doctor 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.890
 Brown and Marty McFly respectively 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.350
 it was a short film with a very black 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.049
 humor and when i speak very black i 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.479
 mean very black seriously even 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.670
 I was ugly and and watch in the show itself 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.920
 the percentage of nauseous moments is strong 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.009
 decreased but still not equal to zero 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.600
 somewhere 30 percent 40 so if you 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.909
 don't like that for you this video 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.799
 will become a warning they are recommendations 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.840
 despite the fact that we are not rik and mort 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.820
 reminds and back to the future doctor who 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.920
 in the animated series there is no travel in 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.869
 time I will say more is peculiar 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.000
 taboo for screenwriters they avoid 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.979
 similar plots quite intentionally and 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.200
 dusty a box in the lab river 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.369
 marked as travel junk 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.640
 in time about this unequivocally 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.250
 hints we need to get rid of the car 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.829
 I agree it is too big for 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.479
 our living room instead of traveling 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.619
 time creators took as a basis 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.570
 adventure heroes 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.430
 especially in the last series of theory 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.259
 multi universes well i think you know 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.030
 what is this theory says that 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.470
 there is an unlimited amount of 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.240
 the village 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.290
 them intersecting sasha some 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.270
 parallel planes parallel 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.710
 planes and where so in each 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.000
 parallel universe reality 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.950
 different from ours 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.860
 sometimes just a little bit sometimes very 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.450
 strongly the point is that any opportunity 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.150
 exists in this way 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.400
 many centuries of march and their family members 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.710
 accordingly, everything would be nothing if 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.390
 Rick was not a crazy genius who 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.710
 can move between worlds without 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.960
 any restrictions 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.450
 i.e. any rik from any dimension 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.650
 may move to some other 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.570
 and not only move but 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.610
 in every way manipulated or even 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.900
 accidentally destroy why i am so 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.550
 I focus on this 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.260
 Well, maybe because the series 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.320
 revealing the topic of parallel universes 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.180
 the very best in the first season 10 like by 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.070
 I'm so generally a little masterpiece but not 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.380
 they are now talking and so on today 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.870
 day two hit the internet before 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.940
 time series 2 season which in my 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.709
 opinions separately reveal two 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.660
 the greatest strengths of the animated series 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.180
 At first, rabid almost nothing 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.650
 limited creativity 1 season series 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.780
 once again reminds us that 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.780
 Still, not all was still in the Simpson 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.600
 throws up another standing roof 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.880
 concept into what used to do 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.650
 futurama in this series by the way speaking to us 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.600
 still demonstrated the journey 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.580
 in time the truth is not performed 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.680
 main characters and even local overlords 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:26.209
 time showed and by the way they look 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.980
 not so and not so and not even okay 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.210
 it can go on like this 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:36.370
 my looks are wonderful 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:38.380
 and who has a stock in the final 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.300
 I did not like the storyline 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.400
 always in such TV shows annoying 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.690
 when the main characters save the world or 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.520
 run away from aliens 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.980
 and minor characters at this time 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.230
 sit at home and find out who ate the last 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.330
 piece of cake or something like that yes 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.310
 plot and without any sci-fi can be 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.350
 interesting and original such as 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.050
 titanic themed cruise 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.300
 but this is not the case can not be said about 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.160
 the second merged series is she like me already 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.290
 spoke personifies one more 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.020
 the main component of the rika and mortis 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.960
 exactly adventure and here guys 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.180
 seriously have all the chase action explosions 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.260
 unexpected turns freaky 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.020
 music videos 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.880
 yes yes don't be surprised even the side line 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:21.430
 no less interesting and funny than 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.320
 the main story if after the first episode, 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.390
 I still had suspicions that the series with 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.610
 the new season may slip then after 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.650
 I finally convinced myself that 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.020
 near future rick and morty like 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.240
 not threatened by this all this was 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.340
 confused impression I really hope that 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.320
 someone I'm with this beautifully animated series 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.930
 nevertheless introduced if so 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.090
 see rate write your opinion in 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.950
 comments i say goodbye to you 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.950
 thank you all good luck everyone bye
