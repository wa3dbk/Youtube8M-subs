sensation that is and getting off the

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.170 
sensation that is and getting off the
ceiling<00:03:24.110> is<00:03:24.380> definitely<00:03:25.070> a<00:03:25.100> difficult<00:03:26.030> task

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
ceiling is definitely a difficult task

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.060 
ceiling is definitely a difficult task
there's<00:03:26.930> ammo<00:03:27.170> boxes<00:03:27.560> flying<00:03:27.860> around

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
there's ammo boxes flying around

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.740 
there's ammo boxes flying around
everywhere<00:03:28.280> that's<00:03:28.850> supposed<00:03:29.239> to<00:03:29.300> teach<00:03:29.540> you

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
everywhere that's supposed to teach you

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
me get down from the ceiling and that's

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.880 
me get down from the ceiling and that's
what<00:03:38.900> it's<00:03:39.050> all<00:03:39.110> about<00:03:39.170> it's<00:03:39.530> about<00:03:39.560> knowing

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
in a situation like that as camp bastian

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.050 
in a situation like that as camp bastian
draws<00:03:48.170> down<00:03:48.440> vehicle<00:03:48.950> crews<00:03:49.220> will<00:03:49.400> be<00:03:49.519> key<00:03:49.790> for
