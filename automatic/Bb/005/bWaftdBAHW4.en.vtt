00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.529
 Hello, my name is Anna Koshkina 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.750
 and today we will consider this 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.109
 Reception in watercolor as an infusion why he 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.500
 need 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.750
 then you need it to make it smooth 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.759
 gentle transitions in watercolor that is such 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.490
 such transitions will not give any 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.960
 the glaze is therefore taking livon and 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.460
 actively used in watercolor 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.619
 it now and we will consider the server 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:31.170
 for example were draw red acado and 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:39.960
 here we start that is let's take the red 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:42.180
 color and cover that is here we look 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.660
 that the surface was slightly 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.510
 damp so that she was not strong 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.260
 dry and now for example i want to carry on 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.829
 let's cover a little more i want 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.710
 introduce some more color basically 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:04.730
 reception his death is not done by two 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.730
 flowers or more like yellow 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:17.159
 So I take and you can just drip 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.850
 put well let's dig here you see 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:24.930
 as soon as the paint went she smoothly 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.890
 spreads there is that is so 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.540
 reception is being done 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.490
 infusions are correct yes I would also refer to 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.180
 receiving infusion i.e. coating paint 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.970
 immediately that is, for example, this is not at all 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.799
 they say well, I think that this is also a reception 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.380
 infusion therefore because this too 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.259
 gives very gentle transitions 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.720
 for example here I have a red yes and 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.729
 pay attention here to the stands 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.350
 paint with water that is extremely dry then 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.689
 there is it is very important that is and will be me 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.310
 Immediately I cover, that is, the work should 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.530
 go fast ie i be red 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.100
 covered and immediately i take and immediately 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:05.100
 I put yellow well here in this place yes then 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.560
 Here there is also, I believe that we have that 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.539
 can be attributed to receiving the infusion i.e. 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.230
 here is yellow put next 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.790
 red I want to wash the brush before pressed and and 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.520
 let's show 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:20.520
 pressed out do not pull over the pile just a little bit 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.550
 squeezed yes and took 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.790
 for example red even purple we take 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:30.750
 yes a little bit red purple can 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:34.230
 be here for example where 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.000
 paint then there is such a job should 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.819
 be carried out very quickly ie you immediately 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.910
 take the correct color right tone and 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:47.900
 immediately cover 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:52.290
 plot of course receptions glaze and 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.910
 infusions and washing the bottom too 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.250
 if you need to adjust 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.159
 they all together that is, as if at once 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.129
 works in watercolor, what I want to say 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:04.680
 that is, not me, but rarely this 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:06.269
 when use only one intake in 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.970
 mostly when painting with watercolor 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:12.170
 enjoy all the tricks 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.920
 the main three are glaze infusion and 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.800
 wash off if you need something 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:22.409
 correct that is like this 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:25.140
 way we are doing the reception of the infusion 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:27.780
 and try to on the edge here 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.459
 there was some water left with paint because 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.980
 what if the edge will dry out 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.959
 then you will immediately see hard clear 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.500
 circuit 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:39.480
 that is, here we did the magician yes and here 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.950
 for example , we are still wet but slightly 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:47.810
 wet up take a little black and 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:51.959
 blue that is the center of the poppy too we will do 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:55.170
 But if there is little paint, that is 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.159
 it turns out it does not spread much in 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.140
 This case is not bad for me 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:02.959
 spreads out 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:04.140
 here is the reception infusion that is the reception 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.239
 infusions 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.430
 he is very good for making exactly 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.030
 gentle smooth transitions such pen 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.880
 transition 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.430
 impossible to achieve glaze 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:19.340
 Well, that's all, I think that you have everything, too 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.340
 work with you was anna koshkina good luck
