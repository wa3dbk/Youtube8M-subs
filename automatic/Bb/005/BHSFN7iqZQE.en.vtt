body so that's gonna love the triceps a

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.120 
body so that's gonna love the triceps a
little<00:00:31.810> more<00:00:31.990> and<00:00:32.470> we'll<00:00:32.650> for<00:00:32.800> the<00:00:32.860> front<00:00:33.040> of

little more and we'll for the front of
the<00:00:33.250> shoulder<00:00:33.610> so<00:00:33.730> what<00:00:33.850> could<00:00:33.940> do<00:00:34.059> you<00:00:34.239> start

00:00:34.529 --> 00:00:34.539 
the shoulder so what could do you start

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:37.830 
the shoulder so what could do you start
off<00:00:34.660> with<00:00:34.980> 45<00:00:35.980> k<00:00:36.250> plates<00:00:36.550> so<00:00:37.300> that's<00:00:37.480> 60

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
off with 45 k plates so that's 60

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.260 
off with 45 k plates so that's 60
kilograms<00:00:38.170> you<00:00:38.980> pumped<00:00:39.280> out<00:00:39.370> as<00:00:39.520> many<00:00:39.760> you<00:00:40.030> can

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
press ups and what we do then is we use

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.259 
press ups and what we do then is we use
a<00:00:44.469> bench<00:00:44.890> basement<00:00:45.340> do<00:00:45.430> a<00:00:45.460> drop<00:00:45.699> set<00:00:45.910> you<00:00:46.120> to

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:46.269 
a bench basement do a drop set you to

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:49.229 
a bench basement do a drop set you to
stick<00:00:46.480> 5<00:00:46.750> kgs<00:00:47.289> off<00:00:47.440> each<00:00:47.620> side<00:00:47.670> right<00:00:48.670> that

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
stick 5 kgs off each side right that

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.810 
stick 5 kgs off each side right that
becomes<00:00:49.480> 50<00:00:49.960> kilograms<00:00:50.410> do<00:00:51.219> as<00:00:51.309> many<00:00:51.460> reps<00:00:51.730> you

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
becomes 50 kilograms do as many reps you

them say five K's on each side so the
bench<00:00:56.590> press<00:00:56.829> we<00:00:57.190> drop<00:00:57.460> setting<00:00:57.879> every<00:00:58.539> time

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
bench press we drop setting every time

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.569 
bench press we drop setting every time
the<00:00:59.019> reps<00:00:59.260> you<00:00:59.440> just<00:00:59.559> go<00:00:59.649> for<00:00:59.679> many<00:01:00.190> as<00:01:00.280> you<00:01:00.399> can

right and then in between who's doing a
fire<00:01:03.039> press<00:01:03.280> up<00:01:03.429> so<00:01:03.550> I'm<00:01:03.640> going<00:01:03.760> to<00:01:03.789> get<00:01:03.940> out<00:01:04.030> of

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
fire press up so I'm going to get out of

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.220 
fire press up so I'm going to get out of
the<00:01:04.150> way<00:01:04.300> what<00:01:04.780> we're<00:01:04.870> going<00:01:04.960> to<00:01:05.050> do<00:01:05.110> is

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
pretend that Ed's max is three or four

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.820 
pretend that Ed's max is three or four
repetitions<00:01:07.570> otherwise<00:01:08.230> the<00:01:08.410> videos<00:01:08.680> gonna

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
repetitions otherwise the videos gonna

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.530 
repetitions otherwise the videos gonna
get<00:01:08.980> too<00:01:09.130> long<00:01:09.370> let's<00:01:10.060> say<00:01:10.180> you<00:01:10.270> will<00:01:10.360> do<00:01:10.450> as

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
get too long let's say you will do as

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.420 
get too long let's say you will do as
many<00:01:10.840> of<00:01:11.110> the<00:01:11.350> bench<00:01:11.560> press<00:01:11.800> as<00:01:11.920> you<00:01:12.010> can<00:01:12.220> until

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
many of the bench press as you can until

many of the bench press as you can until
you<00:01:13.120> reach<00:01:13.330> 100<00:01:14.050> bench<00:01:14.470> presses<00:01:14.980> right<00:01:15.430> so

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
you reach 100 bench presses right so

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.550 
you reach 100 bench presses right so
then<00:01:15.820> be<00:01:15.940> here<00:01:16.150> out<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:16.360> way<00:01:16.450> so<00:01:16.750> it's<00:01:17.440> gonna
