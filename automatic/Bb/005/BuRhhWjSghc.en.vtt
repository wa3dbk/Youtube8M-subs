perfect<00:03:04.090> in<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.930> moment<00:03:05.319> you<00:03:05.590> know<00:03:05.709> right<00:03:06.010> on

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
perfect in the moment you know right on

perfect in the moment you know right on
bang<00:03:06.760> on<00:03:06.940> film<00:03:07.660> was<00:03:07.750> nice<00:03:07.989> because<00:03:08.260> you<00:03:08.379> got<00:03:08.590> to

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
bang on film was nice because you got to

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.580 
bang on film was nice because you got to
have<00:03:09.519> a<00:03:09.549> go<00:03:09.819> at<00:03:09.849> it<00:03:10.090> a<00:03:10.269> couple<00:03:10.360> of<00:03:10.569> times<00:03:10.810> got<00:03:11.440> it

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
have a go at it a couple of times got it

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.289 
have a go at it a couple of times got it
got<00:03:11.709> shot<00:03:12.040> for<00:03:12.250> more<00:03:12.400> different<00:03:12.700> angles<00:03:13.060> so<00:03:13.269> I

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
got shot for more different angles so I

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:14.729 
got shot for more different angles so I
guess<00:03:13.510> it<00:03:13.659> made<00:03:13.930> it<00:03:14.079> so<00:03:14.290> much<00:03:14.319> more<00:03:14.470> three

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
guess it made it so much more three

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.869 
guess it made it so much more three
dimensional<00:03:14.860> and<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:16.870> have<00:03:17.500> my<00:03:17.920> solo<00:03:18.280> that's<00:03:18.610> in

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
dimensional and I have my solo that's in

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.390 
dimensional and I have my solo that's in
the<00:03:19.000> film<00:03:19.299> and<00:03:19.569> was<00:03:20.230> quite<00:03:20.500> two-dimensional

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
the film and was quite two-dimensional

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.009 
the film and was quite two-dimensional
to<00:03:21.519> begin<00:03:21.760> with<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:22.030> quiet<00:03:22.299> you<00:03:22.480> know<00:03:22.540> upright

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
to begin with and quiet you know upright

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.430 
to begin with and quiet you know upright
and<00:03:23.260> it's<00:03:24.069> quite<00:03:24.280> jagged<00:03:24.790> and<00:03:24.940> study<00:03:25.390> and<00:03:25.750> then

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
and it's quite jagged and study and then

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.680 
and it's quite jagged and study and then
they<00:03:26.709> decided<00:03:27.099> to<00:03:27.310> shoot<00:03:27.700> it<00:03:27.849> from<00:03:28.000> bird's<00:03:28.510> eye

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
they decided to shoot it from bird's eye

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.809 
they decided to shoot it from bird's eye
view<00:03:28.720> for<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.620> film<00:03:29.920> and<00:03:30.129> so<00:03:30.250> it<00:03:30.340> just<00:03:30.400> gave<00:03:30.670> it

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
view for the film and so it just gave it

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.180 
view for the film and so it just gave it
this<00:03:30.910> really<00:03:31.150> beautiful<00:03:31.299> different<00:03:32.170> flavor<00:03:33.010> I

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
this really beautiful different flavor I

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.250 
this really beautiful different flavor I
guess<00:03:33.459> so<00:03:33.819> that<00:03:33.940> was<00:03:34.030> really<00:03:34.090> nice<00:03:34.390> I<00:03:34.780> think

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
guess so that was really nice I think

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.770 
guess so that was really nice I think
we've<00:03:35.829> been<00:03:35.980> trying<00:03:36.340> to<00:03:36.549> you<00:03:36.970> know<00:03:37.000> get<00:03:37.629> the

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
we've been trying to you know get the

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.900 
we've been trying to you know get the
film<00:03:37.959> out<00:03:38.109> there<00:03:38.349> more<00:03:38.590> and<00:03:38.920> get<00:03:39.099> it<00:03:39.220> seen<00:03:39.489> and

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
film out there more and get it seen and

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.849 
film out there more and get it seen and
and<00:03:40.150> I<00:03:40.329> guess<00:03:40.480> it's<00:03:40.660> the<00:03:40.870> nice<00:03:41.260> thing<00:03:41.500> about<00:03:41.560> it

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
and I guess it's the nice thing about it

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.160 
and I guess it's the nice thing about it
such<00:03:42.129> am<00:03:42.340> now<00:03:43.150> that<00:03:43.299> it's<00:03:43.420> made<00:03:43.660> it's<00:03:43.989> just

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
such am now that it's made it's just

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.780 
such am now that it's made it's just
easy<00:03:44.379> for<00:03:44.560> it<00:03:44.620> to<00:03:44.680> travel<00:03:45.010> around<00:03:45.099> you<00:03:45.370> can<00:03:45.670> go

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
easy for it to travel around you can go

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.699 
easy for it to travel around you can go
to<00:03:45.849> Europe<00:03:46.209> where<00:03:46.419> is<00:03:46.569> to<00:03:47.019> take<00:03:47.169> all<00:03:47.410> four<00:03:47.680> of

dr. Ellen explains the impact of the
technological<00:05:20.900> shift<00:05:20.930> I<00:05:21.440> think<00:05:21.860> one<00:05:22.010> of<00:05:22.040> the

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
technological shift I think one of the

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.340 
technological shift I think one of the
big<00:05:22.430> things<00:05:22.460> was<00:05:22.940> the<00:05:23.660> technologies<00:05:24.320> that

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
big things was the technologies that

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.140 
big things was the technologies that
could<00:05:24.650> get<00:05:25.010> hold<00:05:25.190> of<00:05:25.310> and<00:05:25.520> that<00:05:25.700> meant<00:05:25.940> that

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
could get hold of and that meant that

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.870 
could get hold of and that meant that
the<00:05:26.900> major<00:05:27.230> players<00:05:27.530> in<00:05:28.100> dance<00:05:28.370> film<00:05:28.670> in<00:05:28.790> the

world for television stations there a

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.210 
world for television stations there a
lot<00:05:31.580> of<00:05:31.610> power<00:05:31.910> I<00:05:32.270> think<00:05:33.020> the<00:05:33.140> massive<00:05:33.740> massive

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
lot of power I think the massive massive

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.030 
lot of power I think the massive massive
massive<00:05:34.760> change<00:05:35.300> has<00:05:35.990> come<00:05:36.290> with<00:05:36.560> the<00:05:36.740> digital

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.040 
massive change has come with the digital

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.250 
massive change has come with the digital
revolution<00:05:37.340> and<00:05:37.910> it's<00:05:38.510> pretty<00:05:38.690> much<00:05:38.900> changed

revolution and it's pretty much changed

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.490 
revolution and it's pretty much changed
every<00:05:39.590> aspect<00:05:39.620> of<00:05:40.100> the<00:05:40.250> production<00:05:40.520> pathway

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.930 

so<00:06:45.710> do<00:06:45.890> you<00:06:45.980> feel<00:06:46.130> that<00:06:46.190> maybe<00:06:46.400> internet

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:46.940 
so do you feel that maybe internet

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.030 
so do you feel that maybe internet
empowers<00:06:47.840> smaller<00:06:48.230> groups<00:06:48.530> like<00:06:48.710> your<00:06:48.920> own

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080 
yeah that exposure yeah I think so

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.890 
yeah that exposure yeah I think so
definitely<00:06:51.290> I<00:06:51.710> think<00:06:51.800> um<00:06:52.600> because<00:06:53.600> you<00:06:53.750> can
