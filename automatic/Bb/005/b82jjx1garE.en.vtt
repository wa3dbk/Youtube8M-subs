00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.509
 who put this character so that 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.210

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.190

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.050

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.860
 history is called hate of love so 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.320
 the story begins there was a powerful 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.780
 trainer who used the pokemon as 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.239
 weapons of war and did not value them until 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.550
 that one day I found an agar I should go 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.280
 hurt he cured her and decided to stay 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.100
 with her even though the coach was still 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.739
 bad with others he believed that nobody was worth 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.570
 worth it being so powerful as to 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.270
 stoop to talk to others 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.699
 people one day garde I will go left 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.160
 his ball poke got into dreams of 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.530
 his coach and told him that he should not 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.180
 be bad with others so much that 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.000
 he entered his dreams 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.530
 it became good little by little 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.300
 until one day he woke up and saw 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.550
 that Gar de Boyle was out of 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.370
 what a ball he saw her and told her that because 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.860
 she did then she told him she knew 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.050
 that there was someone good inside of him 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.270
 that reason he did he told him that 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.420
 thanks to her she managed to see a new world 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.400
 and that I would never let her go because 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.070
 of being his pokemon he had fallen in love with 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.869
 she then she tells him that whatever 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.750
 loved and would be happy forever 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.050
