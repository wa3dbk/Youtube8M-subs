a<00:00:17.609> couple<00:00:18.330> people<00:00:18.449> had<00:00:18.690> questions<00:00:18.869> about<00:00:19.410> how

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
a couple people had questions about how

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.910 
a couple people had questions about how
to<00:00:20.779> set<00:00:21.779> up<00:00:22.039> the<00:00:24.320> stations<00:00:25.320> how<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.619> do<00:00:25.800> the

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
to set up the stations how to do the

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.390 
to set up the stations how to do the
presets<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:27.289> so<00:00:28.289> forth<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:29.039> I'm<00:00:29.099> going<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.310> do

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
presets and so forth so I'm going to do

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.279 
presets and so forth so I'm going to do
some<00:00:29.580> demonstrations<00:00:30.240> on<00:00:30.420> how<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.929> works

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
some demonstrations on how that works

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.610 
some demonstrations on how that works
it's<00:00:31.590> not<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.859> very<00:00:32.279> intuitive<00:00:33.059> process<00:00:33.620> so

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
it's not a very intuitive process so

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.350 
it's not a very intuitive process so
hopefully<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.190> can<00:00:35.309> answer<00:00:35.640> some<00:00:35.910> questions

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
you have off radio play for the iPhone

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.789 
you have off radio play for the iPhone
and<00:01:01.890> iPod<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.820> preset<00:01:03.660> buttons<00:01:03.960> but

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
and iPod and the preset buttons but

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.230 
and iPod and the preset buttons but
don't<00:01:05.010> forget<00:01:05.100> about<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.489> buttons<00:01:05.729> up<00:01:05.880> here

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
don't forget about the buttons up here

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.310 
don't forget about the buttons up here
this<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.450> how<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.689> tune<00:01:07.080> your<00:01:07.260> radio<00:01:07.320> and

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
this is how you tune your radio and

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.539 
this is how you tune your radio and
these<00:01:10.320> are<00:01:10.530> going<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.680> be<00:01:10.830> very<00:01:11.040> important<00:01:11.460> on

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
these are going to be very important on

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.140 
these are going to be very important on
how<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.790> set<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.960> presets<00:01:13.729> this<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.880> why<00:01:15.000> it's

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
how you set the presets this is why it's

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.700 
how you set the presets this is why it's
probably<00:01:15.240> confusing<00:01:15.810> for<00:01:15.990> most<00:01:16.170> because<00:01:16.560> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
probably confusing for most because the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.109 
probably confusing for most because the
preset<00:01:17.070> buttons<00:01:17.340> are<00:01:17.430> up<00:01:17.520> here<00:01:17.729> but<00:01:17.909> how<00:01:18.060> to

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
preset buttons are up here but how to

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.830 
preset buttons are up here but how to
set<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.689> up<00:01:18.840> here<00:01:20.090> so<00:01:21.090> let<00:01:21.360> me<00:01:21.390> go<00:01:21.479> through

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
set it is up here so let me go through

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.230 
set it is up here so let me go through
and<00:01:22.110> show<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.310> also<00:01:23.580> thought<00:01:23.939> there<00:01:24.119> was

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
and show you I also thought there was

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.700 
and show you I also thought there was
another<00:01:24.479> question<00:01:24.720> someone<00:01:25.110> had<00:01:25.380> I'm<00:01:25.560> going

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
another question someone had I'm going

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.670 
another question someone had I'm going
to<00:01:25.770> just<00:01:25.979> double<00:01:26.280> check<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.759> real<00:01:26.939> quick

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.249 

so<00:01:31.680> one<00:01:31.950> question<00:01:32.159> was<00:01:32.610> um<00:01:36.020> someone<00:01:37.020> cannot

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
so one question was um someone cannot

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.219 
so one question was um someone cannot
figure<00:01:37.500> out<00:01:37.650> how<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:37.979> presets<00:01:39.079> for<00:01:40.079> your

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
the alarm clock automatically sets

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.810 
the alarm clock automatically sets
itself<00:01:58.320> not<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.979> alarm<00:01:59.130> clock<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.579> clock

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
itself not the alarm clock the clock

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.280 
itself not the alarm clock the clock
itself<00:02:00.149> but<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.430> set<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.610> clock<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:04.020> alarm

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
itself but to set the clock the alarm

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.080 
itself but to set the clock the alarm
clock<00:02:04.469> there's<00:02:05.280> just<00:02:05.490> two<00:02:05.610> buttons<00:02:05.939> at<00:02:06.060> the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
clock there's just two buttons at the

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.360 
clock there's just two buttons at the
base<00:02:06.329> here<00:02:06.570> alarm<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.950> alarm<00:02:08.369> B<00:02:09.950> so<00:02:10.950> if<00:02:11.250> you

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
base here alarm a and alarm B so if you

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.550 
base here alarm a and alarm B so if you
want<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.610> set<00:02:11.819> it

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.979 

you<00:02:15.560> just<00:02:15.769> hit<00:02:15.860> a<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:17.060> starts<00:02:17.330> blinking

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.140 

then<00:02:20.989> all<00:02:21.110> you<00:02:21.200> have<00:02:21.319> to<00:02:21.410> do<00:02:21.560> is<00:02:22.280> hit<00:02:22.519> the<00:02:22.790> time

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
then all you have to do is hit the time

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.259 
then all you have to do is hit the time
set<00:02:24.700> so<00:02:25.700> let's<00:02:25.879> just<00:02:26.090> say<00:02:26.300> it's<00:02:27.430> six<00:02:28.430> I<00:02:28.730> want<00:02:29.180> to

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269
