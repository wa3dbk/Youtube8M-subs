so the first thing i want to touch on is

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.589 
so the first thing i want to touch on is
toning<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:26.130> females<00:00:26.849> have<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.300> get<00:00:27.480> the

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
toning that you females have to get the

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.080 
toning that you females have to get the
principal<00:00:27.990> out<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.170> your<00:00:28.349> head<00:00:28.880> because<00:00:29.880> in

principal out of your head because in

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.229 
principal out of your head because in
reality<00:00:30.300> i<00:00:30.599> think<00:00:31.050> what<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.410> mean<00:00:31.650> about<00:00:32.239> how

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.770 
reality i think what you mean about how
I<00:00:33.270> would<00:00:33.719> define<00:00:34.050> toning<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.390> building<00:00:36.390> muscle

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
I would define toning is building muscle

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.569 
I would define toning is building muscle
and<00:00:37.040> losing<00:00:38.040> body<00:00:38.280> fat<00:00:38.370> right<00:00:39.320> so<00:00:40.399> whether<00:00:41.399> you

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
and losing body fat right so whether you

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.549 
and losing body fat right so whether you
know<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.790> or<00:00:42.000> not<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.540> want<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.140> build<00:00:43.320> that

Moscow Moscow you want to build that
muscle<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:50.239> understand<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.390> can<00:00:51.510> be<00:00:51.660> very

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
muscle and I understand it can be very

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.990 
muscle and I understand it can be very
intimidating<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.949> go<00:00:53.100> into<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.550> weight

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
intimidating to go into the weight

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.029 
intimidating to go into the weight
lifting<00:00:54.840> area<00:00:56.360> that's<00:00:57.360> how<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.600> felt<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.920> know

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
lifting area that's how I felt you know

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.709 
lifting area that's how I felt you know
it<00:00:59.219> was<00:00:59.340> definitely<00:00:59.670> outside<00:01:00.210> my<00:01:00.539> comfort

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
it was definitely outside my comfort

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.850 
it was definitely outside my comfort
zone<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:02.190> thought<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:03.059> if<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:04.110> went<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.619> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
zone and I thought that if I went to the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.670 
zone and I thought that if I went to the
area<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.250> lifted<00:01:05.790> weights<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:06.240> would<00:01:06.689> become

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
area and lifted weights I would become

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.330 
area and lifted weights I would become
bulky<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.369> look<00:01:08.970> masculine<00:01:09.390> but<00:01:10.110> we<00:01:10.950> all<00:01:11.100> know

that those females who do look that way

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.830 
that those females who do look that way
