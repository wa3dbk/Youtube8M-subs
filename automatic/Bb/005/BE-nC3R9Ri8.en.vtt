00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:06.190
 or the tribe this is the new course that is 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:08.430
 I offer is about photographic composition 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.410
 wow 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.300
 one identifies the center of interest 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.100
 It has to be clear about what is your 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.960
 picture the main subject has to be 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.520
 well focused and the other elements that 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.890
 come out in the photo they can not steal 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.960
 prominence if more things do not come out better 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.430
 even though it does not need to be in 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.539
 the center of the photo I tell you in the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.599
 rule of the third 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.579
 2 the rule of thirds consists of 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.110
 place the object of interest in one of 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.660
 the points where the lines cross 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.269
 of the camera's viewfinder to put the 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.370
 lines on your camera look for the button on 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:41.379
 the one that makes the 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.970
 vertical lines and horizontal ones in 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.399
 site where this line will cross 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.989
 called intersection of thirds there is 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.690
 where the reason for their 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.519
 positions between you you look at the 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.570
 big shades of art almost all use 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.570
 the rule of thirds 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.890
 you can only use the center of the image 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.080
 when you want to get an actor 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.820
 visual impact if you want it to be 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.300
 harmoniously uses the rule of 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.300
 thirds 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.540
 3 fill in the frame occupy the largest 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.610
 possible part of the photo with that 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.290
 you want to count so that it is the center 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.570
 of attention removes all the elements 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.160
 what they do not give you if we try to 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.560
 take from more and further away may not be 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.950
 Of course we wanted to show us if you have 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.579
 doubts if you want to leave or not remove it 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.619
 4 girls look for me I love girls 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:34.930
 photos with lines I go through the world watching 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.640
 lines in a photo in the ruins of the 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.619
 I start the look that you have to take 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.270
 from one part to another of the straights already 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.759
 be horizontal or vertical 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.120
 diagonals notice that they are followed 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.100
 to solve it 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.200
 Of particular interest are the 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.850
 converging lines those parallel 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.680
 they need the distance they finish 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.360
 turning into a point is because you 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.980
 Always make travel photography 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.980
 from the beginning to the city 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.480
 Y 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.409
 all right 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.049
 5 Jan efe curves the curves 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.299
 transmit in movement and help 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.730
 drive the look we also make a 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.540
 photographic vision exercise 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.430
 we will discover many elements 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.709
 everyday that allow us in 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.950
 addresses of the three points on roads 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.260
 cold road 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.920
 They are very powerful and give a lot of interest to 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.920
 the photograph 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.920
 the repeated elements the repetition of 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.440
 forms can give great rhythm is 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.180
 photography you create some guidelines that you 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.850
 Envelops animate and have filter touches 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.620
 attention within the photo the guidelines are 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.600
 can create with another request for lights 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.500
 and shadows with more repeated connector 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.500
 same objects 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.630
 an element that breaks the order is a 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.310
 strong point of impact to label 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.940
 standing 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.980
 7 in the market sometimes we find the 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.870
 of the landscape elements that help us 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.890
 put a frame around the center 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.890
 interest of the photo 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.010
 Maybe more 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.030
 8 triangles and triplets 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.099
 curiously in photography there is a 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.930
 perception especially for numbers 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.939
 odd especially by the groups of 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.620
 three it is possible that the strength of a 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.629
 triangle I find it is creating in 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.510
 contrast a secret connecting with the 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.590
 lines that make the triangle shape 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.370
 respective buildings or groups of 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.370
 three equal pieces 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.290
 and nothing more 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.700
 9 the golden ratio this is a theme 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.530
 precious for you to be so not 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.180
 Reveal a secret but look at these 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.180
 photos that form golden proportions 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.740
 to go 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.090
 and my love 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:45.839
 the front against the bottom the important thing 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:48.629
 You must be in front of your photograph 

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:50.669
 there must be a lot of detail in the background that 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:53.159
 make attention lose this what 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.739
 you will get blurring the background with 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:58.139
 putting little depth of field in the 

00:04:55.739 --> 00:04:59.249
 automatic camera approach the object that 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.589
 you want to photograph 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:03.409
 remember front focused background 

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:06.009
 unfocused 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:06.009
 today
