filter<00:03:33.709> okay<00:03:34.160> well<00:03:34.400> anybody<00:03:34.880> who<00:03:35.180> would<00:03:35.300> want

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
filter okay well anybody who would want

filter okay well anybody who would want
to<00:03:35.570> do<00:03:35.720> that<00:03:35.870> would<00:03:36.020> be<00:03:36.080> an<00:03:36.260> idiot<00:03:36.560> anyway

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
to do that would be an idiot anyway

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.660 
to do that would be an idiot anyway
since<00:03:39.320> we're<00:03:39.560> not<00:03:39.709> idiots<00:03:39.950> and<00:03:40.400> we're<00:03:40.550> not

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
take this plug off inside here because

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.470 
take this plug off inside here because
it<00:04:06.320> is<00:04:06.470> sort<00:04:06.739> of<00:04:06.800> delicate<00:04:07.340> inside<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.239> tube

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
it is sort of delicate inside the tube

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.280 
it is sort of delicate inside the tube
here<00:04:08.959> is<00:04:09.140> a<00:04:10.010> plunger<00:04:10.700> with<00:04:11.060> a<00:04:11.090> spring<00:04:11.600> and<00:04:11.840> this

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
here is a plunger with a spring and this

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.140 
here is a plunger with a spring and this
spring<00:04:12.680> is<00:04:12.800> located<00:04:13.010> at<00:04:13.430> the<00:04:13.519> bottom<00:04:13.850> and<00:04:13.970> as

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
spring is located at the bottom and as

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.740 
spring is located at the bottom and as
you<00:04:14.440> screw<00:04:15.440> down<00:04:15.590> the<00:04:15.650> fuel<00:04:16.040> filter<00:04:16.430> it

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
you screw down the fuel filter it

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.890 
you screw down the fuel filter it
depresses<00:04:17.919> it<00:04:18.919> depresses<00:04:19.669> this<00:04:19.910> so<00:04:20.450> the<00:04:20.600> fuel

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
depresses it depresses this so the fuel

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.110 
depresses it depresses this so the fuel
is<00:04:21.019> allowed<00:04:21.320> to<00:04:21.350> enter<00:04:21.620> what<00:04:22.520> we<00:04:22.669> do<00:04:22.850> is<00:04:23.000> we

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
is allowed to enter what we do is we

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.610 
is allowed to enter what we do is we
just<00:04:23.150> eliminate<00:04:23.810> the<00:04:23.930> whole<00:04:24.050> damn<00:04:24.289> thing

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
just eliminate the whole damn thing

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.360 
just eliminate the whole damn thing
let's<00:04:24.890> take<00:04:25.070> it<00:04:25.190> completely<00:04:25.669> out<00:04:25.700> of<00:04:25.970> there

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
let's take it completely out of there

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.390 
let's take it completely out of there
and<00:04:27.350> you<00:04:28.350> know<00:04:28.470> it's<00:04:28.620> not<00:04:28.800> and<00:04:29.010> you<00:04:29.100> see<00:04:29.280> how

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
and you know it's not and you see how

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.190 
and you know it's not and you see how
much<00:04:29.520> restriction<00:04:30.150> there<00:04:30.300> is<00:04:30.480> there<00:04:30.750> the<00:04:30.900> fuel

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
much restriction there is there the fuel

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.700 
much restriction there is there the fuel
can't<00:04:31.590> flow<00:04:31.980> through<00:04:32.240> that<00:04:33.240> as<00:04:33.510> fast<00:04:33.870> with<00:04:34.680> it

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
can't flow through that as fast with it

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.310 
can't flow through that as fast with it
in<00:04:35.010> there<00:04:35.250> as<00:04:35.430> without<00:04:36.180> it<00:04:36.389> because<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.080> fuel

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
in there as without it because the fuel

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.879 
in there as without it because the fuel
comes<00:04:37.650> in<00:04:38.840> again<00:04:39.840> the<00:04:39.990> fuel<00:04:40.200> comes<00:04:40.470> in<00:04:40.620> here

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
comes in again the fuel comes in here

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:42.740 
comes in again the fuel comes in here
it's<00:04:41.190> pressurized<00:04:41.760> here<00:04:42.180> this<00:04:42.360> is<00:04:42.540> actually

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
it's pressurized here this is actually

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.170 
it's pressurized here this is actually
pressurized<00:04:43.590> and<00:04:43.800> then<00:04:44.280> it<00:04:44.400> climbs<00:04:44.910> up

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
pressurized and then it climbs up

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.510 
pressurized and then it climbs up
through<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:45.990> filter<00:04:46.440> and<00:04:46.590> then<00:04:47.310> goes<00:04:47.490> down

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
through the filter and then goes down

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.190 
through the filter and then goes down
through<00:04:48.150> this<00:04:48.360> area<00:04:48.720> and<00:04:48.930> then<00:04:49.050> is

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
through this area and then is

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.700 
through this area and then is
distributed<00:04:49.889> out<00:04:50.070> to<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.960> individual

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
distributed out to the the individual

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.220 
distributed out to the the individual
cylinder<00:04:53.190> heads<00:04:53.430> here<00:04:54.240> so<00:04:54.780> now<00:04:54.930> that<00:04:54.990> we've

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
cylinder heads here so now that we've

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.590 
cylinder heads here so now that we've
eliminated<00:04:55.470> that<00:04:55.889> we<00:04:56.700> can<00:04:56.940> go<00:04:57.090> ahead<00:04:57.210> and

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
eliminated that we can go ahead and

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.480 
eliminated that we can go ahead and
reinstall<00:04:58.320> the<00:04:58.860> heater<00:04:59.190> and<00:04:59.580> the<00:05:00.570> tube<00:05:01.460> one<00:05:02.460> of

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080 
you're probably going to encounter about

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.600 
you're probably going to encounter about
45<00:07:24.710> to<00:07:24.920> 50<00:07:25.130> psi<00:07:25.610> of<00:07:26.330> a<00:07:26.870> fuel<00:07:27.560> pressure<00:07:27.800> if<00:07:28.100> you

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:28.610 
45 to 50 psi of a fuel pressure if you

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.090 
45 to 50 psi of a fuel pressure if you
can<00:07:28.760> increase<00:07:29.030> that<00:07:29.150> to<00:07:29.390> 70<00:07:30.080> by<00:07:30.290> putting<00:07:31.040> a

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:31.100 
can increase that to 70 by putting a

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.040 
can increase that to 70 by putting a
stiffer<00:07:31.370> spring<00:07:31.790> in<00:07:31.940> there<00:07:32.090> it's<00:07:32.570> a<00:07:32.720> good<00:07:32.870> idea

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:33.050 
stiffer spring in there it's a good idea

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.800 
stiffer spring in there it's a good idea
to<00:07:33.380> do<00:07:33.590> this<00:07:33.830> by<00:07:34.820> increasing<00:07:35.450> the<00:07:35.570> fuel

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:35.810 
to do this by increasing the fuel
