00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:18.070
 and the guys the change list of the 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.619
 windows ce for minecraft and the 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.630
 version 0.12 point 1 and finally 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.749
 we can have the list of changes and 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.999
 let's know what brings us this wheel 12 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:30.310
 that is possibly the last one because 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:33.340
 the things that I have read and that have added 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.800
 Well, the truth is very good but 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.710
 very well because it has things that the 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.060
 truth because it looks like a perfect web 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.610
 so I think it's going to be the 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.830
 last but we'll see I do not know to see 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.600
 when they take out the apk and others or see what 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.100
 they report all those guys but good 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.050
 here I come to you bringing what the 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.510
 list of changes and I 'll tell you that 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.310
 have added and well, he added that 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.800
 the fishing rod now makes a sound 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:00.370
 of less repetitive that is pretty 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.400
 well then they have put the sounds equal 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.320
 that the pc since I also told you 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.620
 that's good, that's the best part of this 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.200
 web that have put the sounds guys 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:15.910
 we were asking for that a long time ago 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.890
 so good now the stop losses 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.870
 line have the correct sounds 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.240
 also serves them the subsidiary make noise 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.890
 in while they move they will not make noise 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.230
 then the skeletons and the wii of the now 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.350
 they have an adequate sound when they die 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.700
 it's worth the wii effects of clear I say 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.880
 because the government has put it not 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.890
 so then the leader praises her now 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.380
 yours as I started it's going to be better 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.580
 before it did not flow so much and so on and so 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.640
 guys because it also runs has been 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.780
 enough errors mistakes that have to be 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.310
 they have been able to correct us in the 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.260
 previous willy and they just finished 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.480
 correct now as for example the 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.280
 critical hits are now with more 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.890
 particles 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.450
 because there would also be vibrations 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.700
 now when the destruction of two 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.250
 tall plants or chairs of those is not 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.570
 well it's pretty good 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.340
 the bucs and look for them corrected and then 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.289
 what they have added that what I most 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.580
 like to me are the sounds and so 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.899
 some more little things out there then 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.540

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.930

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.900
 I'm not going to greet one who for example
