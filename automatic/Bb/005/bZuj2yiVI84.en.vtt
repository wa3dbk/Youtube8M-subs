don't<00:01:18.990> know<00:01:19.140> i<00:01:19.200> think<00:01:19.350> it's<00:01:19.680> probably<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:20.009> good

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
don't know i think it's probably a good

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.340 
don't know i think it's probably a good
thing<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.820> prevent<00:01:21.479> people<00:01:21.720> from<00:01:21.750> camping<00:01:22.200> out

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
thing to prevent people from camping out

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.140

and prevent people from getting hurt I

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.520 
and prevent people from getting hurt I
think<00:01:24.299> that's<00:01:24.420> more<00:01:24.570> important<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.290> want<00:01:25.470> to

think that's more important you want to

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.080 
think that's more important you want to
get<00:01:25.619> hurt<00:01:25.740> for<00:01:25.950> just<00:01:26.130> trying<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.549> get<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.670> pair
