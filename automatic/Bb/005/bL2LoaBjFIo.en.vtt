00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.759
 It's sport eva, it's not easy, right? 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.360
 have to study hard, I'll tell you one 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:18.199
 little about copper see here copper 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.449
 the difference between this copper wire 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:26.130
 red hopscotch and another 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.140
 aesthetically the same may seem so 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.640
 at first glance there is no difference 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.120
 But have you ever stopped to think of 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.550
 quality product quality 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.040
 efficiency and durability all this 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.010
 So when you're going to think about making a 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.530
 investment in a low- 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.289
 quality says cheaper 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.500
 do you think that the applied material 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:53.190
 it's the right material we not only 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.140
 aesthetically black black plastic so 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.930
 during training but have 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.109
 international diagnosis here of bosch 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.019
 We learn to do tests. 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.080
 theory learned the calculations but the people 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.400
 learns very interesting points like 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.220
 that's what I told you 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.700
 you looking at a copper wire of the same 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.630
 same color measure to the naked eye or is it all 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.180
 equal 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.400
 but you have a defect in a car and you 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.040
 Do you have any problem with 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:27.180
 durability and coming back to complain 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.470
 think well parallel part is that is 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.750
 all right 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.950
 I think I said it's black but it will be 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.770
 that I pass the appropriate 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.860
 will the proper copper then think 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.790
 well with you friend repairman will do 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.450
 a training 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.619
 drink from the source in the case bosch nÃ© 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.350
 is a mixed assistant manufacturer of 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.220
 very first line 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:55.150
 so for the right place is in small 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.860
 details that make the difference and these 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.500
 details we are going to bring 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.619
 opportunity to prevent even 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.630
 for your client does not think about it 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.940
 quality this is today's direct tip 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.440

 Beauty is not cool, there's no quality 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.930
 It does not seem like much, but it's your step. 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.720
 it's black 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.650
 Is this enough to have the 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.900
 same quality cool people

 will be that all black pitch equals
