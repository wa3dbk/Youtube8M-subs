00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
now that you're trying to kid or adapt

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.310 
now that you're trying to kid or adapt
you're<00:02:15.580> not<00:02:15.700> adapting<00:02:16.330> you<00:02:16.660> don't<00:02:16.900> know<00:02:17.050> what

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
you're not adapting you don't know what

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.070 
you're not adapting you don't know what
what<00:02:17.740> aren't<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.010> do<00:02:18.160> adaptive<00:02:18.780> perhaps<00:02:19.780> it's

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
what aren't you do adaptive perhaps it's

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.280 
what aren't you do adaptive perhaps it's
a<00:02:20.230> fact<00:02:20.500> that<00:02:21.040> your<00:02:21.220> body<00:02:21.430> cannot<00:02:22.030> retain<00:02:22.630> the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
a fact that your body cannot retain the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.110 
a fact that your body cannot retain the
vitamins<00:02:23.800> and<00:02:24.040> minerals<00:02:24.520> that<00:02:24.610> you<00:02:24.820> try<00:02:25.060> to

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
vitamins and minerals that you try to

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.440 
vitamins and minerals that you try to
put<00:02:25.450> in<00:02:25.690> you<00:02:25.990> try<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:26.260> eat<00:02:26.470> so<00:02:26.740> well<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:28.000> you're

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
put in you try to eat so well and you're

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.170 
put in you try to eat so well and you're
not<00:02:28.720> adapting<00:02:29.580> because<00:02:30.580> those<00:02:30.760> things<00:02:31.030> are

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
not adapting because those things are

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.010 
not adapting because those things are
going<00:02:31.360> right<00:02:31.510> through<00:02:32.430> how<00:02:33.430> about<00:02:33.760> that<00:02:34.120> right

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
going right through how about that right

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.420 
going right through how about that right
stop<00:02:35.770> eating<00:02:36.070> wheat<00:02:37.530> it<00:02:38.530> will<00:02:38.710> do<00:02:38.860> that<00:02:39.070> it'll

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
stop eating wheat it will do that it'll

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.820 
stop eating wheat it will do that it'll
destroy<00:02:39.910> your<00:02:40.270> gut<00:02:40.540> so<00:02:41.110> then<00:02:41.290> when<00:02:41.440> you<00:02:41.530> try

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
destroy your gut so then when you try

and try to finally change your life your

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.670 
and try to finally change your life your
body<00:02:44.980> is<00:02:45.190> not<00:02:45.340> absorbing<00:02:45.790> their<00:02:45.910> nutrients<00:02:46.680> so

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
body is not absorbing their nutrients so

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.650 
body is not absorbing their nutrients so
some<00:02:47.920> people<00:02:48.070> have<00:02:48.280> to<00:02:48.550> take<00:02:48.580> these<00:02:48.940> liquid

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
some people have to take these liquid

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.710 
some people have to take these liquid
minerals<00:02:50.110> because<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:51.820> normal<00:02:52.270> manner<00:02:52.450> loser

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
minerals because the normal manner loser

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.530 
minerals because the normal manner loser
what<00:02:53.350> you<00:02:53.470> might<00:02:53.650> find<00:02:53.830> in<00:02:54.100> foods<00:02:54.400> is<00:02:54.640> just<00:02:55.120> not

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
what you might find in foods is just not

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.350 
what you might find in foods is just not
going<00:02:55.900> in<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:56.530> so<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.340> fire<00:02:57.640> is<00:02:57.940> all<00:02:58.060> over

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
going in and so the fire is all over

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.210 
going in and so the fire is all over
your<00:02:58.510> body<00:02:58.720> you<00:02:58.870> can't<00:02:59.110> put<00:02:59.380> them<00:02:59.500> out<00:02:59.620> fire

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
your body you can't put them out fire

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.460 
your body you can't put them out fire
hoses<00:03:00.490> you<00:03:00.700> can't<00:03:00.910> put<00:03:01.030> them<00:03:01.150> out<00:03:01.240> and<00:03:01.840> that's

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
hoses you can't put them out and that's

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.260 
hoses you can't put them out and that's
another<00:03:02.860> reason<00:03:03.220> why<00:03:03.610> you<00:03:03.640> guys<00:03:03.910> are<00:03:04.150> not

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
another reason why you guys are not

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.090 
another reason why you guys are not
adapting<00:03:04.870> I<00:03:05.110> mean<00:03:05.740> there's<00:03:05.890> other<00:03:06.010> things

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
adapting I mean there's other things

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.030 
adapting I mean there's other things
like<00:03:06.430> maybe<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.850> casein<00:03:07.360> in<00:03:07.810> dairy<00:03:08.530> products

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
like maybe the casein in dairy products

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.990 
like maybe the casein in dairy products
got<00:03:09.670> think<00:03:09.880> about<00:03:10.030> how<00:03:10.150> much<00:03:10.300> dairy<00:03:10.660> you<00:03:10.930> use

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
got think about how much dairy you use

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.080 
got think about how much dairy you use
you<00:03:13.000> might<00:03:13.180> have<00:03:13.390> a<00:03:13.660> leptin<00:03:14.440> resistance<00:03:15.090> issue

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
you might have a leptin resistance issue

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.870 
you might have a leptin resistance issue
that's<00:03:17.080> like<00:03:17.290> a<00:03:17.320> serious<00:03:17.920> one<00:03:18.130> you<00:03:18.760> know

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
that's like a serious one you know

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.510 
that's like a serious one you know
that's<00:03:19.240> when<00:03:19.540> your<00:03:19.660> body<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.620> signal<00:03:21.040> from

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
that's when your body the signal from

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.760 
that's when your body the signal from
your<00:03:21.700> body's<00:03:21.910> body<00:03:22.600> fat<00:03:22.840> to<00:03:23.110> your<00:03:23.350> brain<00:03:23.560> is

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
your body's body fat to your brain is

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.430 
your body's body fat to your brain is
not<00:03:23.860> working<00:03:24.040> so<00:03:24.810> there's<00:03:25.810> nothing<00:03:26.020> to<00:03:26.290> tell

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
not working so there's nothing to tell

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.370 
not working so there's nothing to tell
your<00:03:26.620> brain<00:03:26.830> that<00:03:26.890> you<00:03:27.550> got<00:03:27.730> enough<00:03:27.940> body<00:03:28.150> fat

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
your brain that you got enough body fat

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.000 
your brain that you got enough body fat
so<00:03:29.380> you<00:03:29.470> just<00:03:29.620> keep<00:03:29.800> storing<00:03:31.860> and<00:03:32.860> you<00:03:32.920> just

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
so you just keep storing and you just

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.040 
so you just keep storing and you just
keep<00:03:33.190> getting<00:03:33.430> bigger<00:03:33.630> there's<00:03:34.630> nothing<00:03:34.959> to

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
keep getting bigger there's nothing to

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.690 
keep getting bigger there's nothing to
tell<00:03:35.230> your<00:03:35.350> brain<00:03:35.530> and<00:03:36.070> you<00:03:36.220> go<00:03:36.340> down<00:03:36.520> in

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
tell your brain and you go down in

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.610 
tell your brain and you go down in
calories<00:03:37.209> you're<00:03:37.390> like<00:03:37.540> well<00:03:38.140> I'll<00:03:38.290> just<00:03:38.440> eat

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
calories you're like well I'll just eat

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.300 
calories you're like well I'll just eat
less<00:03:38.830> and<00:03:39.670> you<00:03:39.820> still<00:03:40.239> are<00:03:40.420> like<00:03:40.600> this<00:03:41.310> because

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
less and you still are like this because

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.090 
less and you still are like this because
there's<00:03:42.489> no<00:03:42.700> signal<00:03:43.570> that<00:03:44.110> hormone<00:03:44.590> leptin<00:03:44.920> is

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
there's no signal that hormone leptin is

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.650 
there's no signal that hormone leptin is
