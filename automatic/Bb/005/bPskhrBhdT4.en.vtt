hi<00:00:02.129> this<00:00:02.190> is<00:00:02.580> Catherine<00:00:03.270> EE<00:00:03.780> the<00:00:03.959> answer<00:00:04.410> lady

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
hi this is Catherine EE the answer lady

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.550 
hi this is Catherine EE the answer lady
we<00:00:05.310> all<00:00:05.339> like<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:06.000> have<00:00:06.210> nice<00:00:06.480> edges<00:00:07.200> for<00:00:07.440> our

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
we all like to have nice edges for our

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.190 
we all like to have nice edges for our
knits<00:00:07.859> because<00:00:08.330> without<00:00:09.330> them<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.990> knits

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
knits because without them the knits

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.900 
knits because without them the knits
will<00:00:10.410> roll<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:10.830> not<00:00:11.010> look<00:00:11.250> very<00:00:11.280> good<00:00:11.700> but

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
will roll and not look very good but

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.700 
will roll and not look very good but
some<00:00:12.150> of<00:00:12.300> those<00:00:12.450> edges<00:00:12.929> are<00:00:13.049> difficult<00:00:13.559> to

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
some of those edges are difficult to

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.129 
some of those edges are difficult to
achieve<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.429> I<00:00:15.000> like<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.389> find<00:00:15.630> some<00:00:15.960> that

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
achieve and I like to find some that

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.680 
achieve and I like to find some that
look<00:00:16.350> really<00:00:16.619> really<00:00:17.039> nice<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.640> yet<00:00:18.330> are<00:00:18.449> easy

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
look really really nice and yet are easy

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.250 
look really really nice and yet are easy

to do here's one I use sometimes this
one<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.830> right<00:00:23.160> next<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.820> cabled<00:00:24.480> edge<00:00:24.779> so

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
one is right next to a cabled edge so

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
rung and bring it around the first one

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.730 
rung and bring it around the first one

I<00:01:40.799> am<00:01:41.100> simply<00:01:41.579> going<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.909> latch<00:01:42.299> up<00:01:42.799> two<00:01:43.799> rungs

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
I am simply going to latch up two rungs

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.249 
I am simply going to latch up two rungs
at<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.520> time<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:47.299> feel<00:01:48.299> clumsy<00:01:48.600> because<00:01:49.110> I'm

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
at a time I feel clumsy because I'm

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.800 
at a time I feel clumsy because I'm
working<00:01:49.710> with<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.490> camera<00:01:50.790> between<00:01:51.149> me<00:01:51.630> and

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
working with the camera between me and

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.350 
working with the camera between me and
the<00:01:51.930> work<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:52.920> can<00:01:53.220> be<00:01:53.369> sure<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.790> seeing<00:01:54.119> it

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
the work so I can be sure of seeing it

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.080 
the work so I can be sure of seeing it
and<00:01:55.250> therefore<00:01:56.250> make<00:01:56.490> sure<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.880> you're

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
and therefore make sure that you're

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.480 
and therefore make sure that you're
seeing<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.600> but<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.469> would<00:01:58.829> be<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:58.979> lot<00:01:59.250> happier

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
seeing it but I would be a lot happier

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.850 
seeing it but I would be a lot happier
doing<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.329> without<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.930> camera<00:02:01.350> for<00:02:01.680> in

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
doing this without the camera for in

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.219 
doing this without the camera for in
real<00:02:02.100> life<00:02:02.369> however<00:02:03.270> it's<00:02:03.750> going<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.049> work

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229

the garment here's the finished cardigan
the<00:03:12.470> sleeve<00:03:12.980> hems<00:03:13.430> were<00:03:13.730> treated<00:03:14.239> in<00:03:14.389> the

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
the sleeve hems were treated in the

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.270 
the sleeve hems were treated in the
manner<00:03:14.810> that<00:03:14.930> I<00:03:15.109> just<00:03:15.440> showed<00:03:15.829> you

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
manner that I just showed you

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.080 
manner that I just showed you
I<00:03:16.310> used<00:03:17.090> crocheting<00:03:17.780> on<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.500> front<00:03:18.859> edges<00:03:19.090> to

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
I used crocheting on the front edges to

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.509 
I used crocheting on the front edges to
try<00:03:20.329> two<00:03:20.389> different<00:03:20.599> things<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.949> crocheting

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
try two different things the crocheting

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.610 
try two different things the crocheting
makes<00:03:22.910> a<00:03:23.060> somewhat<00:03:23.540> more<00:03:23.569> pronounced<00:03:24.410> edge

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
makes a somewhat more pronounced edge

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.789 
makes a somewhat more pronounced edge
but<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:25.519> two<00:03:25.730> are<00:03:25.879> very<00:03:26.150> similar<00:03:26.569> and<00:03:26.989> in<00:03:27.620> this

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
but the two are very similar and in this

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.369 
but the two are very similar and in this
case<00:03:28.220> I<00:03:28.489> felt<00:03:28.849> it<00:03:29.030> was<00:03:29.209> appropriate<00:03:29.359> that<00:03:30.019> the

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379 
case I felt it was appropriate that the

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:33.129 
case I felt it was appropriate that the
sleeve<00:03:30.709> hems<00:03:31.010> be<00:03:31.370> a<00:03:31.609> little<00:03:32.269> lower<00:03:32.449> profile

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
sleeve hems be a little lower profile

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:34.720 
sleeve hems be a little lower profile
and<00:03:33.500> a<00:03:33.560> little<00:03:33.799> bit<00:03:33.949> softer

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
and a little bit softer

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.849 
and a little bit softer
plus<00:03:35.269> I<00:03:35.480> have<00:03:35.750> steamed<00:03:36.109> them<00:03:36.319> a<00:03:36.379> little<00:03:36.709> bit

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
plus I have steamed them a little bit

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.430 
plus I have steamed them a little bit
more<00:03:37.129> because<00:03:37.849> I<00:03:38.090> wanted<00:03:38.569> them<00:03:38.780> to<00:03:38.989> hang

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
more because I wanted them to hang

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.079 
more because I wanted them to hang
softly<00:03:40.280> since<00:03:40.970> it's<00:03:41.180> a<00:03:41.299> boxy<00:03:41.750> sweater
