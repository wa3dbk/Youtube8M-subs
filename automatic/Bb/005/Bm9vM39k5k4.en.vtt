Wonder Woman came in here yesterday and

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.159 
Wonder Woman came in here yesterday and
she<00:00:27.179> really<00:00:27.480> got<00:00:27.720> it

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:28.169 
she really got it

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:29.870 
she really got it
first<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.769> all<00:00:28.829> can<00:00:29.009> you<00:00:29.070> suddenly<00:00:29.310> felt<00:00:29.699> that

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
first of all can you suddenly felt that

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.590 
first of all can you suddenly felt that
she'd<00:00:30.449> never<00:00:30.480> real<00:00:31.079> life<00:00:31.710> skills<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.600> that

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
she'd never real life skills and that

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.490 
she'd never real life skills and that
learning<00:00:34.199> had<00:00:34.649> built<00:00:35.269> like<00:00:36.269> this<00:00:36.510> would<00:00:37.019> be<00:00:37.230> a

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
learning had built like this would be a

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.180 
learning had built like this would be a
really<00:00:37.800> valuable<00:00:38.040> skill<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:39.090> fairly<00:00:39.629> easily

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
really valuable skill that fairly easily

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.420 
really valuable skill that fairly easily
obtained<00:00:41.870> and<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.010> reminded<00:00:44.010> me<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.159> how<00:00:44.400> I

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
obtained and that reminded me of how I

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.310 
obtained and that reminded me of how I
felt<00:00:44.820> even<00:00:45.089> though<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.210> was<00:00:45.510> an<00:00:45.659> architect<00:00:46.170> I

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
felt even though I was an architect I

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.590 
felt even though I was an architect I
didn't<00:00:46.530> really<00:00:46.739> know<00:00:46.860> how<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.070> build<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.339> house

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
didn't really know how to build a house

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.639 
didn't really know how to build a house
in<00:00:48.600> theory<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.079> did<00:00:49.290> but<00:00:49.409> I<00:00:49.470> had<00:00:49.559> no<00:00:49.860> idea<00:00:50.159> and

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
in theory I did but I had no idea and

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:53.930 
in theory I did but I had no idea and
when<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.680> came<00:00:52.800> out<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.220> comp<00:00:53.550> workshop

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
when I came out of that comp workshop

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.240 
when I came out of that comp workshop
that<00:00:54.120> my<00:00:54.300> world<00:00:54.600> had<00:00:54.720> changed<00:00:55.379> because<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.860> felt

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
that my world had changed because I felt

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.320 
that my world had changed because I felt
like<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.549> had<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.570> power<00:00:57.839> at<00:00:58.290> the<00:00:58.939> know-how<00:00:59.939> and

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.330 
like I had the power at the know-how and

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.929 
like I had the power at the know-how and
it<00:01:01.229> isn't<00:01:01.409> this<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.799> not<00:01:01.949> know<00:01:02.220> how<00:01:02.430> it's<00:01:02.580> know

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:02.939 
it isn't this is not know how it's know

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:07.520 
it isn't this is not know how it's know
how<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.600> has<00:01:04.549> to<00:01:05.549> do<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.810> changes

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
how it has to do it and that changes

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:25.460 
how it has to do it and that changes
your<00:01:07.740> world

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.520

my wrist I'm hammering and sawing and

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.820 
my wrist I'm hammering and sawing and
all<00:01:35.979> the<00:01:36.280> noise<00:01:36.549> and<00:01:37.090> toxic<00:01:37.780> wood<00:01:38.110> and<00:01:38.560> stuff

all the noise and toxic wood and stuff

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.090 
all the noise and toxic wood and stuff
and<00:01:38.979> it<00:01:39.070> was<00:01:39.189> just<00:01:39.220> like<00:01:39.580> I<00:01:40.320> was<00:01:41.320> getting<00:01:41.530> fed

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
and it was just like I was getting fed

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.940

up<00:01:42.130> with<00:01:42.280> that<00:01:42.640> part<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.990> then<00:01:44.229> when<00:01:44.470> I<00:01:44.500> saw

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
up with that part so then when I saw

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.730 
up with that part so then when I saw
that<00:01:45.340> you<00:01:45.490> could<00:01:45.670> build<00:01:45.909> without<00:01:46.479> having<00:01:47.289> that

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
that you could build without having that

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.590 
that you could build without having that
right<00:01:48.159> artists<00:01:48.759> and<00:01:49.350> tweezing<00:01:50.350> and<00:01:50.679> noise<00:01:51.600> you

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
right artists and tweezing and noise you

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.570 
right artists and tweezing and noise you
know<00:01:52.630> really<00:01:53.020> excludes<00:01:53.649> other<00:01:53.920> people<00:01:54.429> you

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
and working together and so it ended up

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.569 
and working together and so it ended up
being<00:02:25.090> this<00:02:25.450> much<00:02:25.690> bigger<00:02:26.049> thing<00:02:26.470> than<00:02:26.500> than<00:02:27.400> I

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
being this much bigger thing than than I

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:29.190 
being this much bigger thing than than I
pictured<00:02:28.030> in<00:02:28.209> the<00:02:28.299> first<00:02:28.510> place<00:02:28.780> which<00:02:29.019> was

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
pictured in the first place which was

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.380 
pictured in the first place which was
just<00:02:29.440> like<00:02:29.620> oh<00:02:29.829> this<00:02:30.430> is<00:02:30.549> so<00:02:30.760> beautiful<00:02:30.970> this

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
just like oh this is so beautiful this

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.080 
just like oh this is so beautiful this
is<00:02:31.450> so<00:02:31.750> cool<00:02:32.109> you<00:02:32.500> know<00:02:32.650> when<00:02:33.310> everybody<00:02:33.579> to<00:02:33.940> do

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
is so cool you know when everybody to do

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.940 
is so cool you know when everybody to do
it<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:34.450> then<00:02:34.570> slowly<00:02:34.900> it<00:02:35.049> just<00:02:35.320> became<00:02:35.620> that<00:02:35.680> I

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
it and then slowly it just became that I

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.120 
it and then slowly it just became that I
don't<00:02:36.280> even<00:02:36.549> care<00:02:36.820> that<00:02:37.150> much<00:02:37.720> about<00:02:38.049> the<00:02:38.320> the

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
don't even care that much about the the

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.849 
don't even care that much about the the
cob<00:02:39.430> itself<00:02:40.060> it's<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.900> process<00:02:41.200> of<00:02:41.709> the

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:41.859 
cob itself it's the process of the

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:45.319 
cob itself it's the process of the
people<00:02:42.459> getting<00:02:42.760> together<00:02:42.940> and<00:02:43.480> sharing<00:02:44.070> and

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
people getting together and sharing and

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.210 
people getting together and sharing and
realizing<00:02:46.329> that<00:02:46.380> they<00:02:47.380> can<00:02:47.590> do<00:02:47.829> what<00:02:48.190> they

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
realizing that they can do what they
