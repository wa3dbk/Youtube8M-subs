00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:14.979 
that's a fitters paper there and here
and<00:03:02.099> as<00:03:02.909> well<00:03:03.120> as<00:03:03.420> on<00:03:03.989> some<00:03:04.920> of<00:03:05.069> the<00:03:05.159> spiders

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.509 

it's<00:03:15.989> hard<00:03:16.170> to<00:03:16.319> keep<00:03:16.530> this<00:03:16.680> in<00:03:16.860> frame<00:03:17.129> because

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
it's hard to keep this in frame because

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:30.929 
it's hard to keep this in frame because
so<00:03:17.909> large<00:03:18.720> when<00:03:18.989> it<00:03:19.140> opens

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:30.939 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:34.030 

now<00:03:31.939> you<00:03:32.000> can<00:03:32.330> also<00:03:32.540> put<00:03:32.959> a<00:03:32.989> photo<00:03:33.379> on<00:03:33.620> the

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
now you can also put a photo on the

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:44.679 
now you can also put a photo on the
middle<00:03:36.760> on<00:03:37.760> here<00:03:39.430> here<00:03:40.900> and<00:03:42.610> on<00:03:43.610> this<00:03:43.879> one<00:03:44.209> and

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:44.689 
middle on here here and on this one and

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:49.360 
middle on here here and on this one and
just<00:03:44.720> do<00:03:45.200> these<00:03:45.470> little<00:03:45.620> coaches<00:03:46.099> in<00:03:46.280> here<00:03:48.370> so

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
just do these little coaches in here so

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.880 
just do these little coaches in here so
that's<00:03:49.489> the<00:03:49.640> Elmo<00:03:50.000> it's<00:03:50.870> very<00:03:51.200> small<00:03:51.650> its

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
that's the Elmo it's very small its

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.610 
that's the Elmo it's very small its
compact<00:03:52.099> so<00:03:52.700> it's<00:03:52.879> great<00:03:53.150> for<00:03:53.180> a<00:03:53.480> theme<00:03:53.840> if<00:03:54.140> you

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
compact so it's great for a theme if you

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.860 
compact so it's great for a theme if you
were<00:03:54.769> going<00:03:55.670> to<00:03:55.760> a<00:03:55.790> baby<00:03:56.000> shower<00:03:56.120> you<00:03:56.420> can<00:03:56.750> make

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
were going to a baby shower you can make

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.670 
were going to a baby shower you can make
one<00:03:57.049> for<00:03:57.379> a<00:03:57.620> baby<00:03:57.799> shower<00:03:57.890> or<00:03:59.200> Christmas<00:04:00.200> or

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
one for a baby shower or Christmas or

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.470 
one for a baby shower or Christmas or
Thanksgiving<00:04:00.709> or<00:04:01.579> whatnot<00:04:01.790> I<00:04:02.000> do<00:04:02.180> have<00:04:02.450> a

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
Thanksgiving or whatnot I do have a

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.229 
Thanksgiving or whatnot I do have a
tutorial<00:04:03.079> on<00:04:03.440> my<00:04:03.590> website<00:04:04.010> at<00:04:04.280> scrap<00:04:05.090> and

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
tutorial on my website at scrap and

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.860 
tutorial on my website at scrap and
rabbit<00:04:05.569> calm<00:04:05.959> and<00:04:06.489> it's<00:04:07.489> only<00:04:07.670> $9.99<00:04:08.420> for

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
rabbit calm and it's only $9.99 for

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.390 
rabbit calm and it's only $9.99 for
personal<00:04:09.290> use<00:04:09.500> and<00:04:09.530> you<00:04:09.859> can<00:04:09.889> make<00:04:10.190> one<00:04:10.370> of

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
personal use and you can make one of

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.520 
personal use and you can make one of
these<00:04:10.609> I<00:04:10.819> think<00:04:11.209> you<00:04:11.750> can<00:04:11.930> probably<00:04:12.170> easily

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
these I think you can probably easily

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.160 
these I think you can probably easily
make<00:04:12.889> one<00:04:13.069> of<00:04:13.159> these<00:04:13.250> in<00:04:13.659> two<00:04:14.659> days<00:04:14.840> if<00:04:15.079> you

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
make one of these in two days if you

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.469 
make one of these in two days if you
take<00:04:15.379> your<00:04:15.500> time<00:04:15.739> and<00:04:16.070> there's<00:04:17.000> a<00:04:17.060> lot<00:04:17.150> of

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
take your time and there's a lot of

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:19.090 
take your time and there's a lot of
matting<00:04:17.959> and<00:04:18.109> that's<00:04:18.410> what<00:04:18.650> takes<00:04:18.919> the

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
matting and that's what takes the

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.600 
matting and that's what takes the
longest<00:04:19.489> to<00:04:19.850> do<00:04:20.510> so<00:04:20.989> you<00:04:21.079> could<00:04:21.500> work<00:04:21.889> hard<00:04:22.340> all

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
longest to do so you could work hard all

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.270 
longest to do so you could work hard all
day<00:04:22.669> and<00:04:23.300> do<00:04:23.930> it<00:04:24.110> in<00:04:24.260> one<00:04:24.470> day<00:04:24.650> I<00:04:24.680> think<00:04:25.070> but<00:04:25.250> I

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
day and do it in one day I think but I

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.920 
day and do it in one day I think but I
usually<00:04:25.520> take<00:04:25.970> about<00:04:26.240> two<00:04:26.479> days<00:04:26.510> to<00:04:26.690> make

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
usually take about two days to make

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.810 
usually take about two days to make
these<00:04:27.260> because<00:04:27.710> of<00:04:27.740> the<00:04:28.010> all<00:04:28.280> of<00:04:28.460> the<00:04:28.610> matting

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
these because of the all of the matting

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.730 
these because of the all of the matting
that's<00:04:29.120> involved<00:04:29.510> I<00:04:29.840> hope<00:04:30.199> you<00:04:30.350> like<00:04:30.530> it

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
that's involved I hope you like it

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.580 
that's involved I hope you like it
take<00:04:31.370> care
