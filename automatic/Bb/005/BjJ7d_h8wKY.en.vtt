actually split the keyboard to generate

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:36.389 
actually split the keyboard to generate
two<00:01:22.090> different<00:01:22.509> styles<00:01:35.009> what<00:01:36.009> is<00:01:36.100> really

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
two different styles what is really

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:38.099 
two different styles what is really
great<00:01:36.490> about<00:01:36.579> the<00:01:36.909> cs<00:01:37.240> is<00:01:37.479> performance

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
great about the cs is performance

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:40.889

capabilities<00:01:39.060> you're<00:01:40.060> given<00:01:40.359> great<00:01:40.600> tools

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
capabilities you're given great tools

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:42.809 
capabilities you're given great tools
like<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.170> arpeggiator<00:01:41.799> and<00:01:42.069> the<00:01:42.520> ribbon

00:01:42.809 --> 00:01:42.819 
like the arpeggiator and the ribbon

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:51.690 
like the arpeggiator and the ribbon
control<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:49.060> as<00:01:49.270> you<00:01:49.659> can<00:01:49.780> see<00:01:49.989> the<00:01:50.649> CSA<00:01:51.159> TV<00:01:51.459> is

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700
