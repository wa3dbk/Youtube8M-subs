00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
works for Blackbeard and I think person

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.479

person<00:04:01.169> speaks<00:04:01.379> at<00:04:01.590> a<00:04:01.620> discussion<00:04:01.919> video<00:04:02.220> I'm

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
person speaks at a discussion video I'm

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.089 
person speaks at a discussion video I'm
don't<00:04:03.359> just<00:04:04.049> I<00:04:04.409> think<00:04:04.739> he<00:04:04.799> should<00:04:04.949> represent

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
don't just I think he should represent

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.899 
don't just I think he should represent
but<00:04:06.090> you<00:04:06.449> know<00:04:06.540> whatever<00:04:06.959> so<00:04:07.560> he<00:04:08.489> he<00:04:08.729> said<00:04:08.879> a

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
but you know whatever so he he said a

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:10.520 
but you know whatever so he he said a
video<00:04:09.150> about<00:04:09.329> Blackbeard<00:04:09.780> eating<00:04:10.259> the<00:04:10.319> fruit

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:12.449 
and this might also this might be a

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:14.569 
and this might also this might be a
possibility<00:04:12.810> if<00:04:13.139> Jesus<00:04:13.829> wins<00:04:14.099> the<00:04:14.370> tournament
