00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.910
 we will see, however, I have always had 

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:05.520
 hard life piling up on board 

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:10.220
 in the morning to his experience 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.220
 apollonia at 0.8 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.110
 chip number 9 and fall 200 vehicles of 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.740
 ranges 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.740
 at the end of the month 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:36.320
 the api on the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.320
 which in his eyes did not publish any 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.560
 list of markers for the wrong of them 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:50.720
 stop because it brought me everything 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:52.400
 the server version the martyr city for 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.650
 what for who will vote for 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.280
 the intelligence continues 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.280
 and means 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.129
 place for the 5th yable morning my a 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.420
 little bit afraid of what happened to 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.710
 our opinion for 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.730
 the cases until what happened to 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.590
 yell 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.430
 very spectacular we hope only 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.490
 a spectacular tried 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.330
 tell everything if the 3rd and 4th riders are 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.330
 fallen these statements 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.240
 the joker on the north Be Blood rayne in 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.170
 remaining in our jt of kristen myth 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.210
 opposes fallen on Thursday night at sunrise and I 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.000
 also think the game who say so 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.509
 That's what I saw in Boudry Giscard 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.490
 or not deceived 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.200
 so know that light jockey 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.950
 stores are parked there and kristen 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.170
 audrey the rock 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.450
 so these are not always not raised his 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.399
 show does not necessarily agree that this is 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.170
 dramatic but it was hyper 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.759
 spectacular we had rubio darche who 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.390
 stumbled that it's completely 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.270
 slumped at the entrance of the last turn 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.259
 I fell off the shoulder and ejected 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.259
 his rider 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.510
 no 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.390
 so if you miss out on the public 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.750
 fell 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.750
