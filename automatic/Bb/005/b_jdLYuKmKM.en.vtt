00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.220
 no 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:40.309
 150 g of flour 00 70 grams of sugar 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:54.030
 125 g of white yogurt a new 60 g of 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:01:01.589
 butter at room color temperature 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:05.670
 red 2 tablespoons of bitter cocoa a 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:08.869
 teaspoon of white vinegar and a 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.789
 teaspoon of vanilla yeast 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:20.180
 first we have an egg in one 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:20.180
 terrine add the sugar 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.960
 and there we mix with the help of one 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.960
 whipper 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:35.729
 for the sugar to melt and 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:37.500
 in this way we will get a white cream 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.549
 we will add a butter cut into 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:45.630
 pieces and we work everything with 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:51.630
 whips when the butter will be 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:56.960
 mixed we add vinegar 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.960
 white and yogurt 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:05.869
 we mix everything with the mixer in 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.869
 this way we will get a smooth compound 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:12.950
 apart in another bowl we sift 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.950
 together cocoa 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:24.870
 the yeast and flour stir 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.870
 quickly 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.079
 and we incorporate our dough in two 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:35.299
 times 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:35.299
 stirring each time with the mixer 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:42.810
 the final dough will be soft but 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:45.030
 quite dense at this point 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.350
 add red dye 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.210
 I used a gel dye 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:55.550
 until you get the intensity that 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:58.010
 we prefer to mix then again 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:04.190
 we fill a lot then has our own 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:11.480
 dough and fill half the cups by 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:13.970
 martin when they are ready 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.280
 we just have to bake them at 180 degrees 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.350
 for about 20 minutes 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.440
 check that the interior is dry 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:24.730
 with the toothpick test we leave them 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.730
 cool on the grill 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:38.040
 300 g of spreadable cheese 60 g of 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:43.880
 icing sugar 150 g of cream from 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:48.660
 mount decorations in a bowl 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:54.180
 we count the cream as being soft 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:58.070
 and creamy apart from work quickly with 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.070
 the whips the spreadable cheese 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:08.910
 add the icing sugar and mascolo 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:13.320
 well add the cream cheese 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:15.350
 with whipped cream and mix with one 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:19.950
 whip 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:23.070
 then we fill the fucka were that 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.960
 let's make the surface of the cupcakes if 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.290
 you want you can do with it and also 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.320
 the inside by making a hole or 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.000
 simply by dividing the metals 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:37.110
 we decorate cupcakes with 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:41.540
 sugary or with the soft part that 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.540
 you will also get by swimming the cupcakes
