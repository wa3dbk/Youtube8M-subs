00:00:00.123 --> 00:00:04.414
What Destroys your smash (2) Too much turning

00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:08.918
Next one watch my arm

00:00:11.683 --> 00:00:14.011
I see a lot of players they do that

00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:16.420
shuttle is coming from there to here

00:00:16.926 --> 00:00:18.634
their arm is there

00:00:20.592 --> 00:00:25.335
face, head, their racket, arm is behind their head

00:00:26.012 --> 00:00:27.035
and this is opened

00:00:27.843 --> 00:00:30.274
when they hit it they hit it like this

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:32.555
not only this one

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.233
they turn their face that way too

00:00:35.808 --> 00:00:37.503
when shuttle is coming from there

00:00:37.503 --> 00:00:38.337
so what happens

00:00:38.337 --> 00:00:40.838
they look that way and then they hit like this

00:00:40.838 --> 00:00:41.572
watch this

00:00:41.572 --> 00:00:43.234
there like this

00:00:43.886 --> 00:00:46.752
so its completely turning like this

00:00:47.643 --> 00:00:48.313
like that

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:50.273
like that

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.034
like that

00:00:53.043 --> 00:00:53.669
like this

00:00:56.097 --> 00:00:56.669
like that

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.273
like this

00:01:05.013 --> 00:01:06.253
there are number of things

00:01:07.015 --> 00:01:09.765
this elbow should not be opened like that

00:01:09.765 --> 00:01:10.919
it should be tighter

00:01:12.348 --> 00:01:14.284
hands should not be behind

00:01:14.284 --> 00:01:16.839
hands should be side of their face

00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:20.015
face should not turn over there

00:01:20.015 --> 00:01:21.515
if shuttle is coming from there

00:01:21.515 --> 00:01:23.159
face should remain there

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.336
it should be like that

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.252
not like this

00:01:31.762 --> 00:01:32.714
because of this

00:01:33.681 --> 00:01:36.113
if they have ability of 10

00:01:36.626 --> 00:01:40.169
they are only able to use 3 or 4

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.419
6 or 7 of their ability is prevented, limited

00:01:47.876 --> 00:01:50.647
because of they are set wrong way, this way

00:01:50.647 --> 00:01:52.475
and then they try to hit like this

00:01:53.516 --> 00:01:54.170
watch this

00:01:55.683 --> 00:01:57.274
so shuttle is coming from there

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.113
but this player is set this way

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.195
watch

00:02:03.933 --> 00:02:05.253
there and hit

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.919
there and hit

00:02:11.247 --> 00:02:14.168
as you see this and turns

00:02:17.433 --> 00:02:18.716
now change it

00:02:19.286 --> 00:02:21.418
see there, higher

00:02:22.682 --> 00:02:23.275
its there

00:02:24.516 --> 00:02:24.835
there

00:02:25.766 --> 00:02:26.793
so you are there

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.003
there

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.272
so you just use your arm hit bang

00:02:34.212 --> 00:02:35.004
elbow back

00:02:35.703 --> 00:02:36.503
should be there

00:02:37.204 --> 00:02:39.234
so my racket goes that way

00:02:40.853 --> 00:02:42.477
watch this if this is there

00:02:44.095 --> 00:02:44.952
then like this

00:02:49.934 --> 00:02:50.335
compare

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:51.418
there

00:02:56.892 --> 00:02:58.968
