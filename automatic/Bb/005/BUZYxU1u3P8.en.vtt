00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
cash amounts of course your list might

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.900 
cash amounts of course your list might
look<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.949> bit<00:00:52.980> different<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.550> doesn't<00:00:53.579> have<00:00:53.820> to

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
look a bit different it doesn't have to

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.549 
look a bit different it doesn't have to
look<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.149> same<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.870> can<00:00:54.989> even<00:00:55.110> do<00:00:55.350> on<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
look the same you can even do on the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.410 
look the same you can even do on the
computer<00:00:55.680> we<00:00:55.980> want<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.309> but<00:00:56.850> always<00:00:57.000> find<00:00:57.329> a

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
computer we want to but always find a

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.939 
computer we want to but always find a
lot<00:00:57.570> easier<00:00:57.809> just<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.170> kind<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.410> turn<00:00:58.590> my<00:00:58.800> head

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
lot easier just to kind of turn my head

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.950 
lot easier just to kind of turn my head
to<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.129> side<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.640> got<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:00.030> list<00:01:00.390> next<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.809> me

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
to the side and got this list next to me

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.470 
to the side and got this list next to me
that<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.890> flip<00:01:02.370> these<00:01:02.489> same<00:01:02.670> items<00:01:03.000> every<00:01:03.270> four

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
that I flip these same items every four

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.270 
that I flip these same items every four
hours<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:04.320> every<00:01:04.500> four<00:01:04.680> hours<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:05.040> can<00:01:05.129> kind

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
hours so every four hours you can kind

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.800 
hours so every four hours you can kind
of<00:01:05.339> recycle<00:01:05.850> these<00:01:05.970> items<00:01:06.180> go<00:01:06.540> through<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
of recycle these items go through the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.710 
of recycle these items go through the
same<00:01:06.990> items<00:01:07.439> again<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:08.090> if<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.270> don't<00:01:09.450> like<00:01:09.570> an

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
same items again and if I don't like an

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.450 
same items again and if I don't like an
item<00:01:10.080> for<00:01:10.170> example<00:01:10.590> if<00:01:10.680> i<00:01:10.770> don't<00:01:10.950> like<00:01:11.159> a

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
item for example if i don't like a

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.370 
item for example if i don't like a
sourdough<00:01:11.970> moma<00:01:12.330> because<00:01:12.840> there's<00:01:13.020> no<00:01:13.110> longer

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
sourdough moma because there's no longer

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.800 
sourdough moma because there's no longer
profitable<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:14.070> just<00:01:14.460> cross<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.700> out<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:14.970> if<00:01:15.750> I

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
profitable I just cross it out and if I

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.480 
profitable I just cross it out and if I
find<00:01:16.020> another<00:01:16.229> item<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.619> future<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.159> add<00:01:17.340> it

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
find another item in the future I add it

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.280 
find another item in the future I add it
on<00:01:17.640> that's<00:01:18.240> my<00:01:18.420> list<00:01:18.659> pretty<00:01:18.810> much<00:01:18.990> every

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
on that's my list pretty much every

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.050 
on that's my list pretty much every
single<00:01:19.560> day<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:19.860> items<00:01:20.220> coming<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.729> going

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
single day this items coming and going

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.910 
single day this items coming and going
and<00:01:21.299> it's<00:01:21.960> very<00:01:22.140> hard<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.439> kind<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.650> keep<00:01:22.770> up

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
and it's very hard to kind of keep up

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.440 
and it's very hard to kind of keep up
sometimes<00:01:23.310> but<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.580> do<00:01:23.700> get<00:01:23.850> used<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.270> and

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
sometimes but you do get used to it and

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.300 
sometimes but you do get used to it and
it's<00:01:24.900> very<00:01:25.140> good<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.350> have<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.799> list<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.189> you

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
it's very good to have a list that you

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.280 
it's very good to have a list that you
do<00:01:26.430> every<00:01:26.580> four<00:01:26.939> hours<00:01:26.970> rather<00:01:27.810> than<00:01:27.930> every

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
do every four hours rather than every

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.530 
do every four hours rather than every
four<00:01:28.530> hours<00:01:28.560> looking<00:01:29.400> for<00:01:29.579> random<00:01:29.939> items<00:01:30.360> it

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
four hours looking for random items it

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.380 
four hours looking for random items it
can<00:01:30.630> be<00:01:30.750> very<00:01:30.780> complicated<00:01:31.259> if<00:01:31.650> not<00:01:31.880> so<00:01:32.880> right

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
can be very complicated if not so right

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.359 
can be very complicated if not so right
on<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.689> far<00:01:33.900> left<00:01:34.110> side<00:01:34.200> lot<00:01:34.950> on<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.220> column

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
on the far left side lot on that column

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.890 
on the far left side lot on that column
there<00:01:35.670> we<00:01:35.759> have<00:01:35.909> semi<00:01:36.360> away<00:01:36.540> from<00:01:36.720> keyboard

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
there we have semi away from keyboard

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.870 
there we have semi away from keyboard
away<00:01:37.350> from<00:01:37.530> keyboard<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.130> what<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.700> pretty

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
away from keyboard and what I pretty

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.789 
away from keyboard and what I pretty
much<00:01:38.970> means<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.600> if<00:01:39.990> these<00:01:40.229> items<00:01:40.439> take

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
much means is that if these items take

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.649 
much means is that if these items take
about<00:01:40.979> five<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.280> ten<00:01:41.549> minutes<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.909> buy<00:01:42.090> they

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
about five to ten minutes to buy they

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.600 
about five to ten minutes to buy they
would<00:01:42.869> be<00:01:42.990> semi<00:01:43.290> away<00:01:43.470> from<00:01:43.649> keyboard<00:01:43.829> if<00:01:44.430> they

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
would be semi away from keyboard if they

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.100 
would be semi away from keyboard if they
take<00:01:44.759> longer<00:01:45.030> than<00:01:45.180> 10<00:01:45.390> minutes<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.869> will<00:01:45.930> just

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
take longer than 10 minutes it will just

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.260 
take longer than 10 minutes it will just
stay<00:01:46.259> away<00:01:46.409> from<00:01:46.439> keyboard<00:01:46.770> if<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.610> says<00:01:47.850> none

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
stay away from keyboard if it says none

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.670 
stay away from keyboard if it says none
away<00:01:48.479> from<00:01:48.630> keyboard<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:49.140> pretty<00:01:49.290> much<00:01:49.470> means

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
away from keyboard it pretty much means

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.139 
away from keyboard it pretty much means
to<00:01:49.799> take<00:01:49.950> just<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.280> few<00:01:50.310> minutes<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.850> buy<00:01:50.970> each

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
to take just a few minutes to buy each

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.609 
to take just a few minutes to buy each
one<00:01:51.390> or<00:01:51.540> sometimes<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:51.960> in<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.079> few<00:01:52.259> seconds

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
one or sometimes you in a few seconds

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.740 
one or sometimes you in a few seconds
and<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:53.670> might<00:01:53.820> be<00:01:53.909> very<00:01:54.090> handy<00:01:54.329> depending

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
and that might be very handy depending

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.120 
and that might be very handy depending
on<00:01:54.840> what<00:01:54.990> you're<00:01:55.140> doing<00:01:55.170> elsewhere<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:55.979> the

notice<00:02:51.269> that<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.660> steadfast<00:02:52.140> foods<00:02:52.410> are

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
notice that the steadfast foods are

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.350 
notice that the steadfast foods are
actually<00:02:53.100> over<00:02:53.220> 10<00:02:53.550> million<00:02:53.730> at<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.030> moment

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
actually over 10 million at the moment

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.000 
actually over 10 million at the moment
but<00:02:54.810> one<00:02:54.959> of<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.110> reasons<00:02:55.380> why<00:02:55.470> included<00:02:55.890> in

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
but one of the reasons why included in

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.830 
but one of the reasons why included in
that<00:02:56.130> list<00:02:56.190> was<00:02:56.700> because<00:02:57.060> as<00:02:57.269> you<00:02:57.480> flip<00:02:57.660> the

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
that list was because as you flip the

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.720 
that list was because as you flip the
Glavine<00:02:58.050> and<00:02:58.319> the<00:02:58.380> rage<00:02:58.590> fire<00:02:58.830> you<00:02:59.400> will<00:02:59.610> get

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
Glavine and the rage fire you will get

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:00.920 
Glavine and the rage fire you will get
used<00:02:59.850> to<00:03:00.060> flipping<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.480> steadfast

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
used to flipping the steadfast

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.960 
used to flipping the steadfast
eventually<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.650> it's<00:03:02.130> a<00:03:02.190> very<00:03:02.370> good<00:03:02.430> idea<00:03:02.610> to

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
eventually and it's a very good idea to

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.460 
eventually and it's a very good idea to
keep<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.300> steadfast<00:03:03.690> always<00:03:04.110> in<00:03:04.260> mind

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
keep the steadfast always in mind

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.220 
keep the steadfast always in mind
because<00:03:05.100> directly<00:03:05.760> reach<00:03:05.970> over<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.600> amount

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
because directly reach over the amount

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.050 
because directly reach over the amount
to<00:03:07.380> be<00:03:07.470> able<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.650> flip<00:03:07.830> the<00:03:08.040> steadfast<00:03:08.519> you

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
to be able to flip the steadfast you

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.190 
to be able to flip the steadfast you
would<00:03:09.209> have<00:03:09.300> already<00:03:09.450> flipped<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:10.019> Glavine

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
would have already flipped the Glavine

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.020 
would have already flipped the Glavine
and<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.470> veg<00:03:10.650> fire<00:03:10.890> which<00:03:11.069> means<00:03:11.280> flipping

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
and the veg fire which means flipping

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.970 
and the veg fire which means flipping
the<00:03:12.120> steadfast<00:03:12.540> would<00:03:12.720> be<00:03:12.810> no<00:03:12.930> big<00:03:13.170> deal<00:03:13.350> but

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
the steadfast would be no big deal but

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.410 
the steadfast would be no big deal but
of<00:03:14.069> course<00:03:14.100> you<00:03:14.370> will<00:03:14.580> make<00:03:14.700> bigger<00:03:14.940> profits

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
of course you will make bigger profits

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.660 
of course you will make bigger profits

profit per flip do you keep in mind that
have<00:04:02.519> not<00:04:02.640> added<00:04:02.910> any<00:04:03.000> 25<00:04:03.540> thousand<00:04:04.019> or<00:04:04.200> ten

thousand per 40 items purely because
they<00:04:07.500> slowly<00:04:08.100> become<00:04:08.459> less<00:04:08.640> profitable<00:04:09.000> than

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
they slowly become less profitable than

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.599 
they slowly become less profitable than
flipping<00:04:09.540> these<00:04:09.810> items<00:04:10.049> and<00:04:10.500> these<00:04:10.980> items<00:04:11.220> can

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
flipping these items and these items can

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.750 
flipping these items and these items can
make<00:04:12.359> you<00:04:12.480> run<00:04:12.630> the<00:04:12.720> same<00:04:12.930> profit<00:04:13.290> as<00:04:13.380> flipping

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
make you run the same profit as flipping

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.520 
make you run the same profit as flipping
25,000<00:04:14.760> of<00:04:14.850> another<00:04:15.120> item<00:04:15.329> but<00:04:16.109> these<00:04:16.260> are<00:04:16.410> so

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
25,000 of another item but these are so

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.800 
25,000 of another item but these are so
much<00:04:16.680> easier<00:04:16.890> so<00:04:17.669> at<00:04:17.760> this<00:04:17.880> point<00:04:18.180> you<00:04:18.450> want<00:04:18.690> to

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
much easier so at this point you want to

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.180 
much easier so at this point you want to
start<00:04:18.959> to<00:04:19.049> get<00:04:19.200> rid<00:04:19.320> of<00:04:19.380> those<00:04:19.530> items<00:04:19.769> that<00:04:20.100> you

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
start to get rid of those items that you

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.190 
start to get rid of those items that you
might<00:04:20.370> have<00:04:20.400> on<00:04:20.519> your<00:04:20.700> list<00:04:20.880> and<00:04:21.209> if<00:04:21.900> you<00:04:22.019> do

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
might have on your list and if you do

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.110 
might have on your list and if you do
think<00:04:22.470> though<00:04:22.680> you<00:04:22.740> still<00:04:23.099> have<00:04:23.310> very<00:04:24.000> good

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
think though you still have very good

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.690 
think though you still have very good
items<00:04:24.450> to<00:04:24.599> flip<00:04:24.690> that<00:04:25.050> are<00:04:25.200> 25,000<00:04:26.099> or<00:04:26.250> 10

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
items to flip that are 25,000 or 10

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.330 
items to flip that are 25,000 or 10
or<00:04:27.300> anything<00:04:28.260> like<00:04:28.290> that<00:04:28.470> you<00:04:29.070> can<00:04:29.190> always

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
or anything like that you can always

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.490 
or anything like that you can always
stick<00:04:29.670> with<00:04:29.700> them<00:04:30.060> but<00:04:30.720> there's<00:04:31.260> going<00:04:31.350> to<00:04:31.470> be

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
stick with them but there's going to be

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.660 
stick with them but there's going to be
a<00:04:31.560> point<00:04:31.830> where<00:04:31.980> you<00:04:32.130> can<00:04:32.220> have<00:04:32.340> to<00:04:32.430> let<00:04:32.580> them

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
a point where you can have to let them

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.160 
a point where you can have to let them
go<00:04:32.730> because<00:04:33.120> there's<00:04:33.660> going<00:04:33.840> to<00:04:33.930> be<00:04:33.960> better

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
go because there's going to be better

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.050 
go because there's going to be better
profits<00:04:34.590> elsewhere<00:04:35.040> and<00:04:35.280> that<00:04:35.760> are<00:04:35.880> less

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
profits elsewhere and that are less

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.720 
profits elsewhere and that are less
stressful<00:04:36.390> because<00:04:36.720> there's<00:04:37.460> less<00:04:38.460> of<00:04:38.610> an

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
stressful because there's less of an

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.330 
stressful because there's less of an
item<00:04:39.000> to<00:04:39.030> flip<00:04:39.360> for<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:39.750> same<00:04:39.930> profit<00:04:40.350> next<00:04:41.250> up

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
item to flip for the same profit next up

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.860 
item to flip for the same profit next up
on<00:04:41.490> our<00:04:41.520> list<00:04:41.730> we<00:04:41.910> have<00:04:42.030> the<00:04:42.150> severe<00:04:42.510> neck<00:04:42.660> the

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
on our list we have the severe neck the

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.780 
on our list we have the severe neck the
malevolent<00:04:43.080> to<00:04:43.500> the<00:04:43.620> tectonic<00:04:43.950> all<00:04:44.580> those

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
malevolent to the tectonic all those

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.430 
malevolent to the tectonic all those
items<00:04:45.000> are<00:04:45.240> very<00:04:45.390> good<00:04:45.510> to<00:04:45.630> flip<00:04:45.840> and<00:04:46.080> as<00:04:46.230> you

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
items are very good to flip and as you

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.780 
items are very good to flip and as you
can<00:04:46.560> see<00:04:46.590> they<00:04:46.950> can<00:04:47.100> actually<00:04:47.220> make<00:04:47.460> a<00:04:47.490> decent

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
can see they can actually make a decent

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.580 
can see they can actually make a decent
amount<00:04:48.150> of<00:04:48.180> profit<00:04:48.360> every<00:04:49.170> single<00:04:49.440> one<00:04:49.560> of

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
amount of profit every single one of

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.070 
amount of profit every single one of
them<00:04:49.830> are<00:04:50.010> two<00:04:50.490> every<00:04:50.730> four<00:04:50.760> hours<00:04:50.940> but<00:04:51.780> also

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
them are two every four hours but also

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.140 
them are two every four hours but also
some<00:04:53.010> of<00:04:53.040> them<00:04:53.250> are<00:04:53.370> away<00:04:53.460> from<00:04:53.520> keyboard<00:04:53.820> and

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
some of them are away from keyboard and

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.000 
some of them are away from keyboard and
some<00:04:54.390> of<00:04:54.510> them<00:04:54.630> aren't<00:04:54.870> I<00:04:55.230> have<00:04:55.620> noticed<00:04:55.980> that

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
some of them aren't I have noticed that

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.230 
some of them aren't I have noticed that
the<00:04:56.130> malevolent<00:04:56.340> can<00:04:56.670> actually<00:04:56.910> be<00:04:57.000> pretty

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
the malevolent can actually be pretty

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.300 
the malevolent can actually be pretty
fast<00:04:57.510> flips<00:04:57.810> always<00:04:58.260> so<00:04:58.830> if<00:04:58.920> I<00:04:59.010> did<00:04:59.160> that<00:04:59.190> I

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
fast flips always so if I did that I

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.190 
fast flips always so if I did that I
send<00:04:59.670> me<00:04:59.760> away<00:04:59.820> from<00:04:59.940> keyboard<00:05:00.210> but<00:05:00.900> as<00:05:01.050> you

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
send me away from keyboard but as you

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.050 
send me away from keyboard but as you
can<00:05:01.320> also<00:05:01.470> see<00:05:01.770> on<00:05:01.920> the<00:05:02.040> right<00:05:02.190> side<00:05:02.460> someone

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
can also see on the right side someone

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.460 
can also see on the right side someone
that<00:05:03.150> can<00:05:03.270> make<00:05:03.360> you<00:05:03.570> a<00:05:03.600> decent<00:05:04.080> amount<00:05:04.320> of

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
that can make you a decent amount of

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.470 
that can make you a decent amount of
profit<00:05:04.680> up<00:05:05.010> to<00:05:05.340> about<00:05:05.550> half<00:05:05.880> a<00:05:06.030> million<00:05:06.330> per

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
profit up to about half a million per

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.300 
profit up to about half a million per
flip<00:05:06.750> so<00:05:07.470> those<00:05:07.650> are<00:05:07.680> good<00:05:07.890> items<00:05:08.160> to<00:05:08.220> flip

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
flip so those are good items to flip

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.370 
flip so those are good items to flip
