00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.520
 except for the index lauder viv km 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.120
 percentage more than a year ago we visited 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.419
 this greenhouse 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:13.619
 During this time, new ones have accumulated 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:15.210
 knowledge new approaches 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.210
 and now we'll talk about it 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:22.319
 landed policy then worked a number of start 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:23.800
 for good dismissal 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.699
 and good plant potential 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:27.659
 km 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:28.970
 with active 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.140
 on objective growth 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.110
 we applied rayard development 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.670
 to visit the good potential 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.850
 plants to grow 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.160
 good kill mass so she in tbilisi 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.640
 could work but i'll be yanukovich 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.500
 simple condemned with coconut substrate 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.120
 how we got from creating both of us 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.420
 hold the boats 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.710
 and he was planted with baleen constraints 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.890
 Myit neutral environment but for 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.870
 prevention and applied 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.149
 So that the moment that you need to do washing 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.629
 substrate because no matter how to see 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:02.870
 they said that there 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.020
 neutral salts are present 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.480
 oao and as a senior 9 from the development we gave by 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.560
 stories 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.700
 but they did not have their reader after sleeping 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.940
 process 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.520
 made an analysis 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.650
 sensation 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.670
 for today still 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.159
 and according to the results 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:22.469
 diagnostic we 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:24.190
 did the calculations 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.310
 balanced nutrition 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.030
 while using these drugs 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.860
 native team 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.050
 ecocide 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.150
 ring nitrate mass media Tyumen 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.290
 Tel Aviv Zinc 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.870
 kelly gbo bodies like iron 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.210
 telecom organizations 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.140
 Phase budding used body mountain 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.040
 the body was directly 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.760
 affects how soporific creations 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.590
 ovary 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.510
 it is very important that the country will 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:50.430
 nization 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.820
 I did not experience value 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.850
 lack of god 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.720
 in the herd she 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.170
 for the visit of tactile perception 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.890
 applied and carry interest komi reel 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.450
 flew to Yatsenyuk 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.810
 however that antistress in baku 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:06.770
 helps 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.019
 get out of this for this phase 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.599
 to replace and continued actively rub 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.180
 in the un during ripening berries scenes 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.669
 used such a choice taytelya potassium 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:19.289
 knowing how the final min times 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:22.489
 101 Aliyeva I believe we do not apply kelly to her 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.779
 which affects the accumulation of sugar 

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:27.929
 at the checkout berry 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:29.789
 when the raycard final was used on 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:31.129
 advanced stages 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.120
 Aeee there are some such berries day red with 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.649
 which are green 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:38.929
 I already said so and also new ones 

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:41.569
 but it turns out he 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.189
 gave the signal for the plant to finish 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:45.509
 your process 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:47.189
 how about min 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:49.299
 tried to apply here 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.969
 and he seemed attacks red berry she 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:54.260
 poured green remained in the same 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.059
 stages 

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:58.319
 and continued to grow more actively 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.509
 the percentage ie the replacement of the last 

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:03.899
 Stages it seemed much more interesting 

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:06.179
 with record finals 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:08.649
 and now in the last stages we work in 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:10.249
 basic understanding 

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:12.329
 we had such a problem 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.219
 when in banks 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:16.879
 there was a room 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.289
 more readily soles 

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:20.519
 n began to see plants 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.649
 and feed the lower leaves 

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:24.579
 we solved this problem next 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.169
 drug atlanta plus 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:28.479
 it contains and kissing acid which 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:30.529
 counts vessels well 

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:32.699
 increases then the choice was also held 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:35.509
 washing the mats with water 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:37.129
 after all 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:38.349
 plants 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:39.370
 normalized 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.389
 and feels great 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.519
 in November, plants began to give us 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:44.889
 first harvest 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:48.269
 it lasted all winter all spring 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.869
 from this 

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:52.509
 in the first months of summer 

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:55.659
 all this time there was an active offering 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:57.659
 manifested were juicy 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:59.219
 red 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:02.519
 good taste methods 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:03.889
 I do not use 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:04.409
 good demand
