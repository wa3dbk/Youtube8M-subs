00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.000
Hi everyone ! How are you today ?

00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:09.001
Well, I'm gonna speak about the food supplements that I take.

00:00:09.502 --> 00:00:14.002
Indeed, lot of people ask me what I consume, so I'll explain you everything in this video.

00:00:14.003 --> 00:00:19.003
But before this, I would like to tell you 2 things.

00:00:19.304 --> 00:00:27.004
First, I would thank all the person who are supporting me, your messages make me happy;

00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:32.005
And I wish that y videos are helpful for you ! 

00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:40.006
Then, I'll introduce you some food supplements and tell you my opinion on them.

00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:50.007
Well, I DO NOT force you to take them, you can make your own choices. 

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:55.008
This way, there are no problems, and you'll choose if you want to try it, or not.

00:00:55.009 --> 00:01:04.009
What food supplements do I take ? I use Animal Pak Multivitamin for 3 months.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.010
I also take Omega 3 capsule, and Pure Whey. It's a 5 kilos pack.

00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:15.011
I took a Raspberry flavor, And this is fuckin' disgusting. 

00:01:15.012 --> 00:01:36.012
If you don't know what flavor to take, choose chocolate, it's basic and simple, and well good.

00:01:36.013 --> 00:01:45.513
Any way, I'll precisely speak about the Animal Pak Multivitamin.

00:01:45.514 --> 00:01:49.514
Well, what is it ?

00:01:49.515 --> 00:02:01.515
It's a simple pot like this one which contains 44 small bags, and in each bag you'll find 11 capsules.

00:02:01.516 --> 00:02:21.516
In this food supplement, there are lots of vitamins. There are even to much vitamins, some are superfluous.

00:02:21.517 --> 00:02:45.517
It contains Amino Acid Complex (leucyne, Isoleucyne, and lots of technical words that I do not know :p )  ,

00:02:45.518 --> 00:03:01.518
Performance complex, antioxydant complex, digesive enzyme complex, vitamin A, C, D, E, F... Calcium, Zinc...

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:15.519
As you can see, there are lots of things in this, you can check it yourself on internet, while taping Animal Pak Multivitamin.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:31.520
If you take this, you can be sure that you won't have any deficiency. I take 1 small bag each morning, during the breakfast

00:03:31.521 --> 00:03:50.521
What's more, it's not expansive at all. Only 40Ã‡ for 44 small bags. And you do not have to take other products, because everything is in there.

00:03:50.522 --> 00:04:20.522
There is an inconveniant, capsules are quite big, so it can be difficult for you to swallow it. But when you take it every morning, it's easy.

00:04:20.523 --> 00:04:40.523
What's more, when you take a piss, you'll realize that it's fluorescent green. 

00:04:40.524 --> 00:04:51.524
Don't be scared, it's just the result of the excedent vitamins that your body doesn't need especially ! 

00:04:51.525 --> 00:05:10.525
I checked it on Internet, so it's okay, but as every kind of product, if you take it to much, it can be dangerous, just respect the quantity.

00:05:10.526 --> 00:05:37.526
Well, with the Animal Pak Multivitamin, a good diet, and a hard training (2h/day 6days/week), I got good results.

00:05:37.527 --> 00:05:55.527
That is why I recommand it if you want to take food supplements, but once more you have the choice, I do not force you.

00:05:55.528 --> 00:05:56.528
I'll try the famous Jack 3d soon, the favorite Zyzz product, and I'll make a video about it !

00:05:56.529 --> 00:06:10.529
So, I wish that this video will help you, and see you soon. :)
