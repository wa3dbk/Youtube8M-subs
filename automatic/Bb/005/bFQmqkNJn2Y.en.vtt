00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
okay let's start from the top I want you

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.860 
okay let's start from the top I want you
to<00:00:04.470> have<00:00:04.560> a<00:00:04.589> good<00:00:04.859> idea<00:00:05.250> about<00:00:05.790> what's<00:00:06.540> going

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
to have a good idea about what's going

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.530 
to have a good idea about what's going
on<00:00:07.020> in<00:00:07.259> general<00:00:07.710> with<00:00:08.040> computers<00:00:08.610> what's

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
on in general with computers what's

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.180 
on in general with computers what's
going<00:00:09.840> on<00:00:09.960> in<00:00:10.110> general<00:00:10.290> with<00:00:10.530> computers<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.130> I

going on in general with computers and I

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.740 
going on in general with computers and I
want<00:00:11.340> you<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.490> think<00:00:11.670> of<00:00:11.790> four<00:00:12.059> things<00:00:12.389> in

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750

software networks and data let me talk
briefly<00:00:32.550> about<00:00:32.940> each<00:00:33.059> one<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.450> those<00:00:33.540> now

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
briefly about each one of those now

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.180 
briefly about each one of those now
we'll<00:00:33.989> go<00:00:34.110> into<00:00:34.260> much<00:00:34.500> more<00:00:34.530> detail<00:00:34.739> about

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
we'll go into much more detail about

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.090 
we'll go into much more detail about
them<00:00:35.460> as<00:00:35.550> we<00:00:35.700> go<00:00:35.730> through<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.120> course<00:00:37.100> let's

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
them as we go through the course let's

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.860 
them as we go through the course let's
start<00:00:38.309> with<00:00:38.399> hardware<00:00:38.820> hardware<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.629> probably

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
start with hardware hardware is probably

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.330 
start with hardware hardware is probably
the<00:00:39.989> most<00:00:40.110> familiar<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.920> because<00:00:41.219> that's

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
the most familiar to you because that's

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.819 
the most familiar to you because that's
what<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.640> go<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:41.940> buy<00:00:42.059> when<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.480> buy<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.829> smart

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
what you go and buy when you buy a smart

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.529 
what you go and buy when you buy a smart
phone<00:00:44.100> or<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.399> buy<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.579> computer<00:00:45.149> or<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.360> buy

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
phone or you buy a computer or you buy

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.420 
phone or you buy a computer or you buy
any<00:00:45.750> kind<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.050> digital<00:00:46.230> piece<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.980> equipment

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
any kind of digital piece of equipment

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.690 
any kind of digital piece of equipment
it's<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.440> physical<00:00:49.440> stuff<00:00:49.739> it's<00:00:50.520> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
it's the physical stuff it's the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.250 
it's the physical stuff it's the
physical<00:00:51.000> stuff<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.449> makes<00:00:51.690> computing

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
physical stuff that makes computing

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.380 
physical stuff that makes computing
possible<00:00:52.829> now<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.610> without<00:00:53.850> going<00:00:54.030> into<00:00:54.300> a

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
possible now that without going into a

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.939 
possible now that without going into a
lot<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.660> detail<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.260> can<00:00:55.440> imagine<00:00:55.620> that

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
lot of detail you can imagine that

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:56.990 
lot of detail you can imagine that
there's<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.280> lot<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.579> things<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.910> are

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
there's a lot of things that are

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.310 
there's a lot of things that are
necessary<00:00:57.480> some<00:00:57.660> place<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.050> store

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
necessary some place to store

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.560 
necessary some place to store
information<00:00:58.949> some<00:00:59.550> place<00:00:59.789> to<00:01:00.059> do<00:01:00.420> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
the commands lots of power consumption

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.010 
the commands lots of power consumption
needs<00:01:05.309> maybe<00:01:05.909> something<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.450> run<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.780> video

let me start out with this word data
because<00:02:32.010> that's<00:02:32.189> what<00:02:32.430> they<00:02:32.639> say<00:02:32.939> in<00:02:33.090> computer

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
because that's what they say in computer

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.619 
because that's what they say in computer
land<00:02:33.689> data<00:02:34.500> is<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:35.010> bits<00:02:35.250> as<00:02:35.549> they<00:02:36.120> say<00:02:36.329> data

actually<00:03:16.230> want<00:03:16.439> the<00:03:16.500> computers<00:03:17.010> for<00:03:17.340> so<00:03:17.970> that

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
actually want the computers for so that

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.879 
actually want the computers for so that
we<00:03:18.269> have<00:03:18.419> a<00:03:18.449> place<00:03:18.690> to<00:03:18.750> put<00:03:19.169> our<00:03:19.199> information

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
we have a place to put our information

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.710 
we have a place to put our information
our<00:03:20.069> data<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.609> so<00:03:20.940> we<00:03:21.060> have<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.239> way<00:03:21.419> of<00:03:21.540> getting

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
our data and so we have a way of getting

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.750 
our data and so we have a way of getting
it<00:03:21.959> back<00:03:22.109> out<00:03:22.349> towards<00:03:22.739> some<00:03:22.979> goal<00:03:23.159> a<00:03:23.190> goal<00:03:23.400> of

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
it back out towards some goal a goal of

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.610 
it back out towards some goal a goal of
entertainment<00:03:24.389> or<00:03:24.479> a<00:03:24.540> goal<00:03:24.750> of<00:03:24.900> Education<00:03:25.440> or

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
entertainment or a goal of Education or

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.680 
entertainment or a goal of Education or
a<00:03:25.650> goal<00:03:25.889> of<00:03:26.099> calculating<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.090> prices<00:03:27.419> of<00:03:27.479> gold

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
a goal of calculating the prices of gold

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.689 
a goal of calculating the prices of gold
in<00:03:27.900> Zimbabwe<00:03:28.439> or<00:03:28.470> whatever<00:03:28.859> it<00:03:28.979> is<00:03:29.010> we<00:03:29.280> have<00:03:29.489> as

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:29.699 
in Zimbabwe or whatever it is we have as

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:32.960 
in Zimbabwe or whatever it is we have as
our<00:03:30.239> goals<00:03:30.540> so<00:03:31.069> computers<00:03:32.069> consists<00:03:32.849> of

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
our goals so computers consists of

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.390 
our goals so computers consists of
hardware<00:03:33.629> software<00:03:34.049> networks<00:03:34.979> and<00:03:35.189> data

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
hardware software networks and data

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.699 
hardware software networks and data
hardware<00:03:36.060> is<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.150> physical<00:03:36.599> stuff<00:03:36.810> software

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
hardware is the physical stuff software

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:38.929 
hardware is the physical stuff software
