of<00:00:44.129> wildstar<00:00:44.670> like<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.940> wildstar<00:00:45.420> was<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.870> MOBA

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
of wildstar like it wildstar was a MOBA

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.319 
of wildstar like it wildstar was a MOBA
it<00:00:46.649> would<00:00:46.770> be<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.100> game<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.120> kind<00:00:48.300> of

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
it would be this game so it kind of

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.760 
it would be this game so it kind of
controls<00:00:48.660> like<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.809> twin-stick<00:00:49.230> shooter<00:00:49.680> and

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
we've actually seen this in a couple of

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.360 
we've actually seen this in a couple of
new<00:00:51.030> MOBA<00:00:51.329> coming<00:00:51.600> out<00:00:51.750> like<00:00:52.020> dark<00:00:52.590> Nexus<00:00:53.100> or

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
new MOBA coming out like dark Nexus or

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.069 
new MOBA coming out like dark Nexus or
shards<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.850> war<00:00:54.180> there<00:00:54.480> couple<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.930> have

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
shards of war there couple that have

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.139 
shards of war there couple that have
like<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.559> skill-shot<00:00:55.920> based<00:00:56.430> mechanics<00:00:57.030> where

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
like a skill-shot based mechanics where

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.639 
like a skill-shot based mechanics where
you<00:00:57.270> are<00:00:57.390> actually<00:00:57.570> aiming<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.410> this<00:00:58.590> is

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
you are actually aiming and this is

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.470 
you are actually aiming and this is
gonna<00:00:58.739> work<00:00:58.980> very<00:00:59.250> similarly<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.820> those<00:01:00.149> games

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
gonna work very similarly to those games

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.869 
gonna work very similarly to those games
melee<00:01:01.050> units<00:01:01.230> can<00:01:01.559> cleave<00:01:01.859> range<00:01:02.460> units

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
melee units can cleave range units

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.880 
melee units can cleave range units
actually<00:01:03.210> have<00:01:03.359> projectile<00:01:04.019> shots<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.680> need

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
actually have projectile shots that need

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.950 
actually have projectile shots that need
to<00:01:05.010> be<00:01:05.040> aimed<00:01:05.369> in<00:01:05.610> time<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.330> all<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:06.659> all<00:01:06.780> it

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
to be aimed in time and all in all it

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.840 
to be aimed in time and all in all it
just<00:01:06.990> seems<00:01:07.350> like<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.530> skill-shot<00:01:07.890> glower<00:01:08.460> sort

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
just seems like a skill-shot glower sort

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.820 
just seems like a skill-shot glower sort
of<00:01:08.970> thing<00:01:09.150> like<00:01:09.180> it's<00:01:09.810> very<00:01:10.110> skilled<00:01:10.560> based

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
of thing like it's very skilled based

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.800 
of thing like it's very skilled based
and<00:01:11.040> very<00:01:11.189> mechanical<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:11.970> if<00:01:12.510> that's<00:01:12.720> not

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
and very mechanical and if that's not

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.469 
and very mechanical and if that's not
your<00:01:13.110> thing<00:01:13.170> then<00:01:13.770> oh<00:01:13.979> well<00:01:14.310> but<00:01:15.000> that's<00:01:15.240> how

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
your thing then oh well but that's how

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.780 
your thing then oh well but that's how
this<00:01:15.630> game<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:15.869> played<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.320> Les<00:01:16.710> strategy<00:01:17.369> more

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
just brawling action however that's not

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.580

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
to say that there isn't well strategy in

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.289 
to say that there isn't well strategy in
the<00:01:22.710> game<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.009> do<00:01:23.189> have<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> build<00:01:23.790> orders<00:01:24.150> but

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
the game you do have a build orders but

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.090 
the game you do have a build orders but
instead<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.630> like<00:01:24.750> how<00:01:25.049> it's<00:01:25.380> kind<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.740> like<00:01:25.920> in

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.700 
instead of like how it's kind of like in
other<00:01:26.250> MOBA<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:27.210> appeared<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.900> me<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.320> feels

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
other MOBA it appeared to me it feels

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.380 
other MOBA it appeared to me it feels
like<00:01:28.890> counter-strike<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.000> way<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.210> are

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
like counter-strike in a way you are

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.840 
mix-and-match strategy here and I like
that<00:01:58.140> it's<00:01:58.290> not<00:01:58.409> just<00:01:58.469> stats<00:01:59.009> yeah<00:01:59.549> some

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
what if we go ahead and look at the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.580 
what if we go ahead and look at the
different<00:02:06.689> maps<00:02:06.930> cuz<00:02:07.170> there<00:02:07.290> are<00:02:07.409> gonna<00:02:07.530> be

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
different maps cuz there are gonna be

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.020 
different maps cuz there are gonna be
different<00:02:07.770> game<00:02:08.160> modes<00:02:08.190> which<00:02:08.640> hold<00:02:08.879> their

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
different game modes which hold their

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.859 
different game modes which hold their
own<00:02:09.060> different<00:02:09.509> matter

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
own different matter

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.509 
own different matter
sigh<00:02:10.110> believe<00:02:10.349> so<00:02:10.799> I<00:02:10.830> think<00:02:11.099> it's<00:02:11.280> kind<00:02:11.430> of

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
sigh believe so I think it's kind of

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.160 
sigh believe so I think it's kind of
cool<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:11.760> they're<00:02:12.299> doing<00:02:12.629> that<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:12.959> don't

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
cool that they're doing that I don't

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.210 
cool that they're doing that I don't
know<00:02:13.230> if<00:02:13.290> it's<00:02:13.379> gonna<00:02:13.470> be<00:02:13.620> as<00:02:13.739> serious<00:02:13.950> as

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
know if it's gonna be as serious as

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.740 
know if it's gonna be as serious as
heroes<00:02:14.489> of<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.670> storm<00:02:14.730> where<00:02:15.180> every<00:02:15.450> single

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
heroes of the storm where every single

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.750 
heroes of the storm where every single
map<00:02:15.930> is<00:02:16.230> totally<00:02:17.129> different<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.580> then

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
map is totally different and then

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.949 
map is totally different and then
they're<00:02:17.849> gonna<00:02:17.909> like<00:02:18.180> try<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.450> make<00:02:18.629> lots<00:02:18.870> and

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
they're gonna like try to make lots and

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:19.910 
they're gonna like try to make lots and
lots<00:02:19.170> of<00:02:19.260> different<00:02:19.500> maps<00:02:19.680> like<00:02:19.860> a

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
lots of different maps like a

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.770 
lots of different maps like a
first-person<00:02:20.280> shooter<00:02:20.700> but<00:02:21.209> I<00:02:21.269> can't<00:02:21.569> say

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
first-person shooter but I can't say

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:22.820 
first-person shooter but I can't say
that<00:02:21.959> for<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.140> maps<00:02:22.319> that<00:02:22.379> they<00:02:22.500> have<00:02:22.680> in<00:02:22.769> the

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
that for the maps that they have in the

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.020 
that for the maps that they have in the
variety<00:02:23.099> that<00:02:23.129> they<00:02:23.310> have<00:02:23.489> it's<00:02:23.730> very

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
variety that they have it's very

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.330 
variety that they have it's very
intriguing<00:02:24.750> i<00:02:25.080> am<00:02:25.200> interested<00:02:25.980> in<00:02:26.069> seeing

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
intriguing i am interested in seeing

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.440 
intriguing i am interested in seeing
what<00:02:26.459> they<00:02:26.579> can<00:02:26.610> do<00:02:26.879> with<00:02:26.909> that<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.360> how

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
what they can do with that and how

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.240 
what they can do with that and how
they're<00:02:27.599> gonna<00:02:27.690> expand<00:02:28.170> upon<00:02:28.409> it<00:02:28.470> but<00:02:29.040> for<00:02:29.190> the

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
they're gonna expand upon it but for the

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.069 
they're gonna expand upon it but for the
maps<00:02:29.400> that<00:02:29.549> i<00:02:29.610> did<00:02:29.909> play<00:02:30.120> i<00:02:30.480> really<00:02:30.810> like<00:02:30.959> the

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
maps that i did play i really like the

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:32.899 
maps that i did play i really like the
design<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.530> really<00:02:31.890> reminded<00:02:32.310> me<00:02:32.340> of<00:02:32.489> i<00:02:32.879> guess

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
design it really reminded me of i guess

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.300 
design it really reminded me of i guess
like<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.360> twin-stick<00:02:33.750> shooter<00:02:34.200> or<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.530> first

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
like a twin-stick shooter or a first

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.740 
like a twin-stick shooter or a first
person<00:02:35.489> shooter<00:02:35.670> really<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.209> massive<00:02:36.569> felt

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
person shooter really the massive felt

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.360 
person shooter really the massive felt
very<00:02:36.900> brawley<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.560> deathmatch<00:02:37.980> II<00:02:38.010> and

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
very brawley and deathmatch II and

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.680 
very brawley and deathmatch II and
that's<00:02:38.700> kind<00:02:38.940> of<00:02:39.060> how<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.239> game<00:02:39.480> is<00:02:39.659> played

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
that's kind of how the game is played

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.600 
that's kind of how the game is played
anyways<00:02:40.260> this<00:02:40.409> is<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.590> brawling<00:02:41.159> mobo<00:02:41.459> with

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
have certain areas where you're gonna

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.839 
have certain areas where you're gonna
want<00:02:48.599> to<00:02:48.629> be<00:02:48.780> like<00:02:49.349> I<00:02:49.530> guess<00:02:49.739> choke<00:02:50.280> points<00:02:50.700> I

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
want to be like I guess choke points I

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:51.740 
want to be like I guess choke points I
guess<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.180> can<00:02:51.269> say<00:02:51.329> you<00:02:51.390> want<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.569> be<00:02:51.660> in

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
guess you can say you want to be in

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.539 
guess you can say you want to be in
control<00:02:51.780> of<00:02:52.109> those<00:02:52.349> choke<00:02:52.590> points<00:02:52.950> on<00:02:53.069> but

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
control of those choke points on but

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:54.979 
control of those choke points on but
overall<00:02:53.579> it<00:02:54.000> just<00:02:54.030> kind<00:02:54.299> of<00:02:54.329> feels<00:02:54.510> brawley

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
overall it just kind of feels brawley

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.330 
overall it just kind of feels brawley
and<00:02:55.349> if<00:02:55.440> you're<00:02:55.560> into<00:02:55.890> that<00:02:55.920> you're<00:02:56.190> gonna

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
and if you're into that you're gonna

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
have a lot of fun but on a note on these

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.020 
have a lot of fun but on a note on these
character<00:02:58.799> kits<00:02:58.950> because<00:02:59.129> it<00:02:59.310> still<00:02:59.519> is<00:02:59.730> a

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
character kits because it still is a

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.430 
character kits because it still is a
MOBA<00:03:00.540> we're<00:03:00.780> still<00:03:00.959> gonna<00:03:01.049> have<00:03:01.170> character

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
MOBA we're still gonna have character

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.710 
MOBA we're still gonna have character
kits<00:03:01.620> how<00:03:02.099> impactful<00:03:02.760> are<00:03:02.909> they<00:03:03.060> I<00:03:03.269> think

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
kits how impactful are they I think

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.089 
kits how impactful are they I think
drastically<00:03:04.470> impactful<00:03:04.829> you<00:03:04.920> know<00:03:05.010> they

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
drastically impactful you know they

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.020 
drastically impactful you know they
actually<00:03:05.370> have<00:03:05.459> some<00:03:05.579> really<00:03:05.730> cool

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
actually have some really cool

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.089 
actually have some really cool
interesting<00:03:06.780> designs<00:03:07.140> especially<00:03:07.379> with<00:03:07.950> the

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
interesting designs especially with the

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:09.710 
interesting designs especially with the
mechanics<00:03:08.519> of<00:03:08.579> the<00:03:08.700> game<00:03:08.730> I<00:03:09.090> think<00:03:09.569> it's<00:03:09.690> very

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
mechanics of the game I think it's very

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.180 
mechanics of the game I think it's very
interesting<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:10.349> see<00:03:10.470> this<00:03:10.590> John<00:03:10.859> are<00:03:10.980> kind<00:03:11.129> of

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
interesting to see this John are kind of

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.619 
interesting to see this John are kind of
blowing<00:03:11.400> up<00:03:11.609> and<00:03:11.790> seeing<00:03:11.970> all<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.209> cool<00:03:12.390> kits

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
blowing up and seeing all the cool kits

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:13.909 
blowing up and seeing all the cool kits
that<00:03:12.720> we<00:03:12.840> can<00:03:12.930> have<00:03:13.049> and<00:03:13.230> then<00:03:13.530> also<00:03:13.709> the

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:13.919 
that we can have and then also the

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:15.379 
that we can have and then also the
weapons<00:03:14.310> so<00:03:14.549> since<00:03:14.819> this<00:03:14.910> game<00:03:15.090> does<00:03:15.359> have

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
weapons so since this game does have

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:16.670 
weapons so since this game does have
mechanical<00:03:15.810> weapons<00:03:16.139> which<00:03:16.470> are<00:03:16.560> very

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
mechanical weapons which are very

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.559 
mechanical weapons which are very
interesting<00:03:17.099> to<00:03:17.190> me<00:03:17.310> it's<00:03:17.519> very<00:03:18.000> cool<00:03:18.209> that<00:03:18.269> we

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
interesting to me it's very cool that we

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.750 
interesting to me it's very cool that we
actually<00:03:18.750> still<00:03:19.139> have<00:03:19.410> good<00:03:19.980> kits<00:03:20.370> okay

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
actually still have good kits okay

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.099 
actually still have good kits okay
they're<00:03:20.940> not<00:03:21.060> just<00:03:21.299> snap<00:03:21.599> boosters<00:03:22.079> or

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
they're not just snap boosters or

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:23.360 
they're not just snap boosters or
anything<00:03:22.440> like<00:03:22.470> that<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:22.950> have<00:03:23.069> some<00:03:23.250> people

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
that can teleport you have some people

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.050 
that can teleport you have some people
that<00:03:24.989> can<00:03:25.500> do<00:03:25.590> all<00:03:25.650> sorts<00:03:25.769> of<00:03:25.980> crazy<00:03:26.280> moves<00:03:26.790> a

that can do all sorts of crazy moves a

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.909 
that can do all sorts of crazy moves a
very<00:03:27.269> mobile<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.900> that's<00:03:28.319> what<00:03:28.410> I<00:03:28.440> like<00:03:28.739> I

very mobile and that's what I like I

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:29.900 
very mobile and that's what I like I
mean<00:03:29.069> that's<00:03:29.160> one<00:03:29.340> reason<00:03:29.459> why<00:03:29.609> i<00:03:29.700> like

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
mean that's one reason why i like

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.309 
mean that's one reason why i like
playing<00:03:30.030> a<00:03:30.180> league<00:03:30.329> of<00:03:30.389> legends<00:03:30.840> versus<00:03:31.169> dota

playing a league of legends versus dota

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.379 
playing a league of legends versus dota
2<00:03:31.560> because<00:03:31.859> it's<00:03:32.010> very<00:03:32.069> mechanical<00:03:32.639> but<00:03:33.209> now

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
2 because it's very mechanical but now

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.000 
2 because it's very mechanical but now
that<00:03:33.629> with<00:03:33.810> this<00:03:33.900> Neutron<00:03:34.440> are<00:03:34.590> coming<00:03:34.859> out

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
that with this Neutron are coming out

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.220 
that with this Neutron are coming out
I'm<00:03:35.340> just<00:03:35.910> very<00:03:36.150> much<00:03:36.239> enjoying<00:03:36.750> this

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
I'm just very much enjoying this

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.069 
I'm just very much enjoying this
brawling<00:03:37.980> shooting<00:03:38.579> twin-stick<00:03:39.060> thing<00:03:39.660> going

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
brawling shooting twin-stick thing going

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.509 
brawling shooting twin-stick thing going
on<00:03:40.199> and<00:03:40.410> this<00:03:40.739> is<00:03:40.889> one<00:03:41.040> of<00:03:41.069> the<00:03:41.190> this<00:03:41.220> is<00:03:41.489> a

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
on and this is one of the this is a

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.250 
on and this is one of the this is a
shining<00:03:41.699> example<00:03:41.879> of<00:03:42.239> this<00:03:42.690> genre<00:03:42.750> that's

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
shining example of this genre that's

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.449 
shining example of this genre that's
emerging<00:03:43.590> I<00:03:43.680> really<00:03:43.949> think<00:03:44.040> this<00:03:44.190> is<00:03:44.220> good

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
emerging I really think this is good

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.400 
emerging I really think this is good
shards<00:03:44.849> of<00:03:44.910> war<00:03:45.060> already<00:03:45.299> it<00:03:45.750> has<00:03:45.780> a<00:03:45.989> slight

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
shards of war already it has a slight

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.559 
shards of war already it has a slight
competitive<00:03:47.160> play<00:03:47.340> I<00:03:47.549> think<00:03:47.940> this<00:03:48.090> game<00:03:48.269> since

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
competitive play I think this game since

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:49.849 
competitive play I think this game since
it's<00:03:48.720> already<00:03:48.870> kind<00:03:49.139> of<00:03:49.169> building<00:03:49.440> itself<00:03:49.680> up

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
it's already kind of building itself up

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.259 
it's already kind of building itself up
to<00:03:49.949> be<00:03:50.069> like<00:03:50.099> that<00:03:50.370> I<00:03:50.549> think<00:03:50.940> it's<00:03:51.030> going<00:03:51.180> to

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
to be like that I think it's going to

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.809 
to be like that I think it's going to
actually<00:03:51.629> undo<00:03:52.169> well<00:03:52.410> now<00:03:52.859> for<00:03:52.889> casual<00:03:53.549> gamers

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
actually undo well now for casual gamers

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:54.979 
actually undo well now for casual gamers
I<00:03:53.940> think<00:03:54.180> it's<00:03:54.269> also<00:03:54.389> going<00:03:54.569> to<00:03:54.629> be<00:03:54.720> fun<00:03:54.870> it's

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
I think it's also going to be fun it's

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.659 
I think it's also going to be fun it's
it's<00:03:55.199> comical<00:03:55.680> its<00:03:55.859> colorful<00:03:56.310> it's<00:03:56.489> got

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
it's comical its colorful it's got

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.610 
it's comical its colorful it's got
character<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.329> you<00:03:57.959> know<00:03:57.989> even<00:03:58.079> though<00:03:58.470> it<00:03:58.560> is

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
character and you know even though it is

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.140 
character and you know even though it is
mechanical<00:03:58.799> it's<00:03:59.310> not<00:03:59.459> terribly<00:03:59.879> difficult

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
mechanical it's not terribly difficult

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.000 
mechanical it's not terribly difficult
it's<00:04:00.599> just<00:04:00.780> difficult<00:04:00.930> to<00:04:01.169> master<00:04:01.680> but<00:04:01.799> to<00:04:01.919> get

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
it's just difficult to master but to get

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.589 
it's just difficult to master but to get
into<00:04:02.250> it<00:04:02.400> I<00:04:02.459> think<00:04:02.549> it's<00:04:02.730> pretty<00:04:02.879> intuitive<00:04:03.239> as

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
into it I think it's pretty intuitive as

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.599 
into it I think it's pretty intuitive as
long<00:04:04.109> as<00:04:04.290> you've<00:04:04.470> played<00:04:04.799> like<00:04:05.099> a<00:04:05.129> twin-stick

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
long as you've played like a twin-stick

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.099 
long as you've played like a twin-stick
shooter<00:04:05.940> doesn't<00:04:06.090> even<00:04:06.269> have<00:04:06.389> to<00:04:06.419> be<00:04:06.480> on<00:04:06.629> PC<00:04:06.989> as

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
shooter doesn't even have to be on PC as

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:08.479 
shooter doesn't even have to be on PC as
long<00:04:07.260> as<00:04:07.349> you've<00:04:07.440> played<00:04:07.650> it<00:04:07.799> it's<00:04:08.280> pretty

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
long as you've played it it's pretty

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.460 
long as you've played it it's pretty
easy<00:04:08.639> to<00:04:08.819> get<00:04:08.970> hold<00:04:09.510> of<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:09.840> controls<00:04:10.169> step

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
easy to get hold of the controls step

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.619 
easy to get hold of the controls step
more<00:04:10.680> so<00:04:10.980> definitely<00:04:11.370> then<00:04:11.579> clicking<00:04:12.209> to<00:04:12.419> move

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
more so definitely then clicking to move

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.180 
more so definitely then clicking to move
and<00:04:12.959> all<00:04:13.109> the<00:04:13.199> mechanics<00:04:13.620> of<00:04:13.680> dota<00:04:13.889> 2<00:04:14.069> in

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
and all the mechanics of dota 2 in

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.680 
and all the mechanics of dota 2 in
League<00:04:14.310> of<00:04:14.340> Legends<00:04:14.819> I<00:04:14.970> think<00:04:15.419> this<00:04:15.510> one<00:04:15.660> is

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
League of Legends I think this one is

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.969 
League of Legends I think this one is
going<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:15.959> feel<00:04:16.109> just<00:04:16.380> a<00:04:16.470> little<00:04:16.500> bit<00:04:16.799> easier

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
going to feel just a little bit easier

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:17.509 
going to feel just a little bit easier
to

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
to

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.729 
to
get<00:04:17.759> into<00:04:18.150> and<00:04:18.509> so<00:04:18.810> for<00:04:18.959> a<00:04:18.989> casual<00:04:19.379> game<00:04:19.530> I

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
get into and so for a casual game I

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.110 
get into and so for a casual game I
think<00:04:20.039> it's<00:04:20.129> gonna<00:04:20.220> work<00:04:20.310> out<00:04:20.519> just<00:04:20.699> as<00:04:20.879> well

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
think it's gonna work out just as well

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.309 
think it's gonna work out just as well
especially<00:04:21.329> if<00:04:21.720> they<00:04:21.810> do<00:04:21.870> lots<00:04:22.169> of<00:04:22.229> different

00:04:22.309 --> 00:04:22.319 
especially if they do lots of different

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:24.950 
especially if they do lots of different
maps<00:04:22.650> and<00:04:22.800> game<00:04:22.919> types<00:04:23.449> but<00:04:24.449> on<00:04:24.629> a<00:04:24.660> closing

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
maps and game types but on a closing

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.649 
maps and game types but on a closing
note<00:04:25.199> I<00:04:25.319> have<00:04:25.379> to<00:04:25.710> say<00:04:25.889> that<00:04:25.919> I<00:04:26.490> like<00:04:27.300> it<00:04:27.479> you

00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:27.659 
note I have to say that I like it you

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:29.119 
note I have to say that I like it you
know<00:04:27.750> it<00:04:27.870> looks<00:04:27.900> polished<00:04:28.289> it<00:04:28.620> looks<00:04:28.860> good<00:04:29.069> it

00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:29.129 
know it looks polished it looks good it

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:30.409 
know it looks polished it looks good it
has<00:04:29.280> an<00:04:29.430> interesting<00:04:29.610> aesthetic<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.300> whole

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
has an interesting aesthetic the whole

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.570 
has an interesting aesthetic the whole
clone<00:04:30.870> idea<00:04:31.379> and<00:04:31.680> all<00:04:31.770> these<00:04:31.889> crazy<00:04:32.159> heroes

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
clone idea and all these crazy heroes

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.279 
clone idea and all these crazy heroes
from<00:04:32.699> different<00:04:33.030> galaxies<00:04:33.509> it<00:04:33.810> looks<00:04:34.080> silly

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
from different galaxies it looks silly

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:35.689 
from different galaxies it looks silly
and<00:04:34.409> like<00:04:34.500> I<00:04:34.590> said<00:04:34.650> very<00:04:35.190> reminiscent<00:04:35.550> of

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 
and like I said very reminiscent of

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:38.240 
and like I said very reminiscent of
wildstar<00:04:36.210> if<00:04:36.419> it<00:04:36.599> was<00:04:36.780> a<00:04:36.810> MOBA<00:04:37.319> so<00:04:37.919> I<00:04:37.949> think

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
wildstar if it was a MOBA so I think

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.350 
wildstar if it was a MOBA so I think
it's<00:04:38.490> going<00:04:38.669> to<00:04:38.759> do<00:04:38.940> well<00:04:39.090> it's<00:04:39.210> definitely

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
it's going to do well it's definitely

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.149 
it's going to do well it's definitely
want<00:04:39.659> to<00:04:39.690> keep<00:04:39.810> your<00:04:39.930> eye<00:04:39.990> out<00:04:40.139> for<00:04:40.379> now<00:04:40.979> I<00:04:41.009> know
