don't have to click multiple directions
multiple<00:00:32.640> times<00:00:32.850> per<00:00:32.969> second<00:00:33.559> you<00:00:34.559> can

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
multiple times per second you can

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.680 
multiple times per second you can
actually<00:00:35.100> just<00:00:35.690> press<00:00:36.690> one<00:00:36.930> button<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:38.690> it's

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
actually just press one button and it's

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.920 
actually just press one button and it's
pretty<00:00:39.989> much<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.170> win<00:00:40.440> button<00:00:40.910> so<00:00:41.910> what<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:42.840> did

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
pretty much a win button so what I did

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.520 
pretty much a win button so what I did
was<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.910> put<00:00:44.910> heavens<00:00:45.480> fury<00:00:45.780> as<00:00:45.960> my<00:00:46.200> primary

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
was I put heavens fury as my primary

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.959 
was I put heavens fury as my primary
attack<00:00:47.390> the<00:00:48.390> primary<00:00:48.629> mouse<00:00:48.989> button<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.969> to

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
attack the primary mouse button and to

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.750 
attack the primary mouse button and to
move<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.329> use<00:00:51.480> your<00:00:51.600> primary<00:00:52.020> mouse<00:00:52.170> button

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760

move you use your primary mouse button
so<00:00:53.760> now<00:00:54.110> how<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.289> works<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.800> when<00:00:55.949> you're

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
so now how this works is when you're

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.040 
so now how this works is when you're
moving<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:57.090> don't<00:00:57.270> click<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.629> move<00:00:57.809> you

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
moving you don't click to move you

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.369 
moving you don't click to move you
actually<00:00:58.370> click<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.609> you<00:01:00.120> hold<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.539> down<00:01:00.840> so

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
actually click and you hold it down so

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
kind of issue where you spend this look

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.610 
kind of issue where you spend this look
back<00:02:34.400> it'll<00:02:35.400> actually<00:02:35.490> be<00:02:35.730> sinking<00:02:36.620> which

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
back it'll actually be sinking which

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.320 
back it'll actually be sinking which
means<00:02:37.920> we'll<00:02:38.250> start<00:02:38.520> rubber<00:02:38.700> banding<00:02:39.150> and

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
means we'll start rubber banding and

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.440 
means we'll start rubber banding and
there's<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.840> good<00:02:39.990> chance<00:02:40.200> i<00:02:40.380> can<00:02:40.440> guide

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
there's a good chance i can guide

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.880 
there's a good chance i can guide
especially<00:02:42.450> if<00:02:42.570> you<00:02:42.660> say<00:02:42.870> so<00:02:43.830> you<00:02:44.190> want<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.460> get

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
especially if you say so you want to get

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.250 
especially if you say so you want to get
sweet<00:02:46.890> spot<00:02:47.220> that<00:02:47.550> you'll<00:02:48.510> find<00:02:48.570> out

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
sweet spot that you'll find out

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.500 
sweet spot that you'll find out
as<00:02:50.590> you<00:02:50.739> start<00:02:50.799> using<00:02:51.129> this

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
as you start using this

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.429 
as you start using this
oh<00:02:53.879> yeah<00:02:54.879> there<00:02:55.060> is<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.209> sweet<00:02:55.540> spot<00:02:55.720> where<00:02:56.080> you

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:56.439 
oh yeah there is a sweet spot where you

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:58.319 
oh yeah there is a sweet spot where you
don't<00:02:56.560> go<00:02:56.769> over<00:02:57.129> the<00:02:57.220> limit<00:02:57.400> I'm<00:02:57.670> start<00:02:57.970> to<00:02:58.120> see

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
don't go over the limit I'm start to see

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:05.640 
don't go over the limit I'm start to see
things<00:02:58.829> and<00:02:59.829> there's<00:03:00.549> also<00:03:00.790> a<00:03:04.170> wrap<00:03:05.170> up<00:03:05.379> on

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
things and there's also a wrap up on

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.039 
things and there's also a wrap up on
where<00:03:06.159> you<00:03:06.250> start<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:06.819> spend<00:03:07.150> tens<00:03:07.659> of<00:03:07.810> really

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
where you start to spend tens of really

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:08.580 
where you start to spend tens of really
really

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
really

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.880 
really
and<00:03:09.099> from<00:03:09.640> what<00:03:09.790> I've<00:03:09.940> seen<00:03:10.319> it<00:03:11.319> starts<00:03:11.709> off<00:03:11.860> a

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
and from what I've seen it starts off a

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.369 
and from what I've seen it starts off a
little<00:03:12.129> bit<00:03:12.280> slow<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:13.810> then<00:03:13.930> you<00:03:14.080> can<00:03:14.230> just

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 
little bit slow and then you can just

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.229 
little bit slow and then you can just
slice<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.769> family<00:03:15.160> that's<00:03:15.459> faster<00:03:16.120> and

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
slice the family that's faster and

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.119 
slice the family that's faster and
faster<00:03:16.390> I<00:03:16.930> don't<00:03:17.650> know<00:03:17.739> why<00:03:17.860> that<00:03:17.890> is<00:03:18.129> what

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 
faster I don't know why that is what

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:27.000 
faster I don't know why that is what
just<00:03:21.129> how<00:03:21.250> it<00:03:21.370> works<00:03:21.660> yes

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.960 

also<00:03:28.680> since<00:03:29.680> you're<00:03:29.890> not<00:03:29.980> actually<00:03:30.220> directly

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
also since you're not actually directly

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.509 
also since you're not actually directly
clicking<00:03:31.599> on<00:03:31.659> the<00:03:31.810> mob<00:03:32.040> sometimes<00:03:33.040> it's<00:03:33.250> hard

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
clicking on the mob sometimes it's hard

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.440 
clicking on the mob sometimes it's hard
it's<00:03:33.849> been<00:03:34.060> with<00:03:34.769> all<00:03:35.769> three<00:03:36.310> rays<00:03:36.549> that<00:03:37.390> are

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
it's been with all three rays that are

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.809 
it's been with all three rays that are
shooting<00:03:37.840> out<00:03:38.189> what<00:03:39.189> I<00:03:39.220> like<00:03:39.430> to<00:03:39.579> do<00:03:39.670> is<00:03:39.790> just

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
shooting out what I like to do is just

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.149 
shooting out what I like to do is just
get<00:03:40.239> up<00:03:40.390> right<00:03:40.569> in<00:03:40.599> their<00:03:40.840> face<00:03:41.079> and<00:03:41.349> try<00:03:42.099> to

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:42.159 
get up right in their face and try to

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:43.740 
get up right in their face and try to
blast<00:03:42.430> them<00:03:42.640> down<00:03:42.819> so<00:03:43.150> they<00:03:43.180> can<00:03:43.480> do<00:03:43.599> any

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
blast them down so they can do any

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.140 
blast them down so they can do any
damage<00:03:44.019> to<00:03:44.140> me<00:03:44.440> it's<00:03:45.310> a<00:03:45.370> little<00:03:45.430> bit<00:03:45.670> risky<00:03:46.000> but

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
damage to me it's a little bit risky but

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.940 
damage to me it's a little bit risky but
once<00:03:46.450> you<00:03:46.540> get<00:03:46.659> the<00:03:46.720> hang<00:03:46.750> of<00:03:46.989> it<00:03:47.110> you're<00:03:47.680> kind
