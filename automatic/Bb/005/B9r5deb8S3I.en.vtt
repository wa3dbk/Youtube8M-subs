00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.740
 for the bank to make discounts from an account holder it needs authorization 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.140
 in writing 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.719
 triggered when the account was opened 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.190
 otherwise you are committing an infraction city has a counterpoint of 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.150
 express sanction of the consumer 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.150
 can 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.470
 it's so race 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.509
 debit card 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.460
 one with a capitalization security 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.210
 whatever the relationship with the bank and I was previously 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.350
 written by the consumer 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.200
 can be withdrawn 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.540
 but many financial institutions 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.920
 ten points without prior authorization of the consumer 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.179
 I find a lack of respect with the users themselves 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:53.979
 is also unacceptable 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:57.119
 the trader even because he is anyone interested 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.860
 now outside 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.850
 in your producer payment planning should know your rights and 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:04.960
 duties 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.860
 more if counting improperly 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.320
 is the year to some other 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.580
 another taxpayer another salary 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.950
 so it is true 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.000
 there is a law that obliges financial institutions 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.030
 to maintain banking secrecy 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.020
 for the operations carried out by the account holders, the breach of confidentiality 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.560
 Bank officer 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.560
 the area according to the law for example is the opening 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.140
 given secret rule 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.119
 of bankers practiced by account holders or workers. 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.250
 of the financial movement in the employee's current account by the 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.370
 employer, for example, is one of these violations and also the 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.140
 financial transaction in accordance with the law 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.710
 are considered financial institutions 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.290
 brokerages of real estate credit cooperatives 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.869
 credit card rush layoffs cooperatives and companies 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.010
 and the banks 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.030
 the maid worked for a couple of years 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.509
 he was dismissed without cause after two men of resistance to withdraw 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.470
 of his bank account in the hsbc one thousand and five hundred reais without authorization 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.660
 worker asks in justice the return of money the interest of the check 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.250
 who was obliged to use indemnity for moral damages 

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:27.150
 the companies claimed that the discount was to restore the anticipation of daily 

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.970
 on a trip 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.350
 that was not done but the rapporteur of the case in the 1st class of tst 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.350
 We are sorry for the inconvenience. 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.719
 the one thousand and five hundred reais withdrawn from the worker's account 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:46.359
 plus the interest on the overdraft and a further 15 thousand reais of damages 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:50.139
 morale for the minister was proven the damage suffered by the worker
