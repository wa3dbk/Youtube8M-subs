shall<00:01:57.329> why<00:01:57.450> he's<00:01:57.540> doing<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.930> only

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
shall why he's doing that the only

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.719 
shall why he's doing that the only
reason<00:01:58.229> could<00:01:58.560> possibly<00:01:58.920> be<00:01:59.189> doing<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.579> is

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
reason could possibly be doing that is

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.219 
reason could possibly be doing that is
because<00:01:59.850> he<00:02:00.090> might<00:02:00.270> want<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.659> try<00:02:00.780> okay<00:02:01.110> no

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
because he might want to try okay no

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.120 
because he might want to try okay no
maybe<00:02:01.439> he's<00:02:01.560> just<00:02:01.619> trying<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.860> come<00:02:02.009> around

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
maybe he's just trying to come around

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.440 
maybe he's just trying to come around
and<00:02:02.310> go<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.520> our<00:02:02.640> saviors<00:02:03.060> bitch<00:02:03.210> from<00:02:03.299> there

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
and go to our saviors bitch from there

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.459 
and go to our saviors bitch from there
I'm<00:02:03.509> going<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.689> actually<00:02:03.810> send<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.140> second

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
I'm going to actually send a second

probe out towards saviors base so it

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.100 
probe out towards saviors base so it
looks<00:02:06.060> like<00:02:06.119> stork<00:02:06.509> is<00:02:06.600> setting<00:02:06.840> up<00:02:06.899> from<00:02:07.049> a
