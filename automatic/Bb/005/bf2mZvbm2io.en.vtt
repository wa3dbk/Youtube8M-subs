another face product is hilum I'd of

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.850 
another face product is hilum I'd of
photography<00:01:06.270> foundation<00:01:07.080> this<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.470> base

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
photography foundation this is a base

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.240 
photography foundation this is a base
tent<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.670> in<00:01:09.060> one<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.630> my<00:01:09.810> tutorials<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.860> used

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
tent and in one of my tutorials I used

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.219 
tent and in one of my tutorials I used
it<00:01:11.549> after<00:01:11.820> foundation<00:01:12.720> which<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.080> could

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
it after foundation which you could

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.920 
it after foundation which you could
definitely<00:01:13.409> can<00:01:14.010> do<00:01:14.250> but<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.090> find<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.750> it

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
definitely can do but I find that it

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.200 
definitely can do but I find that it
works<00:01:16.110> better<00:01:16.350> if<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.590> use<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.950> under

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
works better if you use it under

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.910 
works better if you use it under
foundation<00:01:18.409> basically<00:01:19.409> what<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.710> is

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
foundation basically what this is

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.370 
foundation basically what this is
supposed<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.400> do<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.909> color<00:01:21.600> correct<00:01:22.110> your

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
supposed to do is color correct your

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.530 
supposed to do is color correct your
skin<00:01:22.799> while<00:01:23.250> you're<00:01:23.460> on<00:01:23.580> camera<00:01:23.880> or<00:01:24.210> taking

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
skin while you're on camera or taking

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.660 
skin while you're on camera or taking
pictures<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.229> has<00:01:25.710> like<00:01:25.950> an<00:01:26.100> illuminator

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
pictures it has like an illuminator

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.429 
pictures it has like an illuminator
which<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.090> why<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.299> thought<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.659> could<00:01:28.020> use<00:01:28.259> it

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
which is why I thought I could use it

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.140 
which is why I thought I could use it
right<00:01:28.710> after<00:01:28.890> foundation<00:01:29.520> which<00:01:29.790> again<00:01:30.000> you

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
right after foundation which again you

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.230 
right after foundation which again you
can<00:01:30.530> but<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.619> just<00:01:31.770> corrects<00:01:32.280> everything<00:01:32.520> so

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
can but it just corrects everything so

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.950 
can but it just corrects everything so
I'm<00:01:33.420> camera<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.290> makes<00:01:34.560> everything<00:01:34.890> look<00:01:35.130> as

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
I'm camera it makes everything look as

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.749 
I'm camera it makes everything look as
what<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.079> looks<00:01:37.290> like<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.549> color

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
what it looks like so this is the color

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.640 
what it looks like so this is the color
that<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:39.000> am<00:01:39.180> I'm<00:01:39.360> wearing<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.750> underneath<00:01:40.079> my

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
that I am I'm wearing it underneath my

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.670 
that I am I'm wearing it underneath my
