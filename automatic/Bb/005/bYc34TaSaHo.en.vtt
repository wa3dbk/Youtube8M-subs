effectively invisible to the Enderman

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.600 
effectively invisible to the Enderman
now<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.079> wiki<00:01:49.500> states<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.100> also<00:01:50.310> need

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
now the wiki states that you also need

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.499 
now the wiki states that you also need
to<00:01:50.640> press<00:01:51.000> f1<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.869> remove<00:01:52.680> your<00:01:52.890> hard<00:01:53.509> however

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
to press f1 to remove your hard however

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.020 
to press f1 to remove your hard however
as<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.530> see<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.920> video<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.640> pumpkin

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
as you see in the video the pumpkin

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.510 
as you see in the video the pumpkin
trick<00:01:57.149> works<00:01:57.509> without<00:01:57.810> pressing<00:01:58.530> f1<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.369> when

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
trick works without pressing f1 so when

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.100 
trick works without pressing f1 so when
I<00:01:59.549> read<00:01:59.790> this<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.240> thought<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.810> know<00:02:00.899> perhaps

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
I read this I thought you know perhaps

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.679 
I read this I thought you know perhaps
pressing<00:02:01.979> f1<00:02:02.369> has<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.969> same<00:02:03.149> effect<00:02:03.450> as<00:02:03.540> the

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
pressing f1 has the same effect as the

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.719 
pressing f1 has the same effect as the
pumpkins<00:02:04.229> however<00:02:04.799> as<00:02:04.979> you'll<00:02:05.159> see<00:02:05.369> here

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
pumpkins however as you'll see here

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:06.889 
pumpkins however as you'll see here
that's<00:02:06.240> not<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.570> case

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
that's not the case

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.109 
that's not the case
pressing<00:02:07.560> f1<00:02:07.860> really<00:02:08.369> doesn't<00:02:08.640> do<00:02:08.729> anything

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
pressing f1 really doesn't do anything

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.150 
pressing f1 really doesn't do anything
now<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.509> things<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.170> people<00:02:10.319> are<00:02:10.649> concerned

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
now the things that people are concerned

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.190 
now the things that people are concerned
about<00:02:11.280> with<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.819> Enderman<00:02:12.180> are<00:02:12.599> that<00:02:12.989> they

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
about with the Enderman are that they

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.980 
about with the Enderman are that they
are<00:02:13.349> able<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.800> move

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
are able to move

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.950 
are able to move
blocks<00:02:14.380> they<00:02:15.100> can<00:02:15.310> teleport<00:02:15.670> which<00:02:16.300> basically

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
blocks they can teleport which basically

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.860 
blocks they can teleport which basically
gives<00:02:17.230> them<00:02:17.500> an<00:02:17.650> infinite<00:02:18.130> reach<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.870> also

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
gives them an infinite reach and also

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.180 
gives them an infinite reach and also
means<00:02:20.080> that<00:02:20.200> they<00:02:20.290> can<00:02:20.410> attack<00:02:20.680> you<00:02:20.860> from<00:02:21.040> just

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
means that they can attack you from just

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.610 
means that they can attack you from just
about<00:02:21.370> any<00:02:21.580> angle<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:22.120> they<00:02:22.900> do<00:02:22.960> hit<00:02:23.320> quite

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
about any angle and they do hit quite

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.210 
about any angle and they do hit quite
hard

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
hard

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.740 
hard
now<00:02:24.400> unfortunately<00:02:25.150> at<00:02:25.240> the<00:02:25.330> moment<00:02:25.630> there's

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
now unfortunately at the moment there's

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.120 
now unfortunately at the moment there's
nothing<00:02:26.110> that<00:02:26.230> we<00:02:26.320> can<00:02:26.440> do<00:02:26.620> about<00:02:26.830> the

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
nothing that we can do about the

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.950 
nothing that we can do about the
Enderman<00:02:27.430> being<00:02:27.670> able<00:02:27.790> to<00:02:27.910> pick<00:02:28.060> up<00:02:28.240> and<00:02:28.480> place

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
Enderman being able to pick up and place

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.050 
Enderman being able to pick up and place
down<00:02:29.260> blocks<00:02:29.710> at<00:02:29.980> this<00:02:30.430> stage<00:02:30.670> they're<00:02:30.940> able

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
down blocks at this stage they're able

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.420 
down blocks at this stage they're able
to<00:02:31.210> pick<00:02:31.390> up<00:02:31.540> any<00:02:31.750> block<00:02:32.110> as<00:02:32.350> far<00:02:32.590> as<00:02:32.740> I<00:02:32.830> know<00:02:32.890> so

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
to pick up any block as far as I know so

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.820 
to pick up any block as far as I know so
I'm<00:02:33.730> not<00:02:33.880> even<00:02:34.120> going<00:02:34.240> to<00:02:34.300> touch<00:02:34.480> on<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:34.830> the

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
I'm not even going to touch on that the

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.550 
I'm not even going to touch on that the
teleporting<00:02:36.460> however<00:02:36.760> we<00:02:37.030> can<00:02:37.300> deal<00:02:37.600> with<00:02:37.660> now

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
teleporting however we can deal with now

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.680 
teleporting however we can deal with now
as<00:02:38.740> I<00:02:38.920> said<00:02:38.980> earlier<00:02:39.310> annemun<00:02:40.210> can<00:02:40.360> teleport

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
as I said earlier annemun can teleport

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.630 
as I said earlier annemun can teleport
and<00:02:41.080> this<00:02:41.770> means<00:02:41.980> that<00:02:42.100> they<00:02:42.220> can<00:02:42.250> generally

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
and this means that they can generally

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.390 
and this means that they can generally
attack<00:02:42.970> you<00:02:43.120> from<00:02:43.240> just<00:02:43.450> about<00:02:43.660> any<00:02:43.870> direction

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
attack you from just about any direction

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.500 
attack you from just about any direction
and<00:02:45.400> a<00:02:45.640> lot<00:02:45.790> of<00:02:45.820> people<00:02:46.120> have<00:02:46.210> been<00:02:46.300> a<00:02:46.360> little

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
and a lot of people have been a little

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.730 
and a lot of people have been a little
bit<00:02:46.600> worried<00:02:46.900> about<00:02:47.050> that<00:02:47.260> they're<00:02:47.470> sort<00:02:47.650> of

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
bit worried about that they're sort of

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:48.810 
bit worried about that they're sort of
worried<00:02:48.010> that<00:02:48.040> when<00:02:48.280> they're<00:02:48.400> fighting<00:02:48.730> an

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
worried that when they're fighting an

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.040 
worried that when they're fighting an
Enderman<00:02:49.150> they're<00:02:49.360> not<00:02:49.540> going<00:02:49.690> to<00:02:49.720> know<00:02:49.840> we're

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
Enderman they're not going to know we're

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.470 
Enderman they're not going to know we're
in<00:02:50.170> attacks<00:02:50.470> coming<00:02:50.890> from<00:02:51.130> however<00:02:52.060> as<00:02:52.270> you'll

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
in attacks coming from however as you'll

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.480 
in attacks coming from however as you'll
see<00:02:52.690> when<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.260> in<00:02:53.500> demand<00:02:53.800> teleport<00:02:54.280> they

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
see when the in demand teleport they

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.690 
see when the in demand teleport they
leave<00:02:54.760> behind<00:02:55.630> a<00:02:56.110> particle<00:02:56.680> trail<00:02:56.920> which

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
leave behind a particle trail which

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.430 
leave behind a particle trail which
actually<00:02:58.090> shows<00:02:58.390> you<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:58.750> general<00:02:58.960> direction

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
actually shows you the general direction

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.090 
actually shows you the general direction

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
the time if an Enderman teleports you're

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.660 
the time if an Enderman teleports you're
going<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.230> know<00:03:05.320> exactly<00:03:05.830> where<00:03:06.070> is<00:03:06.190> going<00:03:06.550> and

you're going to know where to expect

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.070 
you're going to know where to expect
them<00:03:07.990> to<00:03:08.050> come<00:03:08.260> from<00:03:09.300> you<00:03:10.300> are<00:03:10.420> generally<00:03:10.930> able

them to come from you are generally able

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.930 
them to come from you are generally able
to<00:03:11.380> stop<00:03:11.710> an<00:03:11.890> Enderman<00:03:12.280> dead<00:03:12.460> in<00:03:12.610> his<00:03:12.700> tracks

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
to stop an Enderman dead in his tracks

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.240 
to stop an Enderman dead in his tracks
though<00:03:13.390> by<00:03:13.720> simply<00:03:14.230> staring<00:03:14.710> at<00:03:14.830> and<00:03:14.980> during

begin with you can then refreeze it so

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.870 
begin with you can then refreeze it so
although<00:03:20.710> this<00:03:20.950> starts<00:03:21.280> off<00:03:21.370> being<00:03:21.610> a<00:03:21.670> bad

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
although this starts off being a bad

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.760 
although this starts off being a bad
thing<00:03:22.180> meaning<00:03:22.630> that<00:03:22.720> an<00:03:22.870> Enderman<00:03:23.290> attack<00:03:23.560> is

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
thing meaning that an Enderman attack is

thing meaning that an Enderman attack is
imminent<00:03:24.280> it<00:03:24.670> does<00:03:24.940> end<00:03:25.150> up<00:03:25.270> being<00:03:25.330> quite<00:03:25.840> a

imminent it does end up being quite a
large<00:03:26.200> advantage<00:03:26.440> during<00:03:27.160> battle<00:03:27.520> the<00:03:28.210> only

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
large advantage during battle the only

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.390 
large advantage during battle the only
issue<00:03:28.720> is<00:03:29.020> that<00:03:29.320> once<00:03:29.800> you<00:03:29.980> get<00:03:30.100> within<00:03:30.250> a

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
issue is that once you get within a

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.220 
issue is that once you get within a
certain<00:03:30.460> distance<00:03:30.820> of<00:03:31.450> an<00:03:31.750> Enderman<00:03:32.140> they

certain distance of an Enderman they

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.770 
certain distance of an Enderman they
will<00:03:32.350> generally<00:03:32.770> teleport<00:03:33.280> away<00:03:33.550> so<00:03:34.330> freezing

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
will generally teleport away so freezing

you<00:03:38.770> are<00:03:38.950> still<00:03:39.220> going<00:03:39.340> to<00:03:39.430> need<00:03:39.490> to<00:03:39.610> be<00:03:39.790> quick

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
you are still going to need to be quick

now if there are any bodies of water

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.590 
now if there are any bodies of water
around<00:03:42.400> you<00:03:42.700> can<00:03:42.940> use<00:03:43.150> this<00:03:43.330> to<00:03:43.510> your

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
around you can use this to your

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.290 
around you can use this to your
advantage<00:03:43.690> and<00:03:44.410> get<00:03:44.710> quite<00:03:45.010> an<00:03:45.130> easy<00:03:45.220> kill<00:03:45.610> by

advantage and get quite an easy kill by

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.500 
advantage and get quite an easy kill by
luring<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:47.080> Enderman<00:03:47.440> into<00:03:47.770> the<00:03:47.890> water

that body of water until he dies so it's

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.180 
that body of water until he dies so it's

water yourself when the Enderman comes
to<00:04:06.580> attack<00:04:06.880> you<00:04:07.090> he'll<00:04:07.330> take<00:04:07.480> damage<00:04:07.810> and

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
to attack you he'll take damage and

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.440 
to attack you he'll take damage and
generally<00:04:09.070> it'll<00:04:09.250> instantly<00:04:09.610> teleport<00:04:10.360> away

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
generally it'll instantly teleport away

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.240 
generally it'll instantly teleport away
you<00:04:10.930> might<00:04:11.110> want<00:04:11.290> to<00:04:11.320> have<00:04:11.440> your<00:04:11.470> sword<00:04:11.860> handy

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
you might want to have your sword handy

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.890 
you might want to have your sword handy
just<00:04:12.459> in<00:04:12.610> case<00:04:12.670> he<00:04:12.940> doesn't<00:04:13.150> teleport<00:04:13.690> away

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
just in case he doesn't teleport away

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.540 
just in case he doesn't teleport away
but<00:04:14.170> the<00:04:14.380> chances<00:04:14.770> of<00:04:14.830> that<00:04:14.980> happening<00:04:15.040> are

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
but the chances of that happening are

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.000 
but the chances of that happening are
pretty<00:04:15.850> slim<00:04:16.239> and<00:04:16.480> the<00:04:16.510> bonus<00:04:17.440> to<00:04:17.590> this<00:04:17.770> is

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
pretty slim and the bonus to this is

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.340 
pretty slim and the bonus to this is

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
that again all you have to do is sit

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.370 
that again all you have to do is sit
there<00:04:20.530> and<00:04:20.680> wait<00:04:20.920> until<00:04:21.280> the<00:04:21.400> end<00:04:21.520> of<00:04:21.549> min<00:04:21.670> dies
