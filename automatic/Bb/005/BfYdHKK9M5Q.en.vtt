00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.960
 not having this table because of 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.260
 my recording studio's activity has ceased 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:14.469
 which under me with a site on the market for me I know it built personally 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.549
 I designed my here built by a professional 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:26.509
 he built it specifically for needs that a dj can see then for 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.509
 farm requirements I therefore that the point does not jump axis 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.079
 the plan was stable 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.890
 and that perhaps spacious 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.270
 the one fitted with a back 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.120
 80 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.560
 so that 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.720
 the vibrations 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.130
 are for reduced when the dj reports the hand on the disk 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.390
 it is 2 meters long 10 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.390
 quietly accommodate 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.270
 a couple of consoles here 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.840
 if the space for another thecnics turntable 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.890
 4 hours in mind a fairly large mixer 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.860
 and when he comes out he is quietly there 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.520
 another console like this one 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.630
 still smoke a little more 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.230
 Zanata 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.230
 it is 84 centimeters high 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 here is the answer that allows you to have 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.550
 disk 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.640
 however turntables at a height 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.850
 it is a fact to split the back in two because you have to bend at 90 to play 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.229
 often the ct is 50 centimeters deep 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.880
 exactly 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.960
 or almost a little longer the length 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.900
 goddess 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.420
 foto foto dottarelli a 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.680
 of a small thickness 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.380
 that the horror even more 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.809
 beautiful aesthetically practical because 

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:11.909
 cables can be passed through 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:14.899
 here behind the torrent space you see 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:16.469
 on the outside 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:20.779
 also gifted versus credem and I took a lot of light 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:24.449
 adopted 

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:25.400
 8 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.359
 cell 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:33.019
 within which there are respectively about 320 vinimilo 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.039
 each therefore for a total of a thousand records 

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:40.239
 which may be it means things that can be 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.830
 hosts night inside this server of course or below 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.019
 filling boil below and increase table stability 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.069
 further 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.069
 it's very heavy and that's what these 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:58.459
 start again 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.459
 all this stability 

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:05.349
 say that everything 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:06.889
 key and cory 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.289
 there are these two libraries 

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:10.859
 these too 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.959
 built on purpose 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.379
 to house the grueling water bottles. That I do not have 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:19.719
 enough vinyl in all 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:21.329
 these instead 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.599
 are characterized by 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.229
 12 cells with one 

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:31.409
 which can accommodate a total of 1500 vinyl library 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:37.090
 bookcases were made especially for vinyl records in fact vedette lo 

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:40.549
 above thickness I left it 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.549
 I left just a little thickness 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.569
 however the measure in the cells for made for the wines not even with are 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.569
 very resistant 

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:58.419
 I'm. prox at the black melamine like the table 

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:02.069
 and in the case 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.069
 that last too bulky 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.669
 you can pay them 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.669
 to say this twitter ahead with the other were 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:14.339
 a further shall still above 

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:17.339
 but we have a carter with a flexible 4 

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:20.199
 it has become 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:23.199
 a glass top 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:25.860
 was to say that everything
