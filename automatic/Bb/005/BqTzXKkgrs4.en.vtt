00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
why I wanted the yellow set is because I

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.090 
why I wanted the yellow set is because I
have<00:03:49.180> a<00:03:49.209> set<00:03:49.510> up<00:03:49.630> that<00:03:49.840> I<00:03:50.440> think<00:03:50.950> would<00:03:51.040> look

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
have a set up that I think would look

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.979 
have a set up that I think would look
really<00:03:51.430> good<00:03:51.519> with<00:03:51.880> yellow<00:03:52.540> black<00:03:52.750> river
