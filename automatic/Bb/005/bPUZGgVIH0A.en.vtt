 Hello! 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:08.260
 Today I'm going to show you how to weave this sunflower flower. 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:21.900
 This flower is n Â° 20 of my collection of flowers in crochet fabric from www.crochet.com.ar 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.420
 It is very easy, first you have to weave the circle and then the petals. 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.920
 Let's start with the circle. 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:41.070
 We are going to knit it in black. 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:52.530
 Let's make a ring, in this way and then we introduce the needle, and let's weave inside 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:29.000
 of the circle, 6 low points: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:44.139
 and 6, then, we take the thread and adjust to close the row well. 

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:55.270
 We are going to close it by chopping at the 1st low point and closing it with 1 flat point. 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:02.030
 And here we have the 1st row finished. 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:13.530
 For the 2nd row we will knit 1 string and we will knit at each low point, 2 stitches 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:24.700
 low, that is, we chop at the 1st low point and we weave 1 and 2, this is to perform the 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.170
 increase. 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:37.610
 Again, we click on the 2nd and we knit 2 low points and this we will repeat during 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.800
 the whole row. 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:52.240
 Here I have already completed the row and we are going to close it by punching in the 1st low point with 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.060
 1 point satin. 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:02.200
 We must have a total of 12 points, since we made 2 increases in each of the 6 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.160
 points of the 1st row. 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:17.600
 Now, we weave 1 chain and we can cut the thread. 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:31.200
 We slide and as always hide the thread on the wrong side. 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.460
 Now, let's weave the petals. 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:04:02.930
 For them we are going to weave in each low point, we take the yellow thread and we weave: 1 chain, 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:27.639
 1 flat point and 7 chains: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and in the same place we chop and we weave 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:44.800
 1 flat point, that is, at each point we will knit: 1 flat point, 7 chains and 1 flat point. 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:05:04.900
 We are going to repeat it 1 flat point, 7 chains: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.840
 and 1 flat point in the same place. 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.300
 We will repeat this in each point. 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:32.090
 Here I have already woven all the petals the 12 petals: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:46.620
 10, 11, 12, now we are going to close the row with 1 stitched satin on the 1st satin stitch 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:06:06.219
 that we wove, that is, of the 1st petal and finally we weave 1 chain 

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:19.900
 and we can cut the strand and finish. 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:44.370
 Now let's hide all the threads on the wrong side, like this. 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.729
 And we will be like this well neat. 

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:58.729
 This, is woven with plastic bags, can also be made with recycled material. 

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:04.200
 And here we have this nice sunflower fabric.
