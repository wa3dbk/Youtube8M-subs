00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
the song all the way through so we're

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.510 
the song all the way through so we're
gonna<00:00:14.040> start<00:00:14.370> it<00:00:14.460> off<00:00:14.580> with<00:00:14.969> an<00:00:15.570> E<00:00:15.780> minor<00:00:16.520> zero

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520

gonna start it off with an E minor zero
two<00:00:18.029> two<00:00:18.390> zero<00:00:18.869> zero<00:00:19.350> zero<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:22.279> then<00:00:23.279> we're

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
two two zero zero zero and then we're

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.420 
two two zero zero zero and then we're
going<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.519> do<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.670> C<00:00:25.010> we're<00:00:26.010> going<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.189> mute

going to do a C we're going to mute

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:34.250 
going to do a C we're going to mute
three<00:00:27.000> two<00:00:27.359> zero<00:00:27.570> one<00:00:27.960> zero<00:00:31.160> and<00:00:32.899> then<00:00:33.899> we're

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
three two zero one zero and then we're

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.100 
three two zero one zero and then we're
going<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.530> do<00:00:34.620> an<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.860> minor<00:00:35.510> Butte<00:00:36.510> zero<00:00:36.989> two

important<00:00:54.710> obviously<00:00:55.710> I'm<00:00:56.070> playing<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.400> way

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
important obviously I'm playing it way

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.100 
important obviously I'm playing it way
slower<00:00:57.120> than<00:00:57.330> the<00:00:57.390> song<00:00:57.540> but<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.750> really<00:00:57.930> want

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
slower than the song but I really want

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.420 
slower than the song but I really want
you<00:00:58.170> guys<00:00:58.200> to<00:00:58.320> be<00:00:58.440> able<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.620> get<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.920> because<00:00:59.309> if

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
you guys to be able to get it because if

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:08.120 
you guys to be able to get it because if
you<00:00:59.489> hear<00:00:59.910> it<00:00:59.940> fastest<00:01:06.560> so<00:01:07.560> see<00:01:07.710> how<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.800> stick

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
you hear it fastest so see how I stick

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.350 
you hear it fastest so see how I stick
it<00:01:08.220> down<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.520> see<00:01:08.790> for<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.030> little<00:01:09.210> bit

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
it down on that see for a little bit

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.060 
it down on that see for a little bit
it's<00:01:09.810> almost<00:01:09.869> like<00:01:10.140> playing<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.500> see<00:01:10.650> twice<00:01:10.920> in

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
it's almost like playing to see twice in

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:24.770 
it's almost like playing to see twice in
a<00:01:11.100> row<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> minor<00:01:11.910> okay<00:01:20.720> so<00:01:23.210> that<00:01:24.210> second<00:01:24.600> chord

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
a row a minor okay so that second chord

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.670 
a row a minor okay so that second chord
I<00:01:24.869> go<00:01:24.990> on<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.229> upstroke<00:01:28.850> to<00:01:29.850> upstrokes

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
I go on the upstroke to upstrokes

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.499 
I go on the upstroke to upstrokes
and<00:01:31.680> then<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:31.979> think<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.310> pretty<00:01:33.000> much<00:01:33.090> go<00:01:33.330> from

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
and then I think I pretty much go from

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.760 
and then I think I pretty much go from
upstroke<00:01:33.780> on<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.080> last<00:01:34.259> chord

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.039 

just<00:01:40.340> like<00:01:40.460> that<00:01:41.290> up<00:01:42.290> down

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
just like that up down

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.819 
just like that up down
and<00:01:45.049> that's<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.259> strumming<00:01:45.560> pattern<00:01:45.590> that's

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
and that's the strumming pattern that's

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:47.649 
and that's the strumming pattern that's
going<00:01:45.890> to<00:01:46.040> be<00:01:46.130> used<00:01:46.340> a<00:01:46.790> lot<00:01:47.180> pretty<00:01:47.540> much

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
going to be used a lot pretty much

00:01:47.659 --> 00:02:06.969 
going to be used a lot pretty much
through<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:47.899> entire<00:01:48.200> song<00:02:04.060> G<00:02:05.060> minor<00:02:05.619> C<00:02:06.619> which

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
through the entire song G minor C which

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.780 
through the entire song G minor C which
is<00:02:07.159> zero<00:02:07.610> mute<00:02:08.269> zero<00:02:08.840> zero<00:02:09.289> two<00:02:09.410> three<00:02:09.679> two<00:02:10.330> so

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
is zero mute zero zero two three two so

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.920 
is zero mute zero zero two three two so
and<00:02:13.790> then<00:02:14.120> to<00:02:14.209> a<00:02:14.239> see

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
and then to a see

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.180 
and then to a see
and<00:02:16.439> then<00:02:16.620> at<00:02:16.739> a<00:02:16.829> minor

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
and then at a minor

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.340 
and then at a minor
and<00:02:18.280> this<00:02:19.030> is<00:02:19.180> also<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.510> repetitive<00:02:19.810> pattern

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
and this is also a repetitive pattern

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.680 
and this is also a repetitive pattern
that's<00:02:20.530> with<00:02:20.710> some<00:02:20.860> song<00:02:24.300> so<00:02:25.300> that's<00:02:25.480> at<00:02:25.600> the

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
that's with some song so that's at the

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.360 
that's with some song so that's at the
end<00:02:25.810> of<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:25.960> first<00:02:26.290> part<00:02:26.710> of<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.040> verse<00:02:27.160> at

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
end of the first part of the verse at

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.740 
end of the first part of the verse at
the<00:02:27.460> end<00:02:27.580> of<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.730> second<00:02:28.300> part<00:02:28.420> of<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.630> verse

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
the end of the second part of the verse

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.230 
the end of the second part of the verse
they<00:02:29.020> just<00:02:29.320> switch<00:02:29.650> that<00:02:30.190> a<00:02:30.400> minor<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:30.880> a<00:02:30.910> G

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
they just switch that a minor to a G

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:37.160 
they just switch that a minor to a G
instead

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.690 

and<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:37.800> will<00:02:37.920> lead<00:02:38.070> you<00:02:38.160> into<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.340> chorus

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
and that will lead you into the chorus

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.770 
and that will lead you into the chorus
so<00:02:39.030> I'm<00:02:39.150> just<00:02:39.270> going<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.480> go<00:02:39.540> through<00:02:39.690> the

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
so I'm just going to go through the

00:02:39.780 --> 00:03:14.339 
so I'm just going to go through the
verse<00:02:39.930> real<00:02:40.110> quick<00:02:40.320> one

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.740 

and<00:03:15.349> now<00:03:15.590> we<00:03:15.650> go<00:03:16.010> into<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.849> chorus<00:03:17.209> now<00:03:17.690> the

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
and now we go into the chorus now the

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:51.199 
and now we go into the chorus now the
chorus<00:03:18.200> has<00:03:19.190> almost<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.519> exact<00:03:19.849> same

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.370 

so<00:03:52.209> the<00:03:52.330> second<00:03:52.630> time<00:03:52.780> around<00:03:52.810> so<00:03:53.260> they

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
so the second time around so they

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.839 
so the second time around so they
switched<00:03:53.800> it<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.130> way<00:03:54.220> that<00:03:54.250> they<00:03:54.489> did<00:03:54.550> it<00:03:54.670> in

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
switched it the way that they did it in

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:56.850 
switched it the way that they did it in
the<00:03:55.030> verse<00:03:55.390> and<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:55.780> chorus<00:03:55.870> they<00:03:56.650> just

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
the verse and the chorus they just

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.949 
the verse and the chorus they just
switched<00:03:57.220> the<00:03:57.370> pattern<00:03:57.880> those<00:03:58.450> tail<00:03:58.750> end

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
switched the pattern those tail end

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:05.160 
switched the pattern those tail end
patterns<00:03:59.410> the<00:03:59.890> first<00:04:00.160> one<00:04:00.400> goes<00:04:03.900> and<00:04:04.900> this<00:04:05.019> is

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
patterns the first one goes and this is

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.300 
patterns the first one goes and this is
in<00:04:05.260> the<00:04:05.319> course<00:04:05.560> specifically<00:04:06.040> and<00:04:06.160> then<00:04:06.250> the

part<00:04:19.780> that<00:04:19.930> you<00:04:20.079> need<00:04:20.109> to<00:04:20.320> know<00:04:20.500> is<00:04:20.739> the<00:04:21.459> bridge

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
part that you need to know is the bridge

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.490 
part that you need to know is the bridge
now<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:22.360> bridge<00:04:22.600> has<00:04:22.810> some<00:04:22.990> different<00:04:23.260> chords

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
now the bridge has some different chords

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.879 
now the bridge has some different chords
in<00:04:23.590> it<00:04:23.820> has<00:04:24.820> the<00:04:24.970> e<00:04:25.000> minor<00:04:25.620> alright<00:04:26.620> but<00:04:26.770> then

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
in it has the e minor alright but then

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.330 
in it has the e minor alright but then
it<00:04:27.010> has<00:04:27.190> a<00:04:27.220> B<00:04:27.520> minor<00:04:27.820> which<00:04:28.620> is<00:04:29.620> like<00:04:29.889> this<00:04:30.070> it's

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
it has a B minor which is like this it's

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:36.540 
it has a B minor which is like this it's
mute<00:04:30.669> 2<00:04:31.240> 4<00:04:31.750> 4<00:04:32.290> 3<00:04:32.770> 2<00:04:33.160> and<00:04:34.050> then<00:04:35.050> a<00:04:35.080> C<00:04:35.560> would<00:04:36.400> you

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
mute 2 4 4 3 2 and then a C would you

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.110 
mute 2 4 4 3 2 and then a C would you
know<00:04:36.729> and<00:04:37.090> then<00:04:37.990> we<00:04:38.080> do<00:04:38.200> a<00:04:38.229> C<00:04:38.470> minor<00:04:39.000> which<00:04:40.000> is

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
know and then we do a C minor which is

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.820 
know and then we do a C minor which is
almost<00:04:40.240> like<00:04:40.360> that<00:04:40.570> B<00:04:40.720> minor<00:04:40.960> but<00:04:41.620> you<00:04:41.680> just

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
almost like that B minor but you just

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.860 
almost like that B minor but you just
move<00:04:41.950> it<00:04:42.070> up<00:04:42.130> a<00:04:42.220> half<00:04:42.400> step<00:04:42.550> or<00:04:42.880> a<00:04:43.510> whole<00:04:43.660> step

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
move it up a half step or a whole step

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.520 
move it up a half step or a whole step
in<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.110> real<00:04:44.260> case<00:04:44.410> so<00:04:44.950> alright<00:04:45.729> for<00:04:46.030> that<00:04:46.530> and

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
in the real case so alright for that and

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:54.360 
in the real case so alright for that and
so<00:04:47.620> it<00:04:47.710> would<00:04:47.800> be<00:04:47.860> mute<00:04:48.100> 3<00:04:49.020> 5<00:04:50.020> 5<00:04:50.640> 4<00:04:51.640> 3

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
so it would be mute 3 5 5 4 3

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.420 
so it would be mute 3 5 5 4 3
and<00:04:55.169> then<00:04:56.169> the<00:04:56.260> next<00:04:56.470> court<00:04:56.650> after<00:04:56.830> that<00:04:56.980> is<00:04:57.100> G

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
and then the next court after that is G

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:06.270 
and then the next court after that is G
3<00:04:58.060> 2<00:04:58.419> 0<00:04:58.720> 0<00:04:59.590> 3<00:05:00.130> 3<00:05:01.979> and<00:05:02.979> then<00:05:03.639> a<00:05:03.669> D<00:05:03.850> which<00:05:05.280> we've
