00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hi all, swami is back in heat again today 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.750
 I would like to understand why 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.090
 secret room none of the visitors are 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.070
 could notice let's remember the record 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.620
 or background guys from five night at 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.450
 freddys 3 on the third night in an emergency 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.550
 If necessary, proceed to the indicated 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.890
 safe room every establishment 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.779
 built with one extra 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.210
 it is not displayed on the digital 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.400
 security card or available 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.960
 for animatronic room hidden from 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.420
 Visitors invisible to animatronics 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.880
 and and not on the cameras as always not 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.370
 forget to get in the face of freddie phaseber 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.380
 pizza as we could understand the seed in 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.149
 records every institution is built with 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.219
 one extra room which 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.079
 can't be seen on camera also she 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.300
 hidden from clients available to them 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.489
 animatronic that is anyway from 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.039
 The room was in 1 2 five night at 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.440
 freddy's that suggests 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.930
 how did you manage to correctly open it 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.850
 Of course it is clear what could be with the camera 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.620
 CCTV we could not have her 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.410
 see but that's why I couldn't 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.530
 discover customers is not clear after all in the sixth 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.299
 nights phone guy says the following 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.549
 the workers will come here today 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.710
 erecting a false wall on the former site 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.320
 doors and here comes a small 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.720
 a snag how visitors failed 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.000
 notice the door leading secret room 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.979
 as and most importantly where it was possible 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.080
 hide this door based on what was said 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.180
 earlier it can be concluded that 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.400
 secret room possible in all 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.159
 facilities located in the toilet in 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.479
 first there are no surveillance cameras that 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.000
 quite a logical 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.280
 do not take into account the kitchen from 1 five to 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.140
 this freddy's yes the camera doesn't work there 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.540
 but somehow she is there and 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.680
 records sound which means she 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.780
 just broken 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.000
 and secondly the door to the toilet is easiest 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.250
 hide from the customer in the pizzeria so as 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.649
 you can just hang on the toilet door 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.420
 stall inscription does not work and in the 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.310
 booths do just the same door 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.409
 leading secret room 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.240
 Well, I think that we could understand 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.640
 why customers could not pizza 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.049
 notice the hidden room on it all 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.939
 put your thumbs up 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.869
 subscribe to my channel all good luck 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.869
 until
