to screw this on pretty tight and the

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.390 
to screw this on pretty tight and the
VESA<00:02:46.180> mount<00:02:46.510> actually<00:02:46.990> has<00:02:47.230> some<00:02:48.010> plastic

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
VESA mount actually has some plastic

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.000 
VESA mount actually has some plastic
right<00:02:48.940> here<00:02:49.270> where<00:02:49.600> it<00:02:49.750> touches<00:02:49.990> the<00:02:50.470> display

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
right here where it touches the display

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.920 
right here where it touches the display
so<00:02:51.610> it<00:02:51.730> doesn't<00:02:52.060> scratch<00:02:52.300> your<00:02:52.510> display<00:02:52.870> so

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
okay so here we go with the hex bolt and

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:06.680 
okay so here we go with the hex bolt and
for<00:03:00.100> that<00:03:00.220> I<00:03:00.430> gotta<00:03:00.700> use<00:03:00.910> this<00:03:01.320> hex<00:03:02.320> key

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.720 

so<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.200> reason<00:03:07.530> why<00:03:07.650> you<00:03:07.710> wanted<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:08.190> screw<00:03:08.550> in

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
so the reason why you wanted to screw in

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.120 
so the reason why you wanted to screw in
that<00:03:09.030> star<00:03:09.510> bowl<00:03:09.720> in<00:03:09.930> pretty<00:03:10.680> tight<00:03:10.920> is

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
that star bowl in pretty tight is

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.370 
that star bowl in pretty tight is
because<00:03:11.490> it<00:03:11.640> makes<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:12.150> hex<00:03:12.600> bolts<00:03:12.930> easier<00:03:13.260> to

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
because it makes the hex bolts easier to

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.790 
because it makes the hex bolts easier to
screw<00:03:13.590> in<00:03:13.770> that<00:03:13.980> way<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:15.380> these<00:03:16.380> keys<00:03:16.770> are

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
screw in that way and these keys are

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.830 
screw in that way and these keys are
pretty<00:03:17.250> slippery<00:03:17.550> so<00:03:18.030> if<00:03:18.210> they<00:03:18.390> slip<00:03:18.660> they're

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
pretty slippery so if they slip they're

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.810 
pretty slippery so if they slip they're
gonna<00:03:18.930> scratch<00:03:19.320> your<00:03:19.590> display<00:03:19.980> so<00:03:20.040> be<00:03:20.310> careful

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
gonna scratch your display so be careful

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:29.450 
gonna scratch your display so be careful
