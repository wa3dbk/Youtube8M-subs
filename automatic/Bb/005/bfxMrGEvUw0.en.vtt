00:00:05.894 --> 00:00:09.693
 A year ago, a candidate from Sunrise, Florida, was on this stage. 

00:00:09.882 --> 00:00:11.785
 She was the one who won The X Factor. 

00:00:11.974 --> 00:00:14.862
 Tonight she's here with her new single "Long Distance" 

00:00:15.041 --> 00:00:17.016
 This is Melanie Amaro. 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:20.007
 SHE WAS A GIRL 

00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:22.146
 -What's your name? -Melanie Amaro. 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:23.688
 WITH A DREAM 

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:31.004
 And that dream 

00:00:32.334 --> 00:00:34.600
 That was a $ 5 million dollar frailty. 

00:00:34.798 --> 00:00:38.094
 That was completely fantastic. 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.140
 "You were fantastic, girl!" -Thanks. 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:42.864
 BECOMING REALITY 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.577
 The winner of The X Factor is ... 

00:00:46.334 --> 00:00:47.712
 Melanie Amaro! 

00:00:48.068 --> 00:00:55.047
 Melanie Amaro - Performance Gold "Long Distance" 

00:00:56.117 --> 00:00:59.002
 Shadows on the ceiling 

00:00:59.916 --> 00:01:03.884
 You're the one I'm dreaming of. 

00:01:04.217 --> 00:01:06.251
 I'm about to die, boy. 

00:01:06.455 --> 00:01:08.112
 We should say goodbye, boy. 

00:01:08.314 --> 00:01:11.499
 Honey, I just want you to know. 

00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:14.986
 I hate the way I'm feeling. 

00:01:16.037 --> 00:01:19.808
 Talking to you is not enough 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.032
 I need you to touch me. 

00:01:22.245 --> 00:01:24.069
 Why are you so far from me? 

00:01:24.244 --> 00:01:27.462
 Darling, I have to tell you 

00:01:27.648 --> 00:01:30.926
 I just want you to be 

00:01:32.267 --> 00:01:35.773
 More than an image on my screen 

00:01:36.112 --> 00:01:37.342
 I have no choice 

00:01:37.603 --> 00:01:39.288
 I can not live without you 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.275
 I can not sleep at all 

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:43.329
 And I'm crazy about you. 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.663
 And I want you here with me. 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.711
 When I listen to your answering machine 

00:01:52.031 --> 00:01:53.513
 The sound of your voice 

00:01:53.738 --> 00:01:55.234
 I can not live without you 

00:01:55.421 --> 00:01:57.331
 I can not sleep at all 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.271
 And I'm crazy about you. 

00:01:59.476 --> 00:02:01.900
 Long-distance love 

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:10.960
 Wherever you are now 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.917
 I hope I am the object of your dream 

00:02:16.103 --> 00:02:18.035
 Counting Down 

00:02:18.232 --> 00:02:20.239
 Until you're in my arms, boys. 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:23.438
 Darling, I have to tell you 

00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:27.649
 And I just want you to be 

00:02:27.887 --> 00:02:31.719
 More than an image on my screen 

00:02:31.912 --> 00:02:33.473
 I have no choice 

00:02:33.654 --> 00:02:35.365
 I can not live without you 

00:02:35.562 --> 00:02:37.240
 I can not sleep at all 

00:02:37.465 --> 00:02:39.330
 And I'm crazy about you. 

00:02:39.532 --> 00:02:41.909
 Long-distance love 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.652
 Now it seems that the further you go 

00:02:46.028 --> 00:02:49.918
 Closer to me I want you to be 

00:02:50.144 --> 00:02:53.369
 Tired of being alone 

00:02:54.083 --> 00:02:59.262
 Honey, now when you're calling 

00:03:04.474 --> 00:03:06.123
 Long distance 

00:03:08.161 --> 00:03:11.202
 Long distance 

00:03:13.873 --> 00:03:17.737
 (And I just want you to be) 

00:03:18.204 --> 00:03:21.750
 More than an image on my screen 

00:03:21.965 --> 00:03:23.466
 I have no choice 

00:03:23.677 --> 00:03:25.310
 I can not live without you 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.361
 I can not sleep at all 

00:03:27.533 --> 00:03:29.360
 And I'm crazy about you. 

00:03:29.538 --> 00:03:33.700
 And I want you here with me. 

00:03:33.892 --> 00:03:37.766
 When I listen to your answering machine 

00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.484
 The sound of your voice 

00:03:39.707 --> 00:03:41.313
 I can not live without you 

00:03:41.484 --> 00:03:43.380
 I can not sleep at all 

00:03:43.578 --> 00:03:45.306
 I'm crazy for you 

00:03:45.493 --> 00:03:48.914
 Long-distance love 

00:03:52.773 --> 00:03:53.832
 Melanie! 

00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.331
 -Melanie Amaro. -Great job! 

00:03:57.663 --> 00:03:58.671
 Great job. 

00:03:58.974 --> 00:04:01.584
 What has changed for you since the X Factor? 

00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:04.921
 There are thousands of people who ... 

00:04:05.096 --> 00:04:06.872
 love me, carry me. 

00:04:07.523 --> 00:04:08.864
 Thank you very much, you know ... 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.149
 "They stop me on the streets every day, it's incredible. "You're recognized, eh?" 

00:04:12.186 --> 00:04:14.928
 -Yes. -You know exactly what the candidates are going through. 

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:17.659
 He came back where it all began, performing on stage, good for you. 

00:04:17.701 --> 00:04:18.567
 That's awesome. 

00:04:18.757 --> 00:04:22.884
 "I love you, I love you, Simon, LA." By the way, Melanie's new single is too much ... She still loves you. 

00:04:23.173 --> 00:04:26.868
 The new single is "Long Distance" and is now released. Thank you very much, Melanie.
