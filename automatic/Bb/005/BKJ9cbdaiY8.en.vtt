00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
windscreen i think is original so you

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.320 
windscreen i think is original so you
may<00:05:16.700> have<00:05:16.970> some

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
may have some

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.780 
may have some
tiny<00:05:18.960> scratches<00:05:19.410> on<00:05:19.770> here<00:05:20.040> from<00:05:20.310> bugs<00:05:20.550> and

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
tiny scratches on here from bugs and

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:27.050 
tiny scratches on here from bugs and
what<00:05:20.910> math<00:05:21.620> front<00:05:22.620> fender<00:05:23.600> paints<00:05:24.600> perfect

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
what math front fender paints perfect

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.630 
what math front fender paints perfect
the<00:05:27.480> only<00:05:27.660> things<00:05:28.260> like<00:05:28.500> you<00:05:28.860> know<00:05:28.890> to<00:05:29.400> get<00:05:29.520> the

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
the only things like you know to get the

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.170 
the only things like you know to get the
radiator<00:05:30.000> here<00:05:30.360> from<00:05:30.780> all<00:05:30.930> the<00:05:30.990> stone<00:05:31.230> chips

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
radiator here from all the stone chips

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.310 
radiator here from all the stone chips
so<00:05:33.180> if<00:05:33.240> that<00:05:33.480> comes<00:05:33.720> out<00:05:33.930> that<00:05:34.080> could<00:05:34.200> be

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
so if that comes out that could be

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.490 
so if that comes out that could be
painted<00:05:35.420> the<00:05:36.420> only<00:05:36.660> other<00:05:36.810> mark<00:05:37.140> that<00:05:37.350> I<00:05:37.380> know

still<00:05:51.450> perfect<00:05:51.690> after<00:05:52.230> a<00:05:52.260> few<00:05:52.470> months<00:05:53.300> but<00:05:54.300> I

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
still perfect after a few months but I

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.450 
still perfect after a few months but I
mean<00:05:54.540> they<00:05:54.660> only<00:05:54.690> have<00:05:54.960> about<00:05:55.050> 500<00:05:56.010> miles<00:05:56.190> on

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
mean they only have about 500 miles on

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.320 
mean they only have about 500 miles on
them<00:05:56.610> if<00:05:56.760> that<00:05:58.580> nice<00:05:59.580> and<00:05:59.790> clean<00:05:59.970> do<00:06:00.120> some

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
them if that nice and clean do some

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.580 
them if that nice and clean do some
water<00:06:00.510> spots<00:06:00.930> on<00:06:01.140> it

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.010 

so<00:06:05.340> I<00:06:05.370> think<00:06:05.580> that's<00:06:05.970> a<00:06:06.120> pretty<00:06:06.510> good<00:06:06.720> overview

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
so I think that's a pretty good overview

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.230 
so I think that's a pretty good overview
of<00:06:07.230> the<00:06:07.350> whole<00:06:07.470> bike<00:06:10.400> so<00:06:11.400> here's<00:06:11.669> the<00:06:11.790> radiator

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
of the whole bike so here's the radiator

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.500 
of the whole bike so here's the radiator
cap

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:14.510 
cap

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:21.970 
cap
well<00:06:15.510> that's<00:06:15.720> coming<00:06:16.139> up

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:21.980 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.060 

front<00:06:22.980> tires<00:06:23.660> got<00:06:24.660> less<00:06:24.840> than<00:06:24.870> 2,000<00:06:25.590> miles<00:06:25.770> on

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.070 
front tires got less than 2,000 miles on

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:30.380 
front tires got less than 2,000 miles on
it<00:06:26.100> if<00:06:26.460> that<00:06:27.350> and<00:06:28.430> the<00:06:29.430> back<00:06:29.640> tire<00:06:29.940> will<00:06:30.240> need

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.390 
it if that and the back tire will need

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.010 
it if that and the back tire will need
replacing<00:06:30.810> soon<00:06:31.700> don't<00:06:32.700> have<00:06:32.910> a<00:06:32.940> penny<00:06:33.780> or<00:06:33.990> a

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
replacing soon don't have a penny or a

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.640 
replacing soon don't have a penny or a
quarter<00:06:34.470> or<00:06:34.560> anything<00:06:34.710> on<00:06:35.040> me<00:06:35.930> but<00:06:36.930> you<00:06:37.530> can

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
quarter or anything on me but you can

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.660 
quarter or anything on me but you can
see<00:06:37.680> that<00:06:38.040> the<00:06:38.190> sides<00:06:38.430> are<00:06:38.610> still<00:06:39.000> pretty<00:06:39.210> deep

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:40.670 
see that the sides are still pretty deep

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:47.200 
see that the sides are still pretty deep
