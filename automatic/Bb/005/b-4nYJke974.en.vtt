00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.930
 an American and a German 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.240
 Mega companies fight in the distant future 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.620
 the resource of space it abuts 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.420
 the german company on extraterrestrial 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:18.000
 life forms and is of an alien 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.980
 attacks an American mission 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.170
 wants to go to the bottom of the events 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.019
 where only the spaceship on ground 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:31.949
 but amis go groundless for sure anyway 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:34.020
 Well, everything worked out well and then 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.969
 go into the spaceship and meet 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.250
 That's what you see for a millisecond 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.260
 because this abklatsch itself to the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.390
 monster by Hans rudolf giger behaves 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.559
 like a casper figurine hensons 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.559
 Dolls from the dark crystal 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:59.890
 the expedition then finds the over 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:59.890
 200,000 year old artifacts 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.129
 but somehow look like she has 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.680
 someone from a shabby village of 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.799
 Chors Kaltkirchen finally her husband like that 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.720
 The real alien shit looks bent 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.720
 neon tubes in front of a plastic glass of wine 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.880
 at all the whole movie he plays in 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.979
 a cosmos as in a world old and 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.830
 uses a cheap dark studio as 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.409
 only world needs and especially if 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.539
 one in the middle of the film the absolute 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.009
 low point is dipped at once 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:36.670
 Germany's most famous children 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.670
 rapist also klaus kinskis 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:58.960
 he probably has for a few 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.670
 skripte changes even for free with 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.959
 he played the main thing he was allowed on the set 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.250
 everything at graphic not at three 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:05.250
 on the volcano is 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.010
 price 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.510
 and then you realize that the 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.700
 creature small worms used around the 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.500
 humanoid brains will control 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.040
 even an almost entertaining one 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:45.519
 Psycho games fanned the mosque 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.680
 usually only seconds later from extreme 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.900
 cheap effects become pronounced 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:55.720
 instead of masks because we have the art blood in 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:58.090
 the face and very good as me with 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.739
 a bÃ¶ller in the melon costumes 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.250
 cameraman after a night of drinking 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.139
 it could not be cheaper 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.730
 and also the fighting scenes with the upper 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:08.859
 german claus kinski are like that 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.689
 Abyssal level as medial 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:14.370
 slaughter of the very successful 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:14.370
 gaucho singing our world champion 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.740
 and oh wonder just before the end sees 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.620
 then you have this creature as you with 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.630
 wants to put an end to an electric shock 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.660
 an electrifying end looks different 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.660
 out 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.670
 one copies not only alien 1 but 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.370
 a second final went n2 too 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.030
 on top of that I still here 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.030
 wants to show in short 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.459
 the pilot kick the creature because of the 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.040
 attached bomb from the spaceship wm 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.750
 fight for air is in the truest sense 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.420
 There is no air in the word 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.650
 planets and what an aerial fight 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.480
 should that be nice 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.480
 I also have the air gone 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.609
 i do not know what klaus kinski in 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.139
 I have to look for this b movie and me 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.610
 Also do not know if the production costs 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.020
 the 100000 dollar brand ever 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.850
 but have exceeded what 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.850
 definitely white is that creature one 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.800
 such a cheap copy of aliens 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.460
 that I only with the following scene 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.460
 can answer 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.530
 everytime again a little movie 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.060
 I hope you liked it 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.110
 I had their problems with mine 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.310
 That's why laptop has it all 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.660
 had lasted longer bit of a 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.400
 a little bit more intense I want too 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.930
 I do not even care 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.070
 every time on show and until 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.070
 there mio
