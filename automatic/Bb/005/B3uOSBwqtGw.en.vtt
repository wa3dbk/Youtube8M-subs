00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
out and told me about it as I was

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.550 
out and told me about it as I was
painting<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.630> anyway<00:00:27.960> here<00:00:28.140> we<00:00:28.199> are<00:00:28.230> I'm

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
painting this anyway here we are I'm

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.410 
painting this anyway here we are I'm
just<00:00:29.240> laying<00:00:30.240> out<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.869> rough<00:00:31.850> sketch<00:00:32.850> as<00:00:33.239> it

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
just laying out the rough sketch as it

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.490 
just laying out the rough sketch as it
were<00:00:33.570> with<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.050> brush<00:00:34.640> rough<00:00:35.640> impression

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
were with the brush rough impression

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.220 
were with the brush rough impression
trying<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.590> get<00:00:37.710> things<00:00:37.890> balanced<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:39.230> in

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
trying to get things balanced and in

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.459 
trying to get things balanced and in
proportion<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:41.010> right<00:00:41.340> place<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:42.140> the<00:00:43.140> idea

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
proportion in right place and the idea

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.569 
proportion in right place and the idea
of<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.100> try<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:44.940> capture<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.510> pond

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
of this is to try and capture the pond

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.510 
of this is to try and capture the pond
which<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.760> rarely<00:00:48.030> here<00:00:48.500> but<00:00:49.500> as<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.100> said<00:00:50.160> due

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
which is rarely here but as I said due

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.930 
which is rarely here but as I said due
to<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.730> excessive<00:00:51.000> rain<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.510> here<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.670> so<00:00:53.670> I'm

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
to the excessive rain is here and so I'm

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.360 
to the excessive rain is here and so I'm
laying<00:00:54.149> this<00:00:54.360> out<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.710> Minster<00:00:56.129> will<00:00:56.250> be

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
laying this out and the Minster will be

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.389 
laying this out and the Minster will be
in<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.550> distance<00:00:57.800> there<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.070> it's<00:00:59.219> just

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
in the distance there it is it's just

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.049 
in the distance there it is it's just
starting<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.760> appear<00:01:00.559> and<00:01:01.559> this<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.399> all<00:01:02.670> done

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
starting to appear and this is all done

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.460 
starting to appear and this is all done
using<00:01:03.510> an<00:01:04.019> iPod<00:01:04.500> touch<00:01:04.799> on<00:01:05.129> stop<00:01:05.519> motion<00:01:06.470> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
using an iPod touch on stop motion the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.899 
using an iPod touch on stop motion the
earlier<00:01:07.770> photograph<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.430> scene<00:01:08.670> was<00:01:08.850> also

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
earlier photograph of the scene was also

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.340 
earlier photograph of the scene was also
a<00:01:09.299> saying<00:01:09.540> with<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.780> iPod<00:01:10.110> Touch<00:01:10.290> which

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
a saying with the iPod Touch which

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.710 
a saying with the iPod Touch which
wasn't<00:01:10.970> as<00:01:11.970> good<00:01:12.150> at<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.360> could<00:01:12.479> be<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.659> guess

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
wasn't as good at it could be I guess

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.499 
wasn't as good at it could be I guess
but<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.610> just<00:01:14.610> want<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.850> show<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.150> picture<00:01:15.299> of

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
but I just want to show you a picture of

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.140 
but I just want to show you a picture of
the<00:01:15.570> scene<00:01:15.750> before<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.110> started<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.150> so

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
the scene before I started this and so

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.660 
the scene before I started this and so
here<00:01:18.360> we<00:01:18.450> go<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:18.960> there's<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.920> sort<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.250> reddish

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
here we go so there's a sort of reddish

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.120 
here we go so there's a sort of reddish
tint<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.689> sky<00:01:22.369> which<00:01:23.369> became<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.790> bit<00:01:25.130> blue

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
tint to the sky which became a bit blue

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.020 
tint to the sky which became a bit blue
and<00:01:26.790> dark<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:28.430> massive<00:01:29.430> clouds<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.939> it

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
and dark and massive clouds and it

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.679 
and dark and massive clouds and it
formed<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.990> right-hand<00:01:31.560> side<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:32.689> while

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
formed on the right-hand side and while

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.450 
formed on the right-hand side and while
I<00:01:33.720> was<00:01:33.840> painting<00:01:34.079> this<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.470> noticed<00:01:34.920> some<00:01:35.100> very

faint<00:01:35.790> vapour<00:01:36.420> trails<00:01:36.780> from<00:01:37.079> planes<00:01:37.490> which<00:01:38.490> I

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
faint vapour trails from planes which I

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.450 
faint vapour trails from planes which I
hadn't<00:01:38.939> sort<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.270> put<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.729> did<00:01:43.130> but<00:01:44.130> the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
hadn't sort of put in and I did but the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.580 
hadn't sort of put in and I did but the
main<00:01:44.610> challenge<00:01:44.939> here<00:01:45.149> was<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.840> pond<00:01:46.380> in

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
main challenge here was the the pond in

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.960 
main challenge here was the the pond in
front<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.540> fence<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.720> broken<00:01:49.110> fence

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
front of the fence the broken fence

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.010 
front of the fence the broken fence
there<00:01:50.970> was<00:01:51.000> some<00:01:51.299> tussocks<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.930> dead<00:01:52.710> grass<00:01:54.020> at

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
there was some tussocks of dead grass at

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.429 
there was some tussocks of dead grass at
the<00:01:55.049> foot<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.530> posts<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:58.100> it<00:01:59.100> shows<00:01:59.430> the

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
the foot of the posts and it shows the

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.480 
the foot of the posts and it shows the
vastness<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:02.040> east<00:02:02.189> yorkshire

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
countryside there are plans to have a

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.630 
countryside there are plans to have a
bypass<00:02:08.129> around<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.580> south<00:02:08.849> of<00:02:09.060> Beverly<00:02:09.450> and

bypass around the south of Beverly and
unfortunately<00:02:11.640> some<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.360> these<00:02:12.510> views<00:02:12.810> will

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
unfortunately some of these views will

unfortunately some of these views will
disappeared<00:02:14.040> this<00:02:14.250> is<00:02:14.400> one<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.790> reason

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
disappeared this is one of the reason

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.020 
disappeared this is one of the reason
why<00:02:15.090> I'm<00:02:15.300> desperate<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.230> try<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:16.590> get<00:02:16.710> these

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
why I'm desperate to try and get these

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.970 
why I'm desperate to try and get these
down<00:02:18.030> an<00:02:18.330> impression<00:02:18.960> of<00:02:19.020> these<00:02:19.200> down<00:02:19.560> so<00:02:19.770> this

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
down an impression of these down so this

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:20.780 
down an impression of these down so this
is<00:02:20.040> very<00:02:20.310> much

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
is very much

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
precise in some respects not every blade

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
of grass or anything like that but just

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.920 
of grass or anything like that but just
an<00:02:32.100> impression<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:34.220> I<00:02:35.540> moved<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.660> camera

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
an impression and I moved the camera

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.960 
an impression and I moved the camera
slightly<00:02:37.350> round<00:02:38.120> to<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.240> side<00:02:39.660> here<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.970> on

slightly round to the side here and on
reflection<00:02:42.300> I<00:02:42.690> wish<00:02:42.840> I'd<00:02:42.960> kept<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.350> where<00:02:43.500> it

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
reflection I wish I'd kept it where it

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.830 
reflection I wish I'd kept it where it
was<00:02:43.860> but<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.670> didn't<00:02:45.120> think<00:02:45.240> you<00:02:45.360> could<00:02:45.510> see<00:02:45.720> it

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
was but I didn't think you could see it

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:55.340 
was but I didn't think you could see it
