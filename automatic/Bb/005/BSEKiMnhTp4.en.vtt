00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
meter at 200 same as my camera ok give

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.670 
meter at 200 same as my camera ok give
me<00:01:07.460> 250<00:01:08.460> at<00:01:08.970> f/4<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:09.900> what<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.080> think<00:01:10.290> will<00:01:10.560> be

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
me 250 at f/4 so what I think will be

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.520 
me 250 at f/4 so what I think will be
good<00:01:10.710> around<00:01:10.979> 200<00:01:11.640> will<00:01:11.820> check<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.659> not<00:01:13.350> too

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
good around 200 will check that not too

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.950 
good around 200 will check that not too
much<00:01:13.650> depth<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.100> field<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.520> we<00:01:14.549> keep<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.509> war

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
much depth of field so we keep the war

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.429 
much depth of field so we keep the war
breaks<00:01:16.290> out<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:17.189> focus<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.869> I'm<00:01:18.869> working<00:01:19.259> with

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
breaks out of focus and I'm working with

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.770 
breaks out of focus and I'm working with
the<00:01:19.560> d3x<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.580> 7210<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.509> think<00:01:21.689> we<00:01:21.750> have

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
the d3x and the 7210 so I think we have

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.590 
the d3x and the 7210 so I think we have
a<00:01:21.900> nice<00:01:22.259> team<00:01:22.680> since<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.759> thing<00:01:23.970> will<00:01:24.119> make

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
a nice team since the thing will make

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.840 
a nice team since the thing will make
the<00:01:24.720> first<00:01:24.960> shoot<00:01:25.680> just<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.400> check<00:01:26.549> when<00:01:26.729> it

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
the first shoot just to check when it

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.149 
the first shoot just to check when it
give<00:01:27.060> as<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.240> result<00:01:27.799> just<00:01:28.799> bring<00:01:29.040> your

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
give as a result just bring your

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.100 
give as a result just bring your
shoulder<00:01:29.460> just<00:01:29.670> turn<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.180> bit<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.750> me<00:01:30.900> yeah

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
shoulder just turn a bit to me yeah

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.170 
shoulder just turn a bit to me yeah
that's<00:01:31.439> like<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.799> we<00:01:32.159> have<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.340> nice<00:01:32.520> light<00:01:32.820> so

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
that's like that we have a nice light so

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.580 
that's like that we have a nice light so
quite<00:01:33.509> suffered<00:01:33.960> because<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.380> light<00:01:34.560> is

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
quite suffered because the light is

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.920 
quite suffered because the light is
coming<00:01:34.950> from<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.280> side<00:01:35.610> we<00:01:36.360> still<00:01:36.570> have<00:01:36.689> nice

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
coming from the side we still have nice

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.100 
coming from the side we still have nice
contrast<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.130> also<00:01:38.549> nice<00:01:38.759> textures<00:01:39.509> but<00:01:40.049> I

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
contrast and also nice textures but I

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.490 
contrast and also nice textures but I
think<00:01:40.290> we'll<00:01:40.470> be<00:01:40.500> using<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.280> reflector<00:01:41.880> some

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
think we'll be using a reflector some

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.170 
think we'll be using a reflector some
justice<00:01:43.500> get<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.070> reflector<00:01:44.670> I'll<00:01:44.820> be<00:01:44.939> back<00:01:45.060> in

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
justice get a reflector I'll be back in

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.810 
justice get a reflector I'll be back in
a<00:01:45.240> second<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:45.659> all<00:01:45.899> being<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.820> silver

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
a second so all being the silver

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.730 
a second so all being the silver
reflector<00:01:48.299> it's<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.540> light<00:01:48.720> panel<00:01:49.079> from<00:01:49.259> sort

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
reflector it's a light panel from sort

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.840 
reflector it's a light panel from sort
of<00:01:49.829> Lexus<00:01:50.299> 42<00:01:51.299> x<00:01:51.479> 72-inch<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.560> quite<00:01:52.979> big<00:01:53.310> to

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
of Lexus 42 x 72-inch so quite big to

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.520 
of Lexus 42 x 72-inch so quite big to
have<00:01:54.000> nice<00:01:54.240> fill<00:01:54.630> light<00:01:54.840> so<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.170> can<00:01:55.229> see

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
have nice fill light so you can see

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.580 
have nice fill light so you can see
directly<00:01:55.649> not<00:01:56.159> on<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:57.540> side<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.140> your<00:01:58.350> face

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
directly not on the side of your face

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.770 
directly not on the side of your face
and<00:01:58.890> also<00:01:59.189> likely<00:01:59.399> be<00:01:59.640> on<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.850> ice<00:02:00.000> where<00:02:00.329> more

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
and also likely be on the ice where more

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.440 
and also likely be on the ice where more
kick<00:02:01.020> like<00:02:01.229> than<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.829> it's<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:03.180> think<00:02:03.240> it

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
kick like than that and it's I think it

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.510 
kick like than that and it's I think it
will<00:02:03.630> be<00:02:03.689> ready<00:02:04.140> if<00:02:04.409> it's<00:02:04.590> too<00:02:04.770> strong<00:02:05.040> or<00:02:05.250> put

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
will be ready if it's too strong or put

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.190 
will be ready if it's too strong or put
it<00:02:05.579> on<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.850> white<00:02:06.060> side<00:02:06.090> but<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.780> think<00:02:07.020> now<00:02:07.140> the

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
it on the white side but I think now the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.660 
it on the white side but I think now the
silver<00:02:07.680> side<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:08.009> good<00:02:08.160> specially<00:02:08.489> because

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
silver side is good specially because

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.820 
silver side is good specially because
the<00:02:08.910> light<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.119> quite<00:02:09.539> soft<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.200> we're<00:02:10.709> ready

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
the light is quite soft so we're ready

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.470 
the light is quite soft so we're ready
to<00:02:11.009> show<00:02:11.340> just<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:11.940> got

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
to show just so I got

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.970 
to show just so I got
yeah<00:02:13.480> oh<00:02:13.720> yeah<00:02:13.870> that's<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.260> big<00:02:14.440> difference<00:02:14.620> a

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.820 
very big difference that's good yeah a
good<00:02:19.180> thing<00:02:19.390> when<00:02:19.570> using<00:02:20.020> their<00:02:20.230> reflector<00:02:20.710> is

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
good thing when using their reflector is

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.010 
good thing when using their reflector is
it<00:02:20.980> I<00:02:21.130> don't<00:02:21.340> have<00:02:21.550> to<00:02:21.880> write<00:02:22.420> with<00:02:22.570> that<00:02:22.780> big

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
it I don't have to write with that big

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.790 
it I don't have to write with that big
diffuser<00:02:23.800> again<00:02:24.400> from<00:02:24.670> photoflex<00:02:25.060> it's<00:02:25.390> a<00:02:25.800> 77

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
diffuser again from photoflex it's a 77

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
soft light we'll just have to adjust the

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.020 
soft light we'll just have to adjust the
speed<00:02:35.290> or<00:02:35.470> Jabberjaw<00:02:36.010> because<00:02:36.310> we<00:02:36.460> lose<00:02:36.610> some

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
speed or Jabberjaw because we lose some

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.970 
speed or Jabberjaw because we lose some
light<00:02:37.300> and<00:02:37.570> that's<00:02:38.110> a<00:02:38.230> good<00:02:38.350> thing<00:02:38.410> here<00:02:38.770> with
