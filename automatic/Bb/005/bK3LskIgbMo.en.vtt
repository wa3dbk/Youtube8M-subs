00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
you can just basically ripped the brain

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.959 
you can just basically ripped the brain
off<00:00:58.620> your<00:00:58.829> guitar<00:00:59.129> hero<00:00:59.399> world<00:00:59.609> tour<00:00:59.789> set<00:01:00.210> and

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
brain and you're good to go and no need

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.219 
brain and you're good to go and no need
to<00:01:07.530> have<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.010> big<00:01:08.820> plastic<00:01:09.180> drum<00:01:09.720> set<00:01:09.960> laying

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
to have the big plastic drum set laying

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.910 
to have the big plastic drum set laying
around<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:11.960> just<00:01:12.960> mount<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.470> your<00:01:13.590> set

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
around and just mount it to your set

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.679 
around and just mount it to your set
kind<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.280> like<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.580> did<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.290> you're<00:01:16.290> good<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.470> go

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
kind of like I did and you're good to go

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:19.850 
kind of like I did and you're good to go
the<00:01:18.689> g5<00:01:19.080> itself<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> little<00:01:19.770> more

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
the g5 itself is a little more

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.950 
the g5 itself is a little more
complicated<00:01:20.250> than<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.060> MIDI

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
complicated than just the MIDI

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.590 
complicated than just the MIDI
connection<00:01:22.500> on<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.710> box<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.600> definitely

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
connection on the box so definitely

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.109 
connection on the box so definitely
check<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.869> out<00:01:25.049> if<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.350> get<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> chance<00:01:25.770> um<00:01:26.189> my

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
check that out if you get a chance um my

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.830 
check that out if you get a chance um my
j5<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.780> custom-built<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.860> it's<00:01:29.790> got<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.390> lot

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
j5 is custom-built so it's got a lot

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.600 
j5 is custom-built so it's got a lot
more<00:01:30.900> function<00:01:31.500> well<00:01:31.619> not<00:01:31.890> more<00:01:32.100> functions

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
more function well not more functions

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.800 
more function well not more functions
but<00:01:33.770> it's<00:01:34.770> built<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.509> work<00:01:36.509> slightly

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
but it's built to work slightly

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.590 
but it's built to work slightly
different<00:01:37.380> than<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.530> normal<00:01:37.590> j5<00:01:38.280> it's<00:01:38.700> got

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
different than a normal j5 it's got

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.660 
different than a normal j5 it's got
boost<00:01:39.900> since<00:01:40.380> stuff<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:40.979> because<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.490> was

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
boost since stuff in it because I was

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.670 
boost since stuff in it because I was
running<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.180> many<00:01:42.329> cables<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.110> splitters<00:01:43.530> and

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
running so many cables and splitters and

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.499 
running so many cables and splitters and
stuff<00:01:43.920> like<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:44.729> it's<00:01:45.360> actually

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
stuff like that so it's actually

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.170 
stuff like that so it's actually
self-powered<00:01:46.470> plus<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.890> power<00:01:47.159> batteries<00:01:47.850> on

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
self-powered plus the power batteries on

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.440 
self-powered plus the power batteries on
it<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.630> know<00:01:48.720> just<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.140> run<00:01:49.680> normal<00:01:50.270> I'm<00:01:51.270> not

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
it you know just to run normal I'm not

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.609 
it you know just to run normal I'm not
going<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.689> get<00:01:51.780> into<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.049> whole<00:01:52.140> thing<00:01:52.439> but

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
going to get into the whole thing but

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.590 
going to get into the whole thing but
it's<00:01:52.829> still<00:01:52.860> hooked<00:01:53.189> up<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:54.390> does

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
it's still hooked up and it's it does

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.800 
it's still hooked up and it's it does
