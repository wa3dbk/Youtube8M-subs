last relegation it was kind of it was a

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.130

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
last season wasn't it when users I think

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.790 
last season wasn't it when users I think
Christmas<00:00:49.920> really<00:00:50.930> realistically<00:00:51.930> but<00:00:52.680> then

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
Christmas really realistically but then

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.770 
Christmas really realistically but then
when<00:00:52.920> we<00:00:53.010> beat<00:00:53.190> Liverpool<00:00:53.430> it's<00:00:54.120> all<00:00:54.360> give<00:00:54.629> us

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
when we beat Liverpool it's all give us

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.139 
when we beat Liverpool it's all give us
a<00:00:54.809> little<00:00:55.559> bit<00:00:55.739> whore<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.489> glimmer<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.879> all

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
a little bit whore the glimmer of all

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:04.399 
a little bit whore the glimmer of all
but<00:00:57.930> then<00:01:01.609> I<00:01:02.609> suppose<00:01:03.000> we<00:01:03.359> only<00:01:03.570> saw<00:01:03.780> off<00:01:03.930> them

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
but then I suppose we only saw off them

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.320 
but then I suppose we only saw off them
given<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.890> lifetime<00:01:05.309> by<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.549> fact<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:05.909> hole

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
given a lifetime by the fact that hole

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.840 
given a lifetime by the fact that hole
and<00:01:06.799> Sunland<00:01:07.799> were<00:01:07.920> playing<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.369> badly<00:01:08.610> as

and Sunland were playing so badly as

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.190 
and Sunland were playing so badly as

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
well yeah my god the beginning of the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.140 
well yeah my god the beginning of the
season<00:01:13.380> also<00:01:13.740> wanted<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.220> do<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.490> was<00:01:14.610> control

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
season also wanted to do it was control

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.030 
season also wanted to do it was control
and<00:01:15.990> we<00:01:16.110> nearly<00:01:16.290> did<00:01:16.619> yeah<00:01:17.960> I<00:01:18.960> remember<00:01:19.860> that

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
and we nearly did yeah I remember that

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.190 
and we nearly did yeah I remember that
make<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:20.490> game<00:01:20.790> was<00:01:21.030> was<00:01:21.390> kosher<00:01:21.720> with<00:01:22.049> me

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
make a so game was was kosher with me

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.130 
make a so game was was kosher with me
when<00:01:22.710> we<00:01:22.799> took<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.040> lead<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.490> looked<00:01:23.700> like<00:01:24.140> after

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
when we took a lead it looked like after

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.679 
when we took a lead it looked like after
all<00:01:25.380> yeah<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.159> thought<00:01:26.520> if<00:01:26.700> we<00:01:26.729> won<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.240> one<00:01:27.450> we

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
all yeah I thought if we won that one we

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.160 
all yeah I thought if we won that one we
would<00:01:27.869> have<00:01:27.990> been<00:01:28.140> safe<00:01:28.439> but<00:01:29.369> obviously

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
would have been safe but obviously

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.980 
would have been safe but obviously
wasn't<00:01:31.170> meant<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.500> be<00:01:31.970> and<00:01:32.970> what<00:01:33.150> about<00:01:33.329> this

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
wasn't meant to be and what about this

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.230 
wasn't meant to be and what about this
season<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.560> sieve

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
season of a sieve

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.580 
season of a sieve
we're<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.479> championship<00:01:36.659> now<00:01:38.240> we've<00:01:39.240> lost

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
we're in the championship now we've lost

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.670 
we're in the championship now we've lost
steel<00:01:40.590> diamond<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:42.060> looks<00:01:42.240> like<00:01:42.680> sunjai

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
steel diamond and it looks like sunjai

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.910 
steel diamond and it looks like sunjai
and<00:01:43.920> Mito<00:01:44.430> as<00:01:44.700> well<00:01:44.960> so<00:01:45.960> it's<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.290> it's<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.649> fresh

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
and Mito as well so it's a it's a fresh

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.270 
and Mito as well so it's a it's a fresh
start<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.579> few<00:01:48.360> new<00:01:48.540> faces<00:01:48.750> with<00:01:49.140> off<00:01:49.290> but<00:01:50.250> I

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
start a few new faces with off but I

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.319 
start a few new faces with off but I
suppose<00:01:50.460> that's<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.700> point<00:01:50.850> we<00:01:51.030> need<00:01:51.149> some

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
suppose that's the point we need some

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.420 
suppose that's the point we need some
new<00:01:51.360> faces<00:01:51.630> don't<00:01:51.960> win<00:01:52.079> oh<00:01:52.200> yeah<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.920> think<00:01:53.070> they

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
new faces don't win oh yeah I think they

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.700 
new faces don't win oh yeah I think they
need<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.549> freshen<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:54.000> up<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.240> bit<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:55.049> they

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
need to freshen it up a bit and they

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.950 
need to freshen it up a bit and they
need<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:56.040> see<00:01:56.250> who<00:01:56.460> works<00:01:56.729> well<00:01:57.030> together<00:01:57.450> I

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
need to see who works well together I

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.090 
need to see who works well together I
think

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
think

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.109 
think
Emilie's<00:01:59.460> could<00:01:59.939> be<00:02:00.060> very<00:02:00.329> good<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:01.079> season

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
Emilie's could be very good this season

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.260 
Emilie's could be very good this season
and<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:04.049> don't<00:02:04.590> know<00:02:04.950> much<00:02:05.100> about<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.790> new<00:02:06.000> ones

games<00:02:27.200> we<00:02:28.200> might<00:02:28.380> win<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.590> few<00:02:28.800> games<00:02:28.860> this

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
games we might win a few games this

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
Carling Cup final but we might actually

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.510 
Carling Cup final but we might actually
win<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:44.040> league

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.000 
I'm assume we're going to I don't know
but<00:02:47.280> we<00:02:47.640> might<00:02:47.820> actually<00:02:47.970> win<00:02:48.390> something

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
but we might actually win something

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.230 
but we might actually win something
other<00:02:50.010> than<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.310> game<00:02:50.580> every<00:02:50.910> now<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.180> again

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
other than a game every now and again

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.610 
other than a game every now and again
and<00:02:51.420> finish<00:02:51.810> in<00:02:51.959> 13<00:02:55.370> do<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.430> think<00:02:56.610> that<00:02:56.760> some

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
and finish in 13 do you think that some

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.750 
and finish in 13 do you think that some
last<00:02:58.620> season<00:02:58.920> as<00:02:59.010> well<00:02:59.130> as<00:02:59.190> not<00:02:59.370> scoring<00:02:59.640> goals

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
last season as well as not scoring goals

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.449 
last season as well as not scoring goals
we<00:03:00.630> conceded<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.320> lot<00:03:01.470> of<00:03:01.590> really<00:03:01.920> bad<00:03:02.160> girls

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
we conceded a lot of really bad girls

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.680 
we conceded a lot of really bad girls
didn't<00:03:02.820> we<00:03:03.950> did<00:03:05.000> we<00:03:06.000> look<00:03:06.150> at<00:03:06.270> stronger<00:03:06.630> in

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
didn't we did we look at stronger in

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:16.070 
didn't we did we look at stronger in
defence<00:03:06.990> in<00:03:07.350> pre-season<00:03:07.890> you<00:03:14.180> think<00:03:15.180> so

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
defence in pre-season you think so

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:29.560 
defence in pre-season you think so
that's<00:03:16.860> obviously<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.430> point<00:03:27.950> never<00:03:28.950> changed

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
that's obviously a point never changed

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.509 
that's obviously a point never changed
hardly<00:03:30.570> anyone<00:03:31.080> in<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.320> squad<00:03:31.769> throughout

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
hardly anyone in the squad throughout

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.720 
hardly anyone in the squad throughout

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
the whole season so try and do something

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.910 
the whole season so try and do something
like<00:03:35.970> that<00:03:36.180> what<00:03:37.050> about<00:03:37.080> the<00:03:37.260> managers<00:03:37.709> used

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
like that what about the managers used

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.040 
like that what about the managers used
to<00:03:38.040> not<00:03:38.190> faith<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.700> go<00:03:39.150> south<00:03:39.420> period<00:03:39.810> sir

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.490 
yeah I really do like him and I think
what<00:03:44.280> it<00:03:44.400> did<00:03:44.580> stepping<00:03:45.120> up<00:03:45.239> from<00:03:46.019> just<00:03:46.230> being

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
what it did stepping up from just being

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.070 
what it did stepping up from just being
a<00:03:46.800> player<00:03:47.160> to<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:48.030> manager<00:03:48.480> thought<00:03:48.780> that<00:03:48.959> was

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
a player to the manager thought that was

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.759 
a player to the manager thought that was
admirable<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:50.239> I<00:03:51.239> do<00:03:51.840> I<00:03:51.989> faith<00:03:52.320> in<00:03:52.560> him<00:03:52.680> I

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
admirable and I do I faith in him I

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.800 
admirable and I do I faith in him I
think<00:03:52.830> one<00:03:53.250> day<00:03:53.459> he's<00:03:53.640> will<00:03:53.850> be<00:03:53.970> very<00:03:54.420> very

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
think one day he's will be very very

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.470 
think one day he's will be very very
much<00:03:55.459> do<00:03:56.459> you<00:03:56.519> think<00:03:56.580> you<00:03:56.790> have<00:03:56.970> learned<00:03:57.209> from

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
much do you think you have learned from

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.020 
much do you think you have learned from
the<00:03:58.440> experience<00:03:58.890> of<00:03:58.950> going<00:03:59.100> down<00:03:59.310> a<00:03:59.340> season<00:03:59.820> I

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
the experience of going down a season I

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.970 
the experience of going down a season I
think<00:04:02.060> everybody<00:04:03.060> good<00:04:03.410> not<00:04:04.410> saying<00:04:04.680> that<00:04:04.860> we

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
think everybody good not saying that we

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.789 
think everybody good not saying that we
wanted<00:04:05.340> to<00:04:05.519> obviously<00:04:05.970> but<00:04:06.350> it's<00:04:07.350> time<00:04:07.590> to

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
wanted to obviously but it's time to

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.880 
wanted to obviously but it's time to
take<00:04:08.010> stock<00:04:08.190> is<00:04:08.489> in<00:04:08.640> there<00:04:08.790> and<00:04:09.440> like<00:04:10.440> Garth<00:04:10.769> to

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
take stock is in there and like Garth to

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.840 
take stock is in there and like Garth to
probably<00:04:11.160> say<00:04:11.310> himself<00:04:11.640> to<00:04:11.790> rebuild<00:04:12.209> so<00:04:13.850> do

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
probably say himself to rebuild so do

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:15.830 
probably say himself to rebuild so do
you<00:04:14.910> think<00:04:14.940> it's<00:04:15.150> important<00:04:15.450> to<00:04:15.510> get<00:04:15.570> off<00:04:15.690> to<00:04:15.810> a

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
you think it's important to get off to a

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.190 
you think it's important to get off to a
good<00:04:15.930> start<00:04:15.989> then

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
good start then

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.710 
good start then
I<00:04:17.670> think<00:04:18.670> so<00:04:18.850> what<00:04:19.060> we're<00:04:19.210> off<00:04:19.330> to<00:04:19.540> a<00:04:19.570> good

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
I think so what we're off to a good

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.350 
I think so what we're off to a good
start<00:04:19.780> last<00:04:20.110> season<00:04:20.710> and<00:04:20.890> look<00:04:21.850> what<00:04:22.030> happened

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
start last season and look what happened

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.810 
start last season and look what happened
so<00:04:22.690> you<00:04:23.140> just<00:04:23.740> take<00:04:23.950> it<00:04:24.100> as<00:04:24.190> it<00:04:24.220> comes<00:04:24.370> down

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
so you just take it as it comes down

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.330 
so you just take it as it comes down
yeah<00:04:25.410> and<00:04:26.410> you've<00:04:26.530> got<00:04:26.650> prediction<00:04:27.010> for<00:04:27.130> the

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
yeah and you've got prediction for the

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.860 
yeah and you've got prediction for the
first<00:04:27.550> game<00:04:27.760> because<00:04:28.030> we<00:04:28.330> started<00:04:28.630> Friday

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
first game because we started Friday

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:38.940 
first game because we started Friday
don't<00:04:33.990> think<00:04:34.990> it'll<00:04:35.170> be<00:04:36.210> two<00:04:37.210> two<00:04:37.800> already

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
don't think it'll be two two already

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.270 
don't think it'll be two two already
yeah<00:04:39.160> Sheffield<00:04:39.790> United<00:04:40.120> to<00:04:41.010> strong

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
yeah Sheffield United to strong

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.380 
yeah Sheffield United to strong
he<00:04:43.210> thinks<00:04:43.450> good<00:04:43.600> testing<00:04:43.990> starts<00:04:45.180> one<00:04:46.180> of<00:04:46.300> the

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
he thinks good testing starts one of the

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.810 
he thinks good testing starts one of the
stronger<00:04:46.750> teams<00:04:46.960> in<00:04:47.170> the<00:04:47.230> division<00:04:47.380> so<00:04:47.980> it's

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
stronger teams in the division so it's

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.460 
stronger teams in the division so it's
not<00:04:48.970> an<00:04:49.090> easy<00:04:49.300> game<00:04:49.690> to<00:04:49.750> start

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
not an easy game to start

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.810 
not an easy game to start
although<00:04:50.800> the<00:04:50.920> property<00:04:51.220> won't<00:04:51.310> be<00:04:51.460> any<00:04:51.610> easy

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
although the property won't be any easy

00:04:51.820 --> 00:05:00.450 
although the property won't be any easy
games<00:04:57.480> and<00:04:58.480> you<00:04:59.020> think<00:04:59.230> that<00:04:59.410> we<00:05:00.100> will<00:05:00.220> find

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
games and you think that we will find

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.260 
games and you think that we will find
our<00:05:00.640> feet<00:05:00.760> quite<00:05:01.030> quickly<00:05:01.240> I<00:05:02.100> hope<00:05:03.100> so<00:05:03.400> I<00:05:03.730> think

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
our feet quite quickly I hope so I think

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:18.360 
our feet quite quickly I hope so I think
we<00:05:04.570> should<00:05:04.600> do<00:05:15.510> so<00:05:16.510> i<00:05:17.100> optimistic<00:05:18.100> then<00:05:18.220> go

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
we should do so i optimistic then go

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:19.950 
we should do so i optimistic then go
into<00:05:18.520> the<00:05:18.610> season<00:05:18.970> do<00:05:19.210> you<00:05:19.300> think<00:05:19.480> you<00:05:19.750> think

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
into the season do you think you think

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:23.580 
it could be obviously where we're in the
championship<00:05:22.690> how<00:05:23.020> do<00:05:23.080> you<00:05:23.200> think<00:05:23.320> it<00:05:23.470> could

be
I<00:05:30.390> don't<00:05:31.390> think<00:05:31.450> we'll<00:05:31.690> walk<00:05:31.930> it<00:05:32.200> I<00:05:32.580> don't<00:05:33.580> even

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.810 
I don't think we'll walk it I don't even
know<00:05:33.880> if<00:05:34.000> we're<00:05:34.120> gonna<00:05:34.210> win<00:05:34.450> it<00:05:34.600> but<00:05:35.410> I<00:05:35.470> think

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.790 
the very least we'll be in the playoffs
