00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
feel good about themselves really is

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.000

probably<00:00:43.520> my<00:00:44.120> biggest<00:00:44.300> job<00:00:44.989> as<00:00:45.260> their<00:00:45.530> mom<00:00:45.770> and

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
probably my biggest job as their mom and

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.800 
probably my biggest job as their mom and
and<00:00:46.160> you<00:00:46.280> believe<00:00:46.579> that<00:00:47.060> when<00:00:47.239> it<00:00:47.390> comes<00:00:47.630> to

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:47.810 
and you believe that when it comes to

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.840 
and you believe that when it comes to
our<00:00:47.900> kids<00:00:48.170> it's<00:00:48.380> all<00:00:48.590> about<00:00:48.980> self-image<00:00:49.579> and

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
our kids it's all about self-image and

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.250 
our kids it's all about self-image and
making<00:00:50.120> sure<00:00:50.270> they<00:00:50.420> have<00:00:50.570> a<00:00:50.600> positive

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
making sure they have a positive

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.740 
making sure they have a positive
self-image<00:00:51.610> but<00:00:52.610> I<00:00:52.640> think<00:00:53.090> that's<00:00:53.300> probably<00:00:53.450> a

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
self-image but I think that's probably a

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.150 
self-image but I think that's probably a
big<00:00:53.899> problem<00:00:54.320> these<00:00:54.440> days<00:00:54.500> wouldn't<00:00:54.950> you<00:00:55.040> say

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
big problem these days wouldn't you say

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.040

what<00:00:55.370> can<00:00:55.489> we<00:00:55.550> do<00:00:55.850> to<00:00:55.970> make<00:00:56.149> sure<00:00:56.180> that<00:00:56.989> our

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
what can we do to make sure that our

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.690 
what can we do to make sure that our
kids<00:00:57.410> get<00:00:57.620> on<00:00:57.770> the<00:00:57.890> right<00:00:58.010> track<00:00:58.250> and<00:00:58.370> why<00:00:58.640> do

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
kids get on the right track and why do

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.670 
kids get on the right track and why do
you<00:00:58.940> think<00:00:59.210> it<00:00:59.329> is<00:00:59.480> that<00:00:59.510> the<00:01:00.020> self-image<00:01:00.559> of

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
you think it is that the self-image of

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.889 
you think it is that the self-image of
most<00:01:00.890> kids<00:01:01.070> today<00:01:01.220> really<00:01:01.670> isn't<00:01:02.059> as<00:01:02.420> positive

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
it's all the difference in the world and

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.909 
it's all the difference in the world and
too<00:04:01.370> often<00:04:01.790> a<00:04:01.910> child<00:04:02.150> gets<00:04:02.389> four<00:04:03.019> A's<00:04:03.200> and<00:04:03.500> a

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:03.919 
too often a child gets four A's and a

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:05.589 
too often a child gets four A's and a
seat<00:04:04.160> we're<00:04:04.700> going<00:04:04.819> to<00:04:04.880> focus<00:04:05.000> on<00:04:05.269> the<00:04:05.389> scene

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
seat we're going to focus on the scene

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.990 
seat we're going to focus on the scene
and<00:04:05.950> we<00:04:06.950> don't<00:04:07.160> realize<00:04:07.579> the<00:04:07.609> great

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
and we don't realize the great

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.089 
and we don't realize the great
accomplishments<00:04:08.299> that<00:04:09.230> were<00:04:09.349> in<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:09.530> A's<00:04:09.739> and

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
accomplishments that were in the A's and

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:12.610 
accomplishments that were in the A's and
we're<00:04:10.400> tearing<00:04:11.000> all<00:04:11.150> of<00:04:11.299> that<00:04:11.450> down<00:04:11.660> so

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
we're tearing all of that down so

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.890 
we're tearing all of that down so
instead<00:04:12.950> of<00:04:13.010> saying<00:04:13.310> what<00:04:13.819> happened<00:04:14.180> what

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
instead of saying what happened what

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.449 
instead of saying what happened what
happened<00:04:14.930> I<00:04:15.440> told<00:04:15.829> you<00:04:15.980> you<00:04:16.070> just<00:04:16.099> didn't

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:17.740 
happened I told you you just didn't
steady<00:04:16.700> enough<00:04:16.910> that's<00:04:17.120> why<00:04:17.239> you<00:04:17.299> got<00:04:17.479> to<00:04:17.510> see

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
steady enough that's why you got to see

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.870 
steady enough that's why you got to see
there<00:04:17.989> we<00:04:18.320> are<00:04:18.349> tearing<00:04:18.919> the<00:04:19.039> self-image<00:04:19.609> down

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
there we are tearing the self-image down

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.990 
there we are tearing the self-image down
