wants me to use the shell up there but
can<00:03:21.079> I<00:03:21.290> not<00:03:21.560> just<00:03:21.950> use<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:22.549> piece<00:03:22.820> which<00:03:23.180> is<00:03:23.209> my

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
can I not just use the piece which is my

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.610 
can I not just use the piece which is my
question<00:03:24.130> that<00:03:25.130> is<00:03:25.730> that<00:03:26.329> I<00:03:26.360> am<00:03:26.750> asking<00:03:27.440> me

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
question that is that I am asking me

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.170 
question that is that I am asking me
right<00:03:27.860> now<00:03:28.160> because<00:03:28.549> that<00:03:28.700> would<00:03:28.880> have<00:03:29.030> been

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
right now because that would have been

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.620 
right now because that would have been
kind<00:03:29.630> of<00:03:29.720> a<00:03:29.870> silly<00:03:30.549> silly<00:03:31.549> oversight<00:03:32.239> but

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
kind of a silly silly oversight but

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:39.130 
kind of a silly silly oversight but
there<00:03:33.140> we<00:03:33.290> go<00:03:35.380> I<00:03:36.380> I<00:03:36.769> don't<00:03:37.730> know<00:03:37.910> man<00:03:38.239> I'm<00:03:38.930> not

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
there we go I I don't know man I'm not

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.900 
there we go I I don't know man I'm not
gonna<00:03:39.320> die<00:03:39.530> yeah<00:03:39.799> I'm<00:03:40.070> just<00:03:40.280> safe<00:03:40.579> you<00:03:40.790> know

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
gonna die yeah I'm just safe you know

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.229 
gonna die yeah I'm just safe you know
this<00:03:41.180> is<00:03:41.209> just<00:03:41.590> barely<00:03:42.590> hair<00:03:43.280> singeing<00:03:44.060> reach

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
this is just barely hair singeing reach

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.199 
this is just barely hair singeing reach
because<00:03:44.480> no<00:03:44.690> lava<00:03:45.370> normally<00:03:46.370> like<00:03:46.640> at<00:03:46.880> this

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
because no lava normally like at this

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.319 
because no lava normally like at this
proximity<00:03:47.870> demo<00:03:48.380> would<00:03:48.650> be<00:03:48.799> something<00:03:49.070> like

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
proximity demo would be something like

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.400 
proximity demo would be something like
evaporated<00:03:50.329> by<00:03:50.510> now<00:03:50.690> I<00:03:50.720> mean<00:03:51.049> we're<00:03:51.230> talking

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
evaporated by now I mean we're talking

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.100 
evaporated by now I mean we're talking
about<00:03:51.739> reverse<00:03:52.310> gravity<00:03:52.670> lava<00:03:53.209> which<00:03:53.900> has

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
about reverse gravity lava which has

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.470 
about reverse gravity lava which has
completely<00:03:54.820> different<00:03:55.820> physical

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
completely different physical

completely different physical

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
implications for one thing it has a very

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.110 
implications for one thing it has a very
nice<00:03:59.720> effect<00:04:00.260> on<00:04:00.500> mental<00:04:00.950> again<00:04:01.459> against<00:04:01.970> it

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
nice effect on mental again against it

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.180 
nice effect on mental again against it
you<00:04:02.209> know<00:04:02.329> it<00:04:02.420> turns<00:04:02.540> a<00:04:02.720> night<00:04:02.930> banging<00:04:03.920> big

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
you know it turns a night banging big

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.120 
you know it turns a night banging big
nice<00:04:04.400> bright<00:04:05.000> red<00:04:05.329> I<00:04:05.810> cannot<00:04:06.170> wait<00:04:06.440> for<00:04:06.950> one

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
nice bright red I cannot wait for one

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.600 
nice bright red I cannot wait for one
for<00:04:08.090> the<00:04:08.180> day<00:04:08.360> where<00:04:08.660> we<00:04:08.690> can<00:04:09.079> use<00:04:09.380> lava<00:04:09.860> no<00:04:10.340> dip

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
for the day where we can use lava no dip
