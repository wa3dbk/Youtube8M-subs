Hi people!

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.000
This is 
the second part of how to draw hands tutorial.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.250
As was said before, is very important that
you observe every part of

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.640
your hand, how the hand moves in different
positions.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.920
Let's see how the closed hand behaves.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.000
When we move our fingers to make a fist,
the tip of each of them approaches the center

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.760
of the palm.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.230
This is because the fingers follow the alignment
of the bones.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.720
Talking about closed hands, notice how the
hand is seen from several

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.280
sides.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.510
Always remember to respect the structure of
bones and muscles.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.680
Then observe your hand. See how the thumb
is in front of the other

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:53.331
fingers.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.840
In front view [punch!], the thumb is underneath
the fingers.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.310
See differences on each side of a closed hand.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.080
Look at skin folds.
If you do not forget these details, the draw

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.560
is more realistic.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.360
When bending the finger, the lines of fold
of skin, near the joints,

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.440
are more evident.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.560
That looks cool when the position of the fingers
are bent and some

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.180
others are raised.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.600
Look at the disposition of hand when you are
open and the fingers

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.940
together. Note the format.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.100
View from the sides, the hand must portray
the shapes of bones and

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.000
volume of muscles and skin.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.520
Some common mistakes in drawning hands, is
not observed as is the

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.200
format of the fingers.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.380
They are not totally straight and cylindrical
and are not pointy.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.700
Within them have muscles and bones, then can
not seem made ​​of rubber.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.540
Unless you're drawing cartoon style.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.440
But that's a topic for another video.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.460
Now it's my turn to speak.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.320

of them! That is

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.900

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.760
Wow. I must say that the Viktor draw is...
sublime. Congratulations!

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.360

spiderman's hand?
