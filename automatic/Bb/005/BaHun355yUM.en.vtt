looking<00:00:08.639> at<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:08.760> PPR<00:00:09.150> settings<00:00:09.780> I<00:00:09.960> think<00:00:10.740> there

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
looking at a PPR settings I think there

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.820 
looking at a PPR settings I think there
are<00:00:11.870> justifiable<00:00:12.870> reasons<00:00:13.230> why<00:00:13.380> you<00:00:13.440> can<00:00:13.650> take

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
are justifiable reasons why you can take

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.730 
are justifiable reasons why you can take
it<00:00:13.950> there<00:00:14.630> understands<00:00:15.630> all<00:00:15.809> upside<00:00:16.440> though

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
it there understands all upside though

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.090 
it there understands all upside though
oh<00:00:17.330> it<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:18.779> it's<00:00:19.109> an<00:00:19.230> enormous<00:00:19.320> amount<00:00:19.740> outside

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
oh it is it's an enormous amount outside

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.740 
oh it is it's an enormous amount outside
but<00:00:20.310> there's<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.520> lot<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:20.730> stats<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.359> back<00:00:21.539> that

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
but there's a lot of stats to back that

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.660 
but there's a lot of stats to back that
up<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.199> I'll<00:00:22.650> make<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.920> argument<00:00:23.070> for<00:00:23.400> CJ
