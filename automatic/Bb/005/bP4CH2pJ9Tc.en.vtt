00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 so want from all that I listen 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.069
 find even a little kumite pearl i 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.940
 already gou diamond 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.940
 but sometimes it happens as often 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:20.100
 brings a lot of music but of course 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.930
 everyone but you know there is gives 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.840
 hope here is what all the same will appear 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.170
 some name that sings beautifully and 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.619
 moves well and gives everything to the soul 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.890
 songs really come out now the singer 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.750
 who somehow know little can 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.550
 because not enough here and 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.780
 for example, you propose to strengthen it 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.750
 search for talents 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.239
 and what can i do with her all her so 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.910
 музыканты то знает о на ирак поет и по 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.920
 sings and all that he wants can 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.690
 I agree I’m actually cunning now 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.360
 because I know her very well and 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.989
 my dozens of times worked together and every 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.510
 once admired how this small 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.260
 very beautiful man of the female sex 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.600

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.780
 pond just amazing absolutely yes 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.900
 and it seems to me that composers like that 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.820
 should pay attention she is not very not 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.500
 himself does not spin completely though in vain 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.880

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:24.030
 u wouldn't have barely got here and dragged 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:29.390
 if everyone is ready on stage with a song very 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:33.079
