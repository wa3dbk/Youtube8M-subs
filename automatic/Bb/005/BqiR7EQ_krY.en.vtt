in<00:00:01.199> this<00:00:01.500> tutorial<00:00:01.709> we'll<00:00:02.159> take<00:00:02.370> a<00:00:02.399> look<00:00:02.639> at<00:00:02.790> a

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
in this tutorial we'll take a look at a

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.460 
in this tutorial we'll take a look at a
really<00:00:03.120> important<00:00:03.570> light<00:00:03.780> setup<00:00:04.140> for<00:00:04.350> those

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
really important light setup for those

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.260 
really important light setup for those
of<00:00:04.589> you<00:00:04.710> who<00:00:04.890> are<00:00:04.920> saying<00:00:05.279> illuminating<00:00:06.180> a

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
of you who are saying illuminating a

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.530 
of you who are saying illuminating a
character<00:00:06.750> with<00:00:07.130> eyes<00:00:08.130> and<00:00:08.700> you<00:00:09.090> want<00:00:09.240> to<00:00:09.330> make

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
character with eyes and you want to make

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.820 
character with eyes and you want to make
sure<00:00:09.570> you<00:00:09.809> have<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.050> reflection<00:00:10.500> of<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.650> light

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
sure you have the reflection of a light

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.589 
sure you have the reflection of a light
in<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.040> eyes<00:00:11.160> of<00:00:11.639> your<00:00:11.790> character<00:00:12.240> because

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
in the eyes of your character because

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:13.879 
in the eyes of your character because
for<00:00:13.170> those<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.410> you<00:00:13.500> who<00:00:13.559> haven't<00:00:13.710> taken

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
for those of you who haven't taken

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.490 
for those of you who haven't taken
photography<00:00:14.790> or<00:00:15.030> just<00:00:15.630> haven't<00:00:16.170> been<00:00:16.199> aware

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
photography or just haven't been aware

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.170 
photography or just haven't been aware
of<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:16.740> if<00:00:16.859> you<00:00:17.010> look<00:00:17.190> closely<00:00:17.550> at<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.910> lot<00:00:18.090> of

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
of it if you look closely at a lot of

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.330 
of it if you look closely at a lot of
those<00:00:18.270> photographs<00:00:18.720> that<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.800> professional

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
those photographs that a professional

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.920 
those photographs that a professional
photographers<00:00:20.939> take<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.359> can<00:00:21.570> actually<00:00:21.750> see

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
photographers take you can actually see

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.470 
photographers take you can actually see
the<00:00:22.380> reflection<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.100> their<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:24.210> know<00:00:24.240> it's

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
the reflection of their you know it's

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.960 
the reflection of their you know it's
usually<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.900> square<00:00:25.350> softbox<00:00:25.980> sometimes<00:00:26.550> in

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
usually a square softbox sometimes in

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.910 
usually a square softbox sometimes in
the<00:00:27.119> scene<00:00:27.330> if<00:00:27.570> it's<00:00:27.840> taken<00:00:28.140> at<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.320> studio<00:00:28.529> and

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
the scene if it's taken at a studio and

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.140 
the scene if it's taken at a studio and
you'll<00:00:29.039> actually<00:00:29.160> see<00:00:29.519> this<00:00:29.699> big<00:00:29.910> white

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
you'll actually see this big white

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.200 
you'll actually see this big white
reflection<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.800> little<00:00:32.309> tiny<00:00:32.489> square<00:00:32.969> in

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
reflection is a little tiny square in

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.209 
reflection is a little tiny square in
there<00:00:33.480> in<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:34.079> eyeballs<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.469> those<00:00:34.800> persons

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
there in the eyeballs of those persons

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.620 
there in the eyeballs of those persons
well<00:00:35.370> those<00:00:35.489> really<00:00:35.850> those<00:00:36.390> type<00:00:36.600> of

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
well those really those type of

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.420 
well those really those type of
reflections<00:00:37.230> really<00:00:37.500> helped<00:00:37.680> make<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.190> eye

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
reflections really helped make the eye

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.350 
reflections really helped make the eye
pop<00:00:39.300> out<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:41.309> here<00:00:41.670> what<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:41.910> have<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.329> a

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
pop out so in here what I have is a

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.180 
pop out so in here what I have is a
couple<00:00:42.690> setups<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.140> we're<00:00:43.800> going<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.950> look<00:00:44.070> at

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
couple setups and we're going to look at

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.760 
couple setups and we're going to look at
the<00:00:44.430> distinction<00:00:44.820> between<00:00:45.059> using<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.410> spots

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
the distinction between using the spots

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.060 
the distinction between using the spots
that<00:00:47.129> are<00:00:47.489> built<00:00:47.670> into<00:00:48.200> blender<00:00:49.200> cycles<00:00:49.829> now

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
that are built into blender cycles now

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.560 
that are built into blender cycles now
they<00:00:50.340> came<00:00:50.579> from<00:00:50.730> blender<00:00:51.059> render<00:00:51.210> but<00:00:51.480> you

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
they came from blender render but you

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.389 
they came from blender render but you
can<00:00:51.719> use<00:00:51.840> them<00:00:51.960> within<00:00:52.110> cycles<00:00:52.500> first<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.370> just

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
can use them within cycles first is just

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.090 
can use them within cycles first is just
using<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.090> regular<00:00:54.379> light<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.590> we'll<00:00:55.710> see<00:00:55.860> how

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
using a regular light and we'll see how

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.080 
using a regular light and we'll see how
it<00:00:56.280> changes<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.600> object<00:00:58.320> here<00:00:58.620> is

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
it changes so this object here is

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.000 
it changes so this object here is
reflecting<00:01:00.090> light<00:01:00.210> like<00:01:00.629> glass<00:01:00.960> like<00:01:01.350> you

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
reflecting light like glass like you

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.280 
reflecting light like glass like you
know<00:01:02.129> an<00:01:02.219> eyeball<00:01:02.579> would<00:01:02.760> reflect<00:01:03.090> light<00:01:03.300> wow

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
know an eyeball would reflect light wow

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.050 
know an eyeball would reflect light wow
you<00:01:04.350> would<00:01:04.589> say<00:01:04.830> it's<00:01:05.040> basically<00:01:05.519> bouncing

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
you would say it's basically bouncing

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.960 
you would say it's basically bouncing
like<00:01:06.360> it's<00:01:06.570> like<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.750> mirror<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.850> what<00:01:08.850> I'm

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
like it's like a mirror and what I'm

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.630 
like it's like a mirror and what I'm
looking<00:01:09.450> at<00:01:09.600> here<00:01:09.979> I'm<00:01:10.979> looking<00:01:11.159> into<00:01:11.520> that

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
looking at here I'm looking into that

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.870 
looking at here I'm looking into that
mirror<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:13.170> at<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.799> 45-degree<00:01:14.549> angle<00:01:14.790> and

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
mirror and this at a 45-degree angle and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.580 
mirror and this at a 45-degree angle and
it's<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.420> mirror<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.720> looking<00:01:16.049> back<00:01:16.259> into

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
it's and the mirror is looking back into

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.130 
it's and the mirror is looking back into
this<00:01:16.740> tube<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.909> within<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.540> tube<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.580> just<00:01:20.580> a

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
this tube and within that tube is just a

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.630 
this tube and within that tube is just a
that<00:01:22.140> same<00:01:22.439> square<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.979> can<00:01:23.130> see<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:23.520> there

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
that same square you can see it in there

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.800 
that same square you can see it in there
as<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.850> rotate<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.330> around<00:01:24.560> see<00:01:26.540> you<00:01:27.540> get<00:01:27.689> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
as I rotate it around see you get the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.240 
as I rotate it around see you get the
effect<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.290> then<00:01:28.380> when<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.650> look<00:01:28.890> back<00:01:28.920> over

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
effect and then when you look back over

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.800 
effect and then when you look back over
here<00:01:29.549> at<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.850> sphere<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.299> can<00:01:30.450> see<00:01:30.659> the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
here at the sphere you can see the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.840 
here at the sphere you can see the
effect<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.409> light<00:01:31.619> hitting<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.549> sphere

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
effect of the light hitting the sphere

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.149 
effect of the light hitting the sphere
from<00:01:33.090> bouncing<00:01:33.479> off<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.720> mirror<00:01:34.049> into<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
from bouncing off the mirror into the

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.870 
from bouncing off the mirror into the
scene<00:01:35.689> alright<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.439> works<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.610> and

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
scene alright so that works that and

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.149 
scene alright so that works that and
that's<00:01:39.060> just<00:01:39.329> using<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.780> regular<00:01:39.810> plain<00:01:40.740> and

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
that's just using a regular plain and

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.590 
that's just using a regular plain and
it's<00:01:41.909> got<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.259> admission<00:01:43.970> shader<00:01:44.970> set<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.509> it

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
it's got a admission shader set to it

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.969 
it's got a admission shader set to it
like<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.079> it's<00:01:46.229> emitting<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.619> little<00:01:46.860> bit

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
like that so it's emitting a little bit

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.499 
like that so it's emitting a little bit
of<00:01:47.040> light<00:01:47.189> like<00:01:47.399> this<00:01:47.579> okay<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.390> now<00:01:48.479> let's

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
of light like this okay so now let's

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.090 
of light like this okay so now let's
look<00:01:48.720> at<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:48.930> wireframe<00:01:49.140> mode<00:01:49.530> also<00:01:49.770> at<00:01:50.009> the

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
look at in wireframe mode also at the

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.789 
look at in wireframe mode also at the
same<00:01:50.130> time<00:01:50.840> over<00:01:51.840> here<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.229> same<00:01:52.409> scene<00:01:52.680> i

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
let me move this one back behind it and

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.459 
let me move this one back behind it and
turn<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.560> off<00:01:58.790> like<00:01:59.790> this<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.719> then<00:02:01.229> we'll<00:02:01.320> get

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
turn it off like this and then we'll get

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.319 
turn it off like this and then we'll get
take<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.159> look<00:02:02.310> at<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.549> spot<00:02:02.790> now<00:02:03.000> the

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
you can now control the size of the spot

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.650 
you can now control the size of the spot
within<00:02:11.790> here<00:02:12.209> this<00:02:12.360> is<00:02:12.480> as<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.629> version<00:02:12.959> 2.65<00:02:14.660> ok

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
and you can control how much it blends

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.509 
and you can control how much it blends
in<00:02:19.879> to<00:02:20.879> the<00:02:21.000> scene<00:02:21.300> so<00:02:21.780> let<00:02:22.140> me<00:02:22.260> see<00:02:22.470> so<00:02:22.980> let's

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
in to the scene so let me see so let's

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.720 
in to the scene so let me see so let's
say<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:23.819> get<00:02:24.330> this<00:02:24.599> and<00:02:24.959> move<00:02:25.230> let<00:02:26.160> me<00:02:26.280> move<00:02:26.459> this

say I get this and move let me move this

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.059 
say I get this and move let me move this
up<00:02:26.970> out<00:02:27.750> of<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.959> way<00:02:28.110> real<00:02:28.440> quick<00:02:29.660> here<00:02:30.660> and

the scene over there somewhere no but
will<00:02:39.450> I'll<00:02:40.019> just<00:02:40.230> fix<00:02:40.530> that<00:02:42.709> I'll<00:02:43.709> just<00:02:43.769> add<00:02:44.099> a

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
will I'll just fix that I'll just add a

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:57.070 
will I'll just fix that I'll just add a
cube<00:02:44.519> real<00:02:44.760> quick

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.690 

all<00:02:58.080> right<00:02:58.200> now<00:02:58.560> you<00:02:58.620> can<00:02:58.890> see<00:02:59.130> in<00:02:59.340> here<00:02:59.550> you

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
all right now you can see in here you

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.050 
all right now you can see in here you
can<00:02:59.849> see<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.060> spotlight<00:03:01.910> hitting<00:03:02.910> it<00:03:03.030> right

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
can see the spotlight hitting it right

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.059 
can see the spotlight hitting it right
there<00:03:03.390> like<00:03:03.599> that<00:03:03.810> okay<00:03:04.349> so<00:03:04.680> we<00:03:04.800> know<00:03:04.920> the

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
there like that okay so we know the

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.970 
there like that okay so we know the
spotlight<00:03:05.550> is<00:03:05.730> working<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.780> if<00:03:07.590> we<00:03:07.709> come<00:03:07.860> in

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
spotlight is working and if we come in

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.839 
spotlight is working and if we come in
here<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:08.340> grab<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.700> spot<00:03:08.940> we<00:03:09.209> can<00:03:09.360> see<00:03:09.540> the

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
here and grab the spot we can see the

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.350 
here and grab the spot we can see the
need<00:03:11.849> to<00:03:12.000> move<00:03:12.120> this<00:03:12.270> over<00:03:12.420> just<00:03:12.690> a<00:03:12.780> little<00:03:12.810> bit

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
need to move this over just a little bit

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.050 
need to move this over just a little bit
so<00:03:15.360> there<00:03:15.510> you<00:03:15.569> can<00:03:15.690> see<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.930> cone<00:03:16.849> it<00:03:17.849> does

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
so there you can see the cone it does

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.180 
so there you can see the cone it does
actually<00:03:18.239> work<00:03:18.480> if<00:03:18.989> it<00:03:19.140> gets<00:03:19.319> past<00:03:19.590> it<00:03:19.800> shines

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
actually work if it gets past it shines

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.339 
actually work if it gets past it shines
past<00:03:20.550> it<00:03:20.760> so<00:03:20.880> it<00:03:20.970> has<00:03:21.090> some<00:03:21.300> nice<00:03:21.420> effects<00:03:21.840> like

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
past it so it has some nice effects like

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.380 
past it so it has some nice effects like
I<00:03:22.440> said<00:03:22.500> you<00:03:22.800> can<00:03:22.830> change<00:03:23.190> this<00:03:23.519> blending<00:03:24.150> so

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
I said you can change this blending so

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.290 
I said you can change this blending so
it's<00:03:24.540> either<00:03:24.959> a<00:03:25.170> really<00:03:25.650> sharp<00:03:26.459> or<00:03:26.790> smooth

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
it's either a really sharp or smooth

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.100 
it's either a really sharp or smooth
blend<00:03:27.750> right<00:03:28.680> let<00:03:29.670> me<00:03:29.730> see<00:03:29.870> calculating<00:03:30.870> it<00:03:30.989> up

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
blend right let me see calculating it up

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.809 
blend right let me see calculating it up
to<00:03:31.230> 50<00:03:31.560> but<00:03:31.739> it'll<00:03:31.950> blend<00:03:32.130> smooth<00:03:32.489> or<00:03:32.640> if<00:03:32.760> you

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
to 50 but it'll blend smooth or if you

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.750 
to 50 but it'll blend smooth or if you
go<00:03:32.940> out<00:03:33.150> here<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.680> either<00:03:34.680> go<00:03:34.920> sharp<00:03:35.250> or<00:03:35.489> smooth

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
go out here to either go sharp or smooth

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.670 
go out here to either go sharp or smooth
there<00:03:36.120> it<00:03:36.209> is<00:03:36.330> coming<00:03:36.870> out<00:03:36.989> so<00:03:37.319> it<00:03:37.410> gives<00:03:37.500> you<00:03:37.650> a

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
there it is coming out so it gives you a

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.789 
there it is coming out so it gives you a
nice<00:03:37.799> effect<00:03:38.250> in<00:03:38.489> that<00:03:38.910> sense<00:03:39.650> but<00:03:40.650> now

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
nice effect in that sense but now

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.160 
nice effect in that sense but now

however just let's put this other object
back<00:03:43.349> in<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.620> scene<00:03:45.049> here<00:03:46.049> this<00:03:46.830> is<00:03:46.980> going<00:03:47.099> to

spot<00:04:08.840> on<00:04:09.050> the<00:04:09.170> scene<00:04:09.380> like<00:04:09.680> this<00:04:12.100> but<00:04:13.100> let's

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
spot on the scene like this but let's

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.970 
spot on the scene like this but let's
turn<00:04:14.030> this<00:04:14.210> sideways<00:04:14.510> from<00:04:14.960> here<00:04:15.410> just<00:04:15.890> like

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
turn this sideways from here just like

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.600 
turn this sideways from here just like
this<00:04:16.190> other<00:04:16.400> view<00:04:17.020> you<00:04:18.020> come<00:04:18.170> over<00:04:18.320> here<00:04:18.580> but<00:04:19.580> I

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:19.610 
this other view you come over here but I

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.870 
this other view you come over here but I
don't<00:04:19.790> see<00:04:20.120> the<00:04:20.420> spot<00:04:20.720> itself<00:04:21.620> alright<00:04:22.280> so<00:04:22.730> let

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
don't see the spot itself alright so let

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.660 
don't see the spot itself alright so let
me<00:04:22.970> turn<00:04:23.180> that<00:04:23.420> spot<00:04:23.840> down<00:04:24.190> we<00:04:25.190> change<00:04:25.490> that

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
me turn that spot down we change that

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.140 
me turn that spot down we change that
angle<00:04:26.120> and<00:04:27.190> verify<00:04:28.190> that<00:04:28.430> so<00:04:28.610> let's<00:04:28.790> get<00:04:28.940> down

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
angle and verify that so let's get down

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.440 
angle and verify that so let's get down
to<00:04:29.180> a<00:04:29.620> really<00:04:30.620> small<00:04:30.980> angle<00:04:31.460> like<00:04:32.150> the<00:04:32.330> other

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
to a really small angle like the other

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.630 
to a really small angle like the other
one<00:04:32.660> was<00:04:33.940> and<00:04:34.940> there<00:04:35.810> it<00:04:35.900> is<00:04:36.050> so<00:04:36.380> now<00:04:36.590> I'm<00:04:36.770> even

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
one was and there it is so now I'm even

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.370 
one was and there it is so now I'm even
though<00:04:37.880> the<00:04:38.120> light<00:04:38.600> even<00:04:39.170> though<00:04:39.260> the

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
though the light even though the

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.990 
though the light even though the
spotlight<00:04:39.860> is<00:04:40.010> pointing<00:04:40.430> at<00:04:40.520> this<00:04:40.640> mirrored

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
spotlight is pointing at this mirrored

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.960 
spotlight is pointing at this mirrored
surface<00:04:41.480> I<00:04:41.720> don't<00:04:42.410> see<00:04:42.680> it<00:04:42.710> reflected<00:04:43.370> in<00:04:43.880> the

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
surface I don't see it reflected in the

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.760 
surface I don't see it reflected in the
mirrored<00:04:44.270> surface<00:04:44.720> so<00:04:45.140> if<00:04:45.290> you<00:04:45.410> set<00:04:45.650> up<00:04:45.740> your

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
mirrored surface so if you set up your

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.910 
mirrored surface so if you set up your
scene<00:04:47.140> photography<00:04:48.140> scene<00:04:48.290> of<00:04:48.440> some<00:04:48.620> sort

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
scene photography scene of some sort

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.860 
scene photography scene of some sort
you're<00:04:49.100> using<00:04:49.370> these<00:04:49.700> type<00:04:50.060> of<00:04:50.090> spotlights

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
you're using these type of spotlights

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.170 
you're using these type of spotlights
and<00:04:51.110> you're<00:04:51.710> expecting<00:04:52.130> to<00:04:52.520> get<00:04:52.640> reflections

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
and you're expecting to get reflections

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.630 
and you're expecting to get reflections
off<00:04:53.330> of<00:04:53.360> mirrored<00:04:53.840> glass<00:04:54.230> surfaces<00:04:54.770> it<00:04:55.370> looks

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
off of mirrored glass surfaces it looks

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.660 
off of mirrored glass surfaces it looks
like<00:04:55.820> it's<00:04:56.390> not<00:04:56.630> designed<00:04:56.930> to<00:04:57.410> do<00:04:57.830> that<00:04:58.070> so<00:04:58.520> in

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
like it's not designed to do that so in

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.790 
like it's not designed to do that so in
that<00:04:58.820> case<00:04:59.200> what<00:05:00.200> you<00:05:00.290> want<00:05:00.410> to<00:05:00.500> do<00:05:00.590> is<00:05:00.710> you

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
that case what you want to do is you

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.170 
that case what you want to do is you
want<00:05:00.830> to<00:05:01.010> go<00:05:01.130> grab<00:05:01.370> this<00:05:01.580> light<00:05:01.790> I'll<00:05:01.940> verify

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
want to go grab this light I'll verify

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.360 
want to go grab this light I'll verify
let's<00:05:02.720> put<00:05:02.960> this<00:05:03.110> light<00:05:03.350> back<00:05:03.590> on<00:05:03.620> I'll<00:05:04.220> turn

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
let's put this light back on I'll turn

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.520 
let's put this light back on I'll turn
this<00:05:04.580> one<00:05:04.790> back<00:05:04.940> on<00:05:05.180> but<00:05:06.020> this<00:05:06.140> one<00:05:06.320> doesn't

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
this one back on but this one doesn't

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:07.840 
this one back on but this one doesn't
have<00:05:06.620> to<00:05:06.800> be<00:05:06.890> the<00:05:07.160> regular<00:05:07.520> mission<00:05:07.790> the

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
have to be the regular mission the

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.310 
have to be the regular mission the
lights<00:05:08.060> don't<00:05:08.240> have<00:05:08.420> to<00:05:08.510> be<00:05:08.630> so<00:05:08.780> high<00:05:08.930> well

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
lights don't have to be so high well

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.530 
lights don't have to be so high well
there<00:05:09.470> it<00:05:09.560> is<00:05:09.620> right<00:05:09.680> there<00:05:10.090> you<00:05:11.090> can<00:05:11.240> see<00:05:11.450> it

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
there it is right there you can see it

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.900 
there it is right there you can see it
and<00:05:11.750> I'll<00:05:12.020> just<00:05:12.170> move<00:05:12.380> this<00:05:12.590> one<00:05:12.830> back<00:05:13.670> behind

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
and I'll just move this one back behind

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.510 
and I'll just move this one back behind
it<00:05:14.270> out<00:05:14.390> of<00:05:14.510> the<00:05:14.570> way<00:05:15.640> and<00:05:16.640> i'll<00:05:16.820> turn<00:05:17.000> it<00:05:17.210> off

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
it out of the way and i'll turn it off

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.460 
it out of the way and i'll turn it off
like<00:05:19.520> that<00:05:19.700> so<00:05:20.180> now<00:05:20.360> we<00:05:20.420> see<00:05:20.810> the<00:05:20.840> effects<00:05:21.290> of

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
like that so now we see the effects of

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.800 
like that so now we see the effects of
that<00:05:24.610> light<00:05:25.610> reflecting<00:05:26.240> off<00:05:26.240> of<00:05:26.420> there<00:05:26.690> in

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
that light reflecting off of there in

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.390 
that light reflecting off of there in
the<00:05:26.900> scene<00:05:27.080> and<00:05:27.230> there<00:05:27.380> it<00:05:27.470> is<00:05:27.530> pointing<00:05:28.190> here

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
the scene and there it is pointing here

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.730 
the scene and there it is pointing here
and<00:05:28.670> then<00:05:29.090> you<00:05:29.180> come<00:05:29.360> back<00:05:29.390> over<00:05:29.540> here<00:05:29.840> so<00:05:30.470> this

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
and then you come back over here so this

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.150 
and then you come back over here so this
is<00:05:31.060> okay<00:05:32.060> so<00:05:32.120> it's<00:05:32.420> a<00:05:32.630> maybe<00:05:33.260> a<00:05:33.440> minor<00:05:33.710> detail

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
is okay so it's a maybe a minor detail

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.950 
is okay so it's a maybe a minor detail
oh<00:05:34.370> well<00:05:34.820> no<00:05:34.970> not<00:05:35.150> really<00:05:35.360> not<00:05:35.630> for<00:05:35.810> me<00:05:35.930> I

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
oh well no not really not for me I

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.730 
oh well no not really not for me I
assure<00:05:36.200> you<00:05:36.380> so<00:05:37.130> if<00:05:37.430> you're<00:05:38.200> lighting<00:05:39.200> certain

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
assure you so if you're lighting certain

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.320 
assure you so if you're lighting certain
scenes<00:05:39.980> and<00:05:40.250> you<00:05:40.310> need<00:05:40.550> those<00:05:40.790> reflections

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
scenes and you need those reflections

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.180 
scenes and you need those reflections
because<00:05:41.870> those<00:05:42.080> reflections<00:05:42.470> make<00:05:42.800> all<00:05:42.980> the

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
because those reflections make all the

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.820 
because those reflections make all the
difference<00:05:43.280> in<00:05:43.610> the<00:05:43.640> world<00:05:43.880> then<00:05:44.780> this<00:05:45.380> lesson

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
difference in the world then this lesson

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.130 
difference in the world then this lesson
becomes<00:05:46.370> really<00:05:46.580> important<00:05:47.120> okay<00:05:47.690> well

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.140 
becomes really important okay well

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.630 
becomes really important okay well
that's<00:05:48.230> it<00:05:48.380> for<00:05:48.500> this<00:05:48.590> lesson<00:05:48.770> and<00:05:49.130> i'll<00:05:49.490> see

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:49.640 
that's it for this lesson and i'll see

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.150 
that's it for this lesson and i'll see
you<00:05:49.700> in<00:05:49.760> the<00:05:49.790> next<00:05:49.940> lesson
