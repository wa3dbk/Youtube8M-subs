for<00:00:38.129> McAuliffe<00:00:38.640> one<00:00:38.760> I'm<00:00:38.879> not<00:00:39.000> sure<00:00:39.059> but<00:00:39.629> it

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
for McAuliffe one I'm not sure but it

doesn't matter

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.970 
doesn't matter
so<00:00:41.960> it<00:00:42.960> means<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.320> it's<00:00:43.530> kind<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.770> hidden

if<00:06:15.030> they<00:06:15.240> could<00:06:15.300> do<00:06:15.510> that<00:06:15.630> I<00:06:15.780> would<00:06:16.020> definitely

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
if they could do that I would definitely

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.060 
if they could do that I would definitely
use<00:06:16.590> it<00:06:16.950> over<00:06:17.520> the<00:06:17.640> dock<00:06:18.470> if<00:06:19.470> they<00:06:19.680> had<00:06:19.860> that

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070 
use it over the dock if they had that

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.050 
use it over the dock if they had that
and<00:06:20.250> they<00:06:20.310> made<00:06:20.490> just<00:06:20.669> a<00:06:20.730> little<00:06:20.970> more

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
and they made just a little more

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.600 
and they made just a little more
functional<00:06:21.300> and<00:06:21.900> if<00:06:22.080> you<00:06:22.200> could<00:06:22.350> put<00:06:22.610> icons

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
functional and if you could put icons

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.790 
functional and if you could put icons
for<00:06:23.820> your<00:06:23.940> website<00:06:24.300> right<00:06:24.450> there<00:06:24.660> and<00:06:25.620> it

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
for your website right there and it

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.020 
for your website right there and it
would<00:06:25.890> be<00:06:25.950> pretty<00:06:26.130> perfect<00:06:26.610> if<00:06:26.730> they<00:06:26.850> could

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.030 
would be pretty perfect if they could

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.140 
would be pretty perfect if they could
just<00:06:27.180> change<00:06:27.419> that<00:06:27.630> up<00:06:28.520> but<00:06:29.520> overall<00:06:29.760> it's<00:06:30.090> a

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.150 
just change that up but overall it's a

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.330 
just change that up but overall it's a
pretty<00:06:30.180> good<00:06:30.510> app<00:06:30.660> now<00:06:30.930> or<00:06:31.169> $30

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
pretty good app now or $30

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.409 
pretty good app now or $30
you<00:06:32.490> can<00:06:32.610> go<00:06:32.669> ahead<00:06:32.730> and<00:06:32.820> try<00:06:33.030> that<00:06:33.060> if<00:06:33.330> you

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.419 
you can go ahead and try that if you

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:35.300 
you can go ahead and try that if you
want<00:06:33.600> and<00:06:33.720> see<00:06:33.870> if<00:06:34.020> you<00:06:34.770> find<00:06:35.010> a<00:06:35.070> better<00:06:35.190> use

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310 
want and see if you find a better use

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.640 
want and see if you find a better use
for<00:06:35.460> it<00:06:35.790> and<00:06:36.060> it's<00:06:36.870> got<00:06:36.960> a<00:06:36.990> lot<00:06:37.110> of<00:06:37.169> hotkeys

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
for it and it's got a lot of hotkeys

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.560 
for it and it's got a lot of hotkeys
which<00:06:37.949> I<00:06:38.310> think<00:06:38.820> are<00:06:38.910> twists<00:06:39.120> to<00:06:39.210> kind<00:06:39.389> of<00:06:39.419> just

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570 
which I think are twists to kind of just

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.700 
which I think are twists to kind of just
be<00:06:39.630> like<00:06:39.660> how<00:06:39.930> like<00:06:40.139> um<00:06:40.729> Quicksilver<00:06:41.729> is<00:06:41.820> used

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:42.710 
be like how like um Quicksilver is used

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.320 
be like how like um Quicksilver is used
but<00:06:43.710> if<00:06:43.830> you<00:06:43.979> with<00:06:44.220> those<00:06:44.430> two<00:06:44.580> hot<00:06:44.760> abs<00:06:45.060> put

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:45.330 
but if you with those two hot abs put

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.290 
but if you with those two hot abs put
together<00:06:45.449> makes<00:06:46.020> you<00:06:46.760> speed<00:06:47.760> it<00:06:47.880> up<00:06:47.970> your

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300
