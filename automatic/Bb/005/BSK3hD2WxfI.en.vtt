 hello Jungi on the bridge Captain Alatriste 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.130
 not much time will pass the enemy 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.689
 will be afraid to read your nicknames in 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.910
 the opposing team 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.950
 but it will be tomorrow and today only 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.689
 only activated invite code for the PTA 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.829
 mbskachan and running the game client 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.540
 which so far only two ships 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:35.760
 gunboat usa navy or japanese 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.290
 light cruiser which starts with them 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.030
 your way who is on future penalties 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.219
 virtual mary world of warships 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.430
 what to choose and how to play each of 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.260
 of them 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.240
 so that you would not stand but as a knight on 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.880
 the crossroads I prepared for you this mini 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.250
 guide for beginners will start with 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.810
 short historical background 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.040
 gunboats type rip and everything was 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.850
 built two ships 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.250
 the irians charleston are both floated in 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.840
 1936 with a difference of a month participated 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.060
 mostly rescue escort 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.649
 operations at the end of the war or was seriously 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.439
 damaged and dropped out of the fleet 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:10.770
 bosses became a lung training ship 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.860
 cruisers of the type which throughout 1939 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.159
 years on water was launched 3 units this 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.659
 which cosima and box office and initially they 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.670
 not intended for use in 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.920
 battle but war as they say 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.740
 made them all used as 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.719
 flagship escort ships two of them 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.639
 were destroyed in battle alone captured 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:32.600
 Americans , let's move on 

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:34.829
 directly to the survival school 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.420
 as they say athletes involved 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.950
 contact martial arts on 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.139
 carelessness novice can 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.670
 injure the sparring partner much 

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:44.520
 stronger than experienced fighter 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.529
 that's exactly what happens in our 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.749
 chaotic sea battles of the first 

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:50.490
 levels could not play by nested 

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:52.799
 Huge tourism inquisitiveness 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.380
 turns sand fights into chaotic 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.869
 dump before the box under the distribution fall 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.759
 even folders come to drive the kids well 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.289
 still this to me tanks where it is possible to get 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.270
 the bush hung around 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.279
 equipment one hundred percent crew and 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.439
 shoot barely crawling newbies 

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:09.090
 here on open water such tricks are not 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.970
 work you have to go to a rapprochement 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.849
 get your shells on par with everyone 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.470
 but what does a novice do to not only 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.730
 have a trace of your first combat experience of hell 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.360
 shoot first 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.910
 guys learn materiel when yazh boat 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.710
 1000 durability points 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.990
 okay and caliber four artillery 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.930
 install a caliber of 152 millimeter it's in 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.760
 top range 9 and 6 kilometers 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.410
 in the citadel armor eighty eight 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.580
 millimeters and finally the maximum 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.010
 speed 21 knots 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.930
 what is American well armed and 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.210
 even slightly armored profitable 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.070
 placing the guns one by one excludes 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.660
 simultaneous cry of two trunks at once 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.240
 as it often happens in such a 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.700
 round of the series soon yes two nodes that is 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.790
 inside 6 kilometers per hour higher than that 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.590
 Japanese fellow withdrawal maneuver and fire 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.620
 from the second line is the perfect choice for 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.990
 novice water cruisers americans 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.410
 let's go to the light cruiser kotorya 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:07.060
 17.900 survivability points 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.780
 main caliber 2 paired English 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.200
 installation caliber 140 millimeters this in 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.910
 top 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.940
 further firing ten and a half 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.980
 kilometers and scold 51 millimeter 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.160
 also the maximum speed is 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.560
 19 knots massive body practically 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.510
 total lack of armor does it all 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.580
 which is a noble credo of compilations on it 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.560
 He shoots land mines he constantly burns 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.500
 and the twin guns in the towers are knocked out 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.080
 the only way but with this japanese academic 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.910
 a ship of the first level would have a reserve 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.430
 points of combat capability comparable to 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.070
 4 cruisers just imagine 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.440
 yourself and shoots almost a mile further 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.990
 than his american rival we conclusion 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.570
 able to tank damage by no means battleships 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.340
 and do not stand alone next to more 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.260
 thin juicy falcon dandies and not 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.690
 forget about the personal kilometer in the distance 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.940
 projectile flight hand over the main feature 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.890
 this and the other ship you will be easier 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.230
 choose who to download first in any 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.660
 case from 2 you too will not leave offense 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:08.220
 tonal branches of development are good and on them 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:10.959
 can and should be moved in parallel 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.270
 let's talk a bit about tactics 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.489
 ship selected clicks prelaunch 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.620
 it's time to start the battle but before 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.390
 how to rush into the thick of the battle, remember 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.260
 some simple tips 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:25.240
 the first tip is one in the field is not a warrior home 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.010
 the mistake of many at the beginning of the battle to jerk 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.160
 solitary attack get under focus 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.870
 children's ships and drown 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.340
 I do not call you all will be cowardly 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.170
 huddle to the far edge of the map but also 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.450
 unnecessary haste too good to you 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.640
 will not bring the beginning of the battle to first evaluate 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.440
 setting the balance of power on your 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.820
 flank and move together with 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.370
 teammate my covering each other 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.170
 it is better to shoot the enemy alone 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.750
 than one hat to take unequal 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:51.660
 bout with half the opposing team 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.790
 second council movement is life now 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.650
 truly unlike tanks your ship 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.750
 able to fire at full 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.790
 go and when you stand still for you 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.040
 the easiest way to get these benefits 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.020
 hit points you don't get to stop the move 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.840
 in the middle of the fight is all that go on 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.160
 field in robin and stop also not 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.050
 need to try to go out from under the fire 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.680
 reversing ship mode 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.870
 full speed ahead 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.690
 much better maneuvering shy away from 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:18.060
 enemy fire 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.680
 third advice to each his own most important 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.660
 up the right question which arises have 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.490
 novice who beat armor-piercing around 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.480
 high-explosive shells well, I'll try 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.850
 to answer it 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.860
 land mines stably hang small freaks 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.660
 set fire to the goal of the battle of war breaks through 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:34.050
 the citadel and explodes inside is impossible 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:36.240
 high damage modules how are we all the same 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.960
 to decide bombs 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.250
 landmines we finish off the yellow opponent 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.100
 we shoot at not armored targets 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:46.080
 for example on destroyers just the opposite 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.240
 feasible armored targets i mean by 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.510
 battleship well if you of course actually 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.540
 nko 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.310
 and such a moment armored 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.950
 ships try to get weak 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.440
 protected tip in the bow and stern so 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.690
 will take the maximum damage from 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.419
 land mines as for armor piercing 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.980
 shells on them I advise 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:08.040
 Shoot their classmates at the ships 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:10.620
 armor you pierce always and when you 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.600
 shoot aim to board the ship 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.700
 chimney area 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.860
 trying to get as close as possible to the water 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:20.370
 lady damage lego's engine rooms 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:23.070
 cellars almost guaranteed well and 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.850
 fourth last tip keep everything 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.250
 under control 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:28.080
 in every fight constantly look for 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:31.009
 setting around and track 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:33.080
 minimap so you avoid sticking to court 

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:35.360
 and clashes with allies besides 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.490
 building what's happening with yours now 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.839
 team will allow you to respond to 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.819
 any change in setting 

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:44.779
 for example in time to support the weakening 

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:47.089
 clan that's all these rules are simple 

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:48.889
 intuitive adherence will allow you 

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:51.649
 adequately start your maritime career 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:55.599
 wolf let it be long and successful 

00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:55.599
 welcome aboard
