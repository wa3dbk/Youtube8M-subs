00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.520 

see<00:01:30.880> that<00:01:31.060> flipping<00:01:31.450> these<00:01:31.600> docs<00:01:31.900> pays<00:01:32.229> off

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
see that flipping these docs pays off

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.399 
see that flipping these docs pays off
just<00:01:32.830> like<00:01:32.890> we<00:01:33.100> were<00:01:33.220> talking<00:01:33.610> about<00:01:33.670> you<00:01:34.409> have

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
just like we were talking about you have

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.800 
just like we were talking about you have
to<00:01:35.619> flip<00:01:35.860> a<00:01:35.979> lot<00:01:36.159> of<00:01:36.340> them<00:01:36.460> and<00:01:37.270> once<00:01:37.479> you<00:01:37.630> get

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
to flip a lot of them and once you get

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.640 
to flip a lot of them and once you get
on<00:01:37.960> some<00:01:38.229> fish<00:01:38.470> realize<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:39.460> pattern<00:01:39.850> a<00:01:40.650> great

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
on some fish realize the pattern a great

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.800 
on some fish realize the pattern a great
way<00:01:41.860> to<00:01:41.920> catch<00:01:42.310> quality<00:01:43.060> fish<00:01:43.299> that's<00:01:43.659> a

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
way to catch quality fish that's a

00:01:43.810 --> 00:02:02.760 
way to catch quality fish that's a
quality<00:01:44.530> fish<00:02:01.410> that's<00:02:02.410> what<00:02:02.530> i've<00:02:02.649> been<00:02:02.679> doing

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
quality fish that's what i've been doing

working on the bottom traditionally

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.499 
working on the bottom traditionally
normally<00:02:06.550> you<00:02:06.640> don't<00:02:06.759> want<00:02:07.000> to<00:02:07.090> do<00:02:07.179> it<00:02:07.330> just

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
normally you don't want to do it just

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:08.790 
normally you don't want to do it just
want<00:02:07.720> to<00:02:07.780> let<00:02:07.840> it<00:02:07.960> sink<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:08.410> pour<00:02:08.590> it<00:02:08.679> right

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
want to let it sink and pour it right

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:25.229 
want to let it sink and pour it right
now

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.460 

well<00:02:26.239> that's<00:02:26.420> just<00:02:26.510> what<00:02:26.780> we<00:02:26.900> were<00:02:27.019> talking

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
well that's just what we were talking

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.289 
well that's just what we were talking
about<00:02:27.530> before<00:02:27.830> about<00:02:28.099> the<00:02:28.580> fall<00:02:28.819> rate<00:02:31.299> how

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
about before about the fall rate how

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.839 
about before about the fall rate how
sometimes<00:02:32.900> they<00:02:33.110> want<00:02:33.379> that<00:02:33.590> real<00:02:33.920> slow<00:02:34.370> fall

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
sometimes they want that real slow fall

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.940 
sometimes they want that real slow fall
other<00:02:35.420> times<00:02:36.019> to<00:02:36.290> cause<00:02:36.500> that<00:02:36.739> reaction

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
other times to cause that reaction

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.729 
other times to cause that reaction
strike<00:02:37.700> they<00:02:37.970> want<00:02:38.180> it<00:02:38.269> to<00:02:38.390> fall<00:02:38.599> real<00:02:38.900> fast<00:02:39.319> in

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
strike they want it to fall real fast in

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:50.009 
strike they want it to fall real fast in
front<00:02:39.950> of<00:02:40.040> their<00:02:40.159> face<00:02:40.400> and<00:02:40.430> just<00:02:40.909> move<00:02:41.239> out
