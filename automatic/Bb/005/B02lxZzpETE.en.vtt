game<00:00:23.070> which<00:00:23.640> was<00:00:23.850> actually<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.240> computer<00:00:24.810> game

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
game which was actually a computer game

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.689 
game which was actually a computer game
that<00:00:25.199> was<00:00:25.320> turned<00:00:25.590> into<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.980> game<00:00:26.340> for<00:00:26.609> the

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
that was turned into a game for the

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.200 
that was turned into a game for the
nintendo<00:00:27.240> wii<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.810> nintendo<00:00:28.289> DS<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:29.210> the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
nintendo wii and the nintendo DS so the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.209 
nintendo wii and the nintendo DS so the
basics<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.810> game<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.439> have<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:31.949> guy

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
basics of the game is you have this guy

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.690 
basics of the game is you have this guy
bosch<00:00:32.669> which<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:34.320> draw<00:00:34.530> lines<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.219> he<00:00:35.370> draws

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
bosch which you draw lines and he draws

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.910 
bosch which you draw lines and he draws
he<00:00:36.149> writes<00:00:36.390> down<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.840> sled<00:00:37.140> on<00:00:37.380> those<00:00:37.680> lines

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
he writes down the sled on those lines

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.920 
he writes down the sled on those lines
so<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.250> uses<00:00:38.399> gravity<00:00:38.760> let<00:00:39.510> me<00:00:39.570> change<00:00:39.809> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
so it uses gravity let me change the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.229 
so it uses gravity let me change the
options<00:00:40.500> really<00:00:40.710> quick<00:00:41.180> just<00:00:43.730> to<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.940> day

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
options really quick just to the day

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.709 
options really quick just to the day
mode<00:00:45.600> there's<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.530> couple<00:00:46.680> options<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.399> can

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
mode there's a couple options you can

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.060 
mode there's a couple options you can
draw<00:00:48.719> on<00:00:48.750> pan<00:00:49.140> I'll<00:00:49.440> explain<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.770> whenever

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
draw on pan I'll explain that whenever

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.100 
draw on pan I'll explain that whenever
you<00:00:50.280> draw<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.670> line<00:00:50.969> it'll<00:00:51.210> actually<00:00:51.449> switch<00:00:51.870> to

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
you draw a line it'll actually switch to

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.689 
you draw a line it'll actually switch to
the<00:00:52.230> pan<00:00:52.469> tool<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.920> make<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.219> move<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.520> real

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
the pan tool to make you move it real

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:54.799 
the pan tool to make you move it real
quick<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.059> i'll<00:00:54.149> show<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.390> during<00:00:54.719> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
quick and i'll show you during the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.900 
quick and i'll show you during the
gameplay<00:00:55.020> i'm<00:00:56.010> going<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.190> take<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.460> nitro

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
gameplay i'm going to take the nitro

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.330 
gameplay i'm going to take the nitro
right<00:00:57.390> off<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.930> gravity<00:00:58.109> tilt<00:00:58.559> off<00:00:58.770> gravity

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
right off the gravity tilt off gravity

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.660 
right off the gravity tilt off gravity
tilt<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.940> actually<00:01:00.239> pretty<00:01:00.480> pretty<00:01:00.899> fun<00:01:01.230> to

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
tilt is actually pretty pretty fun to

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.100 
tilt is actually pretty pretty fun to
gravity<00:01:02.670> tilt<00:01:02.910> just<00:01:03.120> basically<00:01:03.510> uses<00:01:03.989> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
gravity tilt just basically uses the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.340 
gravity tilt just basically uses the
accelerometer<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:05.100> if<00:01:05.659> bosh<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.689> writing<00:01:07.320> down

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
accelerometer so if bosh is writing down

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.760 
accelerometer so if bosh is writing down
this<00:01:07.650> down<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.520> hill<00:01:08.729> at<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.260> at<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.320> angle

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
this down the hill at this at this angle

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.530 
this down the hill at this at this angle
you<00:01:11.070> can<00:01:11.250> actually<00:01:11.549> tilt<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.939> iphone<00:01:12.330> like

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
you can actually tilt the iphone like

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.420 
you can actually tilt the iphone like
this<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.020> box<00:01:13.229> will<00:01:13.470> just<00:01:13.680> fly<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:13.979> way<00:01:14.369> so

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
this and box will just fly this way so

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.730 
this and box will just fly this way so
it<00:01:14.729> basically<00:01:14.960> whichever<00:01:15.960> way<00:01:16.140> your<00:01:16.350> iphone

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
it basically whichever way your iphone

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.499 
it basically whichever way your iphone
is<00:01:16.920> tilted<00:01:17.310> that's<00:01:17.490> which<00:01:17.729> way<00:01:17.909> gravity<00:01:18.180> is

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
is tilted that's which way gravity is

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.630 
is tilted that's which way gravity is
going<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.799> sound<00:01:20.100> we're<00:01:20.280> going<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.520> leave

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
going and sound we're going to leave

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.310 
going and sound we're going to leave
that<00:01:20.670> on<00:01:20.850> i<00:01:21.030> actually<00:01:21.479> have<00:01:21.600> sound<00:01:21.869> off<00:01:22.080> right

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
that on i actually have sound off right

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.630 
that on i actually have sound off right
now<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:22.710> it's<00:01:22.860> not<00:01:23.009> really<00:01:23.340> going<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.490> matter

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
now so it's not really going to matter

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.630 
now so it's not really going to matter
so<00:01:23.970> i'm<00:01:24.810> going<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.990> go<00:01:25.110> ahead<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.409> click<00:01:26.369> done

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
so i'm going to go ahead and click done

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.280 
so i'm going to go ahead and click done
right<00:01:26.880> there<00:01:27.060> we'll<00:01:27.540> go<00:01:27.659> back<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.020> game

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
right there we'll go back to the game

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.539 
right there we'll go back to the game
and<00:01:28.640> here's<00:01:29.640> actually<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.500> oops<00:01:31.500> let<00:01:32.220> me<00:01:32.280> erase

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
and here's actually a oops let me erase

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.300 
and here's actually a oops let me erase
that<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.790> just<00:01:33.060> drew<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.299> line<00:01:34.009> I'm<00:01:35.009> going<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.220> go

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
that I just drew a line I'm going to go

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.420 
that I just drew a line I'm going to go
to<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.520> pan<00:01:35.790> tool<00:01:36.090> right<00:01:36.299> now<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:37.280> if<00:01:38.280> you

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
to the pan tool right now and if you

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.870 
to the pan tool right now and if you
could<00:01:38.610> see<00:01:38.909> it's<00:01:39.150> actually<00:01:39.570> switching<00:01:40.880> I

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
could see it's actually switching I

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.910 
could see it's actually switching I
actually<00:01:42.570> have<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.170> looks<00:01:43.350> like<00:01:43.500> i<00:01:43.530> have<00:01:43.619> i'm

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
actually have it looks like i have i'm

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.200 
actually have it looks like i have i'm
going<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.100> go<00:01:44.189> ahead<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.460> just<00:01:44.579> play<00:01:44.820> this<00:01:45.060> so

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
going to go ahead and just play this so

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.030 
going to go ahead and just play this so
you<00:01:45.299> can<00:01:45.360> see<00:01:45.630> how<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.780> goes<00:01:45.930> there's<00:01:46.770> bosch

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
you can see how it goes there's bosch

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.700 
you can see how it goes there's bosch
right<00:01:47.280> now<00:01:47.430> I've<00:01:47.579> already<00:01:47.759> drawn<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.119> line<00:01:48.710> and

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
right now I've already drawn a line and

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:57.350 
right now I've already drawn a line and
he's<00:01:50.070> flying<00:01:50.460> down<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.850> hill<00:01:54.920> and<00:01:56.090> so<00:01:57.090> he<00:01:57.210> just

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
he's flying down the hill and so he just

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.450 
he's flying down the hill and so he just
fell<00:01:57.600> off<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.810> slide<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.530> that's<00:01:59.070> really<00:01:59.340> all

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
fell off the slide and that's really all

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.950 
fell off the slide and that's really all
this<00:01:59.880> game<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:00.509> I'm<00:02:00.600> going<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.780> go<00:02:00.930> ahead

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
this game is so I'm going to go ahead

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.200 
this game is so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:01.229> start<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.710> new<00:02:01.740> game<00:02:01.920> just<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:03.000> can<00:02:03.149> see

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
and start a new game just so you can see

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.600 
and start a new game just so you can see
here's<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.229> new<00:02:04.409> game<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.770> just<00:02:04.950> start<00:02:05.219> drawing

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
here's a new game you just start drawing

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.249 
here's a new game you just start drawing
a<00:02:05.790> line<00:02:07.670> and<00:02:08.670> then<00:02:08.970> Bosh<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.599> see<00:02:09.899> now<00:02:10.110> it

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
a line and then Bosh and see now it

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.930 
a line and then Bosh and see now it
switches<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.920> pan<00:02:11.220> tool<00:02:11.459> so<00:02:11.640> that's<00:02:11.819> what

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
switches to that pan tool so that's what

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.980 
switches to that pan tool so that's what
I<00:02:11.970> was<00:02:12.120> saying<00:02:12.390> so<00:02:12.959> every<00:02:13.349> time<00:02:13.379> you<00:02:13.590> go

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
I was saying so every time you go

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.960 
I was saying so every time you go
to<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.320> every<00:02:14.890> time<00:02:15.040> you<00:02:15.100> draw<00:02:15.490> a<00:02:15.520> line<00:02:15.790> it

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
to the every time you draw a line it

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.520 
to the every time you draw a line it
switches<00:02:16.210> to<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.540> pan<00:02:16.840> tool<00:02:17.080> so<00:02:17.260> you<00:02:17.320> can

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
switches to the pan tool so you can

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.410 
switches to the pan tool so you can
immediately<00:02:17.770> move<00:02:18.310> it<00:02:18.430> up<00:02:18.580> like<00:02:18.790> this<00:02:18.820> and

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
immediately move it up like this and

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.240 
immediately move it up like this and
then<00:02:19.750> as<00:02:19.870> soon<00:02:19.900> as<00:02:20.140> I<00:02:20.230> move<00:02:20.440> it<00:02:20.560> up<00:02:20.680> i<00:02:20.860> can<00:02:21.040> draw

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
then as soon as I move it up i can draw

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.700 
then as soon as I move it up i can draw
another<00:02:21.550> line<00:02:21.670> again<00:02:22.350> same<00:02:23.350> thing<00:02:23.560> it<00:02:23.650> will

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
another line again same thing it will

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.250 
another line again same thing it will
switch<00:02:23.920> to<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.160> pan<00:02:24.400> tool<00:02:24.610> again<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.260> so

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
switch to the pan tool again and so

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.590 
switch to the pan tool again and so
there's<00:02:27.130> three<00:02:27.340> different<00:02:27.520> lines<00:02:28.000> or<00:02:28.390> three

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
there's three different lines or three

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.290 
there's three different lines or three
different<00:02:28.780> color<00:02:29.140> lines<00:02:29.440> we<00:02:30.040> have<00:02:30.070> blue<00:02:30.640> red

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
different color lines we have blue red

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.090 
different color lines we have blue red
and<00:02:31.570> green<00:02:32.050> different<00:02:32.500> lines<00:02:32.680> and<00:02:32.920> then<00:02:33.010> we

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
and green different lines and then we

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.340 
and green different lines and then we
also<00:02:33.250> have<00:02:33.400> this<00:02:33.640> magnetic<00:02:34.150> this<00:02:35.080> little

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
also have this magnetic this little

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.990 
also have this magnetic this little
magnet<00:02:35.650> at<00:02:35.740> the<00:02:35.890> end<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.460> blue<00:02:36.700> line<00:02:36.970> is

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
magnet at the end the blue line is

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.530 
magnet at the end the blue line is
basically<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:37.900> free<00:02:38.280> free<00:02:39.280> line<00:02:39.520> tool<00:02:39.820> the<00:02:40.330> blue

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
basically a free free line tool the blue

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.250 
basically a free free line tool the blue
line<00:02:40.780> i<00:02:40.810> can<00:02:41.110> draw<00:02:41.350> in<00:02:42.010> any<00:02:42.130> angle<00:02:42.580> or<00:02:43.360> not<00:02:44.080> in

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
line i can draw in any angle or not in

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.930 
line i can draw in any angle or not in
any<00:02:44.470> angle<00:02:44.740> i<00:02:44.800> can<00:02:45.010> i<00:02:45.130> can<00:02:45.190> draw<00:02:45.460> anywhere<00:02:45.790> the

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
any angle i can i can draw anywhere the

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.720 
any angle i can i can draw anywhere the
red<00:02:46.120> line<00:02:46.410> actually<00:02:47.410> is<00:02:47.770> an<00:02:47.920> accelerating

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
red line actually is an accelerating

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.910 
red line actually is an accelerating
line<00:02:48.970> so<00:02:49.270> the<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.780> red<00:02:49.990> line<00:02:50.200> if<00:02:50.380> you<00:02:50.530> put<00:02:50.770> the

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
line so the the red line if you put the

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.580 
line so the the red line if you put the
red<00:02:51.100> line<00:02:51.310> if<00:02:51.580> you<00:02:51.700> drew<00:02:51.880> let's<00:02:52.270> say<00:02:52.590> let's

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
red line if you drew let's say let's

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.330 
red line if you drew let's say let's
draw<00:02:53.830> a<00:02:53.860> red<00:02:54.130> line<00:02:54.340> right<00:02:54.550> here<00:02:55.980> once<00:02:56.980> Bosh

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
draw a red line right here once Bosh

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.240 
draw a red line right here once Bosh
hits<00:02:57.670> this<00:02:57.940> line<00:02:58.270> he<00:02:58.570> will<00:02:58.720> accelerate<00:02:59.200> so<00:02:59.770> you

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
hits this line he will accelerate so you

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.190 
hits this line he will accelerate so you
can<00:03:00.400> see<00:03:00.550> the<00:03:00.640> little<00:03:00.790> dots<00:03:01.090> on<00:03:01.300> the<00:03:01.390> bottom<00:03:01.750> so

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
can see the little dots on the bottom so

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.960 
can see the little dots on the bottom so
you<00:03:02.230> can<00:03:02.500> almost<00:03:02.680> I<00:03:03.100> mean<00:03:03.310> you<00:03:03.430> can<00:03:03.610> draw<00:03:03.790> this

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
you can almost I mean you can draw this

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.610 
you can almost I mean you can draw this
line<00:03:04.030> straight<00:03:04.540> up<00:03:04.690> in<00:03:04.840> box<00:03:05.080> will<00:03:05.350> just

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
line straight up in box will just

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.620 
line straight up in box will just
accelerate<00:03:06.310> on<00:03:06.490> this<00:03:06.760> lineup<00:03:07.210> even<00:03:07.390> though

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
accelerate on this lineup even though

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.930 
accelerate on this lineup even though
gravity<00:03:07.960> is<00:03:08.260> going<00:03:08.530> down<00:03:08.740> you<00:03:09.400> also<00:03:09.610> have

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
gravity is going down you also have

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.090 
gravity is going down you also have
straight<00:03:10.360> lines<00:03:10.660> that<00:03:10.900> you<00:03:10.990> can<00:03:11.170> draw<00:03:11.350> these

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
straight lines that you can draw these

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.680 
straight lines that you can draw these
again<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:13.570> lines<00:03:13.810> are<00:03:13.990> straight<00:03:14.230> and<00:03:15.690> the

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
again the lines are straight and the

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.190 
again the lines are straight and the
green<00:03:16.930> lines<00:03:17.230> are<00:03:17.800> are<00:03:18.610> for<00:03:19.180> scenery<00:03:19.510> so<00:03:19.900> if<00:03:20.080> i

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
green lines are are for scenery so if i

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.870 
green lines are are for scenery so if i
want<00:03:20.410> to<00:03:20.500> draw<00:03:20.680> background<00:03:21.250> images<00:03:21.670> like<00:03:21.850> a

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
want to draw background images like a

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.300 
want to draw background images like a
tree<00:03:22.240> or<00:03:22.420> something<00:03:22.450> i<00:03:22.900> can<00:03:23.350> draw<00:03:23.530> a<00:03:23.860> green

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
tree or something i can draw a green

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.010 
tree or something i can draw a green
line<00:03:24.520> and<00:03:24.730> it<00:03:24.820> won't<00:03:24.970> matter<00:03:25.180> Bosh<00:03:25.570> will<00:03:25.870> go

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
line and it won't matter Bosh will go

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.170 
line and it won't matter Bosh will go
right<00:03:26.200> through<00:03:26.500> so<00:03:26.740> the<00:03:27.280> red<00:03:27.550> and<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:27.910> blue

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
right through so the red and the blue

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.150 
right through so the red and the blue
lines<00:03:28.480> Bosh<00:03:28.810> will<00:03:29.080> actually<00:03:29.470> write<00:03:29.770> on<00:03:29.980> them

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
lines Bosh will actually write on them

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.250 
lines Bosh will actually write on them
the<00:03:30.580> green<00:03:30.850> line<00:03:31.090> is<00:03:31.300> just<00:03:31.510> for<00:03:31.660> senior<00:03:31.990> if<00:03:32.110> you
