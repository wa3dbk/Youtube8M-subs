00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
like three rides on the new top end my

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.039 
like three rides on the new top end my
clutch<00:01:31.280> levers<00:01:32.280> still<00:01:32.520> plying<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.090> side

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
clutch levers still plying on the side

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.000 
clutch levers still plying on the side
casing<00:01:35.299> my<00:01:36.299> front<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.870> good<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.710> just<00:01:37.860> got

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
casing my front of it good I just got

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.490 
casing my front of it good I just got
oil<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:39.120> the<00:01:39.180> inside<00:01:39.540> cuz<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.840> exhaust<00:01:40.170> leaks

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
oil and the inside cuz the exhaust leaks

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.590 
oil and the inside cuz the exhaust leaks
and<00:01:41.190> then<00:01:41.280> back<00:01:41.490> here<00:01:41.700> comes<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.120> exhaust<00:01:42.420> up

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
and then back here comes the exhaust up

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.180 
and then back here comes the exhaust up
there<00:01:43.040> but<00:01:44.040> otherwise<00:01:45.409> still<00:01:46.409> really<00:01:46.590> good<00:01:46.680> I

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
there but otherwise still really good I

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.120 
there but otherwise still really good I
think<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.150> goes<00:01:48.270> faster<00:01:48.720> than<00:01:49.040> pretty<00:01:50.040> much

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
think it goes faster than pretty much

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:59.710 
think it goes faster than pretty much
most<00:01:51.140> most<00:01:52.820> cr80<00:01:53.820> experts<00:01:54.330> but<00:01:55.049> that's<00:01:55.979> good

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720
