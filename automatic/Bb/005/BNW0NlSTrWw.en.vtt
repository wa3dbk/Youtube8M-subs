because you know that's the way the

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:49.510 
because you know that's the way the
world<00:05:47.630> works<00:05:48.020> is<00:05:48.319> you<00:05:48.470> gotta<00:05:48.620> have<00:05:48.800> credit<00:05:49.190> and

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
I would recommend everyone to start

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.159 
I would recommend everyone to start
building<00:05:51.169> credit<00:05:51.349> very<00:05:51.800> early<00:05:52.159> because

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
building credit very early because

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:55.480 
building credit very early because
otherwise<00:05:54.169> you'll<00:05:54.620> get<00:05:54.740> trouble<00:05:55.220> later<00:05:55.370> on

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
otherwise you'll get trouble later on

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.040 
otherwise you'll get trouble later on
when<00:05:55.699> you're<00:05:55.819> trying<00:05:56.000> to<00:05:56.120> apply<00:05:56.360> for<00:05:56.449> like<00:05:56.870> you

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
when you're trying to apply for like you

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.809

know car loans and mortgages and all

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:01.270 
know car loans and mortgages and all
that<00:05:59.139> so<00:06:00.139> that's<00:06:00.440> all<00:06:00.560> I<00:06:00.590> can<00:06:00.710> work<00:06:00.860> on<00:06:01.009> for<00:06:01.220> the

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 
that so that's all I can work on for the

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.890 
that so that's all I can work on for the
next<00:06:01.370> year<00:06:01.729> because<00:06:01.940> my<00:06:02.449> parents<00:06:02.690> never

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
next year because my parents never

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.960 
next year because my parents never
taught<00:06:03.110> me<00:06:03.319> about<00:06:03.409> it<00:06:03.530> so<00:06:04.340> I<00:06:04.370> just<00:06:04.669> learned

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
taught me about it so I just learned

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.730 
taught me about it so I just learned
about<00:06:05.120> it<00:06:05.330> like<00:06:05.389> a<00:06:05.449> year<00:06:05.659> ago<00:06:05.780> so<00:06:06.169> I<00:06:06.409> got<00:06:06.680> to

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
about it like a year ago so I got to

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.120 
about it like a year ago so I got to
start<00:06:06.919> building<00:06:07.280> um<00:06:08.469> so<00:06:09.469> that<00:06:09.590> was<00:06:09.710> my<00:06:09.740> bit<00:06:10.039> of

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
start building um so that was my bit of

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.469 
start building um so that was my bit of
advice<00:06:10.639> I<00:06:10.849> think<00:06:11.030> I've<00:06:11.150> said<00:06:11.300> it<00:06:11.449> before

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:11.479 
advice I think I've said it before

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:15.249 
advice I think I've said it before
actually<00:06:12.169> which<00:06:12.590> is<00:06:12.710> kind<00:06:12.919> of<00:06:12.949> funny<00:06:14.050> so<00:06:15.050> it's

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:15.259 
actually which is kind of funny so it's

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:17.110 
actually which is kind of funny so it's
about<00:06:15.380> you<00:06:15.710> know<00:06:15.800> it's<00:06:16.039> about<00:06:16.159> a<00:06:16.550> 20<00:06:17.090> minute

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
about you know it's about a 20 minute

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.950 
about you know it's about a 20 minute
drive<00:06:17.389> from<00:06:17.840> the<00:06:17.990> creature<00:06:18.229> house<00:06:18.500> ah<00:06:19.960> but

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
drive from the creature house ah but

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.779 
drive from the creature house ah but
that's<00:06:21.199> only<00:06:21.440> if<00:06:21.650> I<00:06:21.889> hit<00:06:22.099> like<00:06:22.130> all<00:06:22.490> the<00:06:22.639> red

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:22.789 
that's only if I hit like all the red

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:24.040 
that's only if I hit like all the red
lights<00:06:22.820> so<00:06:23.270> i<00:06:23.300> could<00:06:23.539> probably<00:06:23.690> it<00:06:23.840> there<00:06:23.990> in

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
lights so i could probably it there in

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.990 
lights so i could probably it there in
15<00:06:24.440> minutes<00:06:24.800> but<00:06:25.159> that's<00:06:25.370> not<00:06:25.490> too<00:06:25.669> bad<00:06:25.699> of<00:06:25.880> a

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
15 minutes but that's not too bad of a

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.959 
15 minutes but that's not too bad of a
commute<00:06:26.360> so<00:06:27.229> i'll<00:06:27.409> be<00:06:27.560> there<00:06:27.770> you<00:06:28.219> know<00:06:28.250> more

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:28.969 
commute so i'll be there you know more

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:32.260 
commute so i'll be there you know more
