00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.810 

right<00:00:21.270> now<00:00:21.689> I've<00:00:22.020> put<00:00:22.230> this<00:00:22.439> these<00:00:23.400> two<00:00:23.609> pieces

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
right now I've put this these two pieces

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.609 
right now I've put this these two pieces
on<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.359> rubber<00:00:24.539> blocks<00:00:24.930> just<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.320> show

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
on the rubber blocks just to show

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.009 
on the rubber blocks just to show
exactly<00:00:26.099> how<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:27.119> can<00:00:27.390> tell<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.689> difference

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
exactly how you can tell the difference

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.040 
exactly how you can tell the difference
in<00:00:28.140> fired<00:00:28.439> an<00:00:28.680> unfired<00:00:29.250> PMC<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.840> rate<00:00:31.019> of

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
in fired an unfired PMC and the rate of

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.410 
in fired an unfired PMC and the rate of
the<00:00:31.230> shrinkage<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.180> piece

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
the shrinkage so this is the piece

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.810 
the shrinkage so this is the piece
that's<00:00:33.450> unfired<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:35.010> as<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.190> can<00:00:35.280> see<00:00:35.340> it's<00:00:35.700> a

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
that's unfired and as you can see it's a

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.330 
that's unfired and as you can see it's a
slightly<00:00:36.120> more<00:00:36.420> gray<00:00:36.780> color<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.739> that's<00:00:38.070> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
slightly more gray color and that's the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.369 
slightly more gray color and that's the
piece<00:00:38.579> that's<00:00:38.790> fired<00:00:39.270> which<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.809> now<00:00:39.989> white

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
piece that's fired which is now white

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.100 
piece that's fired which is now white
and<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:41.550> therefore<00:00:41.820> about<00:00:42.390> 10<00:00:42.690> percent

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
and is therefore about 10 percent

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.389 
and is therefore about 10 percent
smaller<00:00:43.440> than<00:00:43.649> this<00:00:43.890> one<00:00:43.950> as<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.280> know

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
smaller than this one as you know

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.790 
smaller than this one as you know
previously<00:00:45.390> we<00:00:45.510> use<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.840> same<00:00:46.050> circle<00:00:46.559> cutter

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
previously we use the same circle cutter

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.860 
previously we use the same circle cutter
so<00:00:47.100> we<00:00:47.129> know<00:00:47.399> it's<00:00:47.579> exactly<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.120> same<00:00:48.360> size<00:00:48.629> to

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
so we know it's exactly the same size to

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.660 
so we know it's exactly the same size to
start<00:00:48.930> with<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.590> that's<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.190> amount<00:00:50.520> that

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
start with and that's the amount that

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.970 
start with and that's the amount that
it's<00:00:50.969> shrunk<00:00:51.239> during<00:00:51.480> firing<00:00:51.870> now<00:00:52.649> because

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
it's shrunk during firing now because

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.529 
it's shrunk during firing now because
you're<00:00:53.129> applying<00:00:53.370> direct<00:00:53.940> heat<00:00:54.210> quite

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
you're applying direct heat quite

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.439 
you're applying direct heat quite
quickly<00:00:54.870> using<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.500> butane<00:00:55.890> gas<00:00:55.980> torch<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:57.300> will

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
quickly using a butane gas torch it will

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.810 
quickly using a butane gas torch it will
actually<00:00:57.600> shrink<00:00:58.320> more<00:00:58.710> during<00:00:59.430> gap<00:00:59.640> there

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
actually shrink more during gap there

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.970 
actually shrink more during gap there
torch<00:01:00.149> firing<00:01:00.690> than<00:01:01.050> if<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.289> fired<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:01.859> a

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
torch firing than if you fired it in a

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.139 
torch firing than if you fired it in a
kiln<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.550> kiln<00:01:02.760> they've<00:01:02.879> got<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.059> little

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
kiln and the kiln they've got a little

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.820 
kiln and the kiln they've got a little
bit<00:01:03.300> more<00:01:03.570> control<00:01:03.960> over<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.350> shrinkage

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
bit more control over the shrinkage

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.899 
bit more control over the shrinkage
because<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.610> can<00:01:05.790> fire<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.270> lower<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.170> longer

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
because you can fire it lower and longer

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.240 
because you can fire it lower and longer
and<00:01:08.909> then<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.390> stop<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.170> shrinkage<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.860> then

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
and then to stop the shrinkage and then

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.890 
and then to stop the shrinkage and then
higher<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.119> shorter<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.530> add<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.490> strength

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
higher and shorter to add the strength

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.780 
higher and shorter to add the strength
so<00:01:15.900> right<00:01:16.740> I'm<00:01:16.979> just<00:01:17.070> going<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.340> put<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.610> one

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
so right I'm just going to put this one

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.630 
so right I'm just going to put this one
aside<00:01:17.990> so<00:01:18.990> here<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.259> am<00:01:19.500> with<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.430> white

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
aside so here I am with this the white

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.120 
aside so here I am with this the white
one<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.780> here's<00:01:21.990> my<00:01:22.200> stainless<00:01:22.500> steel<00:01:22.830> brush

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
one so here's my stainless steel brush

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.710 
one so here's my stainless steel brush
that's<00:01:23.460> really<00:01:23.759> important<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.240> use<00:01:24.420> stainless

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
that's really important to use stainless

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.920 
that's really important to use stainless
steel<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.320> not<00:01:25.490> brass<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:27.240> brass<00:01:27.270> will<00:01:27.780> give

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
steel and not brass the brass will give

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.230 
steel and not brass the brass will give
you<00:01:28.320> know<00:01:28.439> obviously<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.040> brassy<00:01:29.520> finished<00:01:29.880> to

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
you know obviously a brassy finished to

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.810 
you know obviously a brassy finished to
the<00:01:30.390> PMC<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.110> as<00:01:31.409> its<00:01:31.590> porous<00:01:32.070> there's<00:01:32.430> no<00:01:32.640> way

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
the PMC and as its porous there's no way

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.300 
the PMC and as its porous there's no way
of<00:01:32.970> removing<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.890> nice<00:01:35.070> thing<00:01:35.280> about

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
of removing that so the nice thing about

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.039 
of removing that so the nice thing about
the<00:01:35.640> rubber<00:01:35.850> block<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.689> gives<00:01:36.869> a

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
the rubber block is that it gives a

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.350 
the rubber block is that it gives a
resistance<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.890> silver<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.729> simply<00:01:39.119> hold

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
resistance to the silver so simply hold

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:52.330 
resistance to the silver so simply hold
it<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:40.320> brush<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.890> get<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.880> matte<00:01:42.119> finish

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.020 

here<00:01:53.030> we've<00:01:53.240> got<00:01:53.270> a<00:01:53.780> matte<00:01:54.170> finish<00:01:54.970> now<00:01:55.970> to

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
here we've got a matte finish now to

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.900 
here we've got a matte finish now to
continue<00:01:56.510> you<00:01:56.810> can<00:01:56.840> burnish<00:01:57.440> either<00:01:58.370> using<00:01:58.820> an

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
continue you can burnish either using an

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.630 
continue you can burnish either using an
agate<00:01:59.240> burnisher<00:01:59.930> or<00:02:00.110> you<00:02:00.680> can<00:02:00.860> use<00:02:01.070> the<00:02:01.340> metal

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
agate burnisher or you can use the metal

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.330 
agate burnisher or you can use the metal
burnisher<00:02:02.210> here<00:02:02.480> so<00:02:03.080> use<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:03.560> curved<00:02:03.830> part<00:02:04.130> of

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
burnisher here so use the curved part of

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.749 
burnisher here so use the curved part of
the<00:02:04.460> burnish<00:02:04.820> up<00:02:05.060> and<00:02:06.220> press<00:02:07.220> down<00:02:08.679> and<00:02:09.679> a<00:02:10.580> good

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
the burnish up and press down and a good

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.670 
the burnish up and press down and a good
way<00:02:10.940> of<00:02:10.970> also<00:02:11.450> burnishing<00:02:11.990> is<00:02:12.200> always<00:02:12.560> the

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
way of also burnishing is always the

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.420 
way of also burnishing is always the
sides<00:02:12.980> of<00:02:13.280> your<00:02:13.310> pieces<00:02:14.950> give<00:02:15.950> them<00:02:16.130> a<00:02:16.220> nice

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
sides of your pieces give them a nice

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.560 
sides of your pieces give them a nice
finish<00:02:18.610> so<00:02:19.610> you<00:02:19.670> can<00:02:19.820> really<00:02:20.180> see<00:02:20.420> the

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
finish so you can really see the

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.480 
finish so you can really see the
difference<00:02:20.990> here<00:02:23.170> so<00:02:24.250> when<00:02:25.250> you've<00:02:25.370> got

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
difference here so when you've got

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.040 
difference here so when you've got
something<00:02:25.730> that's<00:02:26.000> really<00:02:26.300> has<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:26.840> nice

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
something that's really has a nice

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.760 
something that's really has a nice
texture<00:02:27.709> onto<00:02:27.830> it<00:02:28.300> it's<00:02:29.300> a<00:02:29.420> good<00:02:29.570> way<00:02:29.780> of<00:02:29.990> you

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
texture onto it it's a good way of you

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.860 
texture onto it it's a good way of you
know<00:02:31.060> showing<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.180> difference<00:02:32.600> in<00:02:32.750> the

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
know showing the difference in the

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.510 
know showing the difference in the
different<00:02:33.230> texture<00:02:33.680> levels<00:02:34.040> so<00:02:34.190> you<00:02:34.220> can<00:02:34.310> have

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
different texture levels so you can have

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.970 
different texture levels so you can have
a<00:02:34.550> map<00:02:34.850> and<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.209> high<00:02:35.360> shine<00:02:35.660> finish<00:02:35.860> in<00:02:36.860> the

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
a map and the high shine finish in the

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.480 
a map and the high shine finish in the
same<00:02:37.250> piece<00:02:40.330> okay<00:02:41.330> so<00:02:42.140> that's<00:02:42.380> it<00:02:42.650> if<00:02:43.100> you<00:02:43.310> want

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
same piece okay so that's it if you want

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:44.920 
same piece okay so that's it if you want
a<00:02:43.580> canoe<00:02:43.820> you<00:02:43.850> can<00:02:44.030> also<00:02:44.150> do<00:02:44.510> a<00:02:44.540> little<00:02:44.660> bit<00:02:44.900> of

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
a canoe you can also do a little bit of

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.810 
a canoe you can also do a little bit of
silver<00:02:45.290> polish<00:02:45.680> on<00:02:45.890> it<00:02:46.040> that<00:02:46.520> will<00:02:46.610> obviously

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
silver polish on it that will obviously

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.640 
silver polish on it that will obviously
make<00:02:47.120> it<00:02:47.300> slightly<00:02:47.750> more<00:02:47.900> shiny<00:02:48.350> because

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
make it slightly more shiny because

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.500 
make it slightly more shiny because
obviously<00:02:48.830> the<00:02:49.430> rubbers<00:02:49.790> come<00:02:50.030> off<00:02:50.180> on<00:02:50.390> the

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
obviously the rubbers come off on the

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.050 
obviously the rubbers come off on the
piece<00:02:50.890> there<00:02:51.890> you<00:02:51.980> go<00:02:52.160> she's<00:02:52.430> got<00:02:52.610> to<00:02:52.730> see<00:02:52.910> the

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
piece there you go she's got to see the

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.150 
piece there you go she's got to see the
difference<00:02:53.480> here<00:02:53.750> between<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.620> high<00:02:54.800> shine

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
difference here between the high shine

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.200 
difference here between the high shine
and<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:55.730> matte

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.270
