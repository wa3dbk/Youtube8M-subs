at the different uses for Dyneema slings
when<00:00:23.180> tried<00:00:23.510> climbing<00:00:23.920> firstly<00:00:24.920> it's<00:00:25.039> good<00:00:25.160> to

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
when tried climbing firstly it's good to

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.159 
when tried climbing firstly it's good to
understand<00:00:25.699> the<00:00:25.820> differences<00:00:26.240> between<00:00:26.300> the

slings that are an offer here we've got

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.520 
slings that are an offer here we've got
the<00:00:30.430> two<00:00:31.430> diameters<00:00:31.759> 11<00:00:32.599> mil<00:00:32.780> and<00:00:32.989> 8<00:00:33.079> mil<00:00:33.290> and

the two diameters 11 mil and 8 mil and

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.720 
the two diameters 11 mil and 8 mil and
although<00:00:33.680> they<00:00:33.920> both<00:00:34.100> have<00:00:34.250> exactly<00:00:34.400> the<00:00:34.700> same

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
although they both have exactly the same

although they both have exactly the same
strength<00:00:35.239> rating<00:00:35.720> 11<00:00:36.470> mil<00:00:36.590> is<00:00:36.680> a<00:00:36.710> little<00:00:36.980> bit

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
strength rating 11 mil is a little bit

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.009 
strength rating 11 mil is a little bit
more<00:00:37.190> hard<00:00:37.460> wearing<00:00:37.699> reject<00:00:38.540> mil<00:00:38.660> is<00:00:38.780> a<00:00:38.809> little

more hard wearing reject mil is a little

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:41.200 
more hard wearing reject mil is a little
bit<00:00:39.110> lighter<00:00:39.370> you've<00:00:40.370> also<00:00:40.489> got<00:00:40.699> them<00:00:40.790> here<00:00:40.970> in

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
bit lighter you've also got them here in

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.360 
bit lighter you've also got them here in
two<00:00:41.750> of<00:00:41.870> the<00:00:41.930> most<00:00:42.050> popular<00:00:42.320> lengths<00:00:42.830> we've

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
two of the most popular lengths we've

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.439 
two of the most popular lengths we've
got<00:00:43.519> a<00:00:43.550> 60<00:00:44.000> centimeter<00:00:45.010> and<00:00:46.010> a<00:00:46.100> 120<00:00:46.460> centimeter

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:47.449 
got a 60 centimeter and a 120 centimeter

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:49.299 
got a 60 centimeter and a 120 centimeter
these<00:00:48.230> start<00:00:48.559> all<00:00:48.769> the<00:00:48.920> way<00:00:48.980> down<00:00:49.190> at

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
these start all the way down at

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.729 
these start all the way down at
quick-draw<00:00:49.699> length<00:00:49.940> so<00:00:50.210> 12<00:00:50.690> centimeters<00:00:51.320> all

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
quick-draw length so 12 centimeters all

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.760 
quick-draw length so 12 centimeters all
the<00:00:52.010> way<00:00:52.100> up<00:00:52.250> to<00:00:52.460> 4<00:00:52.730> meters<00:00:53.440> so<00:00:54.440> there's<00:00:54.649> loads

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
the way up to 4 meters so there's loads

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.139 
the way up to 4 meters so there's loads
of<00:00:54.950> different<00:00:55.010> ways<00:00:55.370> to<00:00:55.550> use<00:00:55.700> slings<00:00:56.030> and

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
of different ways to use slings and

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:57.250 
of different ways to use slings and
we're<00:00:56.300> going<00:00:56.420> to<00:00:56.480> show<00:00:56.600> you<00:00:56.629> a<00:00:56.809> few<00:00:57.020> of<00:00:57.140> them

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
we're going to show you a few of them

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.189 
we're going to show you a few of them
but<00:00:58.129> essentially<00:00:58.699> they're<00:00:59.210> just<00:00:59.539> a<00:00:59.690> static

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
but essentially they're just a static

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.119 
but essentially they're just a static
fully<00:01:00.500> load<00:01:00.770> bearing<00:01:01.219> connector<00:01:02.859> so<00:01:03.859> here's<00:01:04.070> a

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
fully load bearing connector so here's a

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.330 
fully load bearing connector so here's a
really<00:01:04.280> great<00:01:04.520> example<00:01:04.640> of<00:01:04.970> use<00:01:05.210> for<00:01:05.360> a<00:01:05.449> sling

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
really great example of use for a sling

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.040 
really great example of use for a sling
sometimes<00:01:07.340> a<00:01:07.610> quick-draw<00:01:08.330> this<00:01:08.539> long<00:01:08.750> this<00:01:08.930> is

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
sometimes a quick-draw this long this is

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.170 
sometimes a quick-draw this long this is
a<00:01:09.080> 60<00:01:09.440> centimeter<00:01:09.830> sling<00:01:10.070> it<00:01:10.700> can<00:01:10.820> be<00:01:10.940> really

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
a 60 centimeter sling it can be really

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.029 
a 60 centimeter sling it can be really
handy<00:01:11.509> if<00:01:11.899> you're<00:01:12.050> extending<00:01:12.500> a<00:01:12.560> placement

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:13.039 
handy if you're extending a placement

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:15.340 
handy if you're extending a placement
from<00:01:13.220> out<00:01:13.729> under<00:01:14.180> a<00:01:14.240> roof<00:01:14.479> or<00:01:14.690> on<00:01:14.750> a<00:01:14.869> route<00:01:15.170> that

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
from out under a roof or on a route that

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.440 
from out under a roof or on a route that
wanders<00:01:15.740> around<00:01:15.860> a<00:01:16.130> lot<00:01:16.280> but<00:01:17.000> it's<00:01:17.119> pretty

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
wanders around a lot but it's pretty

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.880 
wanders around a lot but it's pretty
cumbersome<00:01:17.929> to<00:01:18.140> have<00:01:18.229> a<00:01:18.289> quick-draw<00:01:18.679> this

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
cumbersome to have a quick-draw this

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.010 
cumbersome to have a quick-draw this
long<00:01:19.070> hanging<00:01:19.369> from<00:01:19.580> your<00:01:19.670> harness<00:01:20.090> so<00:01:20.840> what

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
long hanging from your harness so what

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.779 
long hanging from your harness so what
you<00:01:21.110> can<00:01:21.259> do<00:01:21.440> is<00:01:21.860> make<00:01:22.160> it<00:01:22.190> an<00:01:22.369> extendable

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
you can do is make it an extendable

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:25.030 
you can do is make it an extendable
quick-draw<00:01:23.270> plus<00:01:24.200> one<00:01:24.380> of<00:01:24.470> the<00:01:24.530> carabiners

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
quick-draw plus one of the carabiners

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.060 
quick-draw plus one of the carabiners
through<00:01:25.430> the<00:01:25.580> other<00:01:25.700> and<00:01:25.970> clip<00:01:26.930> the<00:01:27.380> remaining

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
through the other and clip the remaining

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.490 
through the other and clip the remaining
two<00:01:28.430> bits<00:01:28.670> of<00:01:28.790> the<00:01:28.850> sling<00:01:29.090> then<00:01:29.930> you've<00:01:30.049> got<00:01:30.259> a

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
two bits of the sling then you've got a

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.740 
two bits of the sling then you've got a
quick-draw<00:01:31.460> which<00:01:31.640> isn't<00:01:32.210> any<00:01:32.330> longer<00:01:32.630> than

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
quick-draw which isn't any longer than

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.749 
quick-draw which isn't any longer than
your<00:01:32.840> others<00:01:33.080> and<00:01:33.860> to<00:01:34.040> use<00:01:34.220> it<00:01:34.400> you<00:01:34.549> simply

your others and to use it you simply

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.950 
your others and to use it you simply
take<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.930> rope<00:01:36.140> and<00:01:36.350> quick<00:01:36.680> carabiner<00:01:37.960> take

going to show you a couple of the most

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.590 
going to show you a couple of the most
popular<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:48.649> simplest<00:01:49.189> the<00:01:49.430> first<00:01:50.360> which

popular and simplest the first which

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.090 
popular and simplest the first which
works<00:01:50.840> really<00:01:51.049> well<00:01:51.200> with<00:01:51.350> 60<00:01:51.710> centimetre

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
end and it's there this also works with

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.370 
end and it's there this also works with
120<00:02:22.760> centimetre<00:02:23.180> slings<00:02:23.450> but<00:02:24.110> you<00:02:24.200> want<00:02:24.320> to

120 centimetre slings but you want to

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.759 
120 centimetre slings but you want to
double<00:02:24.739> them<00:02:24.860> over<00:02:25.100> first<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:26.380> then<00:02:27.380> start

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
double them over first and then start

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.349 
double them over first and then start
coiling<00:02:27.980> otherwise<00:02:28.459> they<00:02:28.940> end<00:02:29.060> up<00:02:29.120> hanging

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:29.359 
coiling otherwise they end up hanging

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:31.449 
coiling otherwise they end up hanging
down<00:02:29.630> by<00:02:29.780> your<00:02:29.930> knees<00:02:30.079> somewhere<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:31.430> other

this really great example of a thread if
we<00:02:59.970> were<00:03:00.090> on<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.180> route<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.600> wanted<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:00.810> use

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
we were on a route and wanted to use

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.360 
we were on a route and wanted to use
this<00:03:01.260> we'd<00:03:01.739> loop<00:03:02.069> it<00:03:02.250> sling<00:03:02.760> through<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:04.370> clip

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
this we'd loop it sling through and clip

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.160 
this we'd loop it sling through and clip
it<00:03:05.489> back<00:03:05.640> in<00:03:05.820> then<00:03:06.330> we<00:03:06.420> could<00:03:06.570> clip<00:03:06.750> our<00:03:06.900> ropes

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
it back in then we could clip our ropes

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.810 
it back in then we could clip our ropes
to<00:03:07.380> that<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.769> as<00:03:08.040> long<00:03:08.220> as<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.430> rock<00:03:08.610> was

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
to that and as long as the rock was

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.670 
to that and as long as the rock was
solid<00:03:09.120> and<00:03:09.269> there<00:03:09.360> was<00:03:09.450> no<00:03:09.570> sharp<00:03:09.870> edges<00:03:10.080> it's

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
solid and there was no sharp edges it's

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.650 
solid and there was no sharp edges it's
a<00:03:10.800> pretty<00:03:10.980> bomb<00:03:11.160> a<00:03:11.190> bit<00:03:11.400> of<00:03:11.489> gear<00:03:11.670> so<00:03:11.850> this<00:03:12.510> is

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
a pretty bomb a bit of gear so this is

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.690 
a pretty bomb a bit of gear so this is
an<00:03:12.780> example<00:03:13.110> of<00:03:13.320> how<00:03:13.470> we<00:03:13.530> can<00:03:13.800> use<00:03:13.980> a<00:03:14.010> 1<00:03:14.310> 20

sling with a carabiner and clip it to

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.470 
sling with a carabiner and clip it to
one<00:03:33.150> of<00:03:33.180> your<00:03:33.269> pieces<00:03:33.450> of<00:03:33.630> gear<00:03:33.860> and<00:03:34.860> then<00:03:35.850> make

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
one of your pieces of gear and then make

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.580 
one of your pieces of gear and then make
sure<00:03:36.510> your<00:03:37.500> carabiner<00:03:38.070> is<00:03:38.430> opening<00:03:38.880> up<00:03:39.000> right

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
sure your carabiner is opening up right

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.569 
sure your carabiner is opening up right
then<00:03:40.590> we're<00:03:40.709> going<00:03:40.829> to<00:03:40.890> start<00:03:41.100> pulling<00:03:41.340> up<00:03:41.489> the

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
then we're going to start pulling up the

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.940 
then we're going to start pulling up the
rope<00:03:41.760> making<00:03:42.060> some<00:03:42.299> coils<00:03:42.690> you<00:03:43.530> can<00:03:43.680> make<00:03:43.799> the

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
rope making some coils you can make the

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.520 
rope making some coils you can make the
first<00:03:44.160> coils<00:03:44.910> really<00:03:45.420> quite<00:03:45.660> long<00:03:45.930> and<00:03:46.140> then

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
first coils really quite long and then

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.789 
first coils really quite long and then
start<00:03:47.010> to<00:03:47.130> get<00:03:47.280> shorter<00:03:47.760> as<00:03:47.970> you<00:03:48.239> go<00:03:48.360> on<00:03:48.680> so<00:03:49.680> now

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
start to get shorter as you go on so now

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.259 
start to get shorter as you go on so now
we've<00:03:49.980> called<00:03:50.280> up<00:03:50.519> all<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.790> slack<00:03:51.000> in<00:03:51.150> our

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
we've called up all the slack in our

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.140 
we've called up all the slack in our
rope<00:03:51.450> using<00:03:52.260> this<00:03:52.500> sling<00:03:52.829> we<00:03:53.610> can<00:03:53.760> clip<00:03:54.000> these

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
rope using this sling we can clip these

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.440 
rope using this sling we can clip these
coils<00:03:54.420> into<00:03:54.750> our<00:03:54.959> belay<00:03:55.350> and<00:03:56.150> start<00:03:57.150> bringing

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
coils into our belay and start bringing

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.380 
coils into our belay and start bringing
up<00:03:57.510> our<00:03:57.690> second<00:03:58.110> like<00:03:58.230> we<00:03:58.320> normally<00:03:58.440> would<00:03:59.390> so

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
up our second like we normally would so

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.819 
up our second like we normally would so
now<00:04:00.540> when<00:04:00.690> our<00:04:00.780> climber<00:04:01.049> moves<00:04:01.320> away<00:04:01.470> from<00:04:01.590> the

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
now when our climber moves away from the

now when our climber moves away from the
be<00:04:02.010> late<00:04:02.299> because<00:04:03.299> of<00:04:03.510> these<00:04:03.690> coils<00:04:04.549> we<00:04:05.549> can

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
be late because of these coils we can

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.069 
be late because of these coils we can
pay<00:04:05.850> rope<00:04:06.060> out<00:04:06.269> smoothly<00:04:06.630> without<00:04:06.900> any

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
pay rope out smoothly without any

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.620 
pay rope out smoothly without any
tangles<00:04:07.910> here's<00:04:08.910> another<00:04:09.180> way<00:04:09.359> of<00:04:09.480> keeping

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
tangles here's another way of keeping

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.270 
tangles here's another way of keeping
your<00:04:09.840> ropes<00:04:10.049> organized<00:04:10.470> at<00:04:10.650> a<00:04:10.709> belay<00:04:11.040> this

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
your ropes organized at a belay this

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.449 
your ropes organized at a belay this
time<00:04:11.489> if<00:04:11.730> you're<00:04:11.970> at<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.120> bottom<00:04:12.299> of<00:04:12.480> a<00:04:12.570> roof

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
time if you're at the bottom of a roof

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.259 
time if you're at the bottom of a roof
obviously<00:04:14.459> if<00:04:14.549> you're<00:04:14.700> at<00:04:14.790> the<00:04:14.850> bottom<00:04:15.000> of<00:04:15.120> Roo

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
obviously if you're at the bottom of Roo

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:16.610 
obviously if you're at the bottom of Roo
you<00:04:15.420> haven't<00:04:15.690> used<00:04:15.840> your<00:04:16.019> rope<00:04:16.200> yet<00:04:16.470> and

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
you haven't used your rope yet and

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.599 
you haven't used your rope yet and
they're<00:04:16.709> still<00:04:16.890> going<00:04:17.039> to<00:04:17.070> be<00:04:17.130> coiled<00:04:17.489> up

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
they're still going to be coiled up

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.460 
they're still going to be coiled up
separately<00:04:18.090> so<00:04:18.840> you<00:04:18.930> want<00:04:19.079> to<00:04:19.140> keep<00:04:19.260> them

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
separately so you want to keep them

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.590 
separately so you want to keep them
separate<00:04:19.890> if<00:04:20.250> you<00:04:20.459> haven't<00:04:20.669> got<00:04:20.760> a<00:04:20.789> Ledge<00:04:21.060> to

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
separate if you haven't got a Ledge to

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.020 
separate if you haven't got a Ledge to
Flake<00:04:21.810> them<00:04:21.989> out<00:04:22.079> on<00:04:22.430> all<00:04:23.430> you<00:04:23.580> need<00:04:23.729> to<00:04:23.820> do<00:04:23.910> is

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
Flake them out on all you need to do is

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.000 
Flake them out on all you need to do is
tie<00:04:24.240> up<00:04:24.419> knot<00:04:24.720> in<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.050> middle<00:04:25.110> of<00:04:25.380> your<00:04:25.440> sling

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
tie up knot in the middle of your sling

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.330 
tie up knot in the middle of your sling
then<00:04:29.010> your<00:04:29.190> first<00:04:29.430> rope

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.810 

can<00:04:33.340> be<00:04:33.430> coiled<00:04:33.790> onto<00:04:34.000> there<00:04:35.670> then<00:04:36.670> your

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
can be coiled onto there then your

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.080 
can be coiled onto there then your
second<00:04:37.120> rope<00:04:38.070> can<00:04:39.070> just<00:04:39.220> be<00:04:39.340> coil<00:04:39.580> onto<00:04:39.880> the

second rope can just be coil onto the
second<00:04:40.420> half<00:04:40.570> of<00:04:40.660> the<00:04:40.780> sling<00:04:40.990> and<00:04:41.820> they're

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
second half of the sling and they're

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.270 
second half of the sling and they're
both<00:04:42.970> kept<00:04:43.180> separate<00:04:43.630> you<00:04:44.110> can<00:04:44.260> lock<00:04:44.500> for<00:04:44.860> a<00:04:44.890> 60

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
both kept separate you can lock for a 60

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.700 
both kept separate you can lock for a 60
