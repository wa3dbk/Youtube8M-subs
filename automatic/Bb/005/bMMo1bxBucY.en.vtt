was really complicated and hard to

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.150

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
string involved so that was one of the

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.740 
string involved so that was one of the
problems<00:02:37.910> we<00:02:38.120> had<00:02:38.239> with<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.420> other<00:02:38.570> one

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
problems we had with the other one

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.600

because<00:02:38.900> it<00:02:39.110> had<00:02:39.230> this<00:02:39.380> needle<00:02:39.739> guard<00:02:39.950> on<00:02:40.220> the

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
because it had this needle guard on the

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.000

other<00:02:40.730> one<00:02:40.880> had<00:02:41.000> a<00:02:41.030> needle<00:02:41.209> guard<00:02:41.480> on<00:02:41.630> it<00:02:41.660> and

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
other one had a needle guard on it and

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.860 
other one had a needle guard on it and
it<00:02:43.010> was<00:02:43.190> really<00:02:43.550> hard<00:02:43.910> to<00:02:43.970> get<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.300> string<00:02:44.600> in

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.900 
it was really hard to get the string in

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
placing the fabric underneath the

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:19.790 
placing the fabric underneath the
needles<00:04:59.610> there's<00:05:00.120> three<00:05:00.390> needles<00:05:00.750> in<00:05:00.900> there

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.350 

and<00:05:20.800> turn<00:05:21.340> it<00:05:21.370> up<00:05:21.580> and<00:05:24.120> there's<00:05:25.120> a<00:05:25.210> little

and turn it up and there's a little

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.700 
and turn it up and there's a little
light<00:05:25.539> that<00:05:25.719> goes<00:05:25.870> out<00:05:26.020> when<00:05:26.199> to<00:05:26.229> turn<00:05:26.439> it<00:05:26.500> on

light that goes out when to turn it on

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.260 
light that goes out when to turn it on
apparently<00:05:27.159> it<00:05:27.370> was<00:05:27.520> already<00:05:27.729> out<00:05:27.849> and<00:05:28.000> I

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
apparently it was already out and I

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.029 
apparently it was already out and I
turned<00:05:28.569> it<00:05:28.659> off<00:05:28.750> I'm<00:05:29.050> silly<00:05:30.060> the<00:05:32.039> guard

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 
turned it off I'm silly the guard

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:34.679 
turned it off I'm silly the guard
prevents<00:05:33.520> your<00:05:33.699> fingers<00:05:34.060> from<00:05:34.389> hitting<00:05:34.569> the

00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:34.689 
prevents your fingers from hitting the

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:36.959 
prevents your fingers from hitting the
needles<00:05:35.169> at<00:05:35.259> all<00:05:35.500> it<00:05:35.889> doesn't<00:05:36.400> make<00:05:36.520> it<00:05:36.550> kind

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:36.969 
needles at all it doesn't make it kind

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:38.820 
needles at all it doesn't make it kind
of<00:05:37.090> difficult<00:05:37.300> when<00:05:37.810> you're<00:05:37.960> stacking<00:05:38.349> felt

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
of difficult when you're stacking felt

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.640 
of difficult when you're stacking felt
up<00:05:39.039> to<00:05:39.550> make<00:05:39.819> like<00:05:40.030> multiple<00:05:40.599> like<00:05:41.289> with<00:05:41.530> the

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
up to make like multiple like with the

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.189 
up to make like multiple like with the
purse<00:05:41.919> there<00:05:42.400> Lily<00:05:43.360> had<00:05:43.509> put<00:05:43.719> like<00:05:43.840> a<00:05:43.870> couple

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:44.199 
purse there Lily had put like a couple

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:45.629 
purse there Lily had put like a couple
designs<00:05:44.530> on<00:05:44.770> it<00:05:44.800> and<00:05:45.039> it<00:05:45.099> was<00:05:45.219> getting<00:05:45.400> kind<00:05:45.520> of

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639 
designs on it and it was getting kind of

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:47.339 
designs on it and it was getting kind of
hard<00:05:45.849> I<00:05:46.240> think<00:05:46.719> should<00:05:46.810> have<00:05:46.930> stacked<00:05:47.169> up<00:05:47.319> like

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:47.349 
hard I think should have stacked up like

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:48.659 
hard I think should have stacked up like
four<00:05:47.770> high<00:05:47.979> it<00:05:48.039> was<00:05:48.310> getting<00:05:48.520> a<00:05:48.550> little

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669 
four high it was getting a little

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:50.249 
four high it was getting a little
difficult<00:05:48.879> well<00:05:49.419> it<00:05:49.509> was<00:05:49.629> like<00:05:49.750> four<00:05:50.020> high<00:05:50.199> to

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:50.259 
difficult well it was like four high to

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:54.409 
difficult well it was like four high to
sit<00:05:50.620> underneath<00:05:51.009> the<00:05:51.539> needle<00:05:52.539> guard<00:05:52.860> but

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
sit underneath the needle guard but

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.629 
sit underneath the needle guard but
anyway<00:05:55.419> let's<00:05:55.750> see<00:05:55.900> what<00:05:56.050> I've<00:05:56.139> done<00:05:56.169> I<00:05:56.639> have

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:57.639 
anyway let's see what I've done I have

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:01.709 
anyway let's see what I've done I have
if<00:05:58.389> there's<00:05:58.779> no<00:05:58.990> string<00:05:59.379> and<00:06:00.479> it's<00:06:01.479> holding

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:01.719 
if there's no string and it's holding

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:03.959 
if there's no string and it's holding
together<00:06:02.069> and<00:06:03.069> that's<00:06:03.250> kind<00:06:03.430> of<00:06:03.490> what<00:06:03.639> felting

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:03.969 
together and that's kind of what felting

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:05.999 
together and that's kind of what felting
is<00:06:04.060> the<00:06:04.300> kind<00:06:04.509> of<00:06:04.629> pushes<00:06:05.110> the<00:06:05.560> fabric

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:06.009 
is the kind of pushes the fabric

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:08.330 
is the kind of pushes the fabric
together<00:06:06.279> in<00:06:06.819> a<00:06:06.939> way<00:06:07.120> that<00:06:07.150> holds<00:06:07.750> it<00:06:07.930> together

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
together in a way that holds it together

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.170 
together in a way that holds it together
but<00:06:09.419> that's<00:06:10.419> kind<00:06:10.750> of<00:06:10.840> neat<00:06:10.990> isn't<00:06:11.139> it<00:06:11.379> I<00:06:12.180> think

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180 
but that's kind of neat isn't it I think

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.350 
but that's kind of neat isn't it I think
it's<00:06:13.330> me<00:06:13.539> so<00:06:14.379> it<00:06:14.560> does<00:06:14.710> work<00:06:14.919> with<00:06:15.360> other

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
it's me so it does work with other

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.029 
it's me so it does work with other
fabrics<00:06:16.810> hopefully<00:06:17.289> you<00:06:17.560> can<00:06:17.710> see<00:06:17.919> this

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:18.039 
fabrics hopefully you can see this

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:20.600 
fabrics hopefully you can see this
pretty<00:06:18.219> problem<00:06:18.699> pulled<00:06:19.180> it<00:06:19.330> up<00:06:19.389> closer<00:06:19.689> and

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
pretty problem pulled it up closer and

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.689 
pretty problem pulled it up closer and
see<00:06:21.610> that<00:06:21.849> it<00:06:22.150> is<00:06:22.770> smooshed<00:06:23.770> together<00:06:24.219> there

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:24.699 
see that it is smooshed together there

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:27.749 
see that it is smooshed together there
it's<00:06:25.180> holding<00:06:26.009> but<00:06:27.009> I<00:06:27.099> thought<00:06:27.339> it<00:06:27.460> was<00:06:27.550> really

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:27.759 
it's holding but I thought it was really

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:29.129 
it's holding but I thought it was really
neat<00:06:27.909> I<00:06:28.060> thought<00:06:28.270> I'd<00:06:28.389> do<00:06:28.509> a<00:06:28.539> quick<00:06:28.779> video<00:06:28.960> just

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:29.139 
neat I thought I'd do a quick video just
