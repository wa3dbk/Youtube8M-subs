00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.820 
really like the tag I thought it was a
great<00:00:25.650> unique<00:00:25.980> way<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.720> take<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:28.019> bag

interesting<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.019> it's<00:00:31.140> not<00:00:31.230> just<00:00:31.289> like

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
interesting so it's not just like

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.310 
interesting so it's not just like
there's<00:00:32.279> my<00:00:32.430> red<00:00:32.640> bag<00:00:32.880> here's<00:00:33.480> my<00:00:33.690> second<00:00:34.140> bag

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
there's my red bag here's my second bag

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.810 
there's my red bag here's my second bag
here's<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.829> bed<00:00:35.040> oh<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.340> this<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.610> just

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
here's the bed oh so this is just

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.389 
here's the bed oh so this is just
basically<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.540> series<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.620> like<00:00:37.770> questions

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
basically a series of like questions

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.660 
basically a series of like questions
that<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.690> pulled<00:00:40.050> from<00:00:40.260> your<00:00:40.590> most-used<00:00:41.040> bags

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
that is pulled from your most-used bags

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.220 
that is pulled from your most-used bags
so<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.239> isn't<00:00:42.420> going<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.719> be<00:00:42.780> every<00:00:43.050> single

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
so this isn't going to be every single

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.440 
so this isn't going to be every single
bag<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.680> own<00:00:43.860> bizarre<00:00:44.309> my<00:00:44.550> favorite<00:00:44.910> bags<00:00:45.120> and

actually like a lot of room in here of

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.350 
actually like a lot of room in here of
that<00:03:00.860> I<00:03:01.100> love<00:03:01.280> like<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.550> white<00:03:01.760> like<00:03:02.060> I<00:03:02.180> like

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
that I love like the white like I like

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.760 
that I love like the white like I like
that<00:03:02.510> it's<00:03:02.630> not<00:03:02.780> just<00:03:02.810> like<00:03:03.110> a<00:03:03.140> typical<00:03:03.350> brown

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
that it's not just like a typical brown

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.740 
that it's not just like a typical brown
one<00:03:03.920> I<00:03:04.010> really<00:03:04.250> think<00:03:04.820> the<00:03:04.910> gold<00:03:05.180> accents<00:03:05.570> are

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
one I really think the gold accents are

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.199 
one I really think the gold accents are
really<00:03:06.020> pretty<00:03:06.290> most<00:03:06.560> worn<00:03:06.920> winter<00:03:07.340> bags<00:03:07.550> so<00:03:07.940> I

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
really pretty most worn winter bags so I

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.650 
really pretty most worn winter bags so I
guess<00:03:08.930> I<00:03:09.170> don't<00:03:09.650> believe<00:03:10.370> in<00:03:10.610> seasons<00:03:11.330> when<00:03:11.570> it

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
guess I don't believe in seasons when it

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.230 
guess I don't believe in seasons when it
comes<00:03:11.900> to<00:03:12.140> bags<00:03:12.410> but<00:03:13.220> I<00:03:13.490> will<00:03:13.640> just<00:03:13.850> put<00:03:14.030> it<00:03:14.060> out

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
comes to bags but I will just put it out

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.110 
comes to bags but I will just put it out
there<00:03:14.830> this<00:03:15.830> is<00:03:16.010> probably<00:03:16.370> my<00:03:16.550> most<00:03:16.580> worn

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
there this is probably my most worn

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.030 
there this is probably my most worn
winter<00:03:17.660> bags<00:03:17.900> it's<00:03:18.290> like<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.500> first<00:03:18.739> designer

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.840 
like I didn't pay that price and if I
did<00:05:21.620> probably<00:05:21.860> the<00:05:22.039> Michael<00:05:22.310> Kors<00:05:22.490> and<00:05:22.640> I

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
did probably the Michael Kors and I

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.150 
did probably the Michael Kors and I
think<00:05:23.030> it<00:05:23.120> was<00:05:23.210> like<00:05:23.360> 200<00:05:23.990> something<00:05:24.680> but<00:05:25.039> it

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
think it was like 200 something but it

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.670 
think it was like 200 something but it
was<00:05:25.280> it<00:05:25.760> was<00:05:25.940> Christmas<00:05:26.419> so<00:05:26.840> I'm<00:05:27.229> treating

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
myself because I'm a working girl and I

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.870 
myself because I'm a working girl and I
can<00:05:30.169> do<00:05:30.289> that<00:05:30.500> so<00:05:31.070> the<00:05:31.160> next<00:05:31.340> one<00:05:31.490> is<00:05:31.610> your<00:05:31.700> most
