00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.509
 nice all guys for the traits on mine 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.420
 channel here we are with an unboxing video of 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:13.170
 a game that came out today May 7th 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.350
 we are talking about project cars for ps4 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.560
 game included in standard because not 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.660
 there was a collector's 80 limited but me 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.250
 I never take intermediate versions 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.320
 because I honestly don't know it's from 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.890
 meat and fish though in the end 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.480
 it only cost 10 euros more though 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.730
 moreover, gamestop has given a dirsi 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.100
 on the receipt 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.840
 however we quickly see in 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.540
 so we create you can take away already 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.980
 for today gameplay a driving experience 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.260
 unparalleled 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.930
 graphics and maneuverability able to overcome 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.780
 reality created and approved by players e 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.430
 professional drivers who is not 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.710
 really in focus with so many cases 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.300
 I read an unprecedented series 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.489
 tracks and motor categories 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.699
 oh well the playstation plus is required but 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.019
 now it is a namco bandai thing 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:07.020
 entertainment is something that by now is 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.600
 I know how it is equally well known 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.659
 which I ca n't see this time 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.909
 I did it there is some code but not 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.420
 I think it is a standard 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:22.170
 in fact if some how they are wasted 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.409
 this is how the interior looks like from this 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.130
 the game disc which is also quite 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:32.790
 this is what is now acceptable 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:36.140
 booklets among other things there is absurd there is not 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.140
 a bat 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:44.909
 you see Italy also not in the number 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:49.020
 that other countries have nothing I know 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.670
 only has an email to contact in 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.329
 problem cases then this here that the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.280
 classic in short to record points 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.469
 what to say on the namco bandai site 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.719
 then this was fast and unboxing 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.560
 we give ourselves on the channel with the gameplay 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.560
 beautiful
