00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
but she's got such a delicacy about her

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.820 
but she's got such a delicacy about her
in<00:02:49.610> her<00:02:49.730> presence<00:02:50.330> but<00:02:50.810> at<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.049> same<00:02:51.260> time<00:02:51.530> she

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
in her presence but at the same time she

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.949 
in her presence but at the same time she
really<00:02:52.340> covers<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:52.970> really<00:02:53.269> moves<00:02:53.540> out<00:02:53.750> there

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
really covers and really moves out there

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.780 
really covers and really moves out there
on<00:02:54.049> the<00:02:54.170> ice<00:02:54.319> which<00:02:54.590> is<00:02:54.739> a<00:02:54.790> wonderful

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
on the ice which is a wonderful

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.520 
on the ice which is a wonderful
combination<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.569> have<00:02:56.780> well<00:02:57.230> it's<00:02:57.379> just

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
combination to have well it's just

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.220 
combination to have well it's just
amazing<00:02:58.400> to<00:02:58.549> see<00:02:58.760> where<00:02:59.030> she<00:02:59.269> has<00:02:59.450> come<00:02:59.750> in<00:03:00.019> one

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
amazing to see where she has come in one

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.470

year at the World Championships last

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.410 
year at the World Championships last
year<00:03:03.159> she<00:03:04.159> gained<00:03:04.370> recognition<00:03:04.610> by<00:03:05.239> her

year she gained recognition by her

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.590 
year she gained recognition by her
jumping<00:03:05.870> but<00:03:06.049> this<00:03:06.260> year<00:03:06.560> I<00:03:06.590> think

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.980 

but<00:03:10.050> she<00:03:10.260> has<00:03:10.470> really

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
but she has really

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.460 
but she has really
maturity<00:03:12.860> and

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
maturity and

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.710 
maturity and
12th<00:03:15.160> in<00:03:15.310> Munich<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:15.940> she<00:03:16.150> has<00:03:16.240> staked<00:03:16.540> her

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.510 
12th in Munich and she has staked her
