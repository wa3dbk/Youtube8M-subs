00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.830
 good afternoon you are watching the secret channel 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.050
 masters today I propose to repair the block 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.889
 there is such a power supply 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:13.289
 its length almost 3 amperes it regularly 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:15.839
 burns out though protection short circuit 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:18.000
 here since the work is still being done 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.040
 times who they stand fly away 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.020
 these chips ran out and therefore 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.480
 let's collect the power supply unit on discrete 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.690
 elements of the power supply circuit is simple 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.930
 transformer voltage is about 20 and 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:34.460
 24 volts supplied to the rectifier 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:37.140
 the bridge is filtered by a capacitor 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.329
 enters the regulator circuit 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.249
 the controller is assembled on a field-effect transistor 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.649
 or microcircuit us stabilizer 

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:48.929
 voltage he low current park it 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.589
 tl431 he manages a powerful field 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:51.989
 transistor 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:54.019
 voltage is regulated by 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.909
 r3 resistors 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:57.479
 The power supply unit itself is small 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:59.909
 shawls 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:02.489
 check the work of the board is connected 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:04.860
 voltmeter to the input turn on the power supply 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.659
 maximum voltage that is issued 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.250
 19 word and minimum voltage 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.799
 voltage regulator two 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.930
 with a half volt for control 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.210
 voltage on the power supply inside will be 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.369
 build voltmeter 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.799
 applying here such a unit homemade 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:27.270
 metal cutting disc 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.810
 cut a window for a voltmeter voltmeter 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.869
 built into the casing and power supply 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.359
 it is secured with thermo glue after 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.960
 mounting elements of the block 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:40.799
 power supply 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.360
 slightly changed the radiator turned over to 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.970
 screwed into the standard holes 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:50.440
 field effect transistor board fixed 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:53.320
 the voltmeter is connected to the sides of the voltmeter 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.260
 measures voltage and supplies power to 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.880
 valve 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.830
 having spent a half hour time succeeded 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.400
 fix and upgrade this unit 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.810
 supply it became adjustable further 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.970
 stabilized and exit to 5 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.920
 amp do not forget to subscribe to 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.080
 masterâ€™s secret channel 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.780
 videos and as always we invite you 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.580
 visit sekret-mastera.ru site 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.770
 a little clarification is this pen 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.770
 made from mayonnaise bag neck
