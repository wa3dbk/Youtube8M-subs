00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.849 
this video we're going to take a look at
using<00:00:04.890> ornatrix<00:00:05.850> and<00:00:06.120> some<00:00:06.899> of<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.080> root<00:00:07.379> sub

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859

grooming<00:00:10.500> of<00:00:10.740> hair<00:00:11.040> so<00:00:11.700> in<00:00:12.120> this<00:00:12.750> model<00:00:13.110> this

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
grooming of hair so in this model this

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.110 
grooming of hair so in this model this
is<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.349> great<00:00:13.530> model<00:00:13.830> that<00:00:14.040> was<00:00:14.250> provided<00:00:15.089> by

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
is a great model that was provided by

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.630 
is a great model that was provided by
turbosquid<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:16.020> us<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.740> do<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:16.859> few<00:00:17.070> demos<00:00:17.430> for

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
turbosquid to us to do a few demos for

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.290 
turbosquid to us to do a few demos for
you<00:00:17.789> guys

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
you guys

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.300 
you guys
wonderful<00:00:18.900> models<00:00:19.590> they're<00:00:19.770> really<00:00:20.100> nice

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
wonderful models they're really nice

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.000 
wonderful models they're really nice
topology<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:22.020> character<00:00:22.500> we've<00:00:22.680> added

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
topology and this character we've added

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.580 
topology and this character we've added
some<00:00:23.430> hair<00:00:24.150> too<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.660> these<00:00:25.050> are<00:00:25.230> actually

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
some hair too and these are actually

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.439 
some hair too and these are actually
just<00:00:25.800> guides<00:00:26.039> they<00:00:26.369> were<00:00:26.430> created<00:00:27.000> as<00:00:27.119> splines

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
just guides they were created as splines

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.870 
just guides they were created as splines
and<00:00:27.810> then<00:00:27.930> we<00:00:28.410> went<00:00:28.619> through<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.099> added<00:00:29.730> some

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
and then we went through and added some

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.030 
and then we went through and added some
symmetry<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.599> ground<00:00:30.960> them<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.529> mesh<00:00:31.740> and

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
symmetry and ground them to the mesh and

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.130 
symmetry and ground them to the mesh and
there's<00:00:32.880> another<00:00:33.090> video<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.600> shows<00:00:33.630> that

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
there's another video that shows that

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.260 
there's another video that shows that
process<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.309> video<00:00:35.610> what<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:35.850> wanted<00:00:36.149> to

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
process in this video what I wanted to

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.270 
process in this video what I wanted to
kind<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.540> show<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:37.079> how<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.530> edit<00:00:37.710> those<00:00:37.980> guides

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
kind of show is how to edit those guides

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.030 
kind of show is how to edit those guides
afterwards<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.030> if<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.270> add<00:00:39.450> my<00:00:39.719> oxn<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.860> guides

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
afterwards so if I add my oxn it guides

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.670 
afterwards so if I add my oxn it guides
either<00:00:41.460> from<00:00:41.610> here<00:00:41.940> or<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.210> toolbar<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:43.559> can

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
either from here or the toolbar you can

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.680 
either from here or the toolbar you can
see<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.040> with<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.700> symmetry<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.180> might<00:00:45.450> have

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
see that with that symmetry I might have

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.630 
see that with that symmetry I might have
a<00:00:45.719> couple<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.289> guides<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.739> are<00:00:46.860> crossing<00:00:47.100> or

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
a couple of guides that are crossing or

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.360 
a couple of guides that are crossing or
they<00:00:47.789> might<00:00:47.910> be<00:00:48.090> very<00:00:48.719> very<00:00:49.160> uniform<00:00:50.160> or

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
they might be very very uniform or

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.010 
they might be very very uniform or
symmetrical<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.090> we<00:00:51.210> may<00:00:51.329> want<00:00:51.570> some<00:00:51.840> a

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
symmetrical and we may want some a

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.680 
symmetrical and we may want some a
symmetry<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.649> this<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:53.039> can<00:00:53.520> go<00:00:53.640> into<00:00:53.820> root<00:00:54.420> mode

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
symmetry to this I can go into root mode

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.439 
symmetry to this I can go into root mode
and<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:55.770> select<00:00:56.280> one<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.670> these<00:00:56.850> roots<00:00:57.180> and

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
and I can select one of these roots and

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.779 
and I can select one of these roots and
I<00:00:57.930> can<00:00:58.079> actually<00:00:58.230> move<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:59.010> if<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.370> click<00:00:59.609> and

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
I can actually move it so if I click and

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.250 
I can actually move it so if I click and
move<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.359> can<00:01:00.480> kind<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.750> drag<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.020> on<00:01:01.230> the

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
move this I can kind of drag it on the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.689 
move this I can kind of drag it on the
service<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.949> that'll<00:01:02.160> help<00:01:02.280> me<00:01:02.460> move<00:01:02.640> my

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
service and that'll help me move my

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.729 
service and that'll help me move my
guides<00:01:03.149> around<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:04.049> know<00:01:04.140> maybe<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.530> one

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
guides around you know maybe this one

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.500 
guides around you know maybe this one
that's<00:01:04.949> kind<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.309> crossing<00:01:06.060> over<00:01:06.270> here<00:01:06.479> I

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
that's kind of crossing over here I

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.500 
that's kind of crossing over here I
could<00:01:06.780> select<00:01:06.930> multiples<00:01:07.530> at<00:01:07.740> once<00:01:08.420> kind<00:01:09.420> of

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
could select multiples at once kind of

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.850 
could select multiples at once kind of
move<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:09.840> over<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.320> it's<00:01:10.470> not<00:01:10.619> quite

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
move this over so it's not quite

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.590 
move this over so it's not quite
crossing<00:01:11.400> anymore<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.150> then<00:01:12.270> I'll<00:01:12.360> give<00:01:12.479> me<00:01:12.570> a

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
crossing anymore and then I'll give me a

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.270 
crossing anymore and then I'll give me a
little<00:01:12.810> more<00:01:12.960> natural<00:01:13.500> feel<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.070> guides

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
little more natural feel to the guides

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.910 
little more natural feel to the guides
that<00:01:14.580> I'm<00:01:14.700> placing<00:01:14.939> on<00:01:15.390> my<00:01:15.900> model<00:01:16.259> now<00:01:16.860> the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
that I'm placing on my model now the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.350 
that I'm placing on my model now the
other<00:01:17.130> thing<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.369> want<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.610> show<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:18.030> there<00:01:18.270> may

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
other thing I want to show is there may

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.539 
other thing I want to show is there may
be<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.509> gap<00:01:18.810> as<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.500> can<00:01:19.650> see<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:20.100> here<00:01:20.430> in

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
be a gap as you can see in here in

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.300 
be a gap as you can see in here in
places<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.930> can<00:01:22.170> plant<00:01:22.590> some<00:01:22.890> new<00:01:23.009> roots

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
places and I can plant some new roots

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.490 
places and I can plant some new roots
there<00:01:23.580> which<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.299> kind<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.600> nice<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.020> under

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
there which is kind of nice so under

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.160 
there which is kind of nice so under
routes<00:01:25.740> if<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.250> go<00:01:26.400> down<00:01:26.610> into<00:01:27.170> route

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
routes if I go down into route

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.929 
routes if I go down into route
operations<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.860> can<00:01:28.979> see<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.159> plant<00:01:29.640> and

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
operations you can see a plant and

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.690 
operations you can see a plant and
remove<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.509> course<00:01:30.750> now<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.770> default<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.520> on

remove of course now the default is on

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.090 
remove of course now the default is on
which<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.060> interpolate<00:01:33.689> strands<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.950> can

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
which is interpolate strands and you can

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.440 
which is interpolate strands and you can
choose<00:01:35.310> how<00:01:35.340> many<00:01:35.579> strands<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.119> want<00:01:36.329> to

choose how many strands you want to

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.080
