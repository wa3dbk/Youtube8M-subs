conclusions have made while weaving the

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.640 
conclusions have made while weaving the
candlesticks<00:00:59.210> like<00:00:59.479> these<00:00:59.720> which<00:01:00.049> areas<00:01:00.470> who

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.650 
candlesticks like these which areas who

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.740 
candlesticks like these which areas who
have<00:01:00.680> liked<00:01:01.010> more<00:01:01.339> than<00:01:01.549> the<00:01:01.699> other<00:01:01.850> ones<00:01:02.150> all

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
have liked more than the other ones all

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.020 
have liked more than the other ones all
the<00:01:03.019> peculiarities<00:01:03.549> associated<00:01:04.549> with<00:01:04.729> women

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
the peculiarities associated with women

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.380 
the peculiarities associated with women
candlesticks<00:01:06.070> so<00:01:07.070> first<00:01:07.369> of<00:01:07.520> all<00:01:07.670> I<00:01:07.970> believe

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
candlesticks so first of all I believe

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.380 
candlesticks so first of all I believe
that<00:01:09.049> as<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:09.500> candlesticks<00:01:10.220> have<00:01:11.000> to<00:01:11.240> be

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
that as the candlesticks have to be

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.760 
that as the candlesticks have to be
secure<00:01:13.030> that's<00:01:14.030> why<00:01:14.299> each<00:01:14.570> of<00:01:14.600> them<00:01:15.049> has<00:01:15.439> a

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
secure that's why each of them has a

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.390 
secure that's why each of them has a
glass<00:01:16.040> container<00:01:16.310> inside<00:01:17.980> these<00:01:18.980> are

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
glass container inside these are

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.480 
glass container inside these are
different<00:01:20.120> kinds<00:01:20.570> of<00:01:20.720> camps<00:01:21.290> I<00:01:21.500> try<00:01:22.100> to<00:01:22.160> pick

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
different kinds of camps I try to pick

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.230 
different kinds of camps I try to pick
them<00:01:22.730> as<00:01:22.970> short<00:01:23.300> as<00:01:23.600> I<00:01:23.720> could<00:01:24.880> this<00:01:25.880> one<00:01:26.060> is

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
them as short as I could this one is

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.440 
them as short as I could this one is
just<00:01:26.390> shortest

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.810 

why<00:01:31.110> because<00:01:31.710> otherwise<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.549> would<00:01:32.670> be

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
why because otherwise it would be

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.600 
why because otherwise it would be
inconvenient<00:01:33.330> to<00:01:33.630> light<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> candle<00:01:34.340> one<00:01:35.340> has

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
inconvenient to light a candle one has

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.940 
inconvenient to light a candle one has
to<00:01:35.909> light<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.299> candle<00:01:36.450> at<00:01:36.930> first<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.590> only

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
to light a candle at first and only

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.420 
to light a candle at first and only
after<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.610> put<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.820> inside<00:01:39.530> carefully<00:01:40.530> so

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
after that to put it inside carefully so

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.310 
after that to put it inside carefully so
the<00:01:41.700> short<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.149> the<00:01:42.240> candlestick<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:43.080> the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
the short of the candlestick is the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.770 
the short of the candlestick is the
easier<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.920> light<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.310> candle<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:45.149> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
easier it is to light a candle in the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.350 
easier it is to light a candle in the
shortest<00:01:46.110> one<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:47.130> can<00:01:47.310> even<00:01:47.729> light<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.030> candle

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
shortest one you can even light a candle

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.050 
shortest one you can even light a candle
inside

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
inside

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.240 
inside
at<00:01:51.060> first<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.539> have<00:01:51.750> made<00:01:51.960> use<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.289> all<00:01:52.830> the<00:01:53.009> cans

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
at first I have made use of all the cans

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.910 
at first I have made use of all the cans
ahead<00:01:53.700> at<00:01:53.820> home<00:01:54.119> then<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.020> decided<00:01:55.619> to

experience with sheaves so I bought two

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.389

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
white glasses like these like these two

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.930 
white glasses like these like these two
identical<00:02:06.030> ones<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:07.530> narrower<00:02:07.920> ones

doesn't<00:02:53.560> produce<00:02:53.740> much<00:02:53.950> light<00:02:54.550> but<00:02:55.120> it<00:02:55.240> looks

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
doesn't produce much light but it looks

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
getting through the grating pattern but

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.170 
getting through the grating pattern but
the<00:03:02.410> pattern<00:03:02.770> turns<00:03:03.010> out<00:03:03.220> rather<00:03:03.520> interesting

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180

its<00:03:04.840> exact<00:03:05.280> we<00:03:06.280> do<00:03:06.430> have<00:03:06.670> a<00:03:06.700> tutorial<00:03:06.910> on<00:03:07.360> this

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
its exact we do have a tutorial on this

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.300 
its exact we do have a tutorial on this
kind<00:03:07.840> of<00:03:07.990> pattern<00:03:08.260> so<00:03:08.680> you<00:03:08.710> can<00:03:08.980> apply<00:03:09.250> it

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
kind of pattern so you can apply it

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.130 
kind of pattern so you can apply it
while<00:03:09.550> we're<00:03:09.850> in<00:03:09.970> a<00:03:10.030> candlestick<00:03:10.450> like<00:03:10.870> this

if you need more light I would recommend

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.430 
if you need more light I would recommend
you<00:03:14.470> either<00:03:14.680> side<00:03:15.130> grades<00:03:15.520> with<00:03:16.270> seek<00:03:16.780> ups<00:03:17.140> and

security<00:05:23.730> is<00:05:23.970> the<00:05:24.120> first<00:05:24.390> requirement<00:05:24.810> in

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.170 
security is the first requirement in

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.190 
security is the first requirement in
this<00:05:25.320> case<00:05:26.360> that's<00:05:27.360> why<00:05:27.600> we<00:05:27.750> have<00:05:27.960> glass

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
this case that's why we have glass

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:35.650 
this case that's why we have glass
inside<00:05:28.620> in<00:05:28.860> a<00:05:28.920> holder<00:05:29.310> from<00:05:29.460> one<00:05:29.760> side

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.990 

as<00:05:35.900> well<00:05:36.500> I<00:05:36.530> have<00:05:36.860> experimented<00:05:37.550> with<00:05:37.580> such<00:05:37.970> a

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
as well I have experimented with such a

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.840 
as well I have experimented with such a
chain<00:05:39.190> such<00:05:40.190> a<00:05:40.220> flexible<00:05:40.670> holder<00:05:42.850> actually

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:43.850 
chain such a flexible holder actually

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.030 
chain such a flexible holder actually
the<00:05:43.910> fire<00:05:44.120> is<00:05:44.270> not<00:05:44.420> big<00:05:44.660> here<00:05:45.080> so<00:05:45.410> if<00:05:45.800> the

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
the fire is not big here so if the

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.620 
the fire is not big here so if the
holder<00:05:46.370> was<00:05:46.520> a<00:05:46.550> little<00:05:46.820> longer<00:05:47.060> one<00:05:47.390> could

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.630 
holder was a little longer one could

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.080 
holder was a little longer one could
ascend<00:05:48.020> it<00:05:48.140> up<00:05:48.350> at<00:05:49.070> least<00:05:49.280> for<00:05:49.550> Karen<00:05:49.880> it<00:05:50.060> is

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
ascend it up at least for Karen it is

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.990 
ascend it up at least for Karen it is
quite<00:05:50.450> sufficient<00:05:50.870> I'm<00:05:51.680> going<00:05:52.640> to<00:05:52.760> show<00:05:52.970> you

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
quite sufficient I'm going to show you

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.070 
quite sufficient I'm going to show you
how<00:05:53.300> to<00:05:53.330> weave<00:05:53.630> a<00:05:53.660> holder<00:05:54.080> like<00:05:54.230> this<00:05:54.290> as<00:05:54.680> well
