we're soul genes sinkhole is it's right
here<00:00:21.840> on<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.020> map<00:00:22.170> I'm<00:00:22.380> just<00:00:23.039> trying<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.220> pull

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
here on the map I'm just trying to pull

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.730 
here on the map I'm just trying to pull
it<00:00:23.490> up<00:00:23.609> for<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.300> be<00:00:25.080> able<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.410> pause<00:00:25.590> the

video so you'll be able to kind of get a

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.349 
video so you'll be able to kind of get a
good<00:00:27.869> location<00:00:28.170> on<00:00:28.470> where<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.369> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
good location on where this is and the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.080 
good location on where this is and the
idea<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:31.140> only<00:00:31.170> reason<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.890> come<00:00:32.040> here<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.399> for

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
idea the only reason to come here is for

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:43.700 
idea the only reason to come here is for
the<00:00:33.210> moonstone<00:00:33.780> or<00:00:34.760> alright<00:00:42.559> there's<00:00:43.559> going

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
the moonstone or alright there's going

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.330 
the moonstone or alright there's going
to<00:00:43.770> be<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.950> vein<00:00:44.190> as<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:45.180> enter<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:46.340> complex

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
to be a vein as you enter the complex

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.810 
to be a vein as you enter the complex
there<00:00:47.640> will<00:00:47.850> be<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:48.030> vein<00:00:48.360> right<00:00:48.750> here<00:00:49.160> I<00:00:50.160> think

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
there will be a vein right here I think

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.979 
there will be a vein right here I think
it's<00:00:50.969> just<00:00:51.030> got<00:00:51.210> detective<00:00:56.510> as<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.780> go<00:00:57.960> up

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
it's just got detective as you go up

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.080 
it's just got detective as you go up
these<00:00:58.289> steps<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.190> left<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.910> will<00:01:00.059> notice

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
these steps and the left you will notice

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.410 
these steps and the left you will notice
um<00:01:00.719> there<00:01:01.379> will<00:01:01.559> be<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.710> few<00:01:01.920> pickaxes<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:03.030> just

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
um there will be a few pickaxes so just

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.329 
um there will be a few pickaxes so just
in<00:01:03.510> case<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.840> didn't<00:01:04.049> bring<00:01:04.170> any<00:01:04.379> there<00:01:05.129> will

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.620 

which<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.290> right<00:01:41.070> here

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
which is right here

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.539 
which is right here
so<00:01:42.630> I'll<00:01:42.720> get<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:42.930> later<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:44.009> guys<00:01:44.340> don't

have<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.790> watch<00:01:45.000> me<00:01:45.030> mining

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.340 

all<00:01:48.450> right<00:01:48.540> there<00:01:48.750> should<00:01:48.930> be<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.050> couple<00:01:49.230> of

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
all right there should be a couple of

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.190 
all right there should be a couple of
drug<00:01:49.560> or<00:01:49.740> pumping<00:01:50.100> up<00:01:50.660> you<00:01:51.660> can<00:01:51.840> just<00:01:51.870> take

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
drug or pumping up you can just take

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.020 
drug or pumping up you can just take
them<00:01:52.320> out<00:01:53.360> without<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.860> exposing<00:01:55.860> myself<00:01:56.190> nope

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
them out without a exposing myself nope

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.840 
them out without a exposing myself nope
I<00:01:57.180> guess<00:01:57.240> not

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:38.360

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.589 

when<00:02:39.370> you<00:02:39.459> reach<00:02:39.670> this<00:02:39.879> point<00:02:40.000> don't<00:02:40.420> pull

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
when you reach this point don't pull

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.050 
when you reach this point don't pull
that<00:02:40.719> lever<00:02:41.170> because<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.069> bunch<00:02:42.340> of<00:02:42.489> poison

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
that lever because a bunch of poison

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.879 
that lever because a bunch of poison
arrows<00:02:43.299> will<00:02:43.510> come<00:02:43.659> up<00:02:43.780> so<00:02:44.319> just<00:02:44.560> pull<00:02:44.739> the

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:44.889 
arrows will come up so just pull the

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:50.490 
arrows will come up so just pull the
sides<00:02:45.129> the<00:02:46.060> two<00:02:46.239> on<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.510> sides<00:02:48.629> and<00:02:49.629> then
