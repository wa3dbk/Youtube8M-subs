going to take multiple cars drive them
down<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.250> two-mile<00:00:32.759> stretch<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.239> road<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.140> just

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
down a two-mile stretch of road and just

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.770 
down a two-mile stretch of road and just
crash<00:00:34.650> them<00:00:34.950> as<00:00:35.220> much<00:00:35.790> as<00:00:35.940> we<00:00:36.030> possibly<00:00:36.570> can

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
crash them as much as we possibly can

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.300 
crash them as much as we possibly can
and<00:00:36.840> show<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.380> results<00:00:37.770> at<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.950> end<00:00:37.980> of

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.310 
and show you the results at the end of

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.790 
and show you the results at the end of
each<00:00:38.550> two<00:00:39.540> mile<00:00:39.720> stretch<00:00:39.989> on<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.290> first<00:00:40.500> clip

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
each two mile stretch on the first clip

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.200 
each two mile stretch on the first clip
I'm<00:00:40.920> gonna<00:00:41.040> show<00:00:41.250> regular<00:00:41.640> speed<00:00:41.880> so<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.090> can

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
I'm gonna show regular speed so you can

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.200 
I'm gonna show regular speed so you can
see<00:00:42.530> how<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:43.800> track<00:00:44.190> works<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.789> then<00:00:45.120> the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
see how this track works and then the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.939 
see how this track works and then the
rest<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.449> them<00:00:45.539> I'll<00:00:45.690> speed<00:00:45.989> up<00:00:46.019> and<00:00:46.320> show<00:00:46.890> you

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
rest of them I'll speed up and show you

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:49.009 
rest of them I'll speed up and show you
the<00:00:47.129> results<00:00:47.519> of<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.640> crashes<00:00:48.090> at<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.840> end

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:49.019 
the results of the crashes at the end

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:50.900 
the results of the crashes at the end
and<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.469> usually<00:00:49.649> add<00:00:49.920> my<00:00:50.070> own<00:00:50.190> input<00:00:50.550> but<00:00:50.760> I

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
and I usually add my own input but I

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.160 
and I usually add my own input but I
think<00:00:51.120> visuals<00:00:51.480> are<00:00:51.539> gonna<00:00:51.660> be<00:00:51.809> enough<00:00:52.050> in

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
think visuals are gonna be enough in

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.720 
think visuals are gonna be enough in
this<00:00:52.320> case<00:00:52.500> there's<00:00:53.010> really<00:00:53.070> no<00:00:53.340> point<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.699> me

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
this case there's really no point of me

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.310 
this case there's really no point of me
saying<00:00:54.000> oh<00:00:54.269> look<00:00:54.510> there's<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.809> cracked<00:00:55.199> glass

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
saying oh look there's a cracked glass

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.040 
saying oh look there's a cracked glass
and<00:00:55.739> there's<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.980> dent<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.719> I'm<00:00:57.719> just<00:00:57.809> gonna<00:00:57.929> let

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
and there's a dent so I'm just gonna let

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.720 
and there's a dent so I'm just gonna let
the<00:00:58.170> footage<00:00:58.410> roll<00:00:58.589> so<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:59.070> hope<00:00:59.429> you<00:00:59.579> guys

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.340 

well<00:06:10.820> that's<00:06:11.210> all<00:06:11.390> the<00:06:11.480> crash<00:06:11.750> testing<00:06:12.260> that

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:12.350 
well that's all the crash testing that

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:13.720 
well that's all the crash testing that
we<00:06:12.470> have<00:06:12.680> for<00:06:12.950> today

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:13.730 
we have for today

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.090 
we have for today
well<00:06:14.240> overall<00:06:14.810> I<00:06:15.050> think<00:06:15.170> all<00:06:15.530> the<00:06:15.650> cars<00:06:15.890> are

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:16.100 
well overall I think all the cars are

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.950 
well overall I think all the cars are
basically<00:06:16.610> at<00:06:16.730> different<00:06:17.030> stages<00:06:17.210> you<00:06:17.720> saw

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
basically at different stages you saw

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.420 
basically at different stages you saw
some<00:06:18.230> of<00:06:18.260> them<00:06:18.350> have<00:06:18.500> more<00:06:18.770> damage<00:06:19.070> than

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430 
some of them have more damage than

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.070 
some of them have more damage than
others<00:06:19.490> but<00:06:20.090> the<00:06:20.210> games<00:06:20.360> not<00:06:20.570> released<00:06:20.840> yet<00:06:20.960> so

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
others but the games not released yet so

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.560 
others but the games not released yet so
you<00:06:21.560> know<00:06:21.620> there's<00:06:21.800> probably<00:06:21.950> gonna<00:06:22.160> be<00:06:22.250> a<00:06:23.030> lot

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
you know there's probably gonna be a lot

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:24.970 
you know there's probably gonna be a lot
of<00:06:23.600> updates<00:06:24.140> to<00:06:24.260> come<00:06:24.530> with<00:06:24.680> the<00:06:24.770> crash

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:24.980 
of updates to come with the crash

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.010 
of updates to come with the crash
physics<00:06:25.220> obviously<00:06:26.210> there's<00:06:26.390> a<00:06:26.450> lot<00:06:26.630> of<00:06:26.750> areas

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
physics obviously there's a lot of areas

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.380 
physics obviously there's a lot of areas
that<00:06:27.080> could<00:06:27.230> be<00:06:27.320> worked<00:06:27.560> on<00:06:27.710> but<00:06:28.100> only<00:06:29.060> time

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:29.390 
that could be worked on but only time

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.300 
that could be worked on but only time
will<00:06:29.570> tell<00:06:29.600> so<00:06:30.230> I'm<00:06:30.500> enjoying<00:06:30.650> watching<00:06:31.040> this
