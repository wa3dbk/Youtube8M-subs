00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:01.369
 of this material 

00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:06.060
 of this highly productive material giving us approximately a performance 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.329
 of 60 70 tonnes per hectare 

00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:10.589
 on green base 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:14.869
 tr under a condition of temporary and without fertilization 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.320
 in this mode we have an area of ​​10 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.579
 several watering 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:22.460
 where we also have this material and there we can have returns up to 

00:00:22.459 --> 00:00:23.929
 80 90 tons 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:26.369
 abás also green container 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.240
 Now the possibility of having the material has allowed us to have the 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:32.480
 loading animals with 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.530
 I know the one we currently have 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.750
 However, in the short term, when we see the need to have 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.390
 expand our blind area 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.920
 because in this year will increase the inventory in your mind units 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.500
 social security 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.750
 for births that are planned for this season of the year 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.829
 sux 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:58.670
 the results confirm 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.189
 I saw him quite a lot of students the violence mexico 46 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.010
 which worked with the process of feeling gods became a partner 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.240
 as well as a supplement like that the commercial contract 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.000
 the young 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.990
 then start because you can comment on us from grass and 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.310
 instance instantly 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.750
 Weight gain 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.230
 that the animals have obtained with this forage 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.110
 Has been of 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.530
 has been the consumption 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.980
 that these wells 6 kilograms 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.280
 with the desire since his arrest 4 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.960
 we earn per day per animal 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.689
 and a feed conversion by5 points in tiflis 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:47.950
 which has been favorable for kitsch compared to other groups outside 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.030
 had had before this 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.030
 and this is very considerable for the function of what 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.030
 with this work it is reduced 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.180
 the time of growth and also transcendence of kilos of forage has 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.630
 a high protein index 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.149
 but it is also known that the foragers as well as the type of soil is very poor 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.400
 in the punctures or the sticks the forages are also poor due to 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.250
 this evidence comes a supplementation of two types 

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:18.469
 in mind follow lagunak of a type of food based on well concentrated 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:21.579
 with initial with 12% prosthesis 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.489
 throughout the year with 300 grams 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.049
 an animal 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:27.249
 year 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:30.429
 but they are also given to him really 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:33.899
 temporary lines trip what is the molasses ear 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.019
 we are in the area of ​​decline pelón 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.029
 where the arcs 

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:47.789
 they are fed with their catechists of 8 715 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:53.730
 since those who pass the fights are believed to be what soft alten carbohydrates 82 

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:57.509
 they are seconds in the plot the feeding of these data the texts 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.160
 we have him here 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.589
 what can you tell us? 

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:04.319
 something about feeding the shaggy pig 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.399
 we have been able to feed the forages 

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:09.009
 good the pig 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:15.089
 in that order deported that is tolerant high contents of season forage 

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:16.629
 like previous 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.499
 Well yes it would be good to use them 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:21.129
 what is forage 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:25.049
 in that case the father to do this in experiments with him since neither and wished 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.479
 Constitutional needs are totally unknown 

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:32.559
 and may be important percent currently in others we are doing 

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:35.049
 some studies on this extreme 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.999
 percent I'm going to misano about which the evaluation of channel kippen my 

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:40.319
 principal 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.059
 The point is 

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:45.289
 nadal had done this is a determining point 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:02.109
 a recent work 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.379
 where its different levels are the tournament 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.389
 from 0 50 to 100 150 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:11.229
 200 kilograms of urea 

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:15.419
 He argued that as the level of inflation increased, the problem 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.169
 commented on the production of dry matter 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.919
 with everything and cultures 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:26.209
 per hundred which n giving a total of 32 points on p4 

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:29.779
 tons of dry matter 

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:35.620
 in terms of dry matter yield 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.620
 there are different intervals of 6 strong 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.129
 two weeks 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:43.759
 it was observed that the highest production 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.909
 it's two weeks 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:47.979
 so it is an indicator 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:49.900
 this step can be harvested 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.569
 every three months 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:53.349
 When the total production 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:58.719
 in dry matter p53 a total of three tons of dry matter out there 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:06.349
 in what refers the protein content acts 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:08.210
 it was observed 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.490
 that by including the 200 kilograms of CO2 per year 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.839
 increases the last value of the plant 

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:15.779
 at a new point 22%
