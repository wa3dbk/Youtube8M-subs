00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
a lot of folks are asking what's the

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.610 
a lot of folks are asking what's the
best<00:00:08.490> laptop<00:00:09.000> but<00:00:09.269> as<00:00:09.480> far<00:00:09.690> as<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.870> gift<00:00:10.349> for<00:00:10.559> the

the new macbook air from Apple they've
got<00:00:16.289> two<00:00:16.500> new<00:00:16.710> versions<00:00:16.859> out<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.369> 13<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.000> 11

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
got two new versions out of 13 and 11

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.300 
got two new versions out of 13 and 11
inch<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:18.900> i<00:00:19.109> gotta<00:00:19.289> say<00:00:19.470> these<00:00:19.800> things<00:00:20.100> are

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
inch and i gotta say these things are

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.070 
inch and i gotta say these things are
pretty<00:00:20.550> amazing<00:00:20.850> as<00:00:21.180> far<00:00:21.390> as<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.689> overall

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
pretty amazing as far as the overall

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.560 
pretty amazing as far as the overall
design<00:00:22.490> super<00:00:23.490> thin<00:00:23.730> i<00:00:23.939> mean<00:00:24.119> even<00:00:24.210> look<00:00:24.449> at

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
design super thin i mean even look at

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.750 
design super thin i mean even look at
this<00:00:24.689> screen<00:00:25.019> it's<00:00:25.350> using<00:00:25.590> an<00:00:25.680> LED<00:00:26.070> screen

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
this screen it's using an LED screen

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.939 
this screen it's using an LED screen
technology<00:00:26.970> it's<00:00:27.810> razor-thin<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.619> don't<00:00:28.830> know

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
technology it's razor-thin I don't know

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.620 
technology it's razor-thin I don't know
how<00:00:29.070> they<00:00:29.099> even<00:00:29.340> get<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.490> screen<00:00:29.849> on<00:00:29.880> here<00:00:30.480> but

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
how they even get a screen on here but

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.150 
how they even get a screen on here but
you<00:00:30.929> can't<00:00:31.140> even<00:00:31.230> see<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.710> when<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.920> look<00:00:32.070> on

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
you can't even see it when you look on

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.580 
you can't even see it when you look on
the<00:00:32.250> side<00:00:32.489> but<00:00:33.180> even<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.600> overall<00:00:34.079> profile

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
the side but even the overall profile

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.830 
the side but even the overall profile
again<00:00:34.920> super<00:00:35.460> slim<00:00:35.850> they've<00:00:36.329> done<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.660> few

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
again super slim they've done a few

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.750 
again super slim they've done a few
things<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.320> accomplish<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:38.070> there's<00:00:38.340> no<00:00:38.460> CD

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
things to accomplish that there's no CD

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.580 
things to accomplish that there's no CD
or<00:00:38.910> DVD<00:00:39.300> drive<00:00:39.329> built-in<00:00:39.870> they're<00:00:40.350> also<00:00:40.469> using

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
or DVD drive built-in they're also using

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.280 
or DVD drive built-in they're also using
things<00:00:41.040> like<00:00:41.129> solid<00:00:41.700> state<00:00:41.969> hard<00:00:42.239> drives<00:00:42.629> in

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
things like solid state hard drives in

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.080 
things like solid state hard drives in
these<00:00:43.469> particular<00:00:43.710> units<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.550> can't<00:00:44.910> even<00:00:44.969> say

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
these particular units I can't even say

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.430 
these particular units I can't even say
hard<00:00:45.420> drive<00:00:45.660> because<00:00:45.930> there's<00:00:46.110> no<00:00:46.230> moving

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
hard drive because there's no moving

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.130 
hard drive because there's no moving
parts<00:00:46.610> solid<00:00:47.610> state<00:00:47.700> drives<00:00:48.360> essentially<00:00:48.960> use

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
parts solid state drives essentially use

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.630 
parts solid state drives essentially use
digital<00:00:49.410> memory<00:00:49.739> much<00:00:50.039> like<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.250> digital

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
digital memory much like a digital

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.549 
digital memory much like a digital
memory<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.090> your<00:00:51.239> camera<00:00:51.750> same<00:00:52.320> type<00:00:52.530> of

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
memory in your camera same type of

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.160 
memory in your camera same type of
technology<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.730> less<00:00:54.149> moving<00:00:54.390> parts<00:00:54.539> there

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
technology so less moving parts there

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.200 
technology so less moving parts there
faster<00:00:55.890> for<00:00:56.039> accessing<00:00:56.399> information<00:00:56.640> and

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
faster for accessing information and

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.119 
faster for accessing information and
better<00:00:57.360> on<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.629> battery<00:00:57.930> life<00:00:58.050> as<00:00:58.469> well<00:00:58.680> these

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
better on the battery life as well these

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.799 
better on the battery life as well these
particular<00:00:59.399> units<00:00:59.910> are<00:01:00.239> rated<00:01:00.539> anywhere

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
particular units are rated anywhere

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.569 
particular units are rated anywhere
between<00:01:00.930> 5<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.260> 7<00:01:01.620> hours<00:01:01.770> on<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.190> battery<00:01:02.489> and

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
between 5 to 7 hours on the battery and

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.399 
between 5 to 7 hours on the battery and
again<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.300> just<00:01:03.359> amazes<00:01:03.780> me<00:01:03.930> because<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.260> don't

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
again it just amazes me because I don't

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.660 
again it just amazes me because I don't
know<00:01:04.500> where<00:01:04.650> they<00:01:04.769> put<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:04.979> battery<00:01:05.339> in<00:01:05.460> this

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
know where they put the battery in this

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:13.190 
know where they put the battery in this
thing<00:01:05.729> it's<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.840> thin<00:01:11.420> it's<00:01:12.420> got<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.720> nice<00:01:12.840> track

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
thing it's so thin it's got a nice track

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.450 
thing it's so thin it's got a nice track
pad<00:01:13.500> on<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.680> here<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.070> if<00:01:14.130> you're<00:01:14.310> familiar

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
pad on it here so if you're familiar

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.580 
pad on it here so if you're familiar
with<00:01:14.790> using<00:01:15.000> an<00:01:15.210> ipad<00:01:15.659> for<00:01:15.960> pinching<00:01:16.470> and

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
with using an ipad for pinching and

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.859 
with using an ipad for pinching and
zooming<00:01:16.650> same<00:01:17.369> type<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.700> idea<00:01:18.270> here<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
zooming same type of idea here on the

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.480 
zooming same type of idea here on the
side<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.229> two<00:01:19.350> USB<00:01:19.740> ports<00:01:19.770> if<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.280> want<00:01:20.400> to

side the two USB ports if you want to

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.950 
side the two USB ports if you want to
hook<00:01:20.549> up<00:01:20.700> an<00:01:20.820> external<00:01:21.270> monitor<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.750> have<00:01:21.780> to

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
hook up an external monitor you have to

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.810 
hook up an external monitor you have to
get<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.290> displayport<00:01:22.920> adapter<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.549> hook<00:01:23.580> up

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
get the displayport adapter to hook up

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.120 
get the displayport adapter to hook up
vga<00:01:24.420> screen<00:01:24.930> another<00:01:25.560> thing<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.890> doesn't<00:01:26.040> have

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
vga screen another thing it doesn't have

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.560 
vga screen another thing it doesn't have
a<00:01:26.220> built-in<00:01:26.490> ethernet<00:01:26.640> port<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.299> have<00:01:27.479> to

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
a built-in ethernet port so you have to

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.020 
a built-in ethernet port so you have to
buy<00:01:27.780> an<00:01:28.229> additional<00:01:28.439> USB<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.579> ethernet

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
buy an additional USB to ethernet

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.940 
buy an additional USB to ethernet
adapter<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.630> accomplish<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.170> but<00:01:31.650> for<00:01:31.829> most

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
adapter to accomplish that but for most

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.410 
adapter to accomplish that but for most
people<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.520> does<00:01:32.670> have<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.909> built-in<00:01:33.090> Wi-Fi

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
people it does have the built-in Wi-Fi

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.170 
people it does have the built-in Wi-Fi
the<00:01:34.320> wireless<00:01:34.680> hand<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.130> many<00:01:35.909> people

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
the wireless hand so many people

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.880 
the wireless hand so many people
probably<00:01:36.450> don't<00:01:36.570> even<00:01:36.780> need<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.470> particular

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
probably don't even need that particular

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.550 
probably don't even need that particular
device<00:01:38.700> or<00:01:38.909> functionality<00:01:39.329> overall<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.439> was

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
device or functionality overall I was
