00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.569
 first part 

00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:11.569
 in the country the materials including new families 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:15.929
 % and more 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.869
 the normans the next hours 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.089
 a hail we go back 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.869
 and then here we see the smallest model 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.869
 Why 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.160

 Claude Puel 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.300
 however happy he is 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.510
 m 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.510
 my client is new to me 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.880
 we count a lot I'm fine 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.630
 almost 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.630

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.420

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.190
 the fight 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.190
 standing 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.190

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.040
 no 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.340

 65 70 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.340
 without almost repeating the series 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:11.609
 it was hard because he has no less than four tracks really money 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:14.609
 our goal was to test the new camera 

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:18.889
 worse yet some small adjustments to make the framing away 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.139
 without making noise or five years
