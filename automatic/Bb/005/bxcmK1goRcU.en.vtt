00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.660
 has been presented with this machine let's 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.600
 to cut this time the unit 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.030
 corresponds to the short channel for 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.030
 take out the unit the first thing is the 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.760
 cover again the cover should 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.220
 Pull the gray lever to the lever 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.920
 Gray insurance is eliminated as you can 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.899
 open the cover 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.550
 previously we have already extracted the 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.219
 toner cartridges to make the 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.680
 faster procedure so now 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.930
 the next step will be to extract the band 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.089
 transfer to access to 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.670
 the units the first thing that you have to 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:02.750
 to do is to raise the detection plate 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.920
 dollar 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.810
 the plate rises 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.720
 secret so that it remains there 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.530
 number 2 we extract the screw that 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.530
 hold the band 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.950
 number 3 the insurance of the band is this 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.440
 palanquita that has the colored surface 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.740
 yellow 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.580
 the lever and we're going to the front and 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.190
 the band is released 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.350
 now to extract the band has a 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.390
 right claw in this part of here we 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.180
 we hold on that side 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.830
 we pick it up and extract it notice by 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.990
 please do not need to touch the 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.340
 surface of the band can do it 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.340
 between the plastic parts 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.600
 now as you can see they can 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.090
 notice a part here we have already exposed 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.819
 the drum units start in this 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.819
 order yellow blue whales 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.820
 according to the samples that sent us the 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.430
 problem is effectively in the unit 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.610
 magenta when the magenta unit has 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.650
 a short they are clearly seen 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.470
 horizontal bands of magenta color and 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.260
 the copy tends to be customized to a 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.720
 pink color since that unit the one 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.240
 is producing short circuit for 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.940
 dismantle the unit only we take from 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:44.950
 the banks and poplars up 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.950
 we put it in a safe place when not 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.080
 and now if what interests us 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.270
 solve is the contact of the unit 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.760
 towards the machine if you can notice 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.700
 this contact that is here is the one that 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.760
 discharges the polarity of the drum towards 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.670
 the land of the machine many times by 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.830
 the movement or the dirty this 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.540
 contact does not make good contact with the 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.580
 drum unit and does not discharge the 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.680
 polarity that's why the 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.299
 short that you are having 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.209
 with a rag what I'm going to do is 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:20.219
 clean the connector does not matter if the 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.129
 contact looks clean no matter the 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:25.079
 goal of doing this cleaning is not 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:27.390
 clean the external surface which 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.700
 we have here at a glance but with 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.400
 the movement will clean the part of 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.569
 inside that does the polarization 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.569
 we do this repeatedly 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.980
 I want to clarify that if this 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.560
 procedure will not work from this 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.590
 It would be necessary to dismantle all 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.050
 the jackass part that holds the 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.090
 toners and the outside also for 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.410
 to be able to reach the contact in the 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.780
 part of the inside of the machine and 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.410
 so we'd better clean them 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.410
 well from here 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.230
 to ensure that it is working 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:03.230
 all right 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.380
 once they have repeatedly made the 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.270
 cleaning the contact and I usually move it 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.740
 in this in this position so for 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.900
 make sure I have enough 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:21.130
 mobility and make good contact in 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.130
 the inside of the machine 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.919
 of the buffer unit is very important 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.509
 never touch the surface of the drum what 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.849
 only we are going to do this time 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:33.699
 is to clean the pin that makes the contact 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:35.349
 this metallic pin that is here makes a 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:37.060
 direct contact with the connector that 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:38.950
 we just cleaned inside the 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.770
 machine 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.479
 we clean 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.740
 we put the unit in its normal position 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:45.740
 and assembling 

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:53.240
 doing a little bit of pressure we achieve 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.240
 that is cost correctly 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.700
 to insert the transfer belt 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.130
 all we have to do is 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.990
 make sure that the pins that come out of 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.830
 the constructs band that I just played 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.840
 this one and this one slides in the little channels 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.510
 that are next to the gears that 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.900
 are on this side and this one on the 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.979
 part of inside 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.979
 we make it slide 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:39.040
 we put them back the previous steps 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:42.450
 the insurance of the band 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.450
 the fastener screw 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:56.120
 and finally the detection plate of 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.120
 dollar 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:01.870
 the toner detection plate after 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.030
 to install the detection plate of 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:07.150
 toner is installed the retainer of the 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:09.150
 toner this one only approaches the 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.920
 surface and is pushed towards the bottom 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:14.100
 to disassemble it just be towards 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.100
 behind 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:22.500
 re install the toners we close the 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.500
 machine and we tested it
