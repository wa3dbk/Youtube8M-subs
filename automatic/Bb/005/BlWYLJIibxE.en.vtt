mechanical keyboard is kind of a

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.420 
mechanical keyboard is kind of a
keyboard<00:00:46.110> uses<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.440> different<00:00:46.980> sort<00:00:47.280> of

keyboard uses a different sort of

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.610 
keyboard uses a different sort of
engineering<00:00:48.149> behind<00:00:48.660> how<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.079> keys<00:00:49.440> are

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
engineering behind how the keys are

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.869 
engineering behind how the keys are
pressed<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.100> how<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.309> registered<00:00:50.670> by<00:00:50.700> the

pressed and how is registered by the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
sure if any of you've ever taken apart a

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.580 
sure if any of you've ever taken apart a
key<00:00:57.360> or<00:00:57.539> before<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.760> for<00:00:59.760> any<00:00:59.910> of<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.149> have

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
key or before that for any of you have

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.560 
key or before that for any of you have
instead<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.739> having<00:01:02.120> bunged<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:03.390> up

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
instead of having bunged of this up

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.820 
instead of having bunged of this up
instead<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.960> having<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:06.110> membrane<00:01:07.110> behind<00:01:07.560> each

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
instead of having a membrane behind each

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.910 
instead of having a membrane behind each
individual<00:01:08.400> keys<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.970> now<00:01:09.240> actually<00:01:09.810> has<00:01:10.080> a

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
individual keys it now actually has a

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.370 
individual keys it now actually has a
key<00:01:11.520> switch<00:01:11.760> system<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.990> key<00:01:13.170> switch

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
key switch system and a key switch

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.039 
key switch system and a key switch
system<00:01:13.740> allows<00:01:14.100> for<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.400> keys<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.850> be<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.299> lot

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
system allows for the keys to be a lot

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.929 
system allows for the keys to be a lot
lighter<00:01:16.350> when<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:16.979> press<00:01:17.189> them<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.580> have<00:01:17.820> to

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
lighter when you press them I have to

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.210 
lighter when you press them I have to
put<00:01:18.119> almost<00:01:18.750> zero<00:01:19.020> force<00:01:19.380> into<00:01:19.740> pressing<00:01:19.950> each

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
put almost zero force into pressing each

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.039 
put almost zero force into pressing each
key<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:21.240> means<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.479> they<00:01:21.689> actually

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
key and it means that they actually

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.480 
key and it means that they actually
respond<00:01:22.590> quicker<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.130> when<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.369> actually

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
respond quicker to when you actually

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.730 
respond quicker to when you actually
press<00:01:23.850> them<00:01:24.060> approximately<00:01:24.960> half<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.290> speed

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
press them approximately half the speed

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.960 
press them approximately half the speed
so<00:01:26.670> yeah<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.780> mean<00:01:27.930> it's<00:01:28.920> been<00:01:29.100> technology's

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
so yeah I mean it's been technology's

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.310 
so yeah I mean it's been technology's
been<00:01:30.119> around<00:01:30.299> for<00:01:30.509> some<00:01:30.659> time<00:01:30.900> but<00:01:31.110> razors

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
been around for some time but razors

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.800 
been around for some time but razors
seem<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.799> have<00:01:31.920> been<00:01:32.549> just<00:01:33.450> bringing<00:01:33.720> it

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
seem to have been just bringing it

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.870 
seem to have been just bringing it
around<00:01:33.900> into<00:01:34.409> their<00:01:34.740> gaming<00:01:34.950> range<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.549> this

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
around into their gaming range and this

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.039 
around into their gaming range and this
is<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.060> first<00:01:36.270> cable<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.689> they've<00:01:36.810> pushed

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
is the first cable that they've pushed

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.230 
is the first cable that they've pushed
it<00:01:37.170> into<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:38.250> yeah<00:01:38.700> I've<00:01:38.850> been<00:01:38.970> really<00:01:39.119> excited

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
it into so yeah I've been really excited

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.880 
it into so yeah I've been really excited
to<00:01:39.630> use<00:01:39.720> I've<00:01:39.869> been<00:01:39.990> using<00:01:40.110> for<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.350> past<00:01:40.439> few

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
to use I've been using for the past few

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.760 
to use I've been using for the past few
days<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:42.740> should<00:01:43.740> get<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.860> real<00:01:44.070> joy<00:01:44.310> so

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
days and I should get a real joy so

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.660 
days and I should get a real joy so
certainly<00:01:46.770> be<00:01:46.860> talking<00:01:47.009> about<00:01:47.340> some<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.610> these

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
certainly be talking about some of these

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.490 
certainly be talking about some of these
functions<00:01:48.240> some<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.750> stuff<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.020> look

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
functions some of the stuff that look

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.639 
functions some of the stuff that look
like<00:01:49.649> what<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:49.890> has<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.159> offer<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.990> yeah<00:01:51.990> so

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
like what it has to offer and yeah so

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.219 
like what it has to offer and yeah so
first<00:01:53.280> I'm<00:01:53.430> gonna<00:01:53.549> start<00:01:53.790> off<00:01:53.850> with<00:01:54.200> what<00:01:55.200> I

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
first I'm gonna start off with what I

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.050 
first I'm gonna start off with what I
think<00:01:55.710> is<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.100> coolest<00:01:56.399> thing<00:01:56.549> they've<00:01:56.729> added

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
think is the coolest thing they've added

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.770 
think is the coolest thing they've added
is<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.570> use<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.320> function<00:01:58.799> key<00:01:58.979> now<00:01:59.670> I'm<00:02:00.570> not

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
is the use of a function key now I'm not

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.340 
is the use of a function key now I'm not
sure<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:00.960> it

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
sure of it

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.889 
sure of it
if<00:02:01.799> any<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.130> viewers<00:02:02.399> have<00:02:02.640> seen<00:02:03.240> our

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
if any of the viewers have seen our

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.679 
if any of the viewers have seen our
laptop<00:02:04.439> uses<00:02:05.250> its<00:02:05.430> media<00:02:06.060> keys<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.570> stuff

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
laptop uses its media keys and stuff

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.580 
laptop uses its media keys and stuff
like<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.079> but<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.320> uses<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.590> function<00:02:07.829> key<00:02:08.160> so

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
like that but it uses a function key so

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
pressed on macro and then I press any of

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.050 
pressed on macro and then I press any of
the<00:04:19.630> keys

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
the keys

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.990 
the keys
hold<00:04:22.060> that<00:04:22.120> macro<00:04:22.390> press<00:04:22.810> I<00:04:22.930> know<00:04:23.080> you<00:04:23.320> I<00:04:23.350> Oh

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
hold that macro press I know you I Oh

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.850 
hold that macro press I know you I Oh
whatever<00:04:25.000> that<00:04:25.210> does<00:04:25.450> and<00:04:25.990> I<00:04:26.290> hit<00:04:26.440> up<00:04:26.470> and<00:04:26.800> a

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
whatever that does and I hit up and a

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.810 
whatever that does and I hit up and a
hit<00:04:27.040> macro<00:04:27.400> one<00:04:27.930> that<00:04:28.930> would<00:04:29.020> be<00:04:29.050> a<00:04:29.140> macro<00:04:29.530> key

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
hit macro one that would be a macro key

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.090 
hit macro one that would be a macro key
so<00:04:30.820> yeah<00:04:31.030> works<00:04:31.810> very<00:04:32.110> similar<00:04:32.500> to<00:04:32.650> how<00:04:32.770> razor

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
so yeah works very similar to how razor

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.640 
so yeah works very similar to how razor
had<00:04:33.370> their<00:04:33.610> drivers<00:04:33.970> before<00:04:34.090> with<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:35.140> macro

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
had their drivers before with the macro

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.240 
had their drivers before with the macro
assigning<00:04:36.160> completely<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:37.120> same<00:04:38.670> finally<00:04:40.080> is

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
assigning completely the same finally is

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:47.790 
assigning completely the same finally is
the<00:04:42.250> use<00:04:42.520> of<00:04:45.600> I'm<00:04:46.600> currently<00:04:47.050> using<00:04:47.440> it<00:04:47.560> for<00:04:47.680> my

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
the use of I'm currently using it for my

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.220 
the use of I'm currently using it for my
camera<00:04:48.220> but<00:04:48.430> take<00:04:49.330> it<00:04:49.480> out<00:04:49.570> there's<00:04:49.840> a<00:04:49.900> USB

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
camera but take it out there's a USB

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.050 
camera but take it out there's a USB
port<00:04:50.740> there<00:04:51.040> and<00:04:51.940> lift<00:04:52.210> this<00:04:52.390> up<00:04:52.570> USB<00:04:53.530> port

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
port there and lift this up USB port

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.510 
port there and lift this up USB port
microphone<00:04:55.060> jack<00:04:55.420> an<00:04:55.690> audio<00:04:56.170> jack<00:04:56.230> so<00:04:57.190> instead

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
microphone jack an audio jack so instead

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.070 
microphone jack an audio jack so instead
of<00:04:57.610> having<00:04:57.700> to<00:04:57.910> reach<00:04:58.060> down<00:04:58.300> the<00:04:58.720> baculum

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
of having to reach down the baculum

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.460 
of having to reach down the baculum
viewer<00:04:59.760> can<00:05:00.760> you<00:05:00.940> remove<00:05:01.570> won't<00:05:02.200> make<00:05:02.350> the

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
viewer can you remove won't make the

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.680 
viewer can you remove won't make the
Don's<00:05:02.680> out<00:05:02.830> the<00:05:02.920> way<00:05:03.070> then<00:05:03.790> you<00:05:04.120> can<00:05:04.270> use<00:05:04.450> that

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
Don's out the way then you can use that

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.190 
Don's out the way then you can use that
simply<00:05:05.470> straight<00:05:05.830> from<00:05:05.980> there<00:05:06.570> so<00:05:07.570> yeah<00:05:07.810> key

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
simply straight from there so yeah key

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.410 
simply straight from there so yeah key
features<00:05:08.470> are<00:05:08.920> you<00:05:09.370> mechanical<00:05:09.790> keys<00:05:10.030> really

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
features are you mechanical keys really

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.990 
features are you mechanical keys really
I<00:05:10.450> mean<00:05:10.660> this<00:05:10.750> is<00:05:10.900> a<00:05:10.960> huge<00:05:11.530> big<00:05:11.950> step<00:05:12.160> up<00:05:12.340> from

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
I mean this is a huge big step up from

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.030 
I mean this is a huge big step up from
the<00:05:13.090> original<00:05:13.290> kind<00:05:14.290> of<00:05:14.350> plastic<00:05:14.830> membrane

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
the original kind of plastic membrane

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.670 
the original kind of plastic membrane
that<00:05:15.430> was<00:05:15.580> used<00:05:15.820> behind<00:05:15.940> the<00:05:16.180> keys<00:05:16.420> where<00:05:17.410> that

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
that was used behind the keys where that

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.930 
that was used behind the keys where that
meant<00:05:17.920> that<00:05:18.010> you'd<00:05:18.160> have<00:05:18.280> to<00:05:18.430> push<00:05:18.610> the<00:05:18.760> key

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
meant that you'd have to push the key

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.060 
meant that you'd have to push the key
down<00:05:19.120> all<00:05:19.420> the<00:05:19.810> way<00:05:19.960> for<00:05:20.620> any<00:05:20.710> sort<00:05:21.010> of

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
down all the way for any sort of

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.040 
down all the way for any sort of
response<00:05:21.160> to<00:05:21.730> occur<00:05:22.030> this<00:05:22.570> you<00:05:22.810> can<00:05:22.930> simply

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
response to occur this you can simply

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.860 
response to occur this you can simply
just<00:05:23.350> tap<00:05:23.500> it<00:05:23.680> and<00:05:24.120> it's<00:05:25.120> working<00:05:25.360> absolutely

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
just tap it and it's working absolutely

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.120 
just tap it and it's working absolutely
fine

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
fine

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.250 
fine
another<00:05:27.580> great<00:05:27.820> thing<00:05:27.880> is<00:05:28.300> that<00:05:28.390> audible

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
another great thing is that audible

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.900 
another great thing is that audible
feedback<00:05:29.440> if<00:05:30.040> you<00:05:30.160> can<00:05:30.280> hear<00:05:30.490> it<00:05:30.520> but<00:05:30.700> every

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
feedback if you can hear it but every

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.430 
feedback if you can hear it but every
time<00:05:30.940> I<00:05:31.090> click<00:05:31.270> a<00:05:31.330> key<00:05:31.600> there's<00:05:31.870> a<00:05:31.990> sort<00:05:32.380> of

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
time I click a key there's a sort of

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.080 
time I click a key there's a sort of
clicking<00:05:32.650> noise<00:05:32.920> and<00:05:33.930> that's<00:05:34.930> great<00:05:35.850> as<00:05:36.850> it

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
clicking noise and that's great as it

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.030 
clicking noise and that's great as it
kind<00:05:37.270> of<00:05:37.360> lets<00:05:37.540> you<00:05:37.630> know<00:05:37.920> when<00:05:38.920> you're

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 
kind of lets you know when you're

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.780 
kind of lets you know when you're
pressing<00:05:39.250> which<00:05:39.880> key<00:05:40.180> and<00:05:40.980> just<00:05:41.980> simply<00:05:42.580> so

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
pressing which key and just simply so

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
pressing which key and just simply so
you<00:05:42.820> know<00:05:43.030> when<00:05:43.180> the<00:05:43.270> computer<00:05:43.600> is<00:05:43.660> actually

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
you know when the computer is actually

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.550 
you know when the computer is actually
registering<00:05:44.410> you<00:05:45.340> pressing<00:05:45.760> the<00:05:45.820> keys<00:05:46.080> so<00:05:47.080> yep

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
registering you pressing the keys so yep

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.410 
registering you pressing the keys so yep
apart<00:05:47.890> from<00:05:47.980> that<00:05:48.190> the<00:05:48.550> keyboard<00:05:48.970> does<00:05:49.210> look

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:49.420 
apart from that the keyboard does look

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.230 
apart from that the keyboard does look
very<00:05:49.450> nice<00:05:49.930> and<00:05:50.290> it's<00:05:50.590> very<00:05:50.650> small<00:05:51.160> which<00:05:52.090> is

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
very nice and it's very small which is

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.790 
very nice and it's very small which is
how<00:05:52.390> I<00:05:52.420> like<00:05:52.720> it<00:05:52.750> I<00:05:53.140> like<00:05:53.770> it<00:05:53.830> much<00:05:54.640> much<00:05:54.850> more

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
how I like it I like it much much more

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.430 
how I like it I like it much much more
relaxed<00:05:56.800> and<00:05:57.450> simply<00:05:58.450> so<00:05:58.570> I<00:05:58.600> can<00:05:58.810> put<00:05:59.170> into<00:05:59.290> my

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
relaxed and simply so I can put into my

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.590 
relaxed and simply so I can put into my
nifty<00:05:59.650> desk

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 
nifty desk

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:06.270 
nifty desk
um<00:06:02.010> alongside<00:06:03.090> that<00:06:04.090> I<00:06:04.390> think<00:06:05.050> the<00:06:05.800> mechanical

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 
um alongside that I think the mechanical

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.010 
um alongside that I think the mechanical
keys<00:06:06.460> does<00:06:06.730> actually<00:06:07.030> allow<00:06:07.240> you<00:06:07.300> to<00:06:07.540> have<00:06:07.750> a

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
keys does actually allow you to have a

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.170 
keys does actually allow you to have a
much<00:06:08.470> much<00:06:08.800> longer<00:06:09.070> cube<00:06:09.670> or<00:06:09.760> whether<00:06:09.940> much

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
much much longer cube or whether much

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.010 
much much longer cube or whether much
much<00:06:10.360> longer<00:06:10.510> life<00:06:10.870> expectancy<00:06:11.560> I<00:06:11.710> mean<00:06:13.020> I

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
much longer life expectancy I mean I

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.350 
much longer life expectancy I mean I
know<00:06:14.530> the<00:06:14.830> membrane<00:06:15.220> keys<00:06:15.550> they<00:06:15.820> kind<00:06:16.090> of<00:06:16.180> wear

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
know the membrane keys they kind of wear

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.070 
know the membrane keys they kind of wear
out<00:06:16.390> they<00:06:16.840> kind<00:06:17.050> of<00:06:17.260> get<00:06:17.680> stuck<00:06:18.100> and<00:06:18.580> they're

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
out they kind of get stuck and they're

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.250 
out they kind of get stuck and they're
basically<00:06:20.080> they<00:06:20.350> just<00:06:20.380> get<00:06:21.250> some<00:06:21.430> sort<00:06:21.700> of

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
basically they just get some sort of

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.530 
basically they just get some sort of
not<00:06:23.530> fatty<00:06:23.800> but<00:06:24.190> wear<00:06:24.370> and<00:06:24.550> tear<00:06:24.760> I<00:06:25.060> mean

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:25.540 
not fatty but wear and tear I mean
