00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:14.110
 I arrived too quickly in a turn 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:17.259
 and I took the barriers of two 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:20.649
 faces I tried to correct the 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:23.710
 trajectory but I do not have to try to 

00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:26.649
 to brake at the risk of falling on the ground 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.029
 so I was afraid of bad good it's mine 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:29.349
 the chrono is a long story 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.770
 love so it's a new 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.600
 incident for me but at 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.150
 the main thing is that this morning you there 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.130
 works well no worries i'm 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.950
 ready to go to battle and there is 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.730
 no apprehension and no embarrassment so 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.640
 it's going to go first step where this is where 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.920
 198 runners are at 100% stress the 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.420
 pressure of 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.649
 of the Tour de France so it's clear it's 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.210
 especially the judges who risk doing 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.159
 damage in the final where all the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.390
 world you're in front is where it's 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:59.370
 is going to be complicated it's clear that the 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.289
 chiefs are going to be surely exist 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.550
 I hope we have our little star 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.550
 above the head to avoid them 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.390
 okay 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:42.490
 we went to a warriors race 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.920
 So here I was 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.740
 Roman rayssac we had succeeded in 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.970
 sniffed the shot 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.180
 since we were both in the 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:56.180
 first group when it broke 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.000
 unfortunately in a roundabout on 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.180
 a wet pavement there is serbo annie 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.010
 who fall in front of me I had Roman in 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:09.170
 the wheel and I did not succeed in 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.390
 go fast and I also fell my 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.080
 front wheel that chased the runner from the 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.120
 day at home well it may be ok 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.160
 Roman perhaps because Roman Roman 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.959
 was there and at the right words in the right place 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.420
 at the well placed and unfortunately bath 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.800
 this little fall but he is and he has 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.180
 answered present today 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.220
 yes Roman bah I think today 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.010
 at the level of sensations and satisfied 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.450
 so I think it's kind of the 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.890
 reassure even if behind and we lost 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.570
 a hand of 7 on the operation I think 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.720
 that he himself in physically he was 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.720
 not bad
