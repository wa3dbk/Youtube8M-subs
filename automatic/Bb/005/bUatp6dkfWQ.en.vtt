00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:13.580
 hello good people, what are we doing again? 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.650
 with our lessons of napkin jesus 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.020
 once told the story of a man 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.240
 which he calls the sower 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.939
 he is thinking here in the sower of the 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.660
 times we got a 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:29.960
 filled with seeds and he left 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.180
 throwing all the seeds in the field and 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.329
 said that these seeds fall into four 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.700
 types of soil in the first place 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.100
 seed fell on the side of the road you 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.890
 knows that the road has ground beaten to 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.600
 seed is a place where the 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.809
 people walk with animals walk 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.750
 and then the text says that the birds of the 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:54.109
 air came and ate that seed 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.989
 Second seed fell on the rocky soil she 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:59.989
 finds some land and grows more 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.629
 the sun when it knocks over it causes 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.449
 she dry because she has no root 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:09.020
 has nowhere to grow where to go deeper 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.360
 in the soil the third seed fell into a soil 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.330
 where she could even grow 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.640
 the problem is that there are other types of 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.820
 seeds planted together with them then 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.640
 is called the thorns and thorns 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.940
 grow much faster and he 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.690
 focus on that seed that can not 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.570
 grow up 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.650
 at last he speaks of the seed which has fallen 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.200
 on good soil 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.370
 even so it shows some 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.060
 differences 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:41.360
 has one that grows and 30 by one or 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.300
 be one seed gave 30 fruits have 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.850
 the one that gave 60 by one and has that 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.510
 who gave 100 for one that fruited a lot 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.020
 more 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.760
 Jesus told this story and then he 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.770
 even there he explained 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.170
 the seed that was sown on the 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.170
 way is like one who hears the word 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:04.280
 of god but he understands nothing 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:07.370
 hit the hard heart and there satan has 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.340
 an action he does or his angels 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:13.720
 demons and take that seed out of the 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.610
 heart and mind of the person who listened 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.040
 in the second case the person hears the 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.960
 gospel and joyfully receives a 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.680
 initial joy 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.870
 the sun represents here the anguish that comes 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.020
 of perception when that 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:33.050
 joking at school or at work 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.260
 Those kind of people who talk to you. 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:40.160
 now he's a follower of jesus he gives up 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.710
 and it pulls me in the third place 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.010
 he also heard the gospel here is a 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:50.240
 Different problem he has other things 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:54.440
 in the heart in the case jesus speaks of two 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:57.680
 worries of the world and the fascination 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.960
 riches as it is true that sometimes 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.540
 You are too worried about the 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.790
 things with stress with actions with 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.490
 work with the family and he said that 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.010
 do not have time for god and sometimes it's 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.990
 really money reminds us that jesus 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.820
 said that the rich with difficulty 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.770
 entered the kingdom of God is not because 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.350
 He is rich because his head is 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.990
 time is very focused on money and 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.510
 I do not need it, that suffocates that. 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.560
 seed he heard from the gospel 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.840
 finally there are those who hear 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.180
 understand and bear fruit anyway 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.690
 these three types from those who 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.720
 another that fortifies 60 and 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.420
 another that fruits without this history 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:46.490
 speaks of four types of heart 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:48.440
 What is your type, what's my type pulls? 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.860
 life people we have to look at this 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.760
 close why jesus was very serious 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:58.670
 he knew we could have reactions 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.980
 preaching the gospel 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.740
 all the messages we receive from the 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.480
 bible all messages that god sends 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.510
 for many reasons 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.180
 all of them can lose our part 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.450
 different reactions to the reaction that we 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:19.070
 we need to have is the reaction of the 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:21.490
 there were understand and fruit then here 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.860
 Are you here I 'm me? 

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.730
 God speaks to us how is your 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.490
 heart 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:31.850
 How are you responding to messages? 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.710
 that you receive from God Himself 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.970
 we talk somewhere 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.970
 another lesson in napkin
