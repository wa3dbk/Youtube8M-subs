00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.710
 hello to all today direction the 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.900
 heaths for cooking a duck breast 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.670
 with honey and balsamic vinegar 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.440
 the duck breast what is it 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.600
 simply the tenderloin of a delicious 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:25.080
 ducks bred and force-fed to obtain 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:26.580
 foie gras then for the preparation 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.680
 duck breast we go first the 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.849
 take flesh side we will simply 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.130
 clean by removing little bits of 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.899
 bold and we move on to the preparation of the 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.110
 skin side so for the skin side you 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.219
 go to make little braces 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.750
 so especially if you decide to do 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.399
 braces on the skin side of 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.899
 your breast try not to go 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.399
 until then expensive otherwise you go there bim 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.440
 and the interest is just to win 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.090
 a few minutes to cooking 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.020
 the duck in a cold pan and we're going 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.730
 simmer 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.440
 the interest of cooking over low heat for 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.510
 an aggressor who will be able to provide 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.770
 greece side is not be seized that's it 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.449
 as you can see after five 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.399
 minutes the duck starts to make a 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.870
 much of its juice is going their 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.250
 book aside because we will avoid 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.810
 that the duck breast bathes in 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.310
 so of course you can well imagine 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.670
 we are not going to throw away the fat 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.500
 duck 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.909
 you can keep it and for example the 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.630
 use to make delicious 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.270
 fried potatoes 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.960
 we will now salty and pepper 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.119
 is on the expensive side and we will move to the 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.310
 baking on the other side you see the 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.720
