the<00:00:30.390> season<00:00:30.570> with<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.289> butt<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.219> then<00:00:32.640> all

the season with the butt and then all

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.520

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.750 
and but I think we'll have enough I
think<00:00:40.290> Joe<00:00:40.649> art<00:00:40.860> starts<00:00:41.250> don't<00:00:41.460> need<00:00:41.550> that

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.319 
think Joe art starts don't need that
that's<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.390> given<00:00:43.460> yeah<00:00:44.460> that's<00:00:44.820> all<00:00:45.090> that's

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
that's a given yeah that's all that's

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.790 
that's a given yeah that's all that's
going<00:00:45.600> there<00:00:45.750> tough<00:00:45.960> one<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.350> we<00:00:46.500> got<00:00:46.649> Joe

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
out in net that's just it and I think

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.860

about<00:00:49.620> for<00:00:49.940> don't<00:00:50.940> do<00:00:51.059> fallbacks<00:00:51.480> actually

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
about for don't do fallbacks actually

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.330 
about for don't do fallbacks actually

Tory<00:01:43.229> are<00:01:43.590> our<00:01:43.829> only<00:01:44.070> fit<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.329> weekly<00:01:45.630> others

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
Tory are our only fit and weekly others

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.480 
Tory are our only fit and weekly others

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
if you get rid of zuculini I don't think

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.370 
if you get rid of zuculini I don't think
it<00:01:47.579> quite<00:01:47.759> well<00:01:48.270> in<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.479> case<00:01:48.689> I'd<00:01:48.930> go<00:01:49.110> for<00:01:49.320> a

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
it quite well in that case I'd go for a

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.249 
it quite well in that case I'd go for a
fernando<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:49.860> yeah<00:01:50.520> it's<00:01:50.909> all<00:01:51.030> right<00:01:51.259> so

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
he's proven himself again in preseason

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.410 
he's proven himself again in preseason
but<00:02:31.780> I<00:02:32.049> think<00:02:32.440> you<00:02:32.530> said<00:02:32.799> off<00:02:32.920> off<00:02:33.250> camera<00:02:33.579> you

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
but I think you said off off camera you

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.089 
but I think you said off off camera you
can<00:02:34.450> do<00:02:34.750> things<00:02:34.959> been<00:02:35.290> preseason<00:02:35.739> yeah<00:02:35.980> well

can do things been preseason yeah well

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.369 
can do things been preseason yeah well
when<00:02:36.340> it<00:02:36.430> gets<00:02:36.640> down<00:02:36.849> to<00:02:36.909> it<00:02:37.180> but<00:02:37.989> i<00:02:38.049> think<00:02:38.290> is

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
when it gets down to it but i think is

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.470 
when it gets down to it but i think is
if<00:02:38.650> he's<00:02:39.190> gonna<00:02:39.340> do<00:02:39.579> it<00:02:39.760> he's<00:02:40.030> gotta<00:02:40.209> be<00:02:40.269> given

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
if he's gonna do it he's gotta be given

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.150 
if he's gonna do it he's gotta be given
a<00:02:40.540> chance<00:02:40.569> doesn't<00:02:41.140> it<00:02:41.200> I'm<00:02:41.319> this<00:02:41.530> yeah<00:02:41.920> I'd

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
a chance doesn't it I'm this yeah I'd

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.220 
a chance doesn't it I'm this yeah I'd
like<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:42.700> think<00:02:43.090> that<00:02:43.180> you<00:02:43.480> know<00:02:43.629> he<00:02:43.810> gets<00:02:43.959> off

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
like to think that you know he gets off

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.319 
like to think that you know he gets off
an<00:02:44.440> hour<00:02:44.590> you<00:02:45.040> know<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:45.489> you<00:02:45.609> switch<00:02:45.879> it<00:02:45.910> that

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
an hour you know and you switch it that

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.809 
an hour you know and you switch it that
sterling<00:02:46.840> comes<00:02:47.079> out<00:02:47.319> for<00:02:47.799> novice<00:02:48.400> and<00:02:48.640> then

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
sterling comes out for novice and then

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.550 
sterling comes out for novice and then
he<00:02:49.120> goes<00:02:49.299> down<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.660> middle<00:02:49.840> and<00:02:50.109> you've<00:02:50.349> got

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
he goes down the middle and you've got

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.530 
he goes down the middle and you've got
an<00:02:51.310> A<00:02:51.400> through<00:02:51.609> the<00:02:51.730> other<00:02:51.879> side<00:02:51.910> for<00:02:52.390> me

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
an A through the other side for me

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.119 
an A through the other side for me
that's<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.349> potential<00:02:53.680> I<00:02:53.709> don't<00:02:53.890> think<00:02:54.040> you'll

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
that's a potential I don't think you'll

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:55.559 
that's a potential I don't think you'll
start<00:02:54.400> with<00:02:54.579> that<00:02:54.730> I<00:02:54.790> think<00:02:55.030> Pellegrini's

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
start with that I think Pellegrini's

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.390 
start with that I think Pellegrini's
shown<00:02:55.780> in<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.019> past<00:02:56.170> there's<00:02:56.859> a<00:02:56.920> caution

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
shown in the past there's a caution

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.710 
shown in the past there's a caution
behind<00:02:57.670> what<00:02:57.849> he<00:02:57.940> does<00:02:58.120> and<00:02:58.299> people<00:02:58.629> who've

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
behind what he does and people who've

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.599 
behind what he does and people who've
got<00:02:58.930> game<00:02:59.140> time<00:02:59.440> and<00:02:59.620> experience<00:02:59.980> will<00:03:00.370> lead

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609 
got game time and experience will lead

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:02.640 
got game time and experience will lead
the<00:03:00.849> front<00:03:01.120> but<00:03:01.900> ultimately<00:03:02.260> I<00:03:02.349> think<00:03:02.379> this

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
the front but ultimately I think this

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.500 
the front but ultimately I think this
season<00:03:03.129> it's<00:03:03.489> a<00:03:03.579> prime<00:03:03.760> example<00:03:03.790> that<00:03:04.269> the

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
season it's a prime example that the

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.729 
season it's a prime example that the
officers<00:03:04.810> are<00:03:04.989> going<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.260> get<00:03:05.379> an<00:03:05.500> opportunity

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
officers are going to get an opportunity

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.160 
officers are going to get an opportunity
and<00:03:06.370> when<00:03:06.879> we're<00:03:07.030> down<00:03:07.150> at<00:03:07.269> the<00:03:07.359> bare<00:03:07.540> bones<00:03:07.810> I

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
and when we're down at the bare bones I

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.319 
and when we're down at the bare bones I
mean<00:03:08.560> if<00:03:08.680> this<00:03:08.829> is<00:03:09.010> I<00:03:09.280> mean<00:03:09.370> if<00:03:09.640> we<00:03:09.760> get<00:03:09.940> three

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
mean if this is I mean if we get three

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.869 
mean if this is I mean if we get three
injuries<00:03:10.690> during<00:03:11.049> the<00:03:11.170> season<00:03:11.260> you<00:03:11.879> think

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
injuries during the season you think

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.300 
injuries during the season you think
gonna<00:03:13.000> play<00:03:13.299> Hartley<00:03:13.690> well<00:03:14.349> it<00:03:14.470> depends<00:03:15.130> where

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
gonna play Hartley well it depends where

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.770 
gonna play Hartley well it depends where
the<00:03:15.370> injuries<00:03:15.700> are<00:03:15.880> i<00:03:16.090> mean<00:03:16.180> i'd<00:03:16.540> go<00:03:16.750> for

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
the injuries are i mean i'd go for

why i start with and then let's give as

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.789 
why i start with and then let's give as
a<00:03:22.060> top<00:03:22.239> manager<00:03:22.419> you<00:03:23.260> see<00:03:23.440> how<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.560> games

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
panning out i mean if you look back to

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.330 
panning out i mean if you look back to
the<00:03:26.049> last<00:03:26.230> friendly<00:03:26.590> with<00:03:26.739> for<00:03:26.950> kneel<00:03:27.129> down

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
the last friendly with for kneel down

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.460 
the last friendly with for kneel down
and<00:03:27.370> he<00:03:27.549> changed<00:03:27.849> things<00:03:27.970> around<00:03:28.139> and<00:03:29.139> we<00:03:29.349> got

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
and he changed things around and we got

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.530 
and he changed things around and we got
the<00:03:29.500> two<00:03:29.739> goals<00:03:30.010> in<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.519> second<00:03:30.819> half<00:03:30.849> now

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
the two goals in the second half now

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.619 
the two goals in the second half now
hopefully<00:03:31.720> won't<00:03:32.019> before<00:03:32.260> kneel<00:03:32.440> down<00:03:32.620> yeah

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
hopefully won't before kneel down yeah

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.440 
hopefully won't before kneel down yeah
but<00:03:34.629> the<00:03:35.319> whole<00:03:35.440> point<00:03:35.470> is<00:03:35.950> you<00:03:36.280> can<00:03:36.459> shift

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
but the whole point is you can shift

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.689 
but the whole point is you can shift
slight<00:03:38.049> changes<00:03:38.500> now<00:03:38.680> is<00:03:38.829> these<00:03:39.040> options<00:03:39.549> of

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:39.699 
slight changes now is these options of

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:41.759 
slight changes now is these options of
actually<00:03:39.970> changing<00:03:40.359> something<00:03:40.569> are<00:03:40.989> limited

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
actually changing something are limited

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.770
