really<00:01:30.390> nice<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:31.350> if<00:01:31.409> you'll<00:01:31.590> just<00:01:31.710> absolutely

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
really nice so if you'll just absolutely

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.740 
really nice so if you'll just absolutely
great<00:01:32.400> in<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.579> hand<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.909> think<00:01:32.970> anchor<00:01:33.509> really

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
great in the hand I think anchor really

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.960 
great in the hand I think anchor really
nailed<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.110> with<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.470> construction<00:01:34.909> now<00:01:35.909> I'm

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
nailed it with the construction now I'm

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:36.890 
nailed it with the construction now I'm
gonna<00:01:36.090> give<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.420> quick<00:01:36.659> size<00:01:36.869> comparison

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
gonna give you a quick size comparison

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.740 
gonna give you a quick size comparison
so<00:01:37.770> here<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.040> have<00:01:38.100> my<00:01:38.280> iPhone<00:01:38.759> 5<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.630> can

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
so here I have my iPhone 5 and you can

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.480 
so here I have my iPhone 5 and you can
see<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.259> definitely<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.159> little<00:01:41.369> bit

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
see that is definitely a little bit

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.969 
see that is definitely a little bit
shorter<00:01:42.000> than<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.240> about<00:01:42.479> 3/4<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.290> here<00:01:43.950> I

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
shorter than it about 3/4 and here I

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.069 
shorter than it about 3/4 and here I
have<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.490> compared<00:01:44.909> laterally<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:45.930> can

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
have it compared laterally so you can

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.020 
have it compared laterally so you can
see<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.500> laying<00:01:46.770> on<00:01:46.860> top<00:01:47.100> it's<00:01:47.579> about<00:01:47.640> half

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
see that laying on top it's about half

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.280 
see that laying on top it's about half
the<00:01:48.270> width<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.720> it's<00:01:48.840> not<00:01:48.960> like<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.170> lot

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
the width and it's not like a lot

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.620 
the width and it's not like a lot
smaller<00:01:49.590> than<00:01:49.770> my<00:01:49.890> iPhone<00:01:50.250> 5<00:01:50.670> however<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.509> see

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
smaller than my iPhone 5 however you see

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.929 
smaller than my iPhone 5 however you see
is<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.840> little<00:01:52.020> bit<00:01:52.110> thicker<00:01:52.350> now<00:01:53.220> here<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.640> have

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
is a little bit thicker now here I have

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.179 
is a little bit thicker now here I have
a<00:01:53.970> 5200<00:01:54.960> milliamp<00:01:55.350> external<00:01:55.740> battery<00:01:56.009> on<00:01:56.100> the

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
a 5200 milliamp external battery on the

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.300 
a 5200 milliamp external battery on the
left<00:01:56.490> which<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.479> 800<00:01:57.869> million<00:01:58.469> smaller<00:01:58.799> you

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
left which is 800 million smaller you

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.889 
left which is 800 million smaller you
can<00:01:59.430> see<00:01:59.549> has<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.850> same<00:02:00.090> height<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.570> same

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
can see has the same height the same

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.590 
can see has the same height the same
thickness<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:02.070> same<00:02:02.310> width<00:02:02.640> so<00:02:03.149> actually

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
thickness and the same width so actually

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.789 
thickness and the same width so actually
all<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.869> way<00:02:03.899> around<00:02:04.259> it's<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.500> tiny<00:02:04.710> bit

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
all the way around it's a tiny bit

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.800 
all the way around it's a tiny bit
smaller<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.759> shows<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.090> just<00:02:06.149> how<00:02:06.390> compact

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
smaller so it shows you just how compact

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.690 
smaller so it shows you just how compact
this<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.259> it's<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.039> little<00:02:08.190> bit<00:02:08.280> smaller<00:02:08.550> than

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
this is it's a little bit smaller than

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.790 
this is it's a little bit smaller than
an<00:02:09.060> external<00:02:09.450> battery<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:10.110> has<00:02:10.440> less

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
an external battery that has less

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.920 
an external battery that has less
capacity<00:02:10.979> there's<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.970> really<00:02:12.209> small<00:02:12.510> portable

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
capacity there's a really small portable

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.370 
capacity there's a really small portable

just like that

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.620 
just like that
I<00:02:25.230> found<00:02:25.950> this<00:02:26.190> charges<00:02:26.670> very<00:02:26.910> quickly<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.510> as

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
I found this charges very quickly and as

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.570 
I found this charges very quickly and as
what<00:02:27.810> it's<00:02:27.900> called<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.200> smart<00:02:28.500> USB<00:02:28.890> port<00:02:29.160> which

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
what it's called a smart USB port which

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.430 
what it's called a smart USB port which
gives<00:02:29.790> about<00:02:29.940> 10<00:02:30.330> percent<00:02:30.690> more<00:02:30.840> battery<00:02:31.260> life

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
gives about 10 percent more battery life

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.290 
gives about 10 percent more battery life
than<00:02:31.710> other<00:02:32.040> external<00:02:32.400> batteries<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.240> I

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
than other external batteries and I

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.540 
than other external batteries and I
found<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.720> got<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:33.990> charge<00:02:34.230> my<00:02:34.500> iPhone<00:02:34.950> 5<00:02:35.190> about

nothing really big but just some small

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.570 
nothing really big but just some small
things<00:02:51.960> maybe<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.680> only<00:02:52.860> has<00:02:53.010> one<00:02:53.040> USB<00:02:53.220> port

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
things maybe that only has one USB port

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.370 
things maybe that only has one USB port
so<00:02:54.360> this<00:02:54.450> other<00:02:54.570> one<00:02:54.780> which<00:02:54.960> I<00:02:55.020> showed<00:02:55.260> you

before has two USB ports and this one

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.750 
before has two USB ports and this one
definitely<00:02:57.720> has<00:02:57.990> enough<00:02:58.080> power<00:02:58.410> for<00:02:58.770> two<00:02:59.220> but

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
definitely has enough power for two but

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.070 
definitely has enough power for two but
it's<00:02:59.850> not<00:02:59.970> too<00:03:00.150> big<00:03:00.270> of<00:03:00.390> a<00:03:00.420> deal<00:03:00.510> that<00:03:00.720> only<00:03:00.870> has

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
it's not too big of a deal that only has

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.710 
it's not too big of a deal that only has
one<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:02.250> next<00:03:02.520> thing<00:03:02.670> would<00:03:02.820> be<00:03:02.880> that<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.300> LED

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
one the next thing would be that the LED

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.450 
one the next thing would be that the LED
indicator<00:03:04.170> now<00:03:04.650> has<00:03:04.770> a<00:03:04.860> pretty<00:03:05.070> cool<00:03:05.130> design

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
indicator now has a pretty cool design

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.340 
indicator now has a pretty cool design
that<00:03:05.640> all<00:03:05.970> you<00:03:06.150> do<00:03:06.240> is<00:03:06.360> shake<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.600> however

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
that all you do is shake it however

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.630 
that all you do is shake it however
found<00:03:07.470> that<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:07.710> does<00:03:07.800> not<00:03:07.920> work<00:03:08.130> all<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.610> time

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
found that it does not work all the time

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.850 
found that it does not work all the time
until<00:03:09.060> a<00:03:09.210> bit<00:03:09.330> unorthodox<00:03:09.630> me<00:03:10.140> shaking<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.680> if

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
until a bit unorthodox me shaking it if

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.680 
until a bit unorthodox me shaking it if
you're<00:03:11.460> out<00:03:11.520> in<00:03:11.610> public<00:03:11.850> or<00:03:12.180> whatever<00:03:12.450> just

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
you're out in public or whatever just

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.960 
you're out in public or whatever just
like<00:03:12.810> that<00:03:13.020> so<00:03:13.920> I<00:03:14.040> wish<00:03:14.370> they<00:03:14.520> would<00:03:14.670> have<00:03:14.700> a

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
like that so I wish they would have a

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.760 
like that so I wish they would have a
physical<00:03:15.480> button<00:03:15.630> or<00:03:15.960> maybe<00:03:16.110> even<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.560> touch

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
physical button or maybe even a touch

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.770 
physical button or maybe even a touch
button<00:03:17.100> on<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:17.580> which<00:03:17.970> you<00:03:18.120> could<00:03:18.300> use<00:03:18.330> to

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
button on it which you could use to

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.270 
button on it which you could use to
activate<00:03:18.990> it<00:03:19.440> instead<00:03:19.680> of<00:03:19.740> having<00:03:19.920> to<00:03:20.070> shake

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
activate it instead of having to shake

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.620 
activate it instead of having to shake
it<00:03:20.460> because<00:03:20.640> it<00:03:20.880> does<00:03:21.000> not<00:03:21.030> work<00:03:21.270> all<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.600> time

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
it because it does not work all the time

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.290 
it because it does not work all the time
but<00:03:22.080> apart<00:03:22.920> from<00:03:22.980> that<00:03:23.100> it<00:03:23.460> works<00:03:24.000> pretty<00:03:24.150> well

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
but apart from that it works pretty well

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.210 
but apart from that it works pretty well
I<00:03:24.660> definitely<00:03:25.020> like<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.200> system<00:03:25.560> of<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.800> LED

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
I definitely like the system of the LED

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.980 
I definitely like the system of the LED
lights<00:03:26.250> so<00:03:26.910> it's<00:03:27.000> not<00:03:27.090> that<00:03:27.330> big<00:03:27.450> of<00:03:27.630> a<00:03:27.660> problem

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
lights so it's not that big of a problem

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.530 
lights so it's not that big of a problem
another<00:03:28.920> small<00:03:29.310> little<00:03:29.700> problem<00:03:30.000> I<00:03:30.030> found<00:03:30.240> was

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
another small little problem I found was

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.390 
another small little problem I found was
that<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:31.020> bag<00:03:31.380> was<00:03:31.620> a<00:03:31.650> little<00:03:32.010> bit<00:03:32.100> too<00:03:32.250> small

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
that the bag was a little bit too small

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.280 
that the bag was a little bit too small
now<00:03:33.180> definitely<00:03:33.420> fits<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.840> external<00:03:34.170> battery

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
now definitely fits the external battery

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.740 
now definitely fits the external battery
perfectly<00:03:34.860> fine<00:03:35.070> but<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:35.790> USB<00:03:36.180> port<00:03:36.510> doesn't

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
perfectly fine but the USB port doesn't

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.810 
perfectly fine but the USB port doesn't
fit<00:03:37.050> too<00:03:37.290> well<00:03:37.320> in<00:03:37.650> there<00:03:37.830> I<00:03:38.040> wish<00:03:38.430> I<00:03:38.550> would<00:03:38.670> put

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
fit too well in there I wish I would put

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.190 
fit too well in there I wish I would put
a<00:03:38.850> little<00:03:39.030> bit<00:03:39.120> more<00:03:39.210> room<00:03:39.450> on<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:39.660> top<00:03:39.900> so<00:03:40.110> you

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
a little bit more room on the top so you

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.540 
a little bit more room on the top so you
can<00:03:40.320> just<00:03:40.500> set<00:03:40.650> it<00:03:40.740> in<00:03:40.860> there<00:03:41.010> really<00:03:41.280> easily

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
can just set it in there really easily

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.880 
can just set it in there really easily
just<00:03:41.820> like<00:03:42.120> that<00:03:42.360> or<00:03:42.959> else<00:03:43.320> you<00:03:43.500> would<00:03:43.620> have<00:03:43.740> to

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
just like that or else you would have to

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.770 
just like that or else you would have to
kind<00:03:44.610> of<00:03:44.700> put<00:03:44.880> it<00:03:44.970> down<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.209> side<00:03:45.420> and<00:03:45.690> it

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
kind of put it down the side and it

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.300 
kind of put it down the side and it
doesn't<00:03:46.020> really<00:03:46.110> fit<00:03:46.410> kind<00:03:46.620> of<00:03:46.709> bulges<00:03:47.130> off

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
doesn't really fit kind of bulges off

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.610 
doesn't really fit kind of bulges off
the<00:03:47.880> side<00:03:48.060> of<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.240> bag<00:03:48.450> so<00:03:48.690> again<00:03:48.990> it's<00:03:49.410> not<00:03:49.530> a

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
the side of the bag so again it's not a

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.350 
the side of the bag so again it's not a
huge<00:03:49.950> problem<00:03:50.190> and<00:03:50.580> all<00:03:50.820> these<00:03:50.970> problems

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
huge problem and all these problems

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.060 
huge problem and all these problems
wouldn't<00:03:51.720> really<00:03:51.810> make<00:03:52.020> me<00:03:52.230> not<00:03:52.650> want<00:03:52.860> to<00:03:52.920> get

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
wouldn't really make me not want to get

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.460 
wouldn't really make me not want to get
it<00:03:53.190> so<00:03:53.880> overall<00:03:54.120> I'm<00:03:54.360> a<00:03:54.420> huge<00:03:54.690> fan<00:03:54.959> of<00:03:54.990> this<00:03:55.170> for
