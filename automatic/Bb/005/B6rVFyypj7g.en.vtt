00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 from the series the best contributions in the 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.390
 test, I introduce you to the multi today 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.389
 Power 50 percent protein was about to be released 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.280
 he lies here before me what is that 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.019
 special on the tie now he has like 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.590
 not recognizing one is very obvious 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.020
 low sugar content and he has 50 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.410
 gramm gramme in total now we go 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.699
 just around the bar 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.990
 so it looks from the back and the 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.519
 Nutrition or stuck down here 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:36.239
 underneath 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:40.140
 I hope you can recognize the I have 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:44.219
 now we have a total of 173 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.690
 kilocalories have the rule and 12 5 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.850
 Carbohydrate is actually that 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.520
 important in the latch and has 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.280
 while only 0.9 grams of sugar what really 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.410
 is very little and everyone supplies normally 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.239
 of course after adam giant 25 grams 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:08.850
 protein virtually every protein is one 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:14.689
 Then the mixture was never known 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.689
 exactly the old town back then 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.710
 calcium carbonate milk protein isolate and 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.630
 egg white occurs 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.479
 thus placed in the rules of the bolt 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.369
 classic multi-component protein against 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.369
 the rules from the inside 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.860
 The bitten usually looks from where 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.180
 you can see that he completely from 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:48.150
 chocolate is coated and therewith 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.520
 creamy filling is really very 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.130
 very delicious and beautiful even you can me 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.090
 recommend it to anyone 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.790
