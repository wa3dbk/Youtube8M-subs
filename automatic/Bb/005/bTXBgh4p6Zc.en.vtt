00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.170 
machines are pretty weak and you're not
going<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.399> be<00:01:53.460> able<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.700> get<00:01:53.820> stuff<00:01:54.030> very

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
going to be able to get stuff very

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.300 
going to be able to get stuff very
easily<00:01:54.450> but<00:01:55.020> with<00:01:55.110> some<00:01:55.290> practice<00:01:55.470> it's<00:01:56.189> not

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
easily but with some practice it's not

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.370 
easily but with some practice it's not
that<00:01:56.549> difficult<00:01:56.759> sugar<00:01:57.630> loaf<00:01:57.840> machines<00:01:58.229> are

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
that difficult sugar loaf machines are

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.020 
that difficult sugar loaf machines are
centered<00:01:58.680> around<00:01:58.740> skill<00:01:59.250> so<00:01:59.520> if<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.729> can<00:01:59.909> get

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
centered around skill so if you can get

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.940 
centered around skill so if you can get
the<00:02:00.149> clog<00:02:00.390> correctly<00:02:00.960> around<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.350> plush<00:02:01.619> all

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
the clog correctly around the plush all

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.620 
the clog correctly around the plush all
three<00:02:02.280> prongs<00:02:02.520> around<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.360> doesn't

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
three prongs around it and it doesn't

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.149 
three prongs around it and it doesn't
hit<00:02:03.689> anything<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.380> course<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.979> claw

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
hit anything and of course the claw

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.920 
hit anything and of course the claw
having<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.549> good<00:02:05.700> strength<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.390> will<00:02:06.600> win<00:02:06.810> it

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
having a good strength you will win it

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.839 
having a good strength you will win it
but<00:02:07.170> then<00:02:07.409> there's<00:02:07.680> those<00:02:07.979> other<00:02:08.280> machines

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
but then there's those other machines

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.880 
but then there's those other machines
that<00:02:09.270> are<00:02:09.479> all<00:02:09.660> rigged<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.410> they<00:02:10.470> don't<00:02:10.709> want

cranes<00:02:19.150> for<00:02:19.450> being<00:02:19.629> rigged<00:02:20.019> because<00:02:20.709> what

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
cranes for being rigged because what

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.709 
cranes for being rigged because what
they<00:02:21.010> do<00:02:21.069> is<00:02:21.400> after<00:02:21.640> it<00:02:21.939> picks<00:02:22.180> up<00:02:22.299> the<00:02:22.450> prize

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:25.359 
it will clamp very very strong and it

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:26.759 
it will clamp very very strong and it
will<00:02:25.480> appear<00:02:25.750> like<00:02:25.930> you're<00:02:26.140> going<00:02:26.379> to<00:02:26.500> win<00:02:26.650> it

but after it picks it up and goes to the

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.839 
but after it picks it up and goes to the
top<00:02:28.810> it<00:02:29.109> sits<00:02:29.650> there<00:02:29.829> for<00:02:29.889> like<00:02:30.189> ten<00:02:30.430> seconds

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
top it sits there for like ten seconds

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.220
