00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.610
 hello to all friends 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.500
 a panic greeting and welcome back to 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.240
 this new south east daily video 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.420
 that as usual we return with the if 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.340
 the second Friday appointment where 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.170
 let's go to decrypt in g open a 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.460
 admin package to go go 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.090
 for this Friday we have a 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.160
 available 23 in rare g legendary two 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.029
 an armor is a weapon and three packets 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.710
 of the administrator including one of the 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.079
 tar clip that two of the dead orbit 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.360
 let's see if while decreeing all the 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.770
 stuff dinners from another of the crypt I think 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.750
 yes, but let us not waste any more time 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.520
 I'm going to make the food supply there 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.829
 we see very little perfect is me 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.020
 everything was in the inventory so without 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.940
 lose more time let's decrypt 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.399
 first we decree all the rare ones see 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.100
 a little bit if we are lucky like al 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.199
 usually don't start giving us all the stuff 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.730
 same and we always hope some strange 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.949
 coin in some particle of light 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.219
 maybe in some beating of ass 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.530
 ok strange particle currency there were 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.340
 true 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.930
 nothing nothing we keep those 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.340
 rare guys we understand that I am one 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.900
 we don't need total shit 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.119
 nothing the usual shit 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.850
 we have finished the rare ones we pass 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.690
 let's move on to those legendary pinzano 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.770
 from the perfect armor that is not for the 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.940
 my class seems to me to be for the 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.350
 hunter that stuff over here in the 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:32.100
 we trace tension in legendary range 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:34.619
 primary that shitty game my mom 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.259
 no comment no comment let's go to 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.880
 to open the first ones I empty everything 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.990
 the inventory of all the stuff that has me 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.610
 since my useless then 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.250
 we are going to open the packages for 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.600
 avoid incurring what I do 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.610
 It happened last week that you 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.110
 you have punctually correct I thought myself 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.270
 had paid a package instead o 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.780
 simply the full arrival inventory 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.580
 immediately 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.009
 here we are then as usual also 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.450
 if all the shit we find we succeed 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.520
 to make it come in handy because 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.920
 however between pieces of weapon and lumens 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.690
 we always have a good economic return 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.220
 let's say so 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.000
 ok here we are starting from the avant-garde 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.190
 I have no claims because basically 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.380
 I don't need anything, but let's see 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.630
 system something smart perfet la 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.900
 shit fire generates maybe it's cute with 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.430
 the shader an interesting attention 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.799
 interesting we are going to open them all 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.630
 then hope after the dead bollard 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.920
 are either the shaders or the gravity 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.260
 deviant that I need that is the 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.820
 machine gun the miter says heavy 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:35.100
 let's go with the first shit the model 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:39.299
 of the exodus for the titan omen of the 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:43.260
 useless chaos we continue to nothing 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:45.209
 the most total disgust sucks 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.220
 knows very well we go to open the 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:52.100
 last serious of the dl creep plate that there 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:57.350
 he gave primary strange strange coin 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:59.850
 legendary are the buses and the weapon la 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.410
 cancellation cancellation we go to 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.190
 see her because I'm pretty curious 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:08.250
 the cancellation closes and more becomes 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.900
 precise of the feature war clan 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.590
 boh come on maybe it's not bad I do that 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.910
 keep me 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.750
 let's see if mental daniele I don't have 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.099
