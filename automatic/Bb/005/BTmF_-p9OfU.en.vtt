00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
that'd be good for our function in the

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:41.180 
that'd be good for our function in the
back<00:00:29.660> everybody<00:00:30.660> can<00:00:30.810> hear<00:00:30.960> me<00:00:39.770> here<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:41.010> show

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
back everybody can hear me here is show

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.779 
back everybody can hear me here is show
you<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.399> demonstration<00:00:41.660> on<00:00:42.660> one<00:00:43.440> very<00:00:44.399> small

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
you the demonstration on one very small

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.639 
you the demonstration on one very small
skill<00:00:45.180> set<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.629> we<00:00:45.719> have<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.170> infantry

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
skill set that we have in the infantry

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.190 
skill set that we have in the infantry
and<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.309> go<00:00:47.489> into<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.820> building<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.539> a

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
and that is to go into a building in a

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.520 
and that is to go into a building in a
room<00:00:50.390> discriminating<00:00:51.390> against<00:00:51.660> between

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
room discriminating against between

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.979 
room discriminating against between
hostile<00:00:53.070> targets<00:00:53.610> one<00:00:53.850> hostile<00:00:54.300> targets<00:00:54.809> why

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
hostile targets one hostile targets why

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.229 
hostile targets one hostile targets why
shoot<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.649> guy's<00:00:55.949> not<00:00:56.489> shoot<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.879> good<00:00:56.910> guy

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
shoot that guy's not shoot the good guy

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.529 
shoot that guy's not shoot the good guy
so<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.570> scenario<00:00:57.719> we<00:00:58.109> have<00:00:58.140> today<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:59.539> there's

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
so the scenario we have today is there's

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.500 
so the scenario we have today is there's
a<00:01:00.600> downed<00:01:00.899> pilot<00:01:01.469> being<00:01:01.829> held<00:01:02.129> by<00:01:02.510> held

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
mission is to go into that building and

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.789 
mission is to go into that building and
recover<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.240> capture<00:01:12.659> pilot<00:01:12.869> rescue<00:01:13.619> them

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
remove them from the building back to

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.100 
remove them from the building back to
safe<00:01:15.960> area<00:01:16.880> we<00:01:17.880> also<00:01:18.030> know<00:01:18.299> from<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.750> orders

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
safe area we also know from the orders

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.450 
safe area we also know from the orders
that<00:01:19.259> we<00:01:19.320> would<00:01:19.470> receive<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.950> intelligence

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
that we would receive the intelligence

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.640 
that we would receive the intelligence
brief<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:21.479> individuals<00:01:22.020> holding<00:01:22.320> them<00:01:22.500> are

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
brief the individuals holding them are

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.340 
brief the individuals holding them are
very<00:01:22.860> aggressive<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.880> likely<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.330> engage<00:01:24.630> so

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
very aggressive and likely to engage so

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.859 
very aggressive and likely to engage so
our<00:01:25.710> rules<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.400> engagement<00:01:26.939> would<00:01:27.060> be<00:01:27.240> to

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
our rules of engagement would be to

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.420 
our rules of engagement would be to
encase<00:01:28.259> them<00:01:28.560> if<00:01:28.680> there<00:01:28.860> are<00:01:28.979> threatened<00:01:29.340> if

resources to different skill sets and
but<00:01:45.020> 2004<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.049> believe<00:01:46.109> it<00:01:46.469> was<00:01:46.590> 2004<00:01:47.429> i

but 2004 I believe it was 2004 i
something<00:01:47.850> like<00:01:47.969> that<00:01:48.179> the<00:01:48.390> main<00:01:48.600> forces

00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:48.959 
something like that the main forces

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:51.080 
something like that the main forces
embarked<00:01:49.560> on<00:01:49.709> enhancing<00:01:50.310> those<00:01:50.490> skills<00:01:50.819> to

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
embarked on enhancing those skills to

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.630 
embarked on enhancing those skills to
your<00:01:51.270> operations<00:01:51.959> instructors<00:01:52.920> training

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
your operations instructors training

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.419 
your operations instructors training
program<00:01:54.109> okay<00:01:55.109> so<00:01:55.859> we're<00:01:55.979> going<00:01:56.069> to<00:01:56.130> employ

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
program okay so we're going to employ

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:58.399 
program okay so we're going to employ
some<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.759> those<00:01:56.880> skills<00:01:57.240> today<00:01:57.569> very<00:01:58.020> short

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
some of those skills today very short

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.279 
some of those skills today very short
demonstration<00:01:59.000> again<00:02:00.000> farther<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.929> are<00:02:01.079> on

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
demonstration again farther you are on

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:02.719 
demonstration again farther you are on
the<00:02:01.409> way<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.590> harder<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.399> going<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.670> be

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
the way the harder it is going to be
