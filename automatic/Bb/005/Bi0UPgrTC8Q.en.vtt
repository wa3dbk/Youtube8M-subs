system<00:03:09.700> our<00:03:09.940> text<00:03:10.390> and<00:03:10.600> then<00:03:11.500> it's<00:03:12.430> gonna<00:03:12.640> have

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
system our text and then it's gonna have

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.540 
system our text and then it's gonna have
so<00:03:14.830> it's<00:03:15.370> a<00:03:15.610> pretty<00:03:15.820> complicated<00:03:16.239> code<00:03:17.550> but

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
so it's a pretty complicated code but

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.449 
so it's a pretty complicated code but
I'm<00:03:19.180> gonna<00:03:19.390> show<00:03:19.510> you<00:03:19.600> what<00:03:19.750> it<00:03:19.780> does<00:03:20.459> right

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
I'm gonna show you what it does right

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.280 
I'm gonna show you what it does right
now<00:03:21.670> so<00:03:22.630> you<00:03:22.690> start<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.019> form<00:03:23.200> up<00:03:24.989> you<00:03:25.989> know<00:03:26.170> it

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
now so you start the form up you know it

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.460 
now so you start the form up you know it
