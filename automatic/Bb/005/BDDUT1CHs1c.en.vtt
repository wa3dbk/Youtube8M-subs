of understanding of what it's like to be
an<00:02:04.210> older<00:02:04.420> person<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:08.460> first<00:02:09.460> article<00:02:09.940> I<00:02:10.770> asked

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
an older person so first article I asked

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.670 
an older person so first article I asked
you<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:11.980> read<00:02:12.160> is<00:02:12.340> by<00:02:13.030> alchimia<00:02:14.020> and<00:02:14.230> Ali

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
you to read is by alchimia and Ali

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.230 
you to read is by alchimia and Ali
it's<00:02:14.800> called<00:02:14.980> gerontologist<00:02:15.670> future<00:02:16.030> an

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
it's called gerontologist future an

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.670 
it's called gerontologist future an
integrative<00:02:16.810> model<00:02:17.110> for<00:02:17.260> disciplinary

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
integrative model for disciplinary

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.060 
integrative model for disciplinary
advancement<00:02:18.370> I<00:02:18.610> think<00:02:19.090> this<00:02:19.180> is<00:02:19.300> an<00:02:19.420> excellent

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
advancement I think this is an excellent

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.950 
advancement I think this is an excellent
primer<00:02:21.070> for<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:22.270> current<00:02:22.600> state<00:02:22.840> of

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
primer for the current state of

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.540 
primer for the current state of
gerontology<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:24.430> gerontology<00:02:25.140> is<00:02:26.310> kind<00:02:27.310> of<00:02:27.459> a

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
gerontology so gerontology is kind of a

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.320 
gerontology so gerontology is kind of a
discipline<00:02:27.940> in<00:02:28.060> itself<00:02:28.390> it's<00:02:29.820> studying<00:02:30.820> Aging

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
discipline in itself it's studying Aging

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.220 
discipline in itself it's studying Aging
is<00:02:32.220> is<00:02:33.220> that<00:02:33.459> unique<00:02:33.850> however<00:02:34.300> each<00:02:34.840> of<00:02:35.080> those

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
is is that unique however each of those

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.320 
is is that unique however each of those
disciplines<00:02:36.130> we<00:02:36.250> just<00:02:36.459> mentioned<00:02:37.240> is<00:02:39.330> studies

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
disciplines we just mentioned is studies

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.310 
disciplines we just mentioned is studies
Aging<00:02:40.690> on<00:02:40.870> its<00:02:41.020> own<00:02:42.120> gerontology<00:02:43.120> is<00:02:43.270> kind<00:02:44.230> of

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
Aging on its own gerontology is kind of

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.890 
Aging on its own gerontology is kind of
more<00:02:45.160> when<00:02:45.880> you<00:02:46.150> study<00:02:46.450> when<00:02:46.780> these

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
more when you study when these

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.410 
more when you study when these
disciplines<00:02:47.350> come<00:02:47.590> together<00:02:47.770> to<00:02:48.580> understand

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
disciplines come together to understand

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.410 
disciplines come together to understand
Aging<00:02:49.930> in<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.290> more<00:02:50.740> clear<00:02:51.250> way<00:02:51.690> so<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:55.180> goal<00:02:55.390> of

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
Aging in a more clear way so the goal of

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.050 
Aging in a more clear way so the goal of
gerontology<00:02:56.230> would<00:02:56.410> be<00:02:56.560> to<00:02:56.950> become<00:02:57.880> as

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
gerontology would be to become as

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.050 
gerontology would be to become as
recognized<00:02:58.540> this<00:02:58.780> biology<00:02:59.610> psychology<00:03:00.610> and

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
recognized this biology psychology and

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.479 
recognized this biology psychology and
sociology<00:03:01.650> but<00:03:02.650> of<00:03:02.800> course<00:03:02.980> we<00:03:03.130> can<00:03:03.250> never

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
sociology but of course we can never

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.330 
sociology but of course we can never
fully<00:03:03.850> separate<00:03:04.390> ourselves<00:03:04.570> from<00:03:05.340> biologists

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
fully separate ourselves from biologists

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.600 
fully separate ourselves from biologists
psychologists<00:03:06.790> sociologists<00:03:07.680> so<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:11.370> lot<00:03:12.370> of

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
psychologists sociologists so a lot of

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.680 
psychologists sociologists so a lot of
the<00:03:12.880> theories<00:03:13.450> of<00:03:13.480> Aging<00:03:14.019> are<00:03:14.440> actually

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
the theories of Aging are actually

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.900 
the theories of Aging are actually
theories<00:03:16.690> of<00:03:17.340> psychology<00:03:18.340> of<00:03:18.400> Aging<00:03:18.790> or

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
theories of psychology of Aging or

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.690 
theories of psychology of Aging or
theories<00:03:19.300> of<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.570> sociology<00:03:20.140> of<00:03:20.170> Aging<00:03:20.700> but

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
theories of the sociology of Aging but

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.449 
theories of the sociology of Aging but
there's<00:03:22.360> increasingly<00:03:22.900> an<00:03:23.739> emphasis<00:03:24.070> on

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
there's increasingly an emphasis on

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.400 
there's increasingly an emphasis on
creating<00:03:24.850> interdisciplinary<00:03:25.810> studies<00:03:26.170> and

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
creating interdisciplinary studies and

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.289 
creating interdisciplinary studies and
introduced<00:03:27.010> apply<00:03:27.220> marry<00:03:27.400> theories<00:03:27.790> that

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
introduced apply marry theories that

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.539 
introduced apply marry theories that
link<00:03:28.690> concepts<00:03:29.590> and<00:03:29.860> we'll<00:03:30.010> get<00:03:30.100> into<00:03:30.250> that<00:03:30.489> a

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
link concepts and we'll get into that a

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.620 
link concepts and we'll get into that a
little<00:03:30.790> bit<00:03:30.940> more<00:03:31.150> later<00:03:31.360> so

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.900 

I<00:03:35.660> think<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:37.000> there's<00:03:38.000> a<00:03:38.090> wonderful<00:03:38.330> chart<00:03:39.260> on

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
I think the there's a wonderful chart on

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.350 
I think the there's a wonderful chart on
the<00:03:40.910> Okemah<00:03:41.690> and<00:03:41.870> Ally<00:03:42.800> article<00:03:43.360> that

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
the Okemah and Ally article that

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:50.140 
the Okemah and Ally article that
describes<00:03:44.780> different<00:03:45.560> ways<00:03:45.680> of<00:03:45.920> viewing<00:03:49.150> how

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
describes different ways of viewing how

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.900 
describes different ways of viewing how
to<00:03:50.210> view<00:03:50.390> gerontology<00:03:51.110> so<00:03:52.010> based<00:03:52.730> on<00:03:52.850> that

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
to view gerontology so based on that

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.940 
to view gerontology so based on that
chart<00:03:53.680> it<00:03:54.680> shows<00:03:54.740> that<00:03:55.550> ageing<00:03:56.950> gerontology

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
chart it shows that ageing gerontology

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:58.960 
chart it shows that ageing gerontology
in<00:03:58.010> the<00:03:58.070> center<00:03:58.250> I<00:03:58.310> know<00:03:58.430> you<00:03:58.490> can't<00:03:58.790> see

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
in the center I know you can't see

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.720 
in the center I know you can't see
clearly<00:03:59.120> so<00:03:59.540> you<00:03:59.630> have<00:03:59.780> to<00:03:59.870> look<00:04:00.020> at<00:04:00.140> your<00:04:00.290> own

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
clearly so you have to look at your own

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.850 
clearly so you have to look at your own
document<00:04:01.730> page<00:04:01.880> 578<00:04:02.630> and<00:04:03.050> the<00:04:03.200> first<00:04:03.440> article

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
document page 578 and the first article

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.130 
document page 578 and the first article
on<00:04:03.920> blackboard<00:04:06.040> they<00:04:07.040> start<00:04:07.340> off<00:04:07.520> with<00:04:08.090> age<00:04:08.630> in

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
on blackboard they start off with age in

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.740 
on blackboard they start off with age in
the<00:04:09.560> left<00:04:09.890> corner<00:04:10.420> aging<00:04:11.420> and<00:04:12.010> aged<00:04:13.010> so<00:04:13.820> 8<00:04:14.480> by

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
the left corner aging and aged so 8 by

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.720 
the left corner aging and aged so 8 by
age<00:04:14.990> of<00:04:15.320> talking<00:04:15.620> about<00:04:15.770> the<00:04:15.950> concept<00:04:16.430> of<00:04:16.520> age

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
age of talking about the concept of age

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.900 
age of talking about the concept of age
so<00:04:17.330> age<00:04:17.810> defines<00:04:18.350> who<00:04:18.650> you<00:04:18.710> are<00:04:19.010> what<00:04:19.610> you<00:04:19.760> can

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
so age defines who you are what you can

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.240 
so age defines who you are what you can
do<00:04:20.150> so<00:04:20.570> for<00:04:20.780> example<00:04:21.260> things<00:04:21.500> happen<00:04:21.890> certain

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
do so for example things happen certain

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.820 
do so for example things happen certain
age<00:04:22.430> biologically<00:04:23.330> right<00:04:23.630> there's<00:04:24.140> certain

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
age biologically right there's certain

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.950 
age biologically right there's certain
developments<00:04:25.490> that<00:04:25.820> happen<00:04:26.300> biologically

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
developments that happen biologically

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.250 
developments that happen biologically
but<00:04:27.530> also<00:04:27.890> psychologically<00:04:28.760> as<00:04:28.880> well

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
but also psychologically as well

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.850 
but also psychologically as well
different<00:04:30.260> levels<00:04:30.560> of<00:04:30.590> understanding

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
different levels of understanding

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.090 
different levels of understanding
different<00:04:31.520> capacities<00:04:32.120> through<00:04:32.830> just<00:04:33.830> age

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
different capacities through just age

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.080 
different capacities through just age
itself<00:04:34.870> and<00:04:36.340> sociological<00:04:37.340> you're<00:04:37.820> viewed

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
itself and sociological you're viewed

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.870 
itself and sociological you're viewed
differently<00:04:38.620> depending<00:04:39.620> on<00:04:40.070> your<00:04:40.130> age<00:04:40.580> and

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
differently depending on your age and

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.200 
differently depending on your age and
then<00:04:41.780> there's<00:04:42.230> aging<00:04:42.860> which<00:04:43.430> is<00:04:43.460> the<00:04:43.760> process

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
then there's aging which is the process

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.140 
then there's aging which is the process
of<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:44.510> passage<00:04:44.960> of<00:04:45.080> time
