going to appreciate the fact that
there's<00:06:24.750> no<00:06:24.930> luck<00:06:25.139> because<00:06:25.380> it<00:06:25.590> means<00:06:25.800> that<00:06:26.039> it

00:06:26.149 --> 00:06:26.159 
there's no luck because it means that it

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:28.430 
there's no luck because it means that it
really<00:06:26.460> is<00:06:26.789> a<00:06:27.120> true<00:06:27.539> one-on-one<00:06:28.139> competition

really is a true one-on-one competition
of<00:06:28.889> skill<00:06:29.219> where<00:06:29.940> the<00:06:30.180> only<00:06:30.599> thing<00:06:30.870> between

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
of skill where the only thing between

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.649 
of skill where the only thing between
you<00:06:31.320> and<00:06:31.710> victory<00:06:32.070> is<00:06:32.310> your<00:06:32.669> choices<00:06:32.940> and<00:06:33.449> your

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:33.659

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:35.760 
opponent's choices and then it makes for

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.800 
opponent's choices and then it makes for

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:13.750 
that increases the engagement although I

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.659 
that increases the engagement although I
do<00:07:13.840> have<00:07:14.320> to<00:07:14.380> dock<00:07:14.710> at<00:07:14.860> a<00:07:14.919> couple<00:07:15.250> points

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:15.669 
do have to dock at a couple points

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:18.750 
do have to dock at a couple points
