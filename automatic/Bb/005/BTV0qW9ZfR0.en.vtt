00:00:00.679 --> 00:00:04.090
 hello to all I will present the initial planning 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.130
 she I bought for my little mini 1000 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.799
 it's the head in the heart 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:11.629
 blacks I have however 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:14.549
 So here she is completely boned 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.220
 I'm almost done so 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.960
 maybe because nice 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.960
 - define and level engine yet so it takes my internship 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.640
 filtering 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.359
 coli who has refused until now tweaks to do 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.470
 it was 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.470
 consumption - do it 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.320
 so I will not make you listen to the noise 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.290
 I do not know if we go on the internet but the gross more 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.440
 the mini the group is called like that double exit nox 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.560
 I showed expectations then 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.560
 the fed showed herself 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.720
 so I kept the taste 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.420
 the central 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.580
 for birthdays 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.810
 leadership qualities 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.810
 charles juillard adapted to the maximum of what I think 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.350
 that's why she and not settled in choria of the essence settings to do 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.770
 because I feel that for gasoline 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.660
 but good at this nice 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.660
 you took me driving at the cubs at lcn suddenly it's all the sector 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.820
 kader at the thur at tarbes 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.470
 that's how I see sunlight 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.270
 despite all first motivated 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.980
 cheese finish 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.220
 all I have to do 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.230
 grandpa or put you would show the bafin here I hope it has you 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.800
 enjoyed 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.210
 so it's a bit of a mini lottery out 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.060
 that I mounted on an internship 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.990
 at the end of the race
