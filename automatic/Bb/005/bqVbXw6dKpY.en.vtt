00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
let's get the plastic office let's take

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.590 
let's get the plastic office let's take
a<00:03:18.160> look<00:03:18.370> at<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.489> keyboard<00:03:18.910> now<00:03:19.299> there's<00:03:19.480> some

a look at the keyboard now there's some
keys<00:03:19.810> that<00:03:19.959> are<00:03:20.019> different<00:03:20.620> then<00:03:20.709> they're

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
keys that are different then they're

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.470 
keys that are different then they're
specific<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.489> the<00:03:21.610> iPod<00:03:22.030> and<00:03:22.269> I'll

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
specific to the iPod and I'll

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.180 
specific to the iPod and I'll
demonstrate<00:03:22.720> those<00:03:23.140> when<00:03:23.350> I<00:03:23.380> have<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:23.860> iPad

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
demonstrate those when I have the iPad

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.050

connected<00:03:25.769> on<00:03:26.769> the<00:03:27.190> back<00:03:27.370> it<00:03:27.640> looks<00:03:27.820> like<00:03:27.940> an

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
connected on the back it looks like an

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.319 
connected on the back it looks like an
even<00:03:28.299> larger<00:03:28.540> footrest<00:03:29.260> for<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:30.610> keypad<00:03:31.030> and

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
even larger footrest for the keypad and

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.120 
even larger footrest for the keypad and
the<00:03:31.570> iPad<00:03:32.019> let's<00:03:32.350> see<00:03:32.470> how<00:03:32.530> this<00:03:32.680> compares<00:03:33.070> to

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
the iPad let's see how this compares to

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.350 
the iPad let's see how this compares to
the<00:03:33.310> small<00:03:33.579> dock<00:03:34.200> of<00:03:35.200> course<00:03:35.440> it's<00:03:35.620> smaller

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
the small dock of course it's smaller

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.280 
the small dock of course it's smaller
it's<00:03:37.360> got<00:03:37.480> a<00:03:37.510> smaller<00:03:37.870> base<00:03:39.810> but<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:40.930> back<00:03:41.079> is

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
it's got a smaller base but the back is

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.170 
it's got a smaller base but the back is
very<00:03:41.320> similar<00:03:41.769> so<00:03:42.070> you<00:03:42.640> got<00:03:42.850> the<00:03:43.000> same

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
very similar so you got the same

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.759 
very similar so you got the same
connectors<00:03:43.660> so<00:03:44.019> let's<00:03:44.200> just<00:03:44.350> connect<00:03:44.650> our

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
connectors so let's just connect our

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.390 
connectors so let's just connect our
thirty<00:03:45.010> pin<00:03:45.220> cable<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:45.790> bank<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:47.709> let's

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
thirty pin cable to the bank and let's

00:03:48.400 --> 00:04:06.350 
thirty pin cable to the bank and let's
connect<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:48.850> iPad

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:05:22.460 

you

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.690 

the<00:05:23.470> great<00:05:23.650> thing<00:05:23.800> about<00:05:23.830> this<00:05:24.100> case<00:05:24.400> is<00:05:24.610> that

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 
the great thing about this case is that

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.210 
the great thing about this case is that
it<00:05:25.180> allows<00:05:25.450> you<00:05:25.630> to<00:05:25.750> prop<00:05:26.050> up<00:05:26.320> your<00:05:26.530> iPad<00:05:26.860> to

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
it allows you to prop up your iPad to

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.830 
it allows you to prop up your iPad to
hold<00:05:27.400> it<00:05:27.520> at<00:05:27.700> a<00:05:27.730> better<00:05:27.910> viewing<00:05:28.270> angle<00:05:28.660> or

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
hold it at a better viewing angle or

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.170 
hold it at a better viewing angle or
typing<00:05:29.170> angle<00:05:29.530> so<00:05:30.310> there's<00:05:30.490> two<00:05:30.670> positions

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
typing angle so there's two positions

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.560 
typing angle so there's two positions
first<00:05:31.780> you<00:05:31.930> need<00:05:32.080> to<00:05:32.170> fold<00:05:32.410> the<00:05:32.560> cover<00:05:32.740> back

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
first you need to fold the cover back

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.870 
first you need to fold the cover back
use<00:05:34.570> this<00:05:34.720> little<00:05:35.020> clasp<00:05:35.380> in<00:05:35.650> the<00:05:35.680> back<00:05:35.880> to

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
use this little clasp in the back to

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:43.170 
use this little clasp in the back to
hold<00:05:37.000> the<00:05:37.120> cover<00:05:37.360> back<00:05:41.580> so<00:05:42.580> now<00:05:42.700> you<00:05:42.760> can<00:05:43.000> use

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
hold the cover back so now you can use

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.750 
hold the cover back so now you can use
it<00:05:44.310> flat<00:05:45.310> on<00:05:45.430> a<00:05:45.520> tabletop<00:05:45.850> like<00:05:46.180> this<00:05:46.620> or

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
it flat on a tabletop like this or

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.500 
it flat on a tabletop like this or
upright<00:05:48.900> like<00:05:49.900> this<00:05:51.120> so<00:05:52.120> it<00:05:52.180> allows<00:05:52.330> you<00:05:52.480> to
