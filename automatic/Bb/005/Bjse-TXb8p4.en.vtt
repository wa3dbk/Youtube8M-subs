00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
trick of the trade is when doing miter

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.399 
trick of the trade is when doing miter
joints<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.570> can<00:01:06.600> go<00:01:06.869> back<00:01:07.049> with<00:01:07.080> your

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
joints you can go back with your

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.780 
joints you can go back with your
touch-up<00:01:07.650> pen<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.310> came<00:01:08.490> with<00:01:08.670> your

touch-up kit and color in the end of

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.990 
touch-up kit and color in the end of
those<00:01:10.619> miter<00:01:10.920> joints<00:01:11.430> as<00:01:11.580> you're<00:01:11.760> putting

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
those miter joints as you're putting

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.149 
those miter joints as you're putting
them<00:01:12.090> together<00:01:12.210> with<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.380> being<00:01:13.590> done<00:01:13.890> when

them together with this being done when

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.469 
them together with this being done when
those<00:01:14.310> two<00:01:14.490> miter<00:01:14.700> joints<00:01:15.090> come<00:01:15.270> together

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
those two miter joints come together

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.750 
those two miter joints come together
there<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.320> color<00:01:16.619> on<00:01:16.830> those<00:01:16.979> miter<00:01:17.280> joints<00:01:17.670> so

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
there is color on those miter joints so

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.280 
there is color on those miter joints so
you're<00:01:17.880> not<00:01:18.000> able<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.330> see<00:01:18.600> into<00:01:18.840> those<00:01:18.990> joints

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
you're not able to see into those joints

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.990 
you're not able to see into those joints
as<00:01:19.500> easily<00:01:19.710> as<00:01:20.130> if<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.670> wouldn't<00:01:20.909> have

touched up you can go back and put the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.050 
touched up you can go back and put the
two<00:01:28.140> joints<00:01:28.439> together<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.130> continue<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.850> tack
