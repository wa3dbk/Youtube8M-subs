00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
change this is the 12c set of models we

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.679 
change this is the 12c set of models we
know<00:01:59.549> we're<00:01:59.820> beginning<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.210> see<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.450> little

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
know we're beginning to see a little

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.469 
know we're beginning to see a little
more<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.020> spray<00:02:01.350> here<00:02:01.759> we<00:02:02.759> got<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.030> no<00:02:03.210> gaps

that's<00:02:06.509> why<00:02:06.659> we<00:02:06.840> say<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.110> know<00:02:07.320> we're<00:02:07.469> all

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
is the guys that the NHC say as we say

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.509 
is the guys that the NHC say as we say
there<00:03:09.269> is<00:03:09.390> little<00:03:09.750> skill<00:03:10.050> in<00:03:10.290> forecasting<00:03:11.040> the

there is little skill in forecasting the

there is little skill in forecasting the

so<00:03:13.940> I<00:03:14.940> can't<00:03:15.420> tell<00:03:15.480> you<00:03:15.750> if<00:03:15.840> it's<00:03:15.959> going<00:03:16.050> to<00:03:16.110> be

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
so I can't tell you if it's going to be

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.900 
so I can't tell you if it's going to be
a<00:03:16.290> major<00:03:16.530> hurricane<00:03:16.860> or<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.400> minimal<00:03:17.790> hurricane

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
a major hurricane or a minimal hurricane

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.150 
a major hurricane or a minimal hurricane
but<00:03:18.540> let's<00:03:19.049> look<00:03:19.170> at<00:03:19.320> some<00:03:19.440> modeling<00:03:19.860> this<00:03:20.010> is

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
but let's look at some modeling this is

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.190 
but let's look at some modeling this is
the<00:03:20.420> hurricane<00:03:21.420> w<00:03:22.140> RF<00:03:22.470> and<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:24.480> pressure<00:03:24.870> here

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
the hurricane w RF and the pressure here

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.940 
the hurricane w RF and the pressure here
is<00:03:25.519> 916<00:03:26.519> millibars<00:03:27.060> that's<00:03:27.299> a<00:03:27.390> big<00:03:27.630> one<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.500> be

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
is 916 millibars that's a big one and be

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
speed at 950 millibars it's just off the

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:09.410 
speed at 950 millibars it's just off the
ground<00:04:03.810> of<00:04:04.019> 123<00:04:04.709> knots<00:04:06.110> and<00:04:07.760> again<00:04:08.760> that<00:04:09.180> would

be a major hurricane could it happen
absolutely<00:04:12.780> could<00:04:13.560> it<00:04:13.650> be<00:04:13.769> weaker<00:04:14.190> yes

there's<00:04:14.910> some<00:04:15.090> the<00:04:15.329> school<00:04:15.600> of<00:04:15.630> thought<00:04:15.930> there

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
there's some the school of thought there

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.599 
there's some the school of thought there
could<00:04:16.229> be<00:04:16.260> a<00:04:16.350> little<00:04:16.560> southwesterly<00:04:17.250> shear

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
could be a little southwesterly shear

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.550 
could be a little southwesterly shear
and<00:04:17.850> a<00:04:18.060> chance<00:04:18.329> of<00:04:18.510> some<00:04:18.690> drier<00:04:19.019> air<00:04:19.289> being

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
and a chance of some drier air being

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.170 
and a chance of some drier air being
entrained<00:04:19.890> in<00:04:20.070> this<00:04:20.250> that<00:04:20.459> would<00:04:20.549> weaken<00:04:21.060> it

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
entrained in this that would weaken it

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.820 
entrained in this that would weaken it
somewhat<00:04:21.510> but<00:04:21.630> boy<00:04:21.780> we<00:04:21.959> sure<00:04:21.989> can't<00:04:22.410> guarantee

knows the intensity at this point but

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.840 
knows the intensity at this point but
again<00:04:34.140> Morgan<00:04:34.560> City<00:04:34.830> to<00:04:35.040> Gulf<00:04:35.250> Shores<00:04:35.550> that's

again Morgan City to Gulf Shores that's
the<00:04:36.000> best<00:04:36.240> target<00:04:36.480> we<00:04:36.720> have<00:04:36.870> now<00:04:37.050> Hannah<00:04:37.650> the

the best target we have now Hannah the
other<00:04:38.040> one<00:04:38.250> let's<00:04:38.610> say<00:04:38.730> Hannah<00:04:38.970> it's<00:04:39.210> a

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
other one let's say Hannah it's a

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.720 
other one let's say Hannah it's a
tropical<00:04:39.810> wave<00:04:39.840> now<00:04:40.260> could<00:04:41.130> become<00:04:41.280> Hannah

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
tropical wave now could become Hannah

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.850 
tropical wave now could become Hannah
there's<00:04:42.090> the<00:04:42.300> modeling<00:04:42.720> and<00:04:42.870> again<00:04:43.740> you<00:04:43.830> can

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
there's the modeling and again you can

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.250 
there's the modeling and again you can
see<00:04:44.040> most<00:04:45.030> of<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:45.300> models<00:04:45.660> except<00:04:46.080> for<00:04:46.200> the

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
the northern part of Alabama but it's

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.730 
the northern part of Alabama but it's
losing<00:05:36.360> its<00:05:36.630> upper<00:05:36.900> air<00:05:37.020> support<00:05:37.470> and<00:05:37.620> that

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
losing its upper air support and that

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.320 
losing its upper air support and that
might<00:05:37.920> trigger<00:05:38.190> a<00:05:38.310> shower<00:05:38.610> somewhere<00:05:38.970> not

it<00:06:35.820> is<00:06:36.000> very<00:06:36.270> strange<00:06:36.690> it's<00:06:36.930> it's<00:06:37.140> this<00:06:37.290> blob

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
it is very strange it's it's this blob

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.110 
it is very strange it's it's this blob
of<00:06:37.590> moisture<00:06:38.040> on<00:06:38.160> the<00:06:38.190> coast<00:06:38.520> with<00:06:38.729> nothing

of moisture on the coast with nothing
here<00:06:39.500> but
