thoughts about that question he's able

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.150 
thoughts about that question he's able
to<00:00:08.910> obtain<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.269> great<00:00:09.960> base<00:00:10.230> he's<00:00:10.590> able<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:10.950> take

that a great weight transfer and which
equals<00:00:14.250> accuracy<00:00:14.849> so<00:00:15.389> his<00:00:15.809> accuracy<00:00:16.199> is

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
equals accuracy so his accuracy is

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.310

john brantley but you never want to make
statements<00:00:25.529> like<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:25.740> until<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.490> get

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
statements like that until you get

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.779 
statements like that until you get
through<00:00:26.849> training<00:00:27.240> camp<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:28.789> his

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
through training camp and his

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.569 
through training camp and his
progression<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.869> astronaut<00:00:31.830> absolutely

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
progression is is astronaut absolutely

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.950 
progression is is astronaut absolutely
astronomical<00:00:33.590> his<00:00:34.590> improvement<00:00:35.280> is

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
astronomical his improvement is

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.389 
astronomical his improvement is
mind-boggling<00:00:36.960> but<00:00:37.230> we'll<00:00:37.710> see<00:00:37.890> well

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
mind-boggling but we'll see well

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.139 
mind-boggling but we'll see well
inspection<00:00:38.940> Tebow<00:00:39.239> had<00:00:39.480> not<00:00:39.840> come<00:00:40.140> back<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.620> i

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
inspection Tebow had not come back and i

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.310 
inspection Tebow had not come back and i
think<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.270> with<00:00:42.360> them<00:00:42.510> coming<00:00:42.750> back<00:00:42.960> made<00:00:43.170> us

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
think that with them coming back made us

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.139 
think that with them coming back made us
alive<00:00:43.469> they're<00:00:44.010> made<00:00:44.219> expectations<00:00:44.969> where

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
alive they're made expectations where

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.990 
alive they're made expectations where
they<00:00:45.239> are<00:00:45.360> right<00:00:45.539> now<00:00:46.340> even<00:00:47.340> with<00:00:47.579> them<00:00:47.850> not

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
they are right now even with them not

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.310 
they are right now even with them not
coming<00:00:48.329> back<00:00:48.420> we<00:00:48.600> probably<00:00:48.840> would<00:00:49.050> have<00:00:49.140> had

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
coming back we probably would have had

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.229 
coming back we probably would have had
high<00:00:49.739> expectations<00:00:50.070> because<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.910> aegis

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
high expectations because the aegis

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.510 
high expectations because the aegis
losing<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:52.320> losing<00:00:52.500> your<00:00:52.680> two<00:00:52.920> main<00:00:53.129> leaders

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
losing you losing your two main leaders

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.279 
losing you losing your two main leaders
but<00:00:54.090> you're<00:00:54.239> losing<00:00:54.329> your<00:00:54.510> two<00:00:54.750> best<00:00:54.899> football

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
but you're losing your two best football

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.869 
but you're losing your two best football
players<00:00:55.530> on<00:00:55.680> each<00:00:55.710> side<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.219> football<00:00:56.489> and

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
players on each side of the football and

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.760 
players on each side of the football and
now<00:00:57.329> with<00:00:57.510> Tebow<00:00:57.960> coming<00:00:58.320> back<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.680> with

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
now with Tebow coming back and with

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.290 
now with Tebow coming back and with
spikes<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.190> think<00:00:59.460> that's<00:00:59.609> why<00:00:59.789> it's<00:00:59.969> elevated

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
spikes I think that's why it's elevated

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.689 
spikes I think that's why it's elevated
so<00:01:00.750> high<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:01.079> expectation<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:02.039> don't<00:01:02.489> know<00:01:02.609> if

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
so high in expectation I don't know if

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.520 
so high in expectation I don't know if
it's<00:01:02.820> ever<00:01:02.940> been<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.210> time<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.840> history<00:01:04.290> of
