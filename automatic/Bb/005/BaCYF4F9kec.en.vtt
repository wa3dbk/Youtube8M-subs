00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.710
 the first test lord will be the storm 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.750
 my a game but there is of course still 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.090
 always dsv if the girl is difficult to 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.930
 that really did test well and cook hjoed 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.180
 from swipe there well i have to tell you that 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:57.059

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.489
 as if god or yes a high highest what you 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.609

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.619
 quite good i have not had a corpse it 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.950
 went on to shoot 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.810
 yes nothing and so just became super so yes 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.369
 for the hema 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.369
 thick sauce completely finished top 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.730
 of course there are some plaffertjes and 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.030
 points for improvement on this PC 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.060
 I'm starting a disappeared crisis or yes 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.959
 point that are the button these 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.520
 side 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.970
 want to be buttons for on and off 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.010
 and yes it always went well 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.769
 then it was three times the click 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.300
 and logikos go or whatever because that 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.220
 its a bit wobbly or something so that 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.380
 that is really a point for improvement that is 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.290
 might be able to do something with it 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.239
 but that's the only thing I've found 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.250
 yes then you still come to the plus points 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.000
 or yes of course I go global 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.430
 View and first course and the 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.890
 they have is quite nicely 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.560
 compact nice and easy to take like this 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.500

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.959

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.280
 just really super good 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.530
 next senior plus point is it 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.970
 display it is a mobile screen and 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.160
 that is of course ideal because different 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.480
 still get it to do with the flexi 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.180
 yes and ahead you just do 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.519
 totally crazy a third point really wanted 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.829
 super nice is that we are now in an old 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.569
 so you can just playstation or 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.730

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.790

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.590

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.160

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.690
 the colors are very intensive and me 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.310
 think it is very beautiful 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.380
 and certainly it 's google track here 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.750
 very good testing especially because there are many 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.920
 bright color income you do that jump 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.040
