smaller<00:06:55.210> wheel<00:06:55.540> I<00:06:55.570> think<00:06:55.720> it's<00:06:55.960> just<00:06:56.080> a<00:06:56.140> little

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:56.260 
smaller wheel I think it's just a little

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.170 
smaller wheel I think it's just a little
easier<00:06:56.650> to<00:06:56.800> throw<00:06:57.040> in<00:06:57.190> and<00:06:57.370> out<00:06:57.460> of<00:06:57.610> the<00:06:57.670> car<00:06:57.880> so

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:58.180 
easier to throw in and out of the car so

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.000 
easier to throw in and out of the car so
if<00:06:58.240> it's<00:06:58.390> that<00:06:58.570> type<00:06:58.840> of<00:06:58.870> a<00:06:59.080> stroller<00:06:59.380> might

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.010 
if it's that type of a stroller might

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:01.290 
if it's that type of a stroller might
lend<00:07:00.190> you<00:07:00.370> more<00:07:00.520> towards<00:07:00.820> going<00:07:01.060> in<00:07:01.180> this

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:01.300
