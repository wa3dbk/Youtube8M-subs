00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
uncovered you can if you want to you can

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.080 
uncovered you can if you want to you can
put<00:02:12.400> some<00:02:12.519> cheesecloth

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
put some cheesecloth

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.660 
put some cheesecloth
over<00:02:13.450> it<00:02:13.599> so<00:02:14.409> the<00:02:14.560> fruit<00:02:14.769> flies<00:02:15.010> don't<00:02:15.370> get<00:02:15.549> in

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
over it so the fruit flies don't get in

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.290 
over it so the fruit flies don't get in
it

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
it

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.510 
it
or<00:02:16.570> a<00:02:16.600> little<00:02:16.960> just<00:02:17.230> lay<00:02:17.410> eggs<00:02:17.620> up<00:02:17.830> on<00:02:18.010> top<00:02:18.310> or

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
or a little just lay eggs up on top or

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.480 
or a little just lay eggs up on top or
whatever<00:02:18.790> but<00:02:19.000> it<00:02:19.630> keeps<00:02:19.870> this<00:02:20.080> keeps<00:02:20.710> it<00:02:20.830> well

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
whatever but it keeps this keeps it well

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.130 
whatever but it keeps this keeps it well
usually<00:02:21.760> do<00:02:21.850> is<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.060> cut<00:02:22.270> it<00:02:22.390> half<00:02:22.660> again<00:02:22.990> with

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
usually do is I cut it half again with

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.000 
usually do is I cut it half again with
some<00:02:23.290> water<00:02:24.960> so<00:02:25.960> about<00:02:26.170> there<00:02:26.590> that<00:02:26.830> looks

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
some water so about there that looks

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.910 
some water so about there that looks
about<00:02:27.130> right<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.810> now<00:02:29.110> we<00:02:29.440> just<00:02:29.650> let<00:02:29.830> that

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
about right and now we just let that

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.200 
about right and now we just let that
ferment<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:34.570> what<00:02:35.050> I<00:02:35.080> mean<00:02:35.320> by<00:02:35.530> that<00:02:35.590> is<00:02:35.980> that

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
ferment and what I mean by that is that

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.000 
ferment and what I mean by that is that
there's<00:02:37.210> sugars<00:02:38.080> and<00:02:38.320> so<00:02:38.500> forth<00:02:38.800> in<00:02:38.980> that

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
there's sugars and so forth in that

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.040 
there's sugars and so forth in that
tomato<00:02:39.550> that<00:02:40.510> will<00:02:40.810> cause<00:02:41.110> that<00:02:42.120> pulp<00:02:43.120> to

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
tomato that will cause that pulp to

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.250 
tomato that will cause that pulp to
start<00:02:44.320> to<00:02:44.470> ferment<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:45.720> then<00:02:46.720> depending<00:02:47.170> on

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
start to ferment and then depending on

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.930 
start to ferment and then depending on
the<00:02:47.380> temperature<00:02:47.860> usually<00:02:48.310> about<00:02:48.580> three<00:02:48.850> to

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
the temperature usually about three to

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.270 
the temperature usually about three to
four<00:02:49.120> days<00:02:49.350> you're<00:02:50.350> gonna<00:02:50.470> end<00:02:50.740> up<00:02:50.890> with<00:02:51.100> this

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
four days you're gonna end up with this

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.340 
four days you're gonna end up with this
white<00:02:52.230> fermentation<00:02:54.660> right<00:02:55.660> on<00:02:55.810> top<00:02:56.080> of<00:02:56.110> the

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
white fermentation right on top of the

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.040 
white fermentation right on top of the
water<00:02:56.560> or<00:02:56.860> top<00:02:57.070> of<00:02:57.100> the<00:02:57.280> fluid<00:02:57.610> there<00:02:57.850> and<00:02:58.090> that

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
water or top of the fluid there and that

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.170 
water or top of the fluid there and that
has<00:02:59.260> two<00:02:59.530> purposes

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
has two purposes

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.130 
has two purposes
number<00:03:01.870> one<00:03:02.110> is<00:03:02.580> it<00:03:03.580> keeps<00:03:04.270> the<00:03:04.510> seed<00:03:04.780> from

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
number one is it keeps the seed from

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.130 
number one is it keeps the seed from
getting<00:03:05.440> seed<00:03:06.430> born<00:03:06.730> fungus<00:03:07.240> which<00:03:07.960> can

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
getting seed born fungus which can

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.780 
getting seed born fungus which can
affect<00:03:08.470> your<00:03:08.620> crop<00:03:08.890> if<00:03:09.100> you're<00:03:09.220> trying<00:03:09.460> to<00:03:09.520> sow

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
affect your crop if you're trying to sow

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.000 
affect your crop if you're trying to sow
the<00:03:09.970> seed<00:03:10.150> later<00:03:10.420> after<00:03:11.050> you've<00:03:11.170> dried<00:03:11.770> them

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
the seed later after you've dried them

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.920 
the seed later after you've dried them
and<00:03:12.160> saved<00:03:12.400> them<00:03:12.610> and<00:03:12.850> number<00:03:13.510> two<00:03:13.660> and<00:03:13.870> that

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
and saved them and number two and that

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.020 
and saved them and number two and that
jelly<00:03:14.350> that<00:03:14.590> normally<00:03:15.010> gets<00:03:15.220> on<00:03:15.400> tomato<00:03:15.730> seed

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
jelly that normally gets on tomato seed

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.590 
jelly that normally gets on tomato seed
you<00:03:16.870> can<00:03:16.990> see<00:03:17.200> here<00:03:17.410> I<00:03:17.440> mean<00:03:17.650> it's<00:03:17.770> just<00:03:17.830> like

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
you can see here I mean it's just like

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.550 
you can see here I mean it's just like
okay<00:03:19.600> you<00:03:19.630> came<00:03:19.870> and<00:03:20.050> pick<00:03:20.170> them<00:03:20.320> up<00:03:20.410> because

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
okay you came and pick them up because

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.350 
okay you came and pick them up because
they<00:03:20.800> because<00:03:21.310> that<00:03:21.490> jelly<00:03:21.760> that

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
they because that jelly that

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.270 
they because that jelly that
fermentation<00:03:22.810> will<00:03:23.260> actually<00:03:23.650> separate<00:03:24.070> that

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
fermentation will actually separate that

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.480 
fermentation will actually separate that
jelly<00:03:24.640> off<00:03:24.910> of<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.180> seed<00:03:25.980> so<00:03:26.980> it'll<00:03:27.220> make<00:03:27.340> it

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490 
jelly off of the seed so it'll make it

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.890 
jelly off of the seed so it'll make it
clean<00:03:28.200> make<00:03:29.200> it<00:03:29.350> easier<00:03:29.680> to<00:03:29.850> separate<00:03:30.900> then

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
clean make it easier to separate then

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.960 
clean make it easier to separate then
you<00:03:32.440> know<00:03:32.650> like<00:03:33.070> I<00:03:33.100> said<00:03:33.220> in<00:03:33.430> about<00:03:33.610> three<00:03:33.880> to

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
you know like I said in about three to

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.120 
you know like I said in about three to
four<00:03:34.120> days<00:03:34.260> we'll<00:03:35.260> take<00:03:35.530> some<00:03:35.770> water<00:03:36.010> and

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
four days we'll take some water and

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.890 
four days we'll take some water and
rinse<00:03:39.130> you<00:03:39.670> can<00:03:39.790> either<00:03:39.940> take<00:03:40.180> water<00:03:40.510> and<00:03:40.750> just

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
rinse you can either take water and just

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.380 
rinse you can either take water and just
gently<00:03:41.170> rinse<00:03:41.560> this<00:03:41.800> solution<00:03:42.100> out<00:03:42.460> so<00:03:43.210> that

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
gently rinse this solution out so that

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.720 
gently rinse this solution out so that
the<00:03:43.510> pulp<00:03:43.780> and<00:03:43.990> the<00:03:44.080> bad<00:03:44.830> seed<00:03:45.130> float<00:03:45.520> to<00:03:45.670> the

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
the pulp and the bad seed float to the

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.760 
the pulp and the bad seed float to the
top<00:03:45.790> and<00:03:46.180> float<00:03:46.360> off<00:03:46.600> and<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:47.260> good<00:03:47.440> seed<00:03:47.650> will

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
top and float off and the good seed will

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.860 
top and float off and the good seed will
be<00:03:47.800> left<00:03:48.040> on<00:03:48.190> the<00:03:48.250> bottom<00:03:48.580> or<00:03:48.850> you<00:03:49.480> can<00:03:49.660> take<00:03:49.840> a

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
be left on the bottom or you can take a

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.250 
be left on the bottom or you can take a
strainer<00:03:50.320> you<00:03:50.980> can<00:03:51.130> put<00:03:51.310> it<00:03:51.400> in<00:03:51.520> a<00:03:51.900> plastic<00:03:52.900> or

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
strainer you can put it in a plastic or

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.410 
strainer you can put it in a plastic or
a<00:03:53.290> metal<00:03:53.620> strainer<00:03:53.920> and<00:03:54.250> strain<00:03:55.000> it<00:03:55.390> through

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
a metal strainer and strain it through

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.970 
a metal strainer and strain it through
and<00:03:55.780> just<00:03:55.810> keep<00:03:56.050> rinsing<00:03:56.290> it<00:03:56.620> until<00:03:56.890> you've

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
and just keep rinsing it until you've

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.280 
and just keep rinsing it until you've
got<00:03:57.130> just<00:03:57.370> pure<00:03:57.640> seed<00:03:57.970> but<00:03:58.810> then<00:03:58.960> you<00:03:59.110> might

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
got just pure seed but then you might

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.900 
got just pure seed but then you might
end<00:03:59.320> up<00:03:59.530> with<00:03:59.710> some<00:03:59.830> bad<00:04:00.010> seed<00:04:00.340> in<00:04:00.370> there

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
end up with some bad seed in there

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.600 
end up with some bad seed in there
I<00:04:00.940> like<00:04:01.390> the<00:04:01.600> actually<00:04:01.960> floating<00:04:02.440> off<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:02.620> bad

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
I like the actually floating off the bad

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.210 
I like the actually floating off the bad
stuff<00:04:03.970> and<00:04:04.210> that<00:04:05.200> leaves<00:04:05.440> all<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:05.710> good<00:04:05.950> stuff

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
stuff and that leaves all the good stuff

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.090 
stuff and that leaves all the good stuff
on<00:04:06.370> the<00:04:06.520> bottom<00:04:07.020> if<00:04:08.020> you<00:04:08.080> have<00:04:08.290> a<00:04:08.320> large<00:04:08.770> amount

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
on the bottom if you have a large amount

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.410 
on the bottom if you have a large amount
of<00:04:09.190> seed<00:04:10.320> it's<00:04:11.320> nice<00:04:11.590> to<00:04:11.800> make<00:04:11.980> a<00:04:12.010> frame<00:04:12.970> out<00:04:13.360> of

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
of seed it's nice to make a frame out of

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.360 
of seed it's nice to make a frame out of
wood<00:04:13.780> you<00:04:14.050> can<00:04:14.110> take<00:04:14.290> one<00:04:14.470> before<00:04:14.650> sore<00:04:15.130> 1<00:04:15.250> by

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
wood you can take one before sore 1 by

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.870 
wood you can take one before sore 1 by
3s<00:04:15.670> and<00:04:15.910> some<00:04:17.010> fiberglass<00:04:18.010> screening<00:04:18.670> and

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
3s and some fiberglass screening and

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.090 
3s and some fiberglass screening and
staple<00:04:19.299> that<00:04:19.390> on<00:04:19.630> and<00:04:19.930> then<00:04:20.020> just<00:04:20.799> let<00:04:20.980> it

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
staple that on and then just let it

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.740 
staple that on and then just let it
because<00:04:21.400> the<00:04:21.549> it's<00:04:21.820> fiberglass<00:04:22.120> what<00:04:22.630> will

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
because the it's fiberglass what will

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.080 
because the it's fiberglass what will
happen<00:04:22.990> is<00:04:23.110> the<00:04:23.260> seed<00:04:23.470> will<00:04:23.680> be<00:04:24.430> easy<00:04:24.669> to<00:04:24.910> peel

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
happen is the seed will be easy to peel

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.150 
happen is the seed will be easy to peel
off<00:04:25.330> later<00:04:25.690> or<00:04:26.230> if<00:04:26.410> you<00:04:26.470> just<00:04:26.530> have<00:04:26.770> a<00:04:26.800> small

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
off later or if you just have a small

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.290 
off later or if you just have a small
amount<00:04:27.280> of<00:04:27.520> seed<00:04:27.669> you<00:04:27.820> can<00:04:27.880> take<00:04:28.030> a<00:04:28.060> paper

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
amount of seed you can take a paper

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.820 
amount of seed you can take a paper
plate<00:04:28.630> right<00:04:29.590> then

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
plate right then

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.680 
plate right then
the<00:04:30.130> seed<00:04:30.340> put<00:04:30.700> the<00:04:30.850> date<00:04:31.000> that<00:04:31.180> you<00:04:31.300> saved<00:04:31.540> the

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
the seed put the date that you saved the
