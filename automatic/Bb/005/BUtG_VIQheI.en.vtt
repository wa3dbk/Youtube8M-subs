that you don't see yourself that way do

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.170

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
you see a documentary photograph as

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.020 
you see a documentary photograph as
having<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.599> ability<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:27.230> convey<00:02:27.890> at<00:02:28.129> all<00:02:28.370> that

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
having the ability to convey at all that

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.860 
having the ability to convey at all that
some<00:02:29.690> kind<00:02:29.989> of<00:02:30.140> objective<00:02:30.349> truth<00:02:31.569> yes<00:02:32.569> well<00:02:32.840> I

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
some kind of objective truth yes well I

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.990 
some kind of objective truth yes well I
think<00:02:33.049> I<00:02:33.470> think<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.739> role<00:02:33.980> of<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.370> image

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
think I think the role of the image

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.210 
think I think the role of the image
today<00:02:35.239> has<00:02:35.480> changed<00:02:35.930> quite<00:02:36.170> a<00:02:36.230> bit<00:02:36.319> I<00:02:36.860> mean<00:02:37.010> it

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
today has changed quite a bit I mean it

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.009 
today has changed quite a bit I mean it

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
but but some way in some way comment on

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.879 
but but some way in some way comment on
this<00:03:56.239> event<00:03:56.480> and<00:03:56.660> offer<00:03:56.989> a<00:03:57.200> perspective<00:03:57.620> well

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:57.889 
this event and offer a perspective well

00:03:57.889 --> 00:03:59.050 
this event and offer a perspective well
let<00:03:58.220> me<00:03:58.250> ask<00:03:58.430> you<00:03:58.579> about<00:03:58.639> that<00:03:58.730> perspective

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
let me ask you about that perspective

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.580 
let me ask you about that perspective
because<00:03:59.720> if<00:03:59.900> it<00:04:00.019> is<00:04:00.760> impossible<00:04:01.760> to<00:04:02.590> convey

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
because if it is impossible to convey

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.039 
because if it is impossible to convey
objective<00:04:04.250> truth<00:04:04.579> in<00:04:04.849> any<00:04:05.030> particular<00:04:05.630> image

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
objective truth in any particular image

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:07.839 
objective truth in any particular image
and<00:04:06.169> as<00:04:06.319> you<00:04:06.470> say<00:04:06.680> you're<00:04:06.919> an<00:04:07.010> editorial<00:04:07.489> list

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
and as you say you're an editorial list

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.409 
and as you say you're an editorial list
and<00:04:08.060> I<00:04:08.239> wonder<00:04:08.630> what<00:04:09.250> what<00:04:10.250> is<00:04:10.489> happening<00:04:10.819> in

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:11.419 
and I wonder what what is happening in

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:14.379 
and I wonder what what is happening in
your<00:04:11.930> mind<00:04:11.989> in<00:04:12.620> the<00:04:13.010> moment<00:04:13.220> when<00:04:13.880> you<00:04:14.150> know

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:14.389 
your mind in the moment when you know

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:17.140 
your mind in the moment when you know
that<00:04:15.319> depending<00:04:16.010> on<00:04:16.160> the<00:04:16.459> angle<00:04:16.609> that<00:04:17.030> you

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
that depending on the angle that you

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.819 
that depending on the angle that you
shoot<00:04:17.389> from<00:04:17.630> what<00:04:17.959> you're<00:04:18.169> shooting<00:04:18.410> who

shoot from what you're shooting who
you're<00:04:19.099> shooting<00:04:19.459> if<00:04:19.549> there's<00:04:19.729> a<00:04:19.789> conflict

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
you're shooting if there's a conflict

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.550

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
of what I do as a photographer I don't

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.150 
of what I do as a photographer I don't
believe<00:04:45.320> in<00:04:45.470> objectivity

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
believe in objectivity

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.420 
believe in objectivity
I<00:04:46.310> am<00:04:46.760> subjective<00:04:47.419> what<00:04:47.930> I<00:04:47.960> do<00:04:48.110> is<00:04:48.380> a

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
I am subjective what I do is a

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.800 
I am subjective what I do is a
subjective<00:04:49.430> thing<00:04:49.460> and<00:04:49.910> I<00:04:50.270> think<00:04:50.540> it<00:04:50.720> is

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
subjective thing and I think it is

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.440 
subjective thing and I think it is
actually<00:04:51.020> it<00:04:51.620> is<00:04:51.860> my<00:04:52.070> responsibility<00:04:52.280> to<00:04:53.240> have

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
actually it is my responsibility to have

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.450 
actually it is my responsibility to have
a<00:04:53.480> point<00:04:53.840> of<00:04:53.960> view<00:04:54.139> and<00:04:54.380> to<00:04:54.770> tell<00:04:54.950> you<00:04:55.070> my<00:04:55.220> point

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
a point of view and to tell you my point

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.740 
a point of view and to tell you my point
of<00:04:55.610> view<00:04:55.820> is<00:04:56.780> I<00:04:57.139> think<00:04:57.620> the<00:04:57.950> result<00:04:58.750> amira

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
of view is I think the result amira

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.620 
of view is I think the result amira
sponsibility<00:05:00.350> is<00:05:00.740> to<00:05:00.919> try<00:05:01.100> to<00:05:01.160> do<00:05:01.430> that<00:05:01.610> in<00:05:02.330> a

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
sponsibility is to try to do that in a

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.920 
sponsibility is to try to do that in a
way<00:05:02.840> that<00:05:03.200> is<00:05:03.470> as<00:05:03.740> honest<00:05:04.600> and<00:05:05.600> as

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
way that is as honest and as

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.590 
way that is as honest and as
quote/unquote<00:05:06.710> truthful<00:05:07.520> as<00:05:07.730> I<00:05:07.970> can<00:05:08.210> do<00:05:08.390> that

quote/unquote truthful as I can do that

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.570
