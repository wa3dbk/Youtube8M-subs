00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:52.259 
the day these synthetic and organic

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:53.899 
the day these synthetic and organic
fibers<00:03:53.040> they're<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.310> same<00:03:53.489> thing<00:03:53.699> you're

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
fibers they're the same thing you're

00:03:53.909 --> 00:04:02.190 
fibers they're the same thing you're
wearing<00:03:54.120> they're<00:03:54.419> the<00:03:54.509> same<00:03:54.689> thing

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.490 

you

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
you

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.090 
you
