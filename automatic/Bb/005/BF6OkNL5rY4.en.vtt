with<00:02:29.180> our<00:02:29.960> color<00:02:30.260> B<00:02:30.710> as<00:02:31.070> we<00:02:31.940> normally<00:02:32.240> would<00:02:32.630> in

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
with our color B as we normally would in

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.300 
with our color B as we normally would in
pattern<00:02:33.650> so<00:02:34.060> we<00:02:35.060> would<00:02:35.300> turn<00:02:35.660> our<00:02:35.930> work<00:02:36.800> here

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
pattern so we would turn our work here

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.570 
pattern so we would turn our work here
and<00:02:37.460> then<00:02:38.360> we<00:02:38.510> would<00:02:38.690> start<00:02:38.990> doing<00:02:39.890> our<00:02:40.160> chain

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
and then we would start doing our chain

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.680 
and then we would start doing our chain
for<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.450> next<00:02:41.750> row<00:02:42.020> so<00:02:42.560> we<00:02:43.430> do<00:02:43.670> four<00:02:44.540> double

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
for the next row so we do four double

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:51.040 
for the next row so we do four double
crochet<00:02:45.200> a<00:02:45.500> chain<00:02:45.590> three<00:02:46.430> two<00:02:48.940> three<00:02:49.940> okay<00:02:50.780> and

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
crochet a chain three two three okay and

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.220 
crochet a chain three two three okay and
just<00:02:51.310> continue<00:02:52.310> working<00:02:52.550> in<00:02:52.910> pattern<00:02:53.300> now<00:02:53.480> one

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
just continue working in pattern now one

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.770 
just continue working in pattern now one
of<00:02:54.350> the<00:02:54.410> things<00:02:54.650> that<00:02:54.800> you<00:02:54.920> can<00:02:55.100> do<00:02:55.400> to<00:02:56.240> do<00:02:56.540> this

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
of the things that you can do to do this

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.410 
of the things that you can do to do this
a<00:02:56.840> little<00:02:57.020> bit<00:02:57.170> more<00:02:57.350> seamlessly<00:02:57.920> is<00:02:58.280> to<00:02:59.150> work

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
a little bit more seamlessly is to work

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.100 
a little bit more seamlessly is to work
your<00:03:00.170> ends<00:03:00.710> in<00:03:00.890> now<00:03:01.850> if<00:03:01.970> you<00:03:02.090> wanted<00:03:02.390> to<00:03:02.600> you

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
your ends in now if you wanted to you

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.240 
your ends in now if you wanted to you
could<00:03:03.260> cut<00:03:03.530> this<00:03:03.910> yarn<00:03:04.910> from<00:03:05.570> color<00:03:05.960> a<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:06.620> we

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
could cut this yarn from color a and we

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.990 
could cut this yarn from color a and we
would<00:03:07.460> just<00:03:08.560> start<00:03:09.560> working<00:03:09.770> in<00:03:10.220> these<00:03:10.670> two

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
would just start working in these two

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.240 
would just start working in these two
ends<00:03:11.420> as<00:03:11.600> we<00:03:11.870> went<00:03:12.080> or<00:03:12.380> if<00:03:12.770> you<00:03:12.890> wanted<00:03:13.160> to

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
ends as we went or if you wanted to

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.270 
ends as we went or if you wanted to
carry<00:03:13.670> this<00:03:14.600> yarn<00:03:14.960> across<00:03:15.560> you<00:03:15.860> could<00:03:16.010> just

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
carry this yarn across you could just

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.700 
carry this yarn across you could just
work<00:03:16.460> it<00:03:16.640> in<00:03:16.790> all<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.150> way<00:03:17.180> across<00:03:17.510> so<00:03:18.350> I'm

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
work it in all the way across so I'm

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.020 
work it in all the way across so I'm
going<00:03:18.860> to<00:03:18.920> show<00:03:19.040> you<00:03:19.070> how<00:03:19.250> to<00:03:19.280> work<00:03:19.580> it<00:03:19.820> into

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
going to show you how to work it into

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.190 
going to show you how to work it into
the<00:03:20.690> pattern<00:03:21.670> seamlessly<00:03:22.670> so<00:03:23.170> we're<00:03:24.170> just

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
the pattern seamlessly so we're just

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.370 
the pattern seamlessly so we're just
going<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.530> just<00:03:25.280> take<00:03:25.550> these<00:03:26.480> two<00:03:26.780> loose<00:03:27.050> ends

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
going to just take these two loose ends

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.890 
going to just take these two loose ends
and<00:03:27.770> as<00:03:28.760> we<00:03:29.709> perform<00:03:30.709> our<00:03:31.220> double<00:03:31.550> crochet

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
and as we perform our double crochet

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.380 
and as we perform our double crochet
we're<00:03:32.900> going<00:03:33.080> to<00:03:33.140> pick<00:03:33.440> up<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.830> stitches<00:03:34.390> pick

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
we're going to pick up the stitches pick

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.670 
we're going to pick up the stitches pick
up<00:03:35.540> these<00:03:35.720> ends<00:03:36.140> with<00:03:36.320> us<00:03:36.560> so<00:03:36.920> let's<00:03:37.760> see<00:03:38.680> we're

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
up these ends with us so let's see we're

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.600 
up these ends with us so let's see we're
going<00:03:39.770> to<00:03:39.890> work<00:03:40.010> into<00:03:40.190> the<00:03:40.520> stitch<00:03:40.760> here<00:03:42.610> okay

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
going to work into the stitch here okay

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.940 
going to work into the stitch here okay
and<00:03:43.820> so<00:03:43.940> you<00:03:44.030> can<00:03:44.180> see<00:03:44.360> that<00:03:44.570> this<00:03:44.750> this<00:03:45.350> these

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
and so you can see that this this these

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.699 
and so you can see that this this these
ends<00:03:46.370> here<00:03:46.580> they're<00:03:46.820> laying<00:03:47.120> on<00:03:47.330> top<00:03:47.690> of<00:03:47.990> our

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
ends here they're laying on top of our

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.699 
ends here they're laying on top of our
row<00:03:49.220> so<00:03:50.180> I'm<00:03:50.270> going<00:03:50.420> to<00:03:50.480> grab<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:51.110> yarn<00:03:51.350> to

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
row so I'm going to grab the yarn to

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.070 
row so I'm going to grab the yarn to
pull<00:03:52.070> through<00:03:52.520> and<00:03:52.880> they're<00:03:53.540> getting<00:03:53.660> looped

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
pull through and they're getting looped

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:04.540 
pull through and they're getting looped
into<00:03:54.410> our<00:03:56.530> stitches<00:03:57.530> here<00:04:00.820> so<00:04:01.820> I'm<00:04:01.970> just<00:04:03.550> I'm

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
into our stitches here so I'm just I'm

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.850 
into our stitches here so I'm just I'm
going<00:04:04.760> to<00:04:04.850> do<00:04:04.940> a<00:04:04.970> double<00:04:05.209> crochet<00:04:05.410> so<00:04:06.410> we<00:04:06.620> yarn

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
going to do a double crochet so we yarn

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.480 
going to do a double crochet so we yarn
over<00:04:07.100> then<00:04:07.940> we'll<00:04:08.180> insert<00:04:08.480> our<00:04:08.660> hook<00:04:08.900> and<00:04:09.490> see

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
over then we'll insert our hook and see

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.760 
over then we'll insert our hook and see
the<00:04:10.640> how<00:04:10.760> they<00:04:10.910> lay<00:04:11.060> across<00:04:11.380> then<00:04:12.380> we'll<00:04:12.530> pick

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
the how they lay across then we'll pick

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.130 
the how they lay across then we'll pick
up<00:04:12.800> our<00:04:13.100> yarn<00:04:13.400> over<00:04:14.030> and<00:04:14.270> that's<00:04:14.780> getting

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
up our yarn over and that's getting

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:23.400 
up our yarn over and that's getting
worked<00:04:15.860> into<00:04:16.489> the<00:04:17.150> actual<00:04:17.600> stitch

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.390 

all<00:04:24.410> right<00:04:24.530> so<00:04:24.650> I'm<00:04:24.740> just<00:04:24.860> going<00:04:24.980> to<00:04:25.070> do<00:04:25.190> this<00:04:25.340> a

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
all right so I'm just going to do this a

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.050 
all right so I'm just going to do this a
couple<00:04:25.490> more<00:04:25.880> times<00:04:27.430> and<00:04:28.430> you<00:04:28.580> can<00:04:28.639> see<00:04:28.730> how

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
couple more times and you can see how

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.740 
couple more times and you can see how
that<00:04:29.330> the<00:04:29.870> yarn<00:04:30.139> is<00:04:30.320> in<00:04:30.500> between<00:04:31.750> the

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
that the yarn is in between the

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.730 
that the yarn is in between the
different<00:04:33.110> pieces<00:04:33.350> of<00:04:34.810> parts<00:04:35.810> of<00:04:35.930> our<00:04:36.050> stitch

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.390 

now<00:04:39.740> because<00:04:40.100> these<00:04:40.340> yarn<00:04:41.270> colors<00:04:41.720> are

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
now because these yarn colors are

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.020 
now because these yarn colors are
already<00:04:43.540> matching<00:04:45.460> the<00:04:46.460> yarns<00:04:46.790> that<00:04:46.850> we've

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
already matching the yarns that we've

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.120 
already matching the yarns that we've
been<00:04:47.180> using<00:04:47.380> they're<00:04:48.380> going<00:04:48.560> to<00:04:48.620> blend<00:04:48.919> pretty

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
been using they're going to blend pretty

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.080 
been using they're going to blend pretty
seamlessly<00:04:50.169> into<00:04:51.169> our<00:04:51.620> break<00:04:52.160> here<00:04:52.460> where<00:04:52.910> we

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
seamlessly into our break here where we

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.680 
seamlessly into our break here where we
change<00:04:53.360> the<00:04:53.510> color<00:04:53.720> of<00:04:53.840> the<00:04:53.990> yarn<00:04:54.200> and<00:04:55.690> so

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
change the color of the yarn and so

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.960 
change the color of the yarn and so
we're<00:04:56.870> carrying<00:04:57.140> those<00:04:58.960> loose<00:04:59.960> ends<00:05:00.820> into<00:05:01.820> our

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
we're carrying those loose ends into our

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.340 
we're carrying those loose ends into our
pattern<00:05:03.910> to<00:05:04.910> make<00:05:05.060> it<00:05:05.180> really<00:05:05.720> easy<00:05:05.900> to<00:05:06.050> hide

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
pattern to make it really easy to hide

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.210 
pattern to make it really easy to hide
them<00:05:06.650> and<00:05:07.600> you<00:05:08.600> won't<00:05:08.690> have<00:05:08.960> to<00:05:09.169> work<00:05:09.770> them<00:05:09.980> in

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
them and you won't have to work them in

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.700 
them and you won't have to work them in
later<00:05:10.550> which<00:05:10.940> can<00:05:11.120> be<00:05:11.380> really<00:05:12.380> annoying

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
later which can be really annoying

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.469 
later which can be really annoying
especially<00:05:13.040> if<00:05:13.460> you<00:05:13.550> do<00:05:13.669> a<00:05:13.700> lot<00:05:13.910> of<00:05:13.970> different

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 
especially if you do a lot of different

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:16.480 
especially if you do a lot of different
color<00:05:14.660> changes<00:05:15.169> and<00:05:15.410> you're<00:05:15.500> not<00:05:15.950> carrying

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
color changes and you're not carrying

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:26.110 
color changes and you're not carrying
your<00:05:16.700> yarn<00:05:17.560> across<00:05:18.560> and<00:05:19.040> up<00:05:24.820> so<00:05:25.820> once<00:05:26.000> you've

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
your yarn across and up so once you've

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.600 
your yarn across and up so once you've
gotten<00:05:26.330> a<00:05:26.450> few<00:05:26.720> stitches<00:05:26.960> deep<00:05:29.770> then<00:05:30.770> you<00:05:31.310> can

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
gotten a few stitches deep then you can

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.610 
gotten a few stitches deep then you can
just<00:05:34.120> let<00:05:35.120> this<00:05:35.300> yarn<00:05:35.600> go<00:05:35.900> and<00:05:36.229> work<00:05:36.440> your

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
just let this yarn go and work your

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:46.330 
just let this yarn go and work your
pattern<00:05:37.010> as<00:05:37.250> you<00:05:38.060> would<00:05:38.240> normally<00:05:45.160> so<00:05:46.160> the

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
pattern as you would normally so the

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:54.240 
pattern as you would normally so the
ends<00:05:46.520> will<00:05:46.610> stick<00:05:46.850> out<00:05:47.090> here<00:05:47.570> on<00:05:47.780> the<00:05:47.930> side<00:05:52.630> but

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
ends will stick out here on the side but

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.980 
ends will stick out here on the side but
we're<00:05:55.250> just<00:05:55.280> going<00:05:55.640> to<00:05:55.910> when<00:05:56.570> we're<00:05:56.780> finished

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
we're just going to when we're finished

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.779 
we're just going to when we're finished
with<00:05:57.289> this<00:05:57.440> row<00:05:57.770> I<00:06:00.160> will<00:06:01.160> do<00:06:01.460> is<00:06:01.580> we're<00:06:01.700> going

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:01.789 
with this row I will do is we're going

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:04.570 
with this row I will do is we're going
to<00:06:01.910> stretch<00:06:02.210> out<00:06:02.479> our<00:06:03.229> pattern<00:06:03.620> a<00:06:04.039> little<00:06:04.310> bit

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
to stretch out our pattern a little bit

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.320 
to stretch out our pattern a little bit
and<00:06:04.850> then<00:06:05.330> we'll<00:06:05.479> snip<00:06:05.900> these<00:06:06.830> off<00:06:07.400> and

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
and then we'll snip these off and

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.120 
and then we'll snip these off and
they'll<00:06:08.479> just<00:06:08.510> kind<00:06:08.900> of<00:06:09.880> get<00:06:10.880> stuck<00:06:11.240> into<00:06:12.130> this

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
they'll just kind of get stuck into this

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.120 
they'll just kind of get stuck into this
row<00:06:13.400> here<00:06:14.200> where<00:06:15.200> we've<00:06:15.410> been<00:06:15.560> working<00:06:15.770> them

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130 
row here where we've been working them

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.510 
row here where we've been working them
inside<00:06:16.729> and<00:06:17.390> then<00:06:18.260> you<00:06:18.380> can<00:06:18.530> continue<00:06:18.860> on<00:06:19.220> now

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
inside and then you can continue on now

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.150 
inside and then you can continue on now
if<00:06:20.000> you<00:06:20.180> were<00:06:20.300> going<00:06:20.510> to<00:06:20.600> keep<00:06:20.870> carrying<00:06:21.440> your

working yarn from color a across you

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:26.500 
working yarn from color a across you
could<00:06:24.440> just<00:06:24.740> work<00:06:25.490> that<00:06:25.729> all<00:06:25.940> the<00:06:26.090> way<00:06:26.210> to<00:06:26.240> the

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:26.510 
could just work that all the way to the

could just work that all the way to the
end<00:06:26.690> and<00:06:27.169> then<00:06:27.289> work<00:06:27.530> it<00:06:27.680> up<00:06:27.970> into<00:06:28.970> the<00:06:29.210> next
