00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
are these wireless charging coils don't

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.430 
are these wireless charging coils don't
produce<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.640> kind<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:50.970> current<00:01:51.330> that<00:01:52.080> a

produce the kind of current that a
hardwire<00:01:52.920> connection<00:01:53.540> delivers<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.440> will

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
hardwire connection delivers so it will

I can even do it through a case it's
just<00:03:19.320> a<00:03:19.530> slip-on<00:03:19.800> case<00:03:20.100> and<00:03:20.340> I<00:03:21.030> tested<00:03:21.300> it<00:03:21.480> the

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
just a slip-on case and I tested it the

they all should unless it's like a super
thick<00:03:26.760> giant<00:03:27.150> case<00:03:27.330> and<00:03:27.660> then<00:03:27.750> you<00:03:27.780> could<00:03:27.989> have

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
thick giant case and then you could have

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.979

the factory again let me show you this
this<00:03:44.730> case<00:03:45.060> kind<00:03:45.390> of<00:03:45.510> works

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.880 

but<00:03:49.400> um<00:03:49.959> yeah<00:03:50.959> just<00:03:51.019> put<00:03:51.410> it<00:03:51.440> on<00:03:51.530> here<00:03:51.709> make<00:03:51.860> it

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
but um yeah just put it on here make it

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:59.290 
but um yeah just put it on here make it
easy<00:03:55.090> I<00:03:57.099> don't<00:03:58.099> agree<00:03:58.430> that<00:03:58.519> says<00:03:58.879> charging

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
easy I don't agree that says charging

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.720 
easy I don't agree that says charging
right<00:03:59.390> there<00:03:59.540> 75%<00:04:00.379> like<00:04:01.129> I<00:04:01.160> said<00:04:01.250> I<00:04:01.310> did<00:04:01.610> this

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
right there 75% like I said I did this

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.170 
right there 75% like I said I did this
yesterday<00:04:01.970> and<00:04:02.330> it<00:04:02.510> was<00:04:02.810> about<00:04:03.580> maybe<00:04:04.580> two<00:04:05.060> or

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
yesterday and it was about maybe two or

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.210 
yesterday and it was about maybe two or
three<00:04:05.239> percent<00:04:05.450> for<00:04:06.140> ten<00:04:06.739> minutes

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
three percent for ten minutes

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.250 
three percent for ten minutes
so<00:04:07.730> these<00:04:08.000> batteries<00:04:08.360> are<00:04:08.390> higher<00:04:08.629> capacity

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
so these batteries are higher capacity

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.199 
so these batteries are higher capacity
versus<00:04:09.560> like<00:04:09.709> a<00:04:09.739> phone<00:04:10.040> that's<00:04:10.790> why<00:04:10.940> they<00:04:11.060> take

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
versus like a phone that's why they take

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:12.190 
versus like a phone that's why they take
a<00:04:11.239> little<00:04:11.390> longer<00:04:11.480> so<00:04:11.720> hopefully<00:04:11.989> the<00:04:12.080> future

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
a little longer so hopefully the future

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.850 
a little longer so hopefully the future
we're<00:04:12.410> going<00:04:12.500> to<00:04:12.560> get<00:04:12.709> maybe<00:04:12.950> some<00:04:13.269> higher

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
we're going to get maybe some higher

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.729 
we're going to get maybe some higher
current<00:04:15.860> charging<00:04:16.639> coils<00:04:17.019> you<00:04:18.019> know<00:04:18.139> to<00:04:18.470> speed

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
current charging coils you know to speed

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.560 
current charging coils you know to speed
things<00:04:18.889> up<00:04:19.160> but<00:04:19.459> right<00:04:20.120> now<00:04:20.269> like<00:04:20.449> I<00:04:20.479> said

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
things up but right now like I said

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.350 
things up but right now like I said
overnight<00:04:20.930> and<00:04:21.169> the<00:04:21.229> pockets<00:04:21.620> a<00:04:21.680> good<00:04:21.799> idea<00:04:22.040> so
