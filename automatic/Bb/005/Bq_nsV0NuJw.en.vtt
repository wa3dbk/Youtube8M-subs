five<00:01:44.700> years<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.479> age<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.290> these<00:01:46.380> teeth<00:01:46.619> are

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
five years of age and these teeth are

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.440 
five years of age and these teeth are
moving<00:01:47.070> down<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.460> compensate<00:01:48.000> for<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.240> wear

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
moving down to compensate for the wear

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.440 
moving down to compensate for the wear
of<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:49.649> process<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.549> chewing<00:01:51.149> their<00:01:51.270> food

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
of the process of chewing their food

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.210 
of the process of chewing their food
over<00:01:51.659> their<00:01:51.810> lifetime<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.890> reason<00:01:53.189> that

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
over their lifetime and the reason that

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.490 
over their lifetime and the reason that
they're<00:01:53.460> moving<00:01:53.700> down<00:01:54.110> about<00:01:55.110> an<00:01:55.259> eighth<00:01:55.380> of

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
they're moving down about an eighth of

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.940 
they're moving down about an eighth of
an<00:01:55.619> inch

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
an inch

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.289 
an inch
we'll<00:01:56.100> just<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.430> they<00:01:56.549> can<00:01:56.670> continually<00:01:57.090> have

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
we'll just so they can continually have

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.020 
we'll just so they can continually have
good<00:01:57.689> occlusion<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.770> process<00:01:59.130> food<00:01:59.340> now<00:01:59.969> the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
good occlusion to process food now the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.539 
good occlusion to process food now the
problem<00:02:00.390> comes<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.810> over<00:02:00.990> time<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.590> there

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
problem comes in over time is that there

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.810 
problem comes in over time is that there
are<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.509> teeth<00:02:03.750> wear<00:02:03.990> unevenly<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.799> as<00:02:05.640> you

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
are the teeth wear unevenly and as you

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.039 
are the teeth wear unevenly and as you
can<00:02:05.909> see<00:02:05.969> what's<00:02:06.270> we<00:02:06.540> got<00:02:06.659> some<00:02:06.780> all<00:02:06.930> the

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
can see what's we got some all the

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.900 
can see what's we got some all the
horses<00:02:07.290> here<00:02:07.619> this<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.250> horse<00:02:08.459> that's<00:02:08.640> quite

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
horses here this is a horse that's quite

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.969 
horses here this is a horse that's quite
aged<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.690> if<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:09.959> look<00:02:10.110> at<00:02:10.200> his<00:02:10.379> teeth<00:02:10.590> he's

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
aged and if you look at his teeth he's

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.309 
aged and if you look at his teeth he's
actually<00:02:11.160> lost<00:02:11.489> some<00:02:11.730> teeth<00:02:12.060> here<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:12.540> he's

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
actually lost some teeth here and he's

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.910 
actually lost some teeth here and he's
got<00:02:13.469> very<00:02:13.650> bad<00:02:14.099> wear<00:02:14.579> on<00:02:14.909> his<00:02:15.499> molars<00:02:16.499> and<00:02:16.530> this

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
got very bad wear on his molars and this

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.140 
got very bad wear on his molars and this
horse<00:02:17.099> here<00:02:17.249> would<00:02:17.430> not<00:02:17.549> have<00:02:17.760> much<00:02:17.909> ability

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
horse here would not have much ability

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.989 
horse here would not have much ability
to<00:02:18.420> eat<00:02:18.569> food<00:02:18.810> at<00:02:18.959> all<00:02:19.109> these<00:02:19.980> lower<00:02:20.549> molars

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:20.999 
to eat food at all these lower molars

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:23.809 
to eat food at all these lower molars
here<00:02:21.239> pretty<00:02:22.079> much<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.489> point<00:02:23.700> where

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
here pretty much to the point where

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.069 
here pretty much to the point where
they're<00:02:23.909> not<00:02:23.999> effective<00:02:24.480> so<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.659> horse<00:02:24.900> with

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
they're not effective so a horse with

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.629 
they're not effective so a horse with
teeth<00:02:25.290> like<00:02:25.469> this<00:02:25.650> would<00:02:26.159> have<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.340> hard<00:02:26.609> time

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:26.639 
teeth like this would have a hard time

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:29.270 
teeth like this would have a hard time
keeping<00:02:26.969> on<00:02:27.269> wait<00:02:27.510> now<00:02:28.260> what<00:02:28.769> we<00:02:28.980> want<00:02:29.189> to

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
keeping on wait now what we want to

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.369 
keeping on wait now what we want to
basically<00:02:29.519> show<00:02:29.909> you<00:02:29.969> through<00:02:30.900> this<00:02:31.019> series

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
basically show you through this series

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.349 
basically show you through this series
here<00:02:31.590> is<00:02:31.739> basically<00:02:32.159> what<00:02:32.730> can<00:02:32.909> happen<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.239> a

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:33.359 
here is basically what can happen to a

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:34.309 
here is basically what can happen to a
horse<00:02:33.569> over<00:02:33.780> time

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
horse over time

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.259 
horse over time
here's<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.680> dramatic<00:02:35.159> case<00:02:35.370> this<00:02:35.639> is<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:35.819> quite

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
here's a dramatic case this is a quite

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.420 
here's a dramatic case this is a quite
an<00:02:36.420> older<00:02:36.689> horse<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.739> tooth<00:02:37.980> in<00:02:38.159> front

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
an older horse and the tooth in front

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.550 
an older horse and the tooth in front
here<00:02:38.670> overlapped<00:02:39.480> at<00:02:39.659> the<00:02:39.750> bottom<00:02:40.019> molar<00:02:40.230> and

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
here overlapped at the bottom molar and

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.920 
here overlapped at the bottom molar and
over<00:02:41.010> time<00:02:41.280> this<00:02:41.819> tooth<00:02:42.150> as<00:02:42.359> he<00:02:42.510> was<00:02:42.629> trying<00:02:42.900> to

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
over time this tooth as he was trying to

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.750 
over time this tooth as he was trying to
process<00:02:43.109> his<00:02:43.439> food<00:02:43.709> was<00:02:44.129> actually<00:02:44.519> cutting

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
process his food was actually cutting

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.699 
process his food was actually cutting
into<00:02:44.939> the<00:02:45.120> gum<00:02:45.269> tissue<00:02:45.480> right<00:02:45.840> there<00:02:46.109> and<00:02:46.590> this

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
into the gum tissue right there and this

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.949 
into the gum tissue right there and this
is<00:02:46.859> the<00:02:46.950> kind<00:02:47.159> of<00:02:47.219> way<00:02:47.340> we<00:02:47.489> did<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:47.969> this<00:02:48.719> shows

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
is the kind of way we did and this shows

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.780 
is the kind of way we did and this shows
you<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.799> models<00:02:50.189> basically<00:02:50.400> are

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
you that the models basically are

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.819 
you that the models basically are
embedded<00:02:51.180> deep<00:02:51.329> into<00:02:51.599> the<00:02:51.719> jawbone<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.319> over

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
embedded deep into the jawbone and over

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.890 
embedded deep into the jawbone and over
time<00:02:53.069> these<00:02:53.310> moles<00:02:53.639> will<00:02:53.879> move<00:02:54.030> down<00:02:54.329> but<00:02:54.810> this

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
time these moles will move down but this

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.740 
time these moles will move down but this
is<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:55.109> very<00:02:55.290> uneven<00:02:55.650> situation<00:02:56.510> basic<00:02:57.510> file

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
is a very uneven situation basic file

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.179 
is a very uneven situation basic file
flooding<00:02:58.199> that<00:02:58.319> you're<00:02:58.469> probably<00:02:58.650> used<00:02:59.069> to

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189 
flooding that you're probably used to

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:00.649 
flooding that you're probably used to
hearing<00:02:59.400> where<00:02:59.699> they<00:02:59.790> file<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.209> points<00:03:00.510> off

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
hearing where they file the points off

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.599 
hearing where they file the points off
would<00:03:01.109> not<00:03:01.319> resolve<00:03:01.709> a<00:03:01.859> horse's<00:03:02.219> teeth<00:03:02.370> like

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
would not resolve a horse's teeth like

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.390 
would not resolve a horse's teeth like
this<00:03:02.819> file<00:03:03.480> floating<00:03:03.930> essentially<00:03:04.739> is<00:03:04.919> just

this file floating essentially is just

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.129 
this file floating essentially is just
falling<00:03:05.639> off<00:03:05.879> the<00:03:06.030> points<00:03:06.389> now<00:03:06.840> there<00:03:06.989> are

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
falling off the points now there are

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:08.479 
falling off the points now there are
some<00:03:07.379> practitioners<00:03:07.769> who<00:03:08.159> are<00:03:08.189> very

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
some practitioners who are very

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.369 
some practitioners who are very
competent<00:03:08.879> with<00:03:09.120> files<00:03:09.419> and<00:03:09.689> do<00:03:10.049> a<00:03:10.079> lot<00:03:10.349> more

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
competent with files and do a lot more

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.439 
competent with files and do a lot more
than<00:03:10.769> just<00:03:10.799> filing<00:03:11.189> points<00:03:11.669> but<00:03:12.000> that's<00:03:12.180> not

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:12.449 
than just filing points but that's not

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:16.339 
than just filing points but that's not
that<00:03:12.480> common<00:03:12.900> generally<00:03:13.349> speaking<00:03:13.650> it's<00:03:15.349> it's

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
that common generally speaking it's it's

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.319 
that common generally speaking it's it's
basically<00:03:16.769> they<00:03:17.430> follow<00:03:17.699> points<00:03:18.060> off<00:03:18.150> and

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
basically they follow points off and

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:19.969 
basically they follow points off and
done<00:03:18.479> too<00:03:18.659> much<00:03:18.810> with<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.109> actual<00:03:19.379> occlusal

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:19.979 
done too much with the actual occlusal

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:21.469 
done too much with the actual occlusal
areas<00:03:20.430> here<00:03:20.669> which<00:03:20.819> is<00:03:20.939> where<00:03:21.060> they<00:03:21.150> do<00:03:21.209> their

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:21.479 
areas here which is where they do their

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:23.689 
areas here which is where they do their
chewing<00:03:21.870> of<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:21.959> food<00:03:22.199> I<00:03:22.409> use<00:03:23.099> motorized

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:23.699 
chewing of the food I use motorized

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:25.280 
chewing of the food I use motorized
tools<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.269> I<00:03:24.329> like<00:03:24.569> that<00:03:24.750> because<00:03:24.930> with

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
tools and I like that because with

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.729 
tools and I like that because with
motorized<00:03:25.680> equipment<00:03:25.829> you<00:03:26.639> can<00:03:26.819> basically

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
motorized equipment you can basically

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.229 
motorized equipment you can basically
resurface<00:03:28.739> these<00:03:28.949> molars<00:03:29.519> and<00:03:29.669> not<00:03:29.939> let<00:03:30.120> them

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
resurface these molars and not let them

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.909 
resurface these molars and not let them
get<00:03:30.389> so<00:03:30.569> uneven<00:03:31.019> like<00:03:31.139> in<00:03:31.290> these<00:03:31.409> two<00:03:31.650> examples

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:31.919 
get so uneven like in these two examples

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:33.890 
get so uneven like in these two examples
here<00:03:32.340> so<00:03:32.939> this<00:03:33.150> is<00:03:33.269> just<00:03:33.389> the<00:03:33.540> beginning

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
here so this is just the beginning

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.780 
here so this is just the beginning
