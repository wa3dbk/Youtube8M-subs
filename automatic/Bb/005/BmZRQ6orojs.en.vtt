00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 the egg is the second best food in the 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.310
 world people 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.710
 the world's first food better 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.870
 breast milk the second is the egg it has 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.170
 all and only had no tamina c 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.969
 the rest have all the egg cholesterol and 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.730
 egg is high in cholesterol 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.990
 he is not absorbed and when he arrives 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.570
 in the intestinal mucosa 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.220
 The body thinks there is enough cholesterol in me 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.760
 I'll tell the son of the plan to produce 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.550
 more 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.310
 so the low the cholesterol level looks 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.710
 Look, I 'm just saying the egg is not just not 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.559
 increases as well as contribute to 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.950
 the endogenous production of cholesterol 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.379
 so you can eat the egg every day 12 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.530
 three I have a great friend who is a 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.570
 great teacher that I am friends and 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.210
 he runs 56 hours a day big 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.440
 famous nutrologist with whom I learned a lot 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.539
 which causes obstruction of the arteries in the 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.020
 case of coronary heart disease that is 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:01.289
 interest here is the cholesterol was there to 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:05.489
 help for cholesterol to have 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.740
 adherence to all in the vascular 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.350
 artery lined inside by a 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.770
 single cell layer called endothelium 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.290
 which is very important is the need to 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.729
 yes the suit is injured he has to 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.729
 is inflamed 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.140
 It is called chronic silent inflammation 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.130
 of the endothelium was associated with an inflammation 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.280
 will happen 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.090
 the body will want to deflate that 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.970
 cholesterol is an anti-inflammatory agent 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.729
 he is thrown there to cover the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.670
 hole he goes there to help 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.890
 only that the inflammation persists 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.890
 here comes a troupe like to see in platelets 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.259
 in calcium and you put everything there 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.479
 and that endothelium remaining 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.170
 inflammation will stimulate more and more 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.810
 the reaction and goes forming the plate that 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.030
 obstructing the matter but it is not the fault of 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.159
 cholesterol if the endothelium has not 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.649
 can pass a pound of 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.590
 cholesterol that does not stick if you go 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.570
 fry the egg in sunflower corn oil 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.640
 soy you will die there 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.250
 look unsaturated these eyes may 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.730
 unsaturates should not be used in the 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.840
 food soybean sunflower corn they are 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.660
 harmful 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.340
 the hat also did not throw a poison not 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.510
 there is canola oil there is canola 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.590
 You do not know is a plant called 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.570
 canola 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.450
 heat is withdrawn from a plant 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.390
 there is a so-called rapeseed with the 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.090
 which is very poisonous the thing contains the 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.880
 called acid and rustic star which is a 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.250
 poison and that when he enters the body he 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.130
 Becomes Brazil's Most Poisonous 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.410
 it is still possible in Canada to create 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.380
 the genetically a thing with the 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:58.370
 very low amount of steel 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:00.950
 so canola means canadian wall st 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.100
 In my house we cook with lard 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.190
 pork port is one of the best things 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.720
 from your heart my friend 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.850
 our ancestors cooked 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.080
 company and for my father died with almost 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.580
 100 years and ate lard 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:21.860
 so the lard does not hurt 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:25.370
 no it is good for health coconut 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.290
 you can accompany by color or if you 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.920
 not liking neither 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.959
 a virgin olive oil the virgin is better 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.530
 video disease you do a read more 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:39.170
 little front then the fried egg can but 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:44.680
 little you can eat the scrambled egg or 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.680
 It was all cooked and fantastic.
