00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 hi guys i have a little time and this 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.930
 did he tell you something to write this and 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.389
 automatically when tourists passed 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.639
 approximately in those numbers as left portal 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.830
 you should know what really 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.260
 and so you have to stop it before 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.949
 how it happens and experience everything 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.320
 guessed 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:25.460
 I was not sure to fix it for you 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:29.010
 it is necessary jesus the connection was broken 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:32.730
 what exactly would happen about what he wanted 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.880
 tell and also I heard the phrase i 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.020
 this everyone guessed that he knew from the forest 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:43.590
 more than we think 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:45.180
 let's think about it first 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.489
 I propose to recall this one here 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.600
 Bella I know you impressed you much 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.750
 smarter than you look 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.120
 especially so and also alarming here 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.760
 this moment listen carefully what 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.190
 says sus nothing in the world can 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.649
 bring me down except futuristic 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.019
 handgun grain damn thing 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.630
 may have some sort of magical feeling 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.290
 whether about a normal piece I took and you 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.060
 don't believe it but that is exactly what happened 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.040
 where did sus could know this first episode 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.189
 he is the only one who believed dipper 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.659
 when I told paranormal things 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:21.540
 hence he has met more than once 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.820
 them next it is sus finds new 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.130
 doors in the silence of secrets he found and room with 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.049
 wax figures and room with carpet 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.329
 which changes bodies as well 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.369
 look at this passage that is hidden 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.850
 this vending machine is my secret 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.770
 there is how much you understand sustak said 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.740
 not because he is stupid or something else 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.299
 because he already knew about it 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.640
 hence found out about this secret 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.890
 the door and even when my asked about 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.930
 why would i need a diary of risks 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.210
 pop up sus so they don't become 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.820
 reflect on this issue so that they 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.920
 did not know the truth also we know that sus 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.010
 very clever as he always request 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.080
 turning all sorts of electronic devices 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.600
 It is not everyone can then 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.990
 come out that sus just pretends to be stupid 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.430
 but why does he do it can be minimized 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.200
 say that this is not due to society with 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.570
 any eyes since first he 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.190
 surprised to know about them and secondly because 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.650
 what is it after the series about them she 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.510
 continues to lead you also but given 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.140
 words to consider personal thoughts Bella 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.550
 considering that with bonds 12 year old scene 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.110
 considering only how protected the machine 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.240
 considering what he knows about 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.170
 normality and cities can be assumed 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.000
 what is stanley 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.160
 told Susa about everything with him 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.110
 happened and he said the number say 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.440
 adab and we are not knowing anything about a guy 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.390
 although no it is impossible from this phrase in a new 12 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.280
 series well, I hope that I'm fooling studiosus 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.560
 my fanfic should not heal 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.140
 I will be very disappointed then what 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.910
 is fraught with suss and why does he not want 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.910
 tell even friends about what he is 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.560
 knows something and this time I won't get on 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.590
 houses from some not really steep 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.720
 theories are really all simple to sus 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.750
 on this many mysteries of gravity falls we 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.390
 again portal reversal of all that only 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.120
 could learn not to forget that 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.010
 sus not genius he behaves like usual 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.959
 humble teenager and that type of character 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.850
 just pretty rarely returns 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.310
 in cartoons as even in the life of such 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.470
 a lot of guys just randomly sus 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.360
 noticed all the strange things gradually 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.209
 learned more and more and all my 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.519
 diary which is in 12 episodes 2 seasons he 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.110
 calls the fanfics didn't show the video he 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.430
 just because we really get 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.860
 Stanley to the very end 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.900
 the person who made the bread himself wallpaper 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.940
 replaced father and just because 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.920
 many things were his theories 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.360
 but he did not want to disclose them before 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.970
 would not be sure of one hundred percent 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.290
 Well, that's it and hydrogen is high 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.019
 suspensions which one hundred percent 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.450
 coincided with the original if you subscribe 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.820
 on my channel put your finger up and so 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.890
 But look at this tennant and me bieber 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.290
 sensor and main antagonist disclosed 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.080
 second season I almost forgot me 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.030
 it seems that the father of sousa is this dude 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.620
 because he has a spanish name a wsus 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.780
 how do we know spanish roots 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.910
 and even if in prison, and therefore could not 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.100
 come as in war as we know escaped 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.580
 from this prison with you was Fedor link 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.580
 until
