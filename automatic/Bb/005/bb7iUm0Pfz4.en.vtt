with a round 78 game on farm and a

pretty cool it's Cape right here I'm

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.530 
pretty cool it's Cape right here I'm
gonna<00:00:14.400> get<00:00:14.610> straight<00:00:14.880> into<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.330> gameplay

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
gonna get straight into the gameplay

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.349 
gonna get straight into the gameplay
with<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.350> final<00:00:17.130> down<00:00:17.340> which<00:00:17.580> ended<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.180> game

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
with the final down which ended the game

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.439 
with the final down which ended the game
for<00:00:19.140> me<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.500> problems<00:00:19.980> with<00:00:20.430> these<00:00:20.730> games<00:00:21.180> are

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
for me the problems with these games are

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.720 
for me the problems with these games are
that<00:00:21.539> they<00:00:21.660> go<00:00:21.810> on<00:00:21.930> for<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.289> long<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:23.670> just

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
that they go on for so long that I just

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.509 
that they go on for so long that I just
tend<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.660> lose<00:00:24.840> focus<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.560> concentration<00:00:26.220> you

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
tend to lose focus and concentration you

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.920 
tend to lose focus and concentration you
start<00:00:26.760> thinking<00:00:27.060> about<00:00:27.090> something<00:00:27.480> else<00:00:27.689> and

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
start thinking about something else and

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.140 
start thinking about something else and
then<00:00:28.019> before<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.289> know<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.650> you're<00:00:29.429> dead<00:00:29.789> and

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
then before you know it you're dead and

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.179 
then before you know it you're dead and
that<00:00:30.420> accounts<00:00:30.869> for<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.109> majority<00:00:31.349> well

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
that accounts for the majority well

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.100 
that accounts for the majority well
actually<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.489> think<00:00:32.579> all<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:32.880> my<00:00:33.030> downs<00:00:33.390> in<00:00:33.899> this

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
actually I think all of my downs in this

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.630 
actually I think all of my downs in this
game<00:00:34.170> will<00:00:34.590> result<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.130> lack<00:00:35.489> of

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
game will result of lack of

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.700 
game will result of lack of
concentration<00:00:35.910> we'll<00:00:36.899> get<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.200> those<00:00:37.350> downs

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
concentration we'll get to those downs

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.180 
concentration we'll get to those downs
in<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.790> moment<00:00:39.149> this<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:39.960> not<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.379> record<00:00:40.829> the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
in a moment this is not a record the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.510 
in a moment this is not a record the
actual<00:00:41.670> record<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:43.070> according<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.219> zombie

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
actual record is according to zombie

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.990 
actual record is according to zombie
records<00:00:44.879> at<00:00:45.180> least<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.719> 88<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.879> despite<00:00:47.879> the

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
records at least is 88 and despite the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.850 
records at least is 88 and despite the
fact<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.420> isn't<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.960> record<00:00:49.110> if<00:00:49.620> you're

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
fact that this isn't a record if you're

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.279

the full gameplay I want to quickly talk
about<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> strategy<00:01:02.670> for<00:01:02.850> hitting<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.210> box

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
about the strategy for hitting the box

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.810 
about the strategy for hitting the box
it's<00:01:04.320> quite<00:01:04.500> fashionable<00:01:04.830> these<00:01:05.309> days<00:01:05.369> on

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
it's quite fashionable these days on

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.350 
it's quite fashionable these days on
farm<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.540> use<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.799> glitch<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.460> access<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.150> box

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
farm to use the glitch to access the box

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.570 
farm to use the glitch to access the box
from<00:01:09.600> underneath<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.560> generally<00:01:11.310> don't

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
from underneath it I generally don't

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.539 
from underneath it I generally don't
consider<00:01:12.119> games<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.560> exploit<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.220> glitch

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
consider games that exploit this glitch

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.910 
consider games that exploit this glitch
as<00:01:14.760> legitimate<00:01:15.330> because<00:01:15.590> in<00:01:16.590> my<00:01:16.770> opinion

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
as legitimate because in my opinion

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.789 
as legitimate because in my opinion
exploiting<00:01:17.880> glitches<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.840> cheating<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.680> in

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
exploiting glitches is cheating so in

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.920 
exploiting glitches is cheating so in
this<00:01:19.920> game<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.549> didn't<00:01:21.180> use<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.299> glitch

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
this game I didn't use that glitch

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.679 
this game I didn't use that glitch
I<00:01:21.960> do<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.470> old<00:01:22.590> fro<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.250> EMP<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:24.119> make<00:01:24.570> the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
I do the old fro the EMP to make the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.230 
I do the old fro the EMP to make the
zombies<00:01:24.990> passive<00:01:25.409> give<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.040> time<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.700> switch

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
zombies passive give you time to switch

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.319 
zombies passive give you time to switch
out<00:01:27.390> weapons<00:01:27.570> at<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.960> Box<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:29.460> problem<00:01:29.939> which

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
out weapons at the Box the problem which

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.660 
out weapons at the Box the problem which
sometimes<00:01:31.020> occurs<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.799> as<00:01:32.250> your<00:01:32.520> friend

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
sometimes occurs is that as your friend

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.600 
sometimes occurs is that as your friend
EMP<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.329> zombie<00:01:33.780> dies<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.350> therefore<00:01:35.009> another

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
EMP a zombie dies and therefore another

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.249 
EMP a zombie dies and therefore another
one<00:01:35.820> spawns<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.329> which<00:01:36.509> isn't<00:01:36.689> affected<00:01:37.229> by

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
one spawns in which isn't affected by

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
the EMP this on bill then wake up other

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.520 
the EMP this on bill then wake up other
zombies<00:01:41.490> if<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.790> touches<00:01:42.000> them<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:43.259> can

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
zombies if it touches them you can

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.889 
zombies if it touches them you can
sometimes<00:01:44.009> get<00:01:44.490> away<00:01:44.759> with<00:01:45.060> just<00:01:45.090> training

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
sometimes get away with just training

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.530 
sometimes get away with just training
that<00:01:46.320> zombie<00:01:46.799> by<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.700> box<00:01:48.030> so<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.420> can

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
that zombie by the box so that you can

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.569 
that zombie by the box so that you can
still<00:01:48.750> access<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.409> like<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.799> do<00:01:49.860> in<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.280> clip

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
still access it like I do in this clip

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.660 
still access it like I do in this clip
and<00:01:51.290> here<00:01:52.290> we<00:01:52.380> have<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.649> other<00:01:52.799> three<00:01:53.369> downs

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
and here we have the other three downs
