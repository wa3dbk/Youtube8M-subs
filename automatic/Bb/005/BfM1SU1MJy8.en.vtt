00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:03.230
 A fallera of the court of honor 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.540
 waits thrones impatiently 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.800
 without knowing that the worst terror 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.100
 will make an appearance. 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.600
 MascletÃ  is already beginning and gains a lot of intensity 

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:17.000
 But a great thunder is diverted and causes brutality! 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.099
 What happened? 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:24.159
 How scary! 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:26.369
 Who is the responsibility? 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.600
 The fallera lacks the heart 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.500
 for a security error! 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.670
 But found in the cemetery 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.900
 and with great lack of courage 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.300
 blame for the mortal mystery 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.500
 to the strong wind 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.000
 and bad weather. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.700
 No one remembers her, 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.800
 They no longer speak to the court. 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.200
 They prefer feast and mamella 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.800
 that to find the cause of death. 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.100
 But the next spring 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.200
 when there was no longer hope, 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.100
 The Fallera Skull is born 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.500
 with desires of revenge! 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.900
 The dead man only has in mind 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.900
 A just claim: You want to suffer all the people and cast a curse! 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.830
 The night will be forever and the streets will fill with shame. 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.000
 The Fallera calls every member of her terrorist army! 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.500
 But someone with valency 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.400
 think a moment in it: 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.500
 "I will win such tyranny if I make him a good paella." 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.900
 So with treasures and soldiers and visiting all the environments 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.800
 they get into rivalries 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.800
 to find five ingredients.
