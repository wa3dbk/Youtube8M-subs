height<00:01:24.890> I<00:01:25.070> am<00:01:25.220> putting<00:01:25.490> more<00:01:25.640> emphasis<00:01:25.729> on

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
height I am putting more emphasis on

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.279 
height I am putting more emphasis on
that<00:01:26.149> first<00:01:26.390> little<00:01:26.690> and<00:01:26.810> then<00:01:26.899> I'm<00:01:26.990> getting<00:01:27.110> a

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
that first little and then I'm getting a

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:28.690 
that first little and then I'm getting a
lot<00:01:27.530> more<00:01:27.590> emphasis<00:01:27.979> on<00:01:28.069> that<00:01:28.130> second<00:01:28.550> fiddle

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
lot more emphasis on that second fiddle

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.550 
lot more emphasis on that second fiddle
so<00:01:28.819> it<00:01:28.909> does<00:01:29.060> change<00:01:29.330> that<00:01:29.690> but<00:01:30.200> what<00:01:30.350> I<00:01:30.380> love

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
so it does change that but what I love

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.230 
so it does change that but what I love
about<00:01:30.590> it<00:01:30.950> is<00:01:31.069> the<00:01:31.130> phrasing<00:01:31.819> completely

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
about it is the phrasing completely

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.240 
about it is the phrasing completely
changes<00:01:32.630> from<00:01:32.720> normal<00:01:33.050> sticky<00:01:33.229> which<00:01:33.979> is<00:01:34.130> why

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
changes from normal sticky which is why

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.649 
changes from normal sticky which is why
we<00:01:34.369> change<00:01:34.640> stickies<00:01:35.149> all<00:01:35.300> right<00:01:35.450> so<00:01:35.569> we're

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
we change stickies all right so we're

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.180 
we change stickies all right so we're
try<00:01:35.840> the<00:01:35.899> same<00:01:36.080> thing<00:01:36.319> a<00:01:36.560> little<00:01:36.800> bit<00:01:37.009> quicker

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
try the same thing a little bit quicker

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.490 
try the same thing a little bit quicker
get<00:01:37.850> that<00:01:38.030> feel<00:01:38.270> see<00:01:38.569> that<00:01:38.720> underlying<00:01:39.170> notes

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
get that feel see that underlying notes

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.809 
get that feel see that underlying notes
hopefully<00:01:39.800> they<00:01:39.890> don't<00:01:39.950> change<00:01:40.250> too<00:01:40.580> much

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:40.819 
hopefully they don't change too much

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:42.639 
hopefully they don't change too much
