dealer money now I'm not sure why the

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.229 
dealer money now I'm not sure why the
dealer<00:04:04.389> doesn't<00:04:04.840> tell<00:04:05.169> you<00:04:05.489> this<00:04:06.489> process<00:04:07.030> but

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
it works and you can do it for free it's

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.020 
it works and you can do it for free it's
quick<00:04:09.790> and<00:04:09.970> easy<00:04:10.319> and<00:04:11.549> I'm<00:04:12.549> going<00:04:12.699> to<00:04:12.760> show<00:04:12.940> you

now<00:04:13.180> you<00:04:13.239> enter<00:04:13.540> the<00:04:13.659> code<00:04:13.930> so<00:04:14.709> it's<00:04:15.370> this

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:15.699 
now you enter the code so it's this
