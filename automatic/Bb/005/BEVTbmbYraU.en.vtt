00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.490
 model of line that will be 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.230
 ruffled flower 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.900
 the nail polish I used on my client's nail 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.150
 It was the espresso of top beauty these 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.630
 two nails here I painted with one foot on 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.750
 I will use the brush 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.850
 20 c brush is the fine detail brush 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.519
 I tell them that it is theirs. 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.500
 I used all the time on Thursdays. 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.099
 I will use all the nature colors that is the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:33.780
 Cappuccino I'm going to use cep 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:36.390
 the green pistachio black and the white ink 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.829
 All of nature, I've already got them all. 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.090
 in the milk carton 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:45.360
 I'll start by Baguinho the frill I 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.700
 I'll start from the top and I'll do it. 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.780
 as if it were a nail ladder 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.750
 the first make the outline of it after 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.070
 I come and paint it I'll do until the 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:03.629
 end of the nail as if it were a ladder 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:09.750
 now I came with a brush and I'm going 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:13.290
 paint him this model of me I go 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.270
 make that brush with the same brush 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.180
 here you have a little bit 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.830
 Thick I give a cut on the side 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.259
 it to tune it a little bit 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.869
 it can cut at the tip which cut 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.890
 on the end it ends up spoiling the brush is 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:32.909
 ready while dry 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.840
 I'm going to make the flower the flower I go 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.490
 do 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.659
 the middle and I always start with the 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.659
 petal from below 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:55.060
 are five petals pulled her from one side 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:57.660
 pulls the other end of it and 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.660
 I brush today 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:08.680
 she came back making her really little 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:11.830
 on the nail only always starting with the petal 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:17.280
 underneath it gives no notion 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.280
 right that will get the five petals 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:25.180
 here another opel has the first of 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:30.130
 one side pulls the other 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:33.700
 I already paint and she already forms the tips 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.120
 I'll get the white one and I'll get the 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.120
 pistachio green 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:45.480
 I'll make a little sheet up there more 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.480
 Other 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:57.090
 underneath it while you saw a little 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.090
 I'm going to get the black 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.660
 I'll get right around here on the stairs that 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.660
 I made 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.930
 I'll just make the outline on the steps. 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.930
 zinho 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:20.709
 I'm not leaving and square I'm giving 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:24.520
 a round one dinha now right in the middle 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.440
 I'm going to make a 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:34.950
 corny 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:38.860
 in all of them I do the trade through 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:44.160
 and I pull a little something with the tip of the 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:50.050
 brush with the same brush I pick up black 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:53.310
 and already makes a very fine squirrel as 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.310
 If you were a Frenchwoman 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:03.660
 now it 's just with the tip of the brush 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:09.530
 I pull a strand to form the 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:19.310
 badinho with the same tip of the brush 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:25.280
 I'm going to get the white and I'm going to make wines. 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:25.280
 spread the word now with black 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:32.600
 I'll go around the flower only with the tip 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.950
 of the brush 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.490
 I think I can not cut the 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:40.800
 tip of the brush to cut the brush 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:44.930
 it will not be useful for anything or only 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.930
 with the tip of the brush makes the outline 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.690
 all on the same side 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:02.030
 here one more now with black thorn 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.870
 I'm going to pull 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:18.780
 2 discard well in the middle of the petal 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:22.570
 white and the same brush 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:30.100
 I'll just do penguins in the middle with the 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:32.710
 I'm just going to shaq a chicken already 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:37.480
 I'll get the same brush and I'll go 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:42.540
 put penguins the white dill also 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:42.540
 I'll put it here in the middle of the leaf 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:50.169
 and with the sepe as you can perceive 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.660
 each time I brush the brush 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:54.760
 out of it is getting open 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:58.510
 There's no way not to give him a call. 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:03.870
 It's fine, I was not here. 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:07.540
 pull one more little risquinho here one more 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.850
 the finalization of this nail here this line 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.430
 I already left the customer ready, I already passed 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:14.590
 the color protector on this line is only 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.479
 expect to dry a little may already 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.400
 pass the color protector all this 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:20.620
 material I used yesterday for sale on my 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.400
 store is a very easy model to make and 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.400
 hope you like it
