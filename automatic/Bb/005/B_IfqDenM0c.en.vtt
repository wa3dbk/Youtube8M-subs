00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.090 
very dehydrated so by using a leave-in
moisturizer<00:02:37.720> that<00:02:38.019> really<00:02:38.440> does<00:02:38.620> help<00:02:38.830> and

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
moisturizer that really does help and

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.979

I<00:04:06.100> am<00:04:06.370> just<00:04:06.400> snipping<00:04:07.389> freehand<00:04:07.930> the<00:04:08.019> fringe

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
I am just snipping freehand the fringe

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.990

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
so it's a nice soft fringe rather than a

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.180 
so it's a nice soft fringe rather than a
blunt<00:04:10.239> fringe<00:04:10.620> and<00:04:11.620> then<00:04:11.799> we<00:04:11.889> actually<00:04:12.010> just

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190
