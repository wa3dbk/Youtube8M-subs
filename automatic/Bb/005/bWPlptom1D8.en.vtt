because you see those two chains that

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:38.350 
because you see those two chains that
hang<00:06:36.829> off<00:06:36.949> her<00:06:37.189> belt<00:06:37.399> those<00:06:37.699> chains<00:06:38.059> of

flowers it's kind of hard to have her

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:45.399 
flowers it's kind of hard to have her
sit<00:06:43.249> because<00:06:43.639> of<00:06:43.759> those<00:06:43.959> although<00:06:44.959> if<00:06:45.229> you

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:45.409 
sit because of those although if you

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:47.259 
sit because of those although if you
force<00:06:45.800> one<00:06:46.159> of<00:06:46.189> them<00:06:46.459> in<00:06:46.610> between<00:06:46.759> her<00:06:47.119> legs

force one of them in between her legs

00:06:47.269 --> 00:06:49.779
