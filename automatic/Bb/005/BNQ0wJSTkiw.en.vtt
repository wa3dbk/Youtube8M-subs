local hardware store and basically what
it<00:00:52.410> does<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.739> it's<00:00:52.890> two<00:00:53.280> ends<00:00:53.640> with<00:00:54.149> some

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
it does is it's two ends with some

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.779 
it does is it's two ends with some
pressure<00:00:54.539> fittings<00:00:54.960> we'll<00:00:55.440> put<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.739> piece<00:00:56.489> in

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
pressure fittings we'll put a piece in

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.639 
pressure fittings we'll put a piece in
to<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.180> end<00:00:57.449> we'll<00:00:57.629> tighten<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.320> fittings

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
to this end we'll tighten the fittings

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.139 
to this end we'll tighten the fittings
we'll<00:00:58.770> put<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> piece<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.550> tighten

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149

we'll put a piece of that and tighten
the<00:01:00.210> fittings<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.660> basically<00:01:01.140> we'll<00:01:01.289> have

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
the fittings and basically we'll have

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.740 
the fittings and basically we'll have
our<00:01:01.559> hose<00:01:01.739> back<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.699> working<00:01:03.359> order

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750

hose is going to be Oh probably at least

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.080 
hose is going to be Oh probably at least
fifteen<00:01:08.010> dollars<00:01:08.280> maybe<00:01:08.430> twenty<00:01:08.820> dollars

two dollars and 18 cents protects so

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.640 
two dollars and 18 cents protects so
even<00:01:15.060> if<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.689> house<00:01:15.869> doesn't<00:01:15.900> last<00:01:16.380> for<00:01:16.590> a

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
you know several years it will

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.440 
you know several years it will
definitely<00:01:18.960> be<00:01:19.409> cheaper<00:01:20.250> than<00:01:20.520> replacing<00:01:20.909> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
definitely be cheaper than replacing the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.780 
definitely be cheaper than replacing the
whole<00:01:21.570> thing<00:01:21.840> right<00:01:22.229> now<00:01:22.490> now<00:01:23.490> one<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.670> the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
whole thing right now now one of the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.060 
whole thing right now now one of the
first<00:01:23.909> things<00:01:24.180> we<00:01:24.299> do<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.479> we<00:01:24.770> loosen<00:01:25.770> up<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
first things we do is we loosen up the

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.609 
first things we do is we loosen up the
screws<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.880> coupler<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.350> can<00:01:28.500> be

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
screws on this coupler so that it can be

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.219 
screws on this coupler so that it can be
spread<00:01:28.799> apart<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.579> then<00:01:30.390> slip<00:01:30.869> off<00:01:31.020> the

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
spread apart and then slip off the

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.960 
spread apart and then slip off the
internal<00:01:31.680> piece<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.070> goes<00:01:32.159> inside<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.790> hose

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
internal piece that goes inside the hose

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.999 
internal piece that goes inside the hose
there's<00:01:33.540> also<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:33.930> little<00:01:34.009> plastic

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
there's also this little plastic

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.020 
there's also this little plastic
attachment<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.640> keeps<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.850> whole<00:01:35.970> thing

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
attachment that keeps the whole thing

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.670 
attachment that keeps the whole thing
together<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.479> we'll<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:36.750> snip<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.619> off

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
together and we'll just snip that off

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.469 
together and we'll just snip that off
with<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.640> pair<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.299> side<00:01:39.990> cutters<00:01:41.090> so<00:01:42.090> here<00:01:42.390> we

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
with a pair of side cutters so here we

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.760 
with a pair of side cutters so here we
have<00:01:42.600> all<00:01:42.720> three<00:01:42.930> parts<00:01:43.170> separated<00:01:43.560> and

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
have all three parts separated and

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.980 
have all three parts separated and
basically<00:01:44.549> this<00:01:44.850> piece<00:01:45.030> right<00:01:45.240> here<00:01:45.299> but

whether that's going to go into each end

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.789 
whether that's going to go into each end

fitting<00:01:53.220> will<00:01:53.640> tighten<00:01:54.030> over<00:01:54.149> now<00:01:54.689> one<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:54.930> the

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
fitting will tighten over now one of the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.990 
fitting will tighten over now one of the
things<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.229> need<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.470> do<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.549> first<00:01:56.790> time

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
things you need to do and the first time

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.789 
things you need to do and the first time
you<00:01:57.119> do<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:57.270> you'll<00:01:57.600> sort<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:57.930> figure<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.680> out

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
you do this you'll sort of figure it out

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.109 
you do this you'll sort of figure it out
but<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.040> have<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.310> open<00:01:59.549> up<00:01:59.640> this<00:01:59.820> fitting

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
but you have to open up this fitting

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.530 
but you have to open up this fitting
slip<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.840> over<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.320> end<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.770> hose<00:02:01.920> first

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
slip it over the end of the hose first

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.420 
slip it over the end of the hose first
then<00:02:03.540> put<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.140> insert<00:02:04.619> in<00:02:04.770> then<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.280> can

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
then put the insert in then you can

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.370 
then put the insert in then you can
tighten<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:05.790> down<00:02:05.899> otherwise<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.229> will<00:02:07.320> not

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
tighten it down otherwise it will not

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.100 
tighten it down otherwise it will not
get<00:02:07.710> by<00:02:07.829> this<00:02:07.890> little<00:02:08.190> flange<00:02:08.819> that's<00:02:09.360> on<00:02:09.509> the

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
get by this little flange that's on the

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.690 
get by this little flange that's on the
middle<00:02:10.379> of<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.709> adapt

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
middle of the adapt

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.550 
middle of the adapt
so<00:02:12.700> here<00:02:12.880> we<00:02:12.970> are<00:02:13.000> we've<00:02:13.270> got<00:02:13.450> one<00:02:14.170> end<00:02:14.410> of<00:02:14.470> the

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
so here we are we've got one end of the

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.470 
so here we are we've got one end of the
adapter<00:02:14.770> in<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.190> end<00:02:15.400> of<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.580> hose<00:02:15.760> we<00:02:16.360> have

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
adapter in the end of the hose we have

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.250 
adapter in the end of the hose we have
our<00:02:16.600> coupling<00:02:17.020> ready<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.800> come<00:02:18.670> up<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:19.260> the

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
little flange air tighten that down to

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.780 
little flange air tighten that down to
make<00:02:23.050> a<00:02:23.080> waterproof<00:02:23.680> seal<00:02:23.710> we'll<00:02:24.520> do<00:02:24.670> exactly

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
make a waterproof seal we'll do exactly

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.660 
make a waterproof seal we'll do exactly
the<00:02:25.330> same<00:02:25.360> thing<00:02:25.870> with<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.560> other<00:02:26.710> end<00:02:27.010> now

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
the same thing with the other end now

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.150

just to give you a hint each time I do
this<00:02:30.370> it's<00:02:30.610> can<00:02:31.420> be<00:02:31.450> somewhat<00:02:31.930> of<00:02:32.050> a<00:02:32.110> hassle<00:02:32.290> to

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
this it's can be somewhat of a hassle to

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.950 
this it's can be somewhat of a hassle to
get<00:02:32.980> this<00:02:33.250> flange<00:02:33.670> back<00:02:34.120> in<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.450> hose

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
get this flange back in the hose

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.750 
get this flange back in the hose
I<00:02:34.990> get<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.650> adapter<00:02:36.160> I<00:02:36.190> should<00:02:36.340> say<00:02:36.460> back<00:02:36.640> in

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
I get the adapter I should say back in

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.380 
I get the adapter I should say back in
the<00:02:36.850> hose<00:02:37.470> pushing<00:02:38.470> twisting<00:02:39.100> you<00:02:39.610> can<00:02:39.940> heat

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
the hose pushing twisting you can heat

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.850 
the hose pushing twisting you can heat
up<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.570> hose<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:40.870> little<00:02:41.020> bit<00:02:41.350> just<00:02:41.500> to<00:02:41.590> make<00:02:41.830> a

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
up the hose a little bit just to make a

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.470 
up the hose a little bit just to make a
little<00:02:41.980> more<00:02:42.160> pliable<00:02:42.400> I've<00:02:43.120> used<00:02:43.390> a

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
little more pliable I've used a

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.850 
little more pliable I've used a
screwdriver<00:02:43.510> to<00:02:44.050> kind<00:02:44.230> of<00:02:44.320> widen<00:02:44.770> the<00:02:44.830> opening

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
screwdriver to kind of widen the opening

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
screwdriver to kind of widen the opening
and<00:02:45.270> in<00:02:46.270> this<00:02:46.600> case<00:02:46.810> what<00:02:47.230> worked<00:02:47.470> best<00:02:47.880> was

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
and in this case what worked best was

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.880 
and in this case what worked best was
taking<00:02:49.239> my<00:02:49.360> pair<00:02:49.540> of<00:02:49.630> side<00:02:49.780> cutters<00:02:49.890> holding

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
taking my pair of side cutters holding

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.190 
taking my pair of side cutters holding
the<00:02:51.010> hose<00:02:51.160> in<00:02:51.370> one<00:02:51.550> hand<00:02:51.850> and<00:02:52.060> simply<00:02:52.510> banging

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
the hose in one hand and simply banging

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.590 
the hose in one hand and simply banging
on<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:54.280> adapter<00:02:54.670> on<00:02:54.730> this<00:02:54.910> end<00:02:55.120> to<00:02:55.270> push<00:02:55.450> it

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
on the adapter on this end to push it

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.699 
on the adapter on this end to push it
into<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:55.840> house<00:02:55.930> and<00:02:56.170> that<00:02:56.230> actually<00:02:56.530> seemed

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
into the house and that actually seemed

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.170 
into the house and that actually seemed
to<00:02:56.800> work<00:02:56.920> fairly<00:02:57.340> well<00:02:59.640> then<00:03:00.640> finally<00:03:01.030> we<00:03:01.150> just

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
to work fairly well then finally we just

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.360 
to work fairly well then finally we just
tighten<00:03:01.480> these<00:03:01.660> screws<00:03:01.720> down<00:03:02.200> they<00:03:02.920> bring

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
tighten these screws down they bring

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.010 
tighten these screws down they bring
those<00:03:03.550> clamps<00:03:03.820> down<00:03:04.030> to<00:03:04.330> seal<00:03:04.510> against<00:03:04.810> the

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
those clamps down to seal against the

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.810 
those clamps down to seal against the
insert<00:03:05.890> and<00:03:06.100> it<00:03:06.489> should<00:03:06.820> be<00:03:07.000> good<00:03:07.480> to<00:03:07.720> go<00:03:08.820> and

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
insert and it should be good to go and

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.060 
insert and it should be good to go and
here<00:03:10.300> we<00:03:10.390> go<00:03:10.510> everything<00:03:11.200> back<00:03:11.440> and<00:03:11.709> dripping

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
here we go everything back and dripping

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.800 
here we go everything back and dripping
as<00:03:12.900> normally<00:03:13.900> so<00:03:14.709> sometimes<00:03:15.610> you<00:03:15.940> need<00:03:16.690> to

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
as normally so sometimes you need to

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.060 
as normally so sometimes you need to
realize<00:03:17.080> you<00:03:17.200> don't<00:03:17.290> have<00:03:17.410> to<00:03:17.620> replace<00:03:17.860> an

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
realize you don't have to replace an

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.550 
realize you don't have to replace an
entire<00:03:18.239> system<00:03:19.239> just<00:03:19.989> to<00:03:20.049> get<00:03:20.230> it<00:03:20.350> working

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
entire system just to get it working

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.800 
entire system just to get it working
