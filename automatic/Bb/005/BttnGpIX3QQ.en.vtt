hello it's clear here again five to go
and<00:00:04.670> I<00:00:05.670> am<00:00:06.089> blogging<00:00:06.600> for<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.200> first<00:00:07.410> time<00:00:07.770> in

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:08.360 
and I am blogging for the first time in

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:15.289 
and I am blogging for the first time in
January<00:00:09.360> 2014<00:00:10.230> and<00:00:11.690> it's<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.809> new<00:00:12.960> year<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:14.299> for

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
January 2014 and it's a new year and for

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.689 
January 2014 and it's a new year and for
once<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.809> have<00:00:15.990> made<00:00:16.170> absolutely<00:00:16.740> no<00:00:16.890> new

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
once I have made absolutely no new

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.090 
once I have made absolutely no new
year's<00:00:18.060> resolutions<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.710> think<00:00:19.920> that's

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
year's resolutions and I think that's

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.060 
year's resolutions and I think that's
mainly<00:00:20.340> because<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:21.350> made<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.740> biggest

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
mainly because I made the biggest

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.700 
mainly because I made the biggest
changes<00:00:23.460> last<00:00:23.760> year<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.330> found<00:00:24.779> this<00:00:25.050> diet<00:00:25.320> and

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
changes last year I found this diet and

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.160 
changes last year I found this diet and
I<00:00:26.490> have<00:00:27.060> never<00:00:27.269> been<00:00:27.390> happier

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
I have never been happier

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.439 
I have never been happier
it's<00:00:29.010> not<00:00:29.220> been<00:00:29.369> easy<00:00:29.519> I've<00:00:29.820> actually<00:00:29.970> been<00:00:30.269> on

this diet since April and I probably

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:42.200 
this diet since April and I probably
weighed<00:00:34.410> about<00:00:37.340> about<00:00:38.340> 10<00:00:38.870> about<00:00:40.520> 10<00:00:41.520> pounds

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.970 
weighed about about 10 about 10 pounds
or<00:00:42.360> trying<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.690> convert<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.410> from<00:00:43.559> giving<00:00:43.860> us

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
or trying to convert it from giving us

or trying to convert it from giving us
about<00:00:44.309> 10<00:00:44.610> pounds<00:00:46.160> then<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.190> did<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.700> year<00:00:47.969> ago

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
about 10 pounds then I did a year ago

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.119 
about 10 pounds then I did a year ago
and<00:00:48.960> it's<00:00:49.559> really<00:00:49.890> noticeable<00:00:50.070> now<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.260> I<00:00:52.260> I'm

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
and it's really noticeable now and I I'm

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.250 
and it's really noticeable now and I I'm
gonna<00:00:53.460> say<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.090> think<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.809> first<00:00:55.079> few

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
gonna say this I think the first few

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.779 
gonna say this I think the first few
weeks<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.190> did<00:00:56.430> on<00:00:56.640> 5<00:00:56.879> -<00:00:57.180> back<00:00:57.449> in<00:00:57.629> April<00:00:58.020> I

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
weeks that I did on 5 - back in April I

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.959 
weeks that I did on 5 - back in April I
was<00:00:59.789> pretty<00:01:00.750> rubbish<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.440> was<00:01:01.770> really<00:01:02.579> just

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
was pretty rubbish I was really just

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.210 
was pretty rubbish I was really just
playing<00:01:03.539> around<00:01:03.750> with<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.110> checking<00:01:04.890> out<00:01:05.189> and

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
playing around with it checking out and

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.670 
playing around with it checking out and
my<00:01:08.220> 5:2<00:01:08.880> diet<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.570> probably<00:01:10.020> very<00:01:10.140> different

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
my 5:2 diet is probably very different

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.969 
my 5:2 diet is probably very different
to<00:01:10.770> yours<00:01:11.330> and<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.540> think<00:01:12.869> that's<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.770> one

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
to yours and I think that's the one

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.890 
to yours and I think that's the one
thing<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.340> discover<00:01:14.820> as<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.420> become<00:01:15.840> a

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
thing you discover as you become a

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.640 
thing you discover as you become a
veteran<00:01:16.170> at<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:17.030> you<00:01:18.030> learn<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:19.049> realise<00:01:19.380> how

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
veteran at this you learn to realise how

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.780 
veteran at this you learn to realise how
it<00:01:19.830> works<00:01:20.009> for<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:21.890> it<00:01:22.890> does<00:01:23.189> work<00:01:23.400> for<00:01:23.640> me

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
it works for you and it does work for me

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.850 
it works for you and it does work for me
