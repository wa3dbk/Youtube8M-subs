 i 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.069
 to 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.820
 Y 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:21.600
 Y 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.600
 [Applause] 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.240
 hello that such android I hope you are 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.770
 very well in this video we are going to see a 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.990
 analysis of this product you sent us 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.790
 the company to compensated ok is a 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.169
 amazon company of a product 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.640
 quite interesting that is a charger 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.350
 wireless that works with the 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.570
 technology here for enough 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.940
 devices and then smartphones iphone 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.370
 etcetera etcetera so let's go to 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.430
 see that those that contain the box in 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.199
 this case I have the one that is the charger 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.360
 and it is also a little the bank of 4 thousand 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.010
 800 thousand amps is called this disc 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.460
 hard them in minor and equal models 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.619
 but but let's go of the article 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.619
 [Music] 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.989
 ah 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.139
 [Music] 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.920
 and we have it ok 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.480
 and here we will have the connector to the 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.700
 current that is here 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:25.130
 and the usb cable so we're going to see it from 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.409
 what is this interesting product 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.700
 the technology here is basically the 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.130
 transfer of electricity through 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.630
 of some waves that reach devices 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.399
 of recision in this case teach the 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.530
 batteries why some terminals like 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.750
 the c4 that we will see later that 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.320
 requires a receiver that is like a 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.659
 adhesive which already receives the waves by 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.280
 means of induction of the emitter 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.859
 good that we already have what is the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.539
 charger the part is the link for 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.460
 who can download it then 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.159
 make us here we have several several 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.530
 models we have the n 11 with 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.020
 4,800 which is the battery integrate the network 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.700
 which we can already load in your 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.020
 device easily we have that 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.539
 connect it until it's over 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.459
 then as you can see here we have the 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.590
 neon if we have the color white 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.480
 I have this here we have line 7 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.519
 that I already am already comes if not only what is 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.950
 the receiver not only that already the 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.650
 wireless charging device and no longer 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.879
 comes with power bank we already have the n 7 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.250
 also black color is a device 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.680
 They were 16, the one I have is worth 40 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.430
 then it is then already some mediate vale 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.049
 28 and q 19 is rotating is basic 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.299
 receiver entity but in the most 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.860
 inclined and in a different way in case 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.780
 we want to have it in the following way 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.760
 then we have here the same color 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.730
 black and already if we already have only at last 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.099
 current 115 euros and cheaper what 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.569
 shows the part as this piece 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.879
 would connect with equally is quite 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.629
 little idea that I would only order no longer 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.099
 on your device 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.030
 here is how you can see we have in 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.800
 White color 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.600
 and also in black with green 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.970
 that also in his pretty pretty power 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.860
 this bar 15 in terms of compatibility 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.690
 in new ones on phones that have 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.920
 load of the series scope that come 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:07.530
 being in those five the one of his seven is 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.100
 a generation in its 4 lg optimus hub 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.850
 euros 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:14.069
 I do not want my 920 and htc x 8 and between 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.360
 some more then good those 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.650
 terminals as they have to do the 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.900
 america by default they will work 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.920
 perfectly close to the galaxies and 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.680
 4 s delivered but 2 13 12 to 18 20 and 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.920
 The range of the iphone requires a 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.209
 adapter we put here a receiver that is 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.100
 who will receive the zone of 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.720
 electricity then this is like the 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.940
 kind of adhesive and we see it to fields 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.970
 in finishing that the battery is stuck and 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.250
 we can put our terminal disk in 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.050
 our issuing team is not positive 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.330
 emitter decay lambry case bucket 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.239
 barely 11 euros 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.680
 here is for the s4 for the 23rd and for 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.959
 the other terminals to say of power 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.370
 they can look for them we have them on the web 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.440
 good the functioning of what is 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.010
 this great friend of sheen pretty 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.200
 simple 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.470
 here we have in charger with your 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.269
 capacity of 4800 binaries here we have 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.599
 what is the button then on 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.790
 here we have the usb entry and here the 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.860
 micro usb then for the micro sd let's go 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.989
 to try everything connected to what is the 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.090
 energy and we're going to see credits or 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.310
 turn on as you can see here is 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.079
 palpitating here here they mean 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.269
 that the charge level has been removed 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.190
 extra for the one who is loading then 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.320
 we can put it to load directly from 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.669
 energy or if we also want from the 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.919
 pc that is also a pretty point 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.630
 important or all point in favor is that 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.639
 we can have here whatever the 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.350
 loading device and we can have 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.510
 also another connecting here 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.060
 simultaneously at the same time then good 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.530
 we are going to disconnect it here and we are going to 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.050
 move on to what is the connection 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.300
 device remember that this one has 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.729
 directly what the load we are going to 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.590
 put it here and how can we see the 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.240
 turn off only which of 930 no cable 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.010
 or anything connected instantly 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.620
 solutions to turn on we're going to 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.660
 turn it on here and let's put it to each 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.070
 A sound as much as it comes out is 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.870
 four centimeters let's put the 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.580
 straight 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:06.060
 makes a sound as you can see and starts 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.190
 to palpitate the green and the device already 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.310
 I would be here loading I can also put 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:14.190
 of the air a little bit without that we need 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:16.620
 see what is loading x is shining 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.669
 what is the pilot 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.669
 we separate 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:25.310
 and how can we own the title 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.009
 that would basically be the operation 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.250
 of the ballast pretty great because 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:33.479
 we have what is the load directly 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.430
 who stored as the others 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:38.490
 devices that we saw in the little one that 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.530
 I already had to be connected to the PC 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.759
 for example to be able to load it without more 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.069
 I say goodbye so I hope we 're 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:45.870
 well I'll leave the link so they can 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:47.819
 Acquire the product if you want to know that 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.650
 there is a price range also so 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:51.030
 see you in another upcoming video I hope 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.500
 give me a good line if in the taste 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.500
 of this product I hope
