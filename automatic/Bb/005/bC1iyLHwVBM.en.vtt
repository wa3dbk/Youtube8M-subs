jumble<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:36.000> things<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:37.200> he<00:00:37.260> says<00:00:37.530> code<00:00:37.890> and

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
jumble of things that he says code and

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.340 
jumble of things that he says code and
that<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.920> pretty<00:00:41.190> much<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:42.110> if<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.260> will

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
that is pretty much it so if you will

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.990 
that is pretty much it so if you will
watch<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> sufficient<00:00:44.910> amount

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
watch this this is a sufficient amount

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.270 
watch this this is a sufficient amount
of<00:00:45.300> TNT<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:46.140> would<00:00:46.289> lag<00:00:46.469> up<00:00:46.680> even<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.100> best

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
of TNT this would lag up even the best

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.090 
of TNT this would lag up even the best
computer<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.629> I'm<00:00:48.899> going<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.110> put<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.590> much

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
computer so I'm going to put that much

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.680 
computer so I'm going to put that much
TNT<00:00:50.700> here<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.390> let's<00:00:51.930> see<00:00:52.289> how<00:00:53.250> well<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:54.329> mod

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
TNT here and let's see how well this mod

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.740 
TNT here and let's see how well this mod
does<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:56.370> let<00:00:56.520> me<00:00:56.610> fly<00:00:57.030> up<00:00:57.890> there<00:00:58.890> we<00:00:59.010> go<00:00:59.750> not

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
does so let me fly up there we go not

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.570 
does so let me fly up there we go not
even<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.440> stutter<00:01:02.989> completely<00:01:03.989> smooth<00:01:04.799> just

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
even a stutter completely smooth just

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.080 
even a stutter completely smooth just
really<00:01:06.030> perfect<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:07.369> yeah<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:08.909> will

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
really perfect and yeah so this will

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.300 
really perfect and yeah so this will
work<00:01:09.240> with<00:01:09.479> pretty<00:01:10.229> much<00:01:10.409> any<00:01:10.710> explosion

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
work with pretty much any explosion

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.810 
work with pretty much any explosion
obviously<00:01:11.820> if<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.030> go<00:01:12.180> massive<00:01:13.049> like<00:01:13.820> 20,000

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
obviously if you go massive like 20,000

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.140 
obviously if you go massive like 20,000
blocks<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.240> TIG<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:16.350> not<00:01:16.590> going<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.799> be

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
blocks of TIG it's not going to be

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.340 
blocks of TIG it's not going to be
completely<00:01:18.150> lag-free<00:01:18.509> it's<00:01:18.900> going<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.080> be<00:01:19.170> a

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
completely lag-free it's going to be a

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.130 
completely lag-free it's going to be a
lot<00:01:20.040> less<00:01:20.310> laggy<00:01:20.670> tho<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.509> if<00:01:21.689> you're<00:01:21.900> someone

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
lot less laggy tho so if you're someone

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.560 
lot less laggy tho so if you're someone
that<00:01:22.200> has<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> pretty<00:01:22.950> bad<00:01:23.040> computer<00:01:23.490> or<00:01:23.790> you

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
that has a pretty bad computer or you

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.969 
that has a pretty bad computer or you
just<00:01:24.689> want<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.900> set<00:01:25.049> off<00:01:25.140> big<00:01:25.380> explosions

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
just want to set off big explosions

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.800 
just want to set off big explosions
without<00:01:26.250> having<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.759> leg<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.659> would

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
without having a leg and I would

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.600

this mod because it is so useful and

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.899 
this mod because it is so useful and
it's<00:01:33.619> probably<00:01:34.619> one<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.159> best<00:01:35.310> mods<00:01:35.549> out

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
it's probably one of the best mods out

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.640 
it's probably one of the best mods out
there<00:01:36.210> because<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.750> fixed<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.170> such<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.350> big

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
there because it fixed is such a big

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.870 
there because it fixed is such a big
problem<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.159> know<00:01:38.220> everyone's<00:01:38.640> had<00:01:38.790> this

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
problem I know everyone's had this

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.200 
problem I know everyone's had this
problem<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.680> TNT<00:01:40.680> just<00:01:40.950> makes<00:01:41.159> such<00:01:41.579> laggy

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
problem that TNT just makes such laggy

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.530 
problem that TNT just makes such laggy
explosions<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:44.250> believe<00:01:44.549> what<00:01:45.030> he<00:01:45.119> did<00:01:45.299> was

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
explosions so I believe what he did was

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.450 
explosions so I believe what he did was
just<00:01:45.899> get<00:01:46.110> rid<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.290> some<00:01:46.470> unnecessary<00:01:46.770> things

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
just get rid of some unnecessary things

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.999 
just get rid of some unnecessary things
at<00:01:47.820> tnt<00:01:48.270> dozen<00:01:48.570> animations<00:01:49.079> but<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.799> can't

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
at tnt dozen animations but you can't

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.289 
at tnt dozen animations but you can't
notice<00:01:50.310> anything<00:01:50.700> different<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.180> is

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
notice anything different it is

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.910 
notice anything different it is
completely<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.229> same<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.619> think<00:01:52.649> it's

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
completely the same I think it's

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.080 
completely the same I think it's
something<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.189> do<00:01:53.280> with<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.490> shock<00:01:53.700> wave<00:01:53.909> that

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
something to do with the shock wave that

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.319 
something to do with the shock wave that
he<00:01:54.210> change<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:55.399> let<00:01:56.399> me<00:01:56.490> get<00:01:56.640> this<00:01:56.670> nice<00:01:57.090> and

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
he change so let me get this nice and

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.060

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
row and I'm going to explode it and see

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.789 
row and I'm going to explode it and see
just<00:02:02.610> see<00:02:02.759> if<00:02:02.790> my<00:02:03.149> computer<00:02:03.689> lags<00:02:03.930> at<00:02:04.259> all<00:02:04.380> I'm

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
just see if my computer lags at all I'm

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.920 
just see if my computer lags at all I'm
pretty<00:02:05.369> sure<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.640> will<00:02:05.790> because<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.450> huge

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
pretty sure it will because a huge

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.600 
pretty sure it will because a huge
explosion<00:02:07.200> but<00:02:07.979> it's<00:02:08.190> not<00:02:08.369> going<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.550> be

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
explosion but it's not going to be

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.730 
explosion but it's not going to be
anywhere<00:02:08.910> near<00:02:09.080> so<00:02:10.400> let's<00:02:11.400> see<00:02:11.640> we<00:02:11.790> got

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
anywhere near so let's see we got

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.190 
anywhere near so let's see we got
turn<00:02:12.980> creative<00:02:13.880> mode<00:02:13.970> off<00:02:14.150> turned<00:02:14.630> on<00:02:14.870> so<00:02:15.140> I
