00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
Pens is actually dual purpose which

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.509 
Pens is actually dual purpose which
would<00:00:08.790> be<00:00:08.910> this<00:00:09.090> one<00:00:09.330> which<00:00:10.320> is<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.559> pen<00:00:11.010> side<00:00:11.250> so

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
would be this one which is a pen side so

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.339 
would be this one which is a pen side so
you<00:00:11.580> can<00:00:11.639> actually<00:00:11.880> write<00:00:12.150> on<00:00:12.300> paper<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.809> the

you can actually write on paper and the

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.440 
you can actually write on paper and the
capacitive<00:00:14.009> side<00:00:14.219> so<00:00:14.580> you<00:00:14.610> can<00:00:14.880> write<00:00:15.000> on<00:00:15.240> the

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
capacitive side so you can write on the

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.109 
capacitive side so you can write on the
ipad<00:00:15.839> i<00:00:16.080> will<00:00:16.949> be<00:00:17.070> testing<00:00:17.430> out<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.699> bedsides

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
ipad i will be testing out the bedsides

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.880 
ipad i will be testing out the bedsides
to<00:00:18.570> show<00:00:19.050> you<00:00:19.109> guys<00:00:19.199> how<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:19.680> works<00:00:24.769> it<00:00:25.769> works

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
going to test the pen on the capacitive

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.930 
going to test the pen on the capacitive
side<00:00:36.570> with<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.020> ipad<00:00:37.350> i'm<00:00:37.590> using<00:00:38.250> sketchbook

compared to the other pens that I have
used<00:02:11.860> it's<00:02:12.760> very<00:02:13.030> similar<00:02:13.720> it<00:02:14.530> has<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:15.459> rubber

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
tip which does not crumble like some of

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.089 
tip which does not crumble like some of
the<00:02:18.970> other<00:02:19.090> pens<00:02:19.360> that<00:02:19.450> I've<00:02:19.630> used<00:02:19.660> before<00:02:20.099> it

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
the other pens that I've used before it

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.190 
the other pens that I've used before it
doesn't<00:02:21.819> affect<00:02:22.300> the<00:02:22.480> screen<00:02:22.840> I<00:02:23.280> don't<00:02:24.280> have<00:02:24.610> a

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
doesn't affect the screen I don't have a

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.530 
doesn't affect the screen I don't have a
screen<00:02:26.200> protector<00:02:27.180> like<00:02:28.180> some<00:02:28.390> of<00:02:28.480> the

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
screen protector like some of the

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.470 
screen protector like some of the
popular<00:02:28.690> brands<00:02:29.260> like<00:02:29.410> sag<00:02:29.769> so<00:02:30.640> I<00:02:30.670> don't<00:02:31.150> know

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
popular brands like sag so I don't know

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.470 
popular brands like sag so I don't know
if<00:02:32.099> they<00:02:33.099> would<00:02:33.370> get<00:02:33.700> caught<00:02:33.970> on<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.150> screen

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
if they would get caught on the screen

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.160 
if they would get caught on the screen
protector<00:02:35.400> but<00:02:36.400> I<00:02:36.640> don't<00:02:37.150> really<00:02:37.599> believe<00:02:38.019> in

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
protector but I don't really believe in

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.830 
protector but I don't really believe in
having<00:02:38.349> screen<00:02:38.709> protectors<00:02:39.250> if<00:02:39.750> you're<00:02:40.750> going

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
having screen protectors if you're going

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.390 
having screen protectors if you're going
to<00:02:40.900> be<00:02:40.989> drawing<00:02:41.230> on<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.530> iPad<00:02:41.920> or<00:02:42.069> taking<00:02:42.370> a

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
to be drawing on the iPad or taking a

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.610 
to be drawing on the iPad or taking a
lot<00:02:42.580> of<00:02:42.610> notes<00:02:42.880> because<00:02:43.120> most<00:02:43.420> pens<00:02:43.720> have<00:02:44.560> a

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
lot of notes because most pens have a

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.460 
lot of notes because most pens have a
tendency<00:02:45.190> of<00:02:45.220> getting<00:02:45.310> stuck<00:02:45.819> on<00:02:46.470> the

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
tendency of getting stuck on the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.780 
tendency of getting stuck on the
protectors<00:02:48.480> so

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.479 

I<00:02:52.469> can<00:02:53.469> tell<00:02:53.650> you<00:02:53.739> it<00:02:53.829> works<00:02:53.980> great<00:02:54.129> with<00:02:54.310> that

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
I can tell you it works great with that

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:16.790 
I can tell you it works great with that
one

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.180 

I<00:03:16.890> would<00:03:17.700> totally<00:03:18.240> recommend<00:03:18.690> this<00:03:19.140> pen<00:03:19.620> if

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
I would totally recommend this pen if

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.030 
I would totally recommend this pen if
you're<00:03:21.000> looking<00:03:21.390> for<00:03:21.420> a<00:03:21.660> dual<00:03:21.930> purpose<00:03:22.260> spend

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.260 

it's<00:03:26.040> also<00:03:26.220> very<00:03:26.490> pretty<00:03:26.850> if<00:03:27.000> you<00:03:27.120> like

it's also very pretty if you like
crystals<00:03:28.610> and<00:03:29.610> you<00:03:30.210> can<00:03:30.390> change<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.900> ink

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
crystals and you can change the ink
