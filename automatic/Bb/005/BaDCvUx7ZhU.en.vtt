00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello I want to explain how to get the 

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.410
 material of two siren videos that 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.809
 I have here on youtube so I do not have to 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.790
 answer more questions you can 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.920
 believe the story that I'm going to tell you or 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.630
 you can not believe you anything 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.430
 it looks good I'm the first one that barely 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.030
 he believes in nothing he sees here in 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.640
 Youtube 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.410
 but well this is what happened I went to 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.140
 the great barrier reef in 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.540
 australia which is where I live to try a 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.090
 underwater box to film under the 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.790
 water that he had bought and the movie 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.110
 the left was my first attempt or be 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.840
 I am already answering many 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.550
 questions this is my material stop 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.250
 copy it this is not from any movie 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.110
 no television show and this is 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.330
 the bottom of the ocean 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:50.590
 not very deep but it is not even an aquarium 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:53.440
 neither a pool nor anyone's bathtub 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.760
 good back story just 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.690
 get down there and I'm trying 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.840
 operate a camera from outside through 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.750
 from the box and I suddenly feel something 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.030
 behind me and at that moment I see 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.210
 pass this 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.190
 and I did not know I thought it was that 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.610
 but before I knew it, I already 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.700
 had gone 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.670
 I've written a hundred times here that the 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.409
 visibility that I had then there 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.570
 it was much worse than what was appreciated 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.040
 now in the images or because in 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.350
 I chased what is it that asks 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.140
 many people here because why why not 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.840
 I found out and why if you are 50 years old 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.000
 but you ditch very well or not the very good 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.659
 swimmer and you get into the bottom of the 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.920
 ocean with a camera and a box let's go 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:44.560
 as if it were a vacuum cleaner and the 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.020
 oxygen cylinder you're not for 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.909
 chase fish or be sorry 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.619
 disappoint or if not to see introduce 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.030
 here an action movie but this what 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.619
 waths up 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.140
 I did not realize what I had 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.930
 filmed until at night I saw the 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.540
 images on my computer on the laptop 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.700
 so I went back the next day to the same 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:08.679
 place almost exactly at the same 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:11.709
 place and I waited and waited and this time 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.260
 He had been there quite a while when 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.090
 I saw her soon and there are many people who 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.950
 comment not if it looks like you were 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.720
 waiting for it to appear then it 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.440
 I was waiting but I did not know if I was going to 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.900
 appear or not 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.210
 but it has appeared and this time I could 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.990
 have perfectly and I shit legs 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.960
 down 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:34.770
 and I stayed filming filming and tilt 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.630
 the camera as much as I could and then 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.420
 when I wanted to turn around and move 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:43.200
 the whole thing had disappeared 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.870
 as if by magic 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.790
 that's why I think it's a siren because 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.709
 is that he was and suddenly he was not there and 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.200
 besides, like someone could have me 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.140
 spent a joke once but twice 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.360
 consecutive 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:01.340
 things that people comment on these 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:03.530
 videos this light at this time I do not know 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.990
 what seems to me to be the reflection of the 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.990
 sun over a fish but I do not have an idea 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:17.020
 this other moment she doubles the 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.020
 knees is what people write here 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:24.150
 Well yes there are legs 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.880
 It seems to me that if you double the 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.490
 knees and other things 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.070
 but well that may be I do not know what 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.500
 better is the water distortion because 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.450
 I'm not 67 meters deep 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.920
 I know if you 've ever flipped with 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.260
 but if you are at the bottom of the 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.280
 sea â€‹â€‹and you look towards the surface it seems 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.980
 that is the same 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.660
 but I do not know that everyone thinks what 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.790
 I want what I do know is that I do not 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.100
 I have no idea of sirens nor am I a 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.100
 specialist in costumes or effects 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.770
 special nothing of that but good you 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.050
 Do you think what you think of me? 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.150
 it looks good 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.180
 because I believe now that it is a 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:07.720
 mermaid good for something that nobody has 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.820
 commented here three million visits 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.820
 between these two videos and nobody has 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:16.239
 commented on the tail the tail of these 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:19.299
 Two mermaids is not the same I've seen 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:23.020
 this material more than anyone that sure and 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:25.810
 look queues is that it is not 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.820
 They are not the same 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.500
 that's why I think these are a group of 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:36.450
 animals or mermaids that were traveling 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:38.290
 towards the north towards the tropic and 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.210
 they were there in a moment and then 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.950
 they disappeared because after 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.100
 second day I had to go home and 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.960
 when I realized that really the 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.139
 material that I had filmed I organized another 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:53.530
 I traveled a month later and I came back and I was 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.760
 four times more in the same area and not 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:05:01.090
 I saw nothing 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:03.420
 that is they were and disappeared and that 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.420
 that's it
