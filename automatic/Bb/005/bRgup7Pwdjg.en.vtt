recognize something a little bit these
helicopters<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.710> are<00:01:07.830> inspired<00:01:08.070> by<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.520> bin

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
helicopters that are inspired by the bin

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.010 
helicopters that are inspired by the bin
Laden<00:01:09.119> right<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.570> they're<00:01:09.720> little<00:01:09.869> to

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
Laden right so they're little to

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.910 
Laden right so they're little to
stealthily<00:01:10.439> helicopters<00:01:12.650> so<00:01:13.650> we're<00:01:13.770> on<00:01:13.799> our

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
stealthily helicopters so we're on our

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
way we should have also an lav in

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.880 
way we should have also an lav in
support<00:01:16.860> coming<00:01:17.189> in<00:01:18.320> one<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.500> cool<00:01:19.680> new

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
support coming in one of the cool new

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.830 
support coming in one of the cool new
things<00:01:20.189> as<00:01:20.340> well<00:01:20.520> from<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.270> alpha<00:01:21.540> we<00:01:21.659> had<00:01:21.810> a

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
things as well from the alpha we had a

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.270 
things as well from the alpha we had a
lot<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.020> feedback<00:01:22.259> for<00:01:22.740> stuff<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
lot of feedback for stuff that the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.070 
lot of feedback for stuff that the
community<00:01:23.700> wanted<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.180> see<00:01:24.360> one<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:24.990> the

community wanted to see one of the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.840 
community wanted to see one of the
examples<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.740> stance<00:01:26.009> indicator<00:01:26.490> so

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
examples is the stance indicator so

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.460 
examples is the stance indicator so
people<00:01:27.390> weren't<00:01:27.540> quite<00:01:27.810> sure<00:01:27.840> whether<00:01:28.290> they

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
people weren't quite sure whether they

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.710

were<00:01:28.590> crouched<00:01:29.189> or<00:01:29.490> prone<00:01:29.700> or<00:01:29.729> whatever<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.630> in

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
were crouched or prone or whatever so in

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.450 
were crouched or prone or whatever so in
the<00:01:30.810> top<00:01:30.990> right<00:01:31.200> here<00:01:31.439> we've<00:01:31.890> added<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.220> sense

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
the top right here we've added a sense

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.130 
the top right here we've added a sense
indicator<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.210> optional<00:01:33.659> people<00:01:34.049> who

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
indicator that is optional people who

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.020 
indicator that is optional people who
are<00:01:34.290> hardcore<00:01:34.950> they<00:01:35.130> don't<00:01:35.310> want<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.670> they<00:01:35.880> can

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
are hardcore they don't want it they can

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.569 
are hardcore they don't want it they can
disable<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.570> but<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.560> just<00:01:37.590> helps<00:01:37.979> helps<00:01:38.460> you

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
slow-paced more methodical knowing

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.260 
slow-paced more methodical knowing
what's<00:03:59.920> around<00:03:59.980> I<00:04:00.400> think<00:04:00.730> the<00:04:00.820> thing<00:04:00.850> is<00:04:01.120> as

platform<00:04:03.040> like<00:04:03.580> modding<00:04:04.000> is<00:04:04.150> really

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
platform like modding is really

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.390 
platform like modding is really
important<00:04:04.900> to<00:04:04.960> us<00:04:05.170> and<00:04:05.320> always<00:04:05.470> has<00:04:05.710> been<00:04:05.740> so

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
important to us and always has been so

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.160 
important to us and always has been so
since<00:04:06.700> the<00:04:06.850> Alpha<00:04:07.150> we've<00:04:07.300> allowed<00:04:07.600> moving<00:04:07.990> and

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
since the Alpha we've allowed moving and

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.440 
since the Alpha we've allowed moving and
people<00:04:08.500> if<00:04:08.680> they<00:04:08.890> do<00:04:08.950> one<00:04:09.450> expected

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
people if they do one expected

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.060 
people if they do one expected
spectacular<00:04:11.110> scenarios<00:04:11.500> like<00:04:11.650> that<00:04:11.830> they<00:04:11.920> can

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
spectacular scenarios like that they can

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.710 
spectacular scenarios like that they can
just<00:04:12.220> make<00:04:12.370> it<00:04:12.400> they<00:04:12.880> can<00:04:13.060> we've<00:04:13.330> seen<00:04:13.570> some

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720

just make it they can we've seen some
really<00:04:13.960> crazy<00:04:14.350> modifications<00:04:15.310> quad<00:04:15.640> bike

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
really crazy modifications quad bike

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.449 
really crazy modifications quad bike
races<00:04:16.360> and<00:04:16.860> recently<00:04:17.860> a<00:04:17.950> model's<00:04:18.370> release

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
races and recently a model's release

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.310

like<00:04:18.910> a<00:04:18.940> bow<00:04:19.180> and<00:04:19.209> arrow<00:04:19.450> is<00:04:19.780> looking<00:04:20.200> really

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
like a bow and arrow is looking really

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.790 
like a bow and arrow is looking really
cool<00:04:21.030> so<00:04:22.030> yeah<00:04:22.210> our<00:04:22.540> missions<00:04:23.140> are<00:04:23.350> perhaps<00:04:23.530> a

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
cool so yeah our missions are perhaps a

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.530 
cool so yeah our missions are perhaps a
little<00:04:23.920> bit<00:04:24.100> more<00:04:24.250> slow<00:04:24.490> paced<00:04:24.760> and<00:04:25.060> that's

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
little bit more slow paced and that's

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.960 
little bit more slow paced and that's
just<00:04:25.660> the<00:04:26.050> style<00:04:26.290> of<00:04:26.470> play<00:04:26.860> that<00:04:27.070> we<00:04:27.160> like<00:04:27.400> but

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
just the style of play that we like but

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.220 
just the style of play that we like but
if<00:04:28.180> the<00:04:28.360> community<00:04:28.660> wants<00:04:28.840> to<00:04:29.020> make<00:04:29.140> these

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
if the community wants to make these

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.630
