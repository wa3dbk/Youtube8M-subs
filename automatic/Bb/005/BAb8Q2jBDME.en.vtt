hey<00:00:00.269> everybody<00:00:00.719> I'm<00:00:00.930> just<00:00:01.199> going<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:01.829> do<00:00:01.979> a

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
hey everybody I'm just going to do a

resistor<00:00:05.549> on<00:00:06.150> a<00:00:07.429> 2004<00:00:08.429> Ford<00:00:08.870> Expedition<00:00:10.219> XLT

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:11.750 
resistor on a 2004 Ford Expedition XLT

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.709 
resistor on a 2004 Ford Expedition XLT
this<00:00:12.750> does<00:00:12.960> not<00:00:13.139> have<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.620> climate<00:00:13.980> control

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 
this does not have the climate control

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.540 
this does not have the climate control
it's<00:00:15.719> just<00:00:16.049> as<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:16.710> say<00:00:16.890> almost<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.400> base

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
it's just as you say almost the base

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.200 
it's just as you say almost the base
model<00:00:18.710> so<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.460> resistor<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:21.029> we're

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
model so the the resistor that we're

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.710 
model so the the resistor that we're
actually<00:00:21.420> looking<00:00:21.840> like<00:00:22.880> it's<00:00:23.880> going<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.240> be<00:00:24.420> Y

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
actually looking like it's going to be Y

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.480 
actually looking like it's going to be Y

this<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.440> one<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.829> you're<00:00:40.950> going<00:00:41.040> to

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
this is the one that you're going to

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.139 
this is the one that you're going to
want<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.460> go<00:00:41.579> ahead<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.910> get<00:00:42.090> so<00:00:43.820> it's<00:00:44.820> just<00:00:45.059> a

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
want to go ahead and get so it's just a

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.740 
want to go ahead and get so it's just a
flat<00:00:45.450> blade<00:00:45.840> style<00:00:46.260> there<00:00:46.620> are<00:00:46.770> two<00:00:47.070> other

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
flat blade style there are two other

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.229 
flat blade style there are two other
styles<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.050> may<00:00:49.289> have<00:00:49.469> seen<00:00:50.090> there<00:00:51.090> is

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
styles that you may have seen there is

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.380 
styles that you may have seen there is
the<00:00:51.390> silver<00:00:51.890> style<00:00:52.890> but<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.430> goes<00:00:53.640> for<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
the silver style but that goes for the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.439 
the silver style but that goes for the
rear<00:00:54.600> system<00:00:55.699> so<00:00:56.699> basically<00:00:57.030> first<00:00:57.239> thing

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
rear system so basically first thing

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.520 
rear system so basically first thing
we're<00:00:57.600> going<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.780> do<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.140> we're<00:00:58.289> going<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.440> go

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
we're going to do is we're going to go

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.599 
we're going to do is we're going to go
ahead<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.739> pop<00:00:58.859> pop<00:00:59.640> down<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.320> cover<00:01:01.320> and

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
ahead and pop pop down the cover and

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.800 
ahead and pop pop down the cover and
just<00:01:02.609> right<00:01:02.879> here<00:01:03.350> you're<00:01:04.350> going<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.559> push<00:01:04.739> in

up<00:01:15.210> with<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> mess<00:01:16.259> on<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.470> ground<00:01:17.060> and<00:01:18.060> then

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
up with a mess on the ground and then

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.850 
up with a mess on the ground and then
this<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.570> what<00:01:18.750> we're<00:01:18.900> looking<00:01:18.930> for<00:01:19.530> right

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
this is what we're looking for right

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.260 
this is what we're looking for right
here<00:01:21.049> now<00:01:22.049> once<00:01:22.290> again<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.860> on<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.270> 2004

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270

here now once again this is on a 2004
Ford<00:01:24.960> Expedition<00:01:25.939> the<00:01:26.939> clip<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.210> we<00:01:27.390> have

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
Ford Expedition the clip that we have

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.440 
Ford Expedition the clip that we have
there<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.799> just<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.670> little<00:01:29.909> piece<00:01:30.090> underneath

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
there is just a little piece underneath

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.840 
there is just a little piece underneath
you're<00:01:30.750> going<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.960> push<00:01:31.350> in<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.799> then<00:01:32.610> just

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
you're going to push in and then just

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.700 
you're going to push in and then just
wiggle<00:01:35.869> and<00:01:36.869> it's<00:01:37.079> just<00:01:37.320> going<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.530> come<00:01:37.680> right

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
wiggle and it's just going to come right

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.520 
wiggle and it's just going to come right
out<00:01:38.659> there<00:01:39.659> we<00:01:39.810> go

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
out there we go

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.450 
out there we go
now<00:01:41.270> once<00:01:42.270> we<00:01:42.420> get<00:01:42.570> there<00:01:42.890> there<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.070> going<00:01:44.340> to

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
now once we get there there is going to

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.580 
now once we get there there is going to
be<00:01:44.549> two<00:01:45.090> eight<00:01:45.810> millimeter<00:01:46.560> bolts<00:01:48.170> so<00:01:49.170> let's

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
be two eight millimeter bolts so let's

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.920 
be two eight millimeter bolts so let's
go<00:01:49.740> ahead<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.009> grab<00:01:50.189> this<00:01:52.220> we<00:01:53.220> have<00:01:53.399> our

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
go ahead and grab this we have our

go ahead and grab this we have our
quarter<00:01:54.930> inch<00:01:55.049> ratchet

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.620 

is<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.900> little<00:02:31.200> tight<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.620> get<00:02:31.770> back<00:02:32.010> there<00:02:32.630> just

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
is a little tight to get back there just

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:48.850 
is a little tight to get back there just
go<00:02:33.900> with<00:02:34.080> one<00:02:34.290> hand<00:02:46.370> all<00:02:47.370> right<00:02:47.610> there<00:02:47.850> we<00:02:47.940> go

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
go with one hand all right there we go

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.699 
go with one hand all right there we go
just<00:02:49.860> pull<00:02:50.070> this<00:02:50.250> out<00:02:51.320> and<00:02:54.410> there's<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.620> issue

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
just pull this out and there's the issue

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.760 
just pull this out and there's the issue
right<00:02:56.700> there<00:02:57.200> you<00:02:58.200> can<00:02:58.350> see<00:02:58.500> it's<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.680> little

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
right there you can see it's a little

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.979 
right there you can see it's a little
cracked<00:02:59.160> up<00:02:59.930> little<00:03:00.930> burnt<00:03:01.110> up<00:03:01.350> much<00:03:02.840> not<00:03:03.840> as

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
cracked up little burnt up much not as

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.449 
cracked up little burnt up much not as
bad<00:03:04.170> as<00:03:04.350> I've<00:03:04.500> seen<00:03:04.739> before

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
bad as I've seen before

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.360 
bad as I've seen before
but<00:03:06.269> uh<00:03:06.299> that<00:03:06.930> that's<00:03:07.260> what<00:03:07.560> tends<00:03:07.830> to<00:03:08.040> go<00:03:08.190> out

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
but uh that that's what tends to go out

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.120 
but uh that that's what tends to go out
so<00:03:08.760> I<00:03:09.350> what<00:03:10.350> I<00:03:10.380> was<00:03:10.709> having<00:03:11.130> issue<00:03:11.400> eyes<00:03:12.799> was<00:03:13.799> I

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
so I what I was having issue eyes was I

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.910 
so I what I was having issue eyes was I
would<00:03:14.370> have<00:03:14.549> speed<00:03:14.910> four<00:03:15.320> but<00:03:16.320> not<00:03:16.470> speed

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
would have speed four but not speed

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.710 
would have speed four but not speed
three<00:03:17.489> two<00:03:17.880> or<00:03:18.090> one

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
three two or one

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.890 
three two or one
so<00:03:19.230> obviously<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:19.950> resistor<00:03:20.430> fried<00:03:20.700> out<00:03:20.900> in

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
so obviously the resistor fried out in

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.009 
so obviously the resistor fried out in
that<00:03:22.170> specific<00:03:22.709> part<00:03:22.890> so<00:03:23.190> luckily<00:03:23.989> the<00:03:24.989> new

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
that specific part so luckily the new

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.680 
that specific part so luckily the new
resistor<00:03:25.680> does<00:03:26.519> come<00:03:26.730> with<00:03:26.850> a<00:03:26.910> new<00:03:27.120> foam<00:03:27.360> guard

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
resistor does come with a new foam guard

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.270 
resistor does come with a new foam guard
on<00:03:27.870> it<00:03:27.900> or<00:03:28.290> seal<00:03:28.860> excuse<00:03:29.580> me<00:03:31.070> just<00:03:32.070> go<00:03:32.220> ahead

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
on it or seal excuse me just go ahead

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.830 
on it or seal excuse me just go ahead
and<00:03:32.519> take<00:03:32.700> that<00:03:33.560> pop<00:03:34.560> it<00:03:34.799> right<00:03:34.830> back<00:03:35.250> in

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
and take that pop it right back in

00:03:35.840 --> 00:04:34.249 
and take that pop it right back in
direct<00:03:36.840> replacement

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:36.659 

so<00:04:35.259> we're<00:04:35.470> almost<00:04:35.590> done<00:04:36.009> with<00:04:36.160> this<00:04:36.340> part

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
so we're almost done with this part

00:04:36.669 --> 00:05:04.370 
so we're almost done with this part
right<00:04:36.880> here<00:04:51.570> nice<00:04:52.570> and<00:04:52.780> tight<00:04:52.990> on<00:04:59.699> the<00:05:00.699> side

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:25.230 

pop<00:05:05.380> our<00:05:05.620> plug<00:05:05.919> back<00:05:06.099> in<00:05:14.220> there<00:05:15.220> we<00:05:15.340> go

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.390 

I<00:05:27.690> hope<00:05:28.690> you<00:05:28.840> find<00:05:28.990> this<00:05:29.199> pretty<00:05:29.470> easy<00:05:29.770> it's<00:05:30.190> a

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
I hope you find this pretty easy it's a

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.029 
I hope you find this pretty easy it's a
five<00:05:30.819> minutes<00:05:31.240> 30<00:05:31.539> seconds<00:05:32.080> all<00:05:32.349> said<00:05:32.919> and

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 
five minutes 30 seconds all said and

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:34.529 
five minutes 30 seconds all said and
done<00:05:33.130> that's<00:05:33.729> with<00:05:33.970> one<00:05:34.090> hand

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:34.539 
done that's with one hand

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:37.169 
done that's with one hand
have<00:05:34.750> a<00:05:34.780> great<00:05:35.020> day
