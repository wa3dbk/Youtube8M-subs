00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.490
 Hello 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:15.840
 and today how is the beautiful mass niece 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:18.480
 this planet so strange 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.900
 because so many dishes and they make us 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.900
 three alone 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.210
 is that we are traveling with priscilla and 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.509
 also because they are traveling with 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.509
 possible 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.350
 here 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.980
 the night 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.309
 today 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.610
 I'm very happy with the language 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.980
 still but well missing a bit the 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.780
 aspect more than anything believe that they are here 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.580
 neither create if the truth is that I 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.830
 I can not believe it either if it's a 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.810
 blessing this trip not justly 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.729
 I was just what I was counting because 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.830
 four business came together the 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.500
 eight had to be business and 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.450
 We took advantage of 200 Germanic suggested 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.530
 that we all come together so we can 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.530
 strengthen our relationship 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.840
 cities when you go cities do not 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.840
 many cities 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.610
 sorry, but it's not what I 'm thinking 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.550
 do not 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.340
 difficult, we met a little while ago 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.820
 we beat it ever again 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.380
 to you if you are boyfriends and if you want 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.030
 get married and they want us to live all 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:57.590
 together as a big family so 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:02:00.010
 I calculate that to be because I am going to eat 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.010
 chicken 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:16.340
 torrico dies as rich 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.340
 its effect will be good 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.600
 [Music] 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.609
 no Please 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:03:00.110
 [Music] 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.540
 to 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:10.680
 lost to nowhere 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.680
 [Music] 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.100
 no subtle name to look for 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.200
 and we believe that everything is forgotten 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.569
 [Music] 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.569
 the blues canada 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.470
 against 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.950
 strong 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.349
 [Music] 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:45.620
 I do not remember 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.110
 what will it be 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:58.380
 you'll see that something of him 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.960
 it makes environmental sense 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:13.710
 and something about him 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.870
 it makes sense 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.870
 30 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.350
 [Music] 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.680
 all right 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.860
 we have so many activities with 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.010
 the girls that is good I also a 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.010
 day
