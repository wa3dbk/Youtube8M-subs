 this person will demonstrate is to have a 

00:00:05.709 --> 00:00:11.260
 cauliflower soup as I do this is 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.390
 ideal for then now that the habit 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.010
 we are already in Holy Week Lent for 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.020
 when they want to do it and this we're going 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:21.280
 to occupy I have a cauliflower here 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:23.220
 small game if more or less this already 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:28.400
 It is like you 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:31.770
 to battle and I have a big tomato 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.750
 you can see it here it's cut in 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.820
 four and one small in half I have a 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.850
 chile serrano which is also large 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.829
 split to half a hundred advanced to 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.809
 onion and one and almost a small square of 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.839
 chicken broth powder in pasta more 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:54.329
 well that 's zero and we're going to liquefy everything 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:55.829
 what is this obviously we are going to 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.100
 put something 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.570
 and we are going to clean it well and also if 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.929
 the leg salt then we're going to 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.570
 put salt here nothing else I have a one 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:10.049
 ollita one I go there to this one like a little 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.299
 heated oil and that is at the same time 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.420
 salsa body see it there and I will 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.580
 remove the weight and here grass I'm going to 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.340
 put what is support because the cauliflower 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:25.979
 Well, this is not very hard so, 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:29.030
 may be sooner ok for the sauce 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.420
 If I get more or less 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.610
 equipment and also depends on such 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.500
 thing they want 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.909
 and also if you do not want to make it spicy 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.880
 do not put you can omit the 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.969
 ok so I'm going to add it more or less 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.750
 because if I still do not want it when 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:52.060
 highlighted 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:58.590
 this, as I say, is up to you 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.590
 and how much grace and now I'm going to try 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.660
 if you see that it is perfect if it stings a 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.180
 I'm going to cover it and let it boil 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:10.229
 we are going to add the cauliflower 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.060
 my sauce is already boiling and it's here 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.300
 you can only taste it of salt if you 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.510
 is missing or something 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.970
 they have arrived to me I say that the Canary Islands is a 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.000
 your taste we are going to put the collection to 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:28.010
 I do not like him to be either 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.750
 both so bald but that's already 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.480
 it's a matter of taste 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.660
 and l'aquila I'm going to leave and I'm going to 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.660
 cover 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.440
 as for others 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:47.069
 10 15 minutes being half slow more 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.760
 well slower than medium 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:53.099
 whether you've visited the water the 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.660
 texture that you want to see imitates 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.150
 the samples 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.650
 and that's how my cauliflower soup looked 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.060
 the very own is a little bit 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.380
 ideal picosita 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.630
 and makes short 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.310
 If I like it and for me, as I say everything 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.710
 depends and there is the rest of the 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.210
 been and I hope you do for this 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:16.850
