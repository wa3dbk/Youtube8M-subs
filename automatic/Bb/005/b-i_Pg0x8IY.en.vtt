00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.130
 unfortunately and we unfortunately underline the 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.159
 presence of two bugs 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.590
 if microsoft has fixed the bug that 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.439
 prevented users from using certain 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.820
 unfortunately cortana moments introduced 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.400
 two new problems 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.979
 the first concerns the impossibility of 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.530

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.520
 start menu by left click of 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.840
 mouse 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.840
 then to launch an application 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.930
 you will have to run it as an administrator 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.930
 this speech is rightly not valid 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.840
 for apps outside the start bar e 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.000
 the presence of double directories for 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.520
 so regarding the main ones then 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.920
 documents download video images e 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.630

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:16.160
