00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
those kind of things and then you still

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.789 
those kind of things and then you still
gap<00:00:49.039> control<00:00:49.460> on<00:00:49.609> because<00:00:50.089> you<00:00:51.050> know<00:00:51.170> cover<00:00:51.409> 3s

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:51.799 
gap control on because you know cover 3s

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:55.420 
gap control on because you know cover 3s
cover<00:00:52.040> three<00:00:52.399> on<00:00:52.549> tues<00:00:52.850> too<00:00:53.379> so<00:00:54.399> there<00:00:55.399> are
