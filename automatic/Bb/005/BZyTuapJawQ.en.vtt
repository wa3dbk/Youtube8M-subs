American law wife Deborah and we started
in<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.070> very<00:00:53.280> small<00:00:53.640> scale<00:00:55.340> that's<00:00:56.340> for<00:00:56.520> tree

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
in a very small scale that's for tree

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.849 
in a very small scale that's for tree
farms<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.480> at<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:57.960> point<00:00:58.379> in<00:00:58.469> time<00:00:58.500> it

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
farms and at that point in time it

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.779

wasn't<00:00:59.270> called<00:01:00.270> us<00:01:00.480> from<00:01:00.690> tree<00:01:00.840> farms<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.350> was

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
wasn't called us from tree farms it was

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.770 
wasn't called us from tree farms it was
it<00:01:02.789> was<00:01:02.879> just<00:01:03.000> basically<00:01:04.100> an<00:01:05.510> anticipation<00:01:06.510> of

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
it was just basically an anticipation of

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.420

a<00:01:06.840> tree<00:01:07.110> farm<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.500> guess<00:01:07.680> because<00:01:07.890> we<00:01:08.189> really

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
15 years ago we thought that there was a

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.939 
15 years ago we thought that there was a
need<00:04:48.720> for<00:04:50.509> shrubbery<00:04:51.509> in<00:04:51.930> the<00:04:52.169> southern

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
need for shrubbery in the southern

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:58.820 
need for shrubbery in the southern
Michigan<00:04:53.490> northern<00:04:54.240> Ohio<00:04:56.270> area<00:04:57.270> and<00:04:57.599> we<00:04:58.560> had<00:04:58.800> a

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
Michigan northern Ohio area and we had a

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.050 
Michigan northern Ohio area and we had a
lot<00:04:59.099> of<00:04:59.130> good<00:05:00.000> plant<00:05:00.330> stock<00:05:00.660> that<00:05:01.229> was<00:05:02.060> could

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
lot of good plant stock that was could

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.790 
lot of good plant stock that was could
be<00:05:03.210> used<00:05:03.419> for<00:05:03.570> shrubbery<00:05:04.080> and<00:05:04.229> so<00:05:04.470> we've

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
be used for shrubbery and so we've

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:11.150 
be used for shrubbery and so we've
gradually<00:05:05.370> 15<00:05:05.970> years<00:05:06.150> ago<00:05:08.150> came<00:05:09.150> in<00:05:10.099> part<00:05:11.099> of

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
gradually 15 years ago came in part of

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.610 
gradually 15 years ago came in part of
our<00:05:11.250> resources<00:05:11.789> and<00:05:12.020> hadn't<00:05:13.020> directed<00:05:13.470> than

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
our resources and hadn't directed than

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.279 
our resources and hadn't directed than
for<00:05:13.979> the<00:05:14.070> shrubbery<00:05:14.430> and<00:05:14.820> I<00:05:15.300> think<00:05:15.630> today<00:05:16.020> I

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
for the shrubbery and I think today I

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:19.100 
for the shrubbery and I think today I
was<00:05:16.590> 15<00:05:17.009> percent<00:05:17.490> of<00:05:17.610> what<00:05:17.820> we<00:05:18.000> do<00:05:18.210> and<00:05:18.690> that's

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
was 15 percent of what we do and that's

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.510 
was 15 percent of what we do and that's
what<00:05:19.410> maybe<00:05:19.590> even<00:05:19.889> a<00:05:19.919> little<00:05:20.009> more<00:05:20.280> at<00:05:20.370> this

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
what maybe even a little more at this

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.870 
what maybe even a little more at this
point<00:05:20.639> is<00:05:21.270> shrubbery<00:05:22.139> orientated<00:05:23.130> and<00:05:23.639> we

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
point is shrubbery orientated and we

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.110 
point is shrubbery orientated and we
kind<00:05:24.060> of<00:05:24.120> like<00:05:24.240> that<00:05:24.449> it<00:05:24.659> gives<00:05:25.199> us<00:05:25.470> a<00:05:26.120> spring

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
kind of like that it gives us a spring

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.899 
kind of like that it gives us a spring
time<00:05:27.570> activity<00:05:28.169> in<00:05:28.320> springtime<00:05:28.800> harvest<00:05:29.400> kind

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:29.909 
time activity in springtime harvest kind

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:31.730 
time activity in springtime harvest kind
of<00:05:30.000> spreads<00:05:30.389> the<00:05:30.539> harvest<00:05:30.900> over<00:05:31.229> of<00:05:31.320> the<00:05:31.440> year

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
of spreads the harvest over of the year

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.469 
of spreads the harvest over of the year
and<00:05:31.919> and<00:05:32.130> then<00:05:32.639> it's<00:05:32.849> been<00:05:33.000> something<00:05:33.240> that's

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 
and and then it's been something that's

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:36.050 
and and then it's been something that's
the<00:05:33.720> new<00:05:33.900> and<00:05:34.139> exciting<00:05:34.229> and<00:05:34.830> it<00:05:35.550> seems<00:05:35.820> like
