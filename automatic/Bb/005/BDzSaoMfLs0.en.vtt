00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
it may be a little bit more but with the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:26.650 
it may be a little bit more but with the
quite<00:01:16.010> load<00:01:17.110> more<00:01:18.340> power<00:01:25.180> they<00:01:26.180> have<00:01:26.330> the<00:01:26.480> same

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
quite load more power they have the same

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.510 
quite load more power they have the same
deep<00:01:26.930> pow<00:01:27.140> right<00:01:27.410> you<00:01:27.740> think<00:01:27.950> to<00:01:28.100> show<00:01:28.280> you<00:01:28.340> so
