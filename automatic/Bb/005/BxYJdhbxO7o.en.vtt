mounted<00:00:22.760> at<00:00:23.760> an<00:00:24.000> angle<00:00:24.390> so<00:00:24.720> he<00:00:24.869> just<00:00:25.080> pulled<00:00:25.350> it

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
mounted at an angle so he just pulled it

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.700 
mounted at an angle so he just pulled it
momentarily<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.609> noticed<00:00:27.359> I'm<00:00:28.050> right<00:00:28.500> behind

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
momentarily I noticed I'm right behind

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.730 
momentarily I noticed I'm right behind
Douglas<00:00:29.460> I'm<00:00:29.609> getting<00:00:29.849> closer<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.689> closer<00:00:31.170> in

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
Douglas I'm getting closer and closer in

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.910 
Douglas I'm getting closer and closer in
his<00:00:32.189> draft<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.570> can<00:00:33.899> go<00:00:34.050> faster<00:00:34.590> than<00:00:34.739> he<00:00:34.890> can

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
his draft so I can go faster than he can

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.160 
his draft so I can go faster than he can
because<00:00:35.610> he's<00:00:35.910> breaking<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.329> wind<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:36.930> here<00:00:37.140> I

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
because he's breaking the wind so here I

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.920 
because he's breaking the wind so here I
go<00:00:37.320> past<00:00:37.620> him<00:00:37.890> down<00:00:38.610> into<00:00:38.850> turn<00:00:39.180> one<00:00:39.510> breaking

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
go past him down into turn one breaking

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
go past him down into turn one breaking
hard<00:00:40.379> get<00:00:41.370> around<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.910> turn<00:00:42.559> little<00:00:43.559> Wiggly

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
hard get around the turn little Wiggly

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.440 
hard get around the turn little Wiggly
but<00:00:44.910> he's<00:00:45.570> he's<00:00:46.410> behind<00:00:46.800> me<00:00:47.039> now<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:48.090> very

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
but he's he's behind me now it's very

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.400 
but he's he's behind me now it's very
hard<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.930> cast<00:00:49.579> into<00:00:50.579> twisty<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:51.300> so<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:52.050> don't

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
hard to cast into twisty this so I don't

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.680 
hard to cast into twisty this so I don't
think<00:00:52.800> he's<00:00:53.010> even<00:00:53.160> got<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.489> try<00:00:53.789> this<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.390> full

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
think he's even got to try this is full

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.110 
think he's even got to try this is full
throttle<00:00:55.260> turn<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.610> NASCAR<00:00:57.239> turn<00:00:59.120> short

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
throttle turn in the NASCAR turn short

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.630 
throttle turn in the NASCAR turn short
straight<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.930> brake<00:01:01.170> hard<00:01:01.620> this<00:01:02.010> next<00:01:02.280> turn

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
straight and brake hard this next turn

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.509 
straight and brake hard this next turn
it's<00:01:03.629> difficult<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.439> more<00:01:04.830> than<00:01:05.070> 90<00:01:05.369> degrees

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
it's difficult it's more than 90 degrees

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.730 
it's difficult it's more than 90 degrees
then<00:01:06.710> immediately<00:01:07.710> back<00:01:08.040> into<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.400> left<00:01:08.729> and

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
then immediately back into a left and

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.500 
then immediately back into a left and
you<00:01:10.740> need<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.220> get<00:01:11.430> all<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.880> momentum<00:01:12.180> you

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
you need to get all the momentum you

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.840 
you need to get all the momentum you
come<00:01:12.840> through<00:01:13.350> here<00:01:13.770> because<00:01:14.159> now<00:01:14.369> there's<00:01:14.760> a

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
come through here because now there's a

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.640 
come through here because now there's a
long<00:01:15.780> full<00:01:16.380> throttle<00:01:16.979> uphill<00:01:18.380> this<00:01:19.380> like<00:01:19.619> a

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
long full throttle uphill this like a

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.499 
long full throttle uphill this like a
probably<00:01:20.040> gets<00:01:20.280> for<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.580> faster<00:01:21.060> just<00:01:21.270> went

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
probably gets for the faster just went

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.969 
probably gets for the faster just went
in<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.780> top<00:01:22.049> here<00:01:23.240> there's<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.360> straight<00:01:24.979> bit

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
in the top here there's a straight bit

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.420 
in the top here there's a straight bit
here<00:01:26.400> for<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.729> while<00:01:26.909> we're<00:01:27.720> much<00:01:28.590> faster<00:01:29.130> cars

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
here for a while we're much faster cars

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.910 
here for a while we're much faster cars
can<00:01:29.820> pass<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.420> but<00:01:30.780> that's<00:01:31.200> still<00:01:31.619> stuck

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
can pass you but that's still stuck

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.749 
can pass you but that's still stuck
behind<00:01:32.189> then<00:01:32.640> into<00:01:33.420> these<00:01:33.600> esas<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.560> just

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
behind then into these esas and just

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.270 
behind then into these esas and just
flow<00:01:35.759> smoothly<00:01:36.420> through<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.350> just<00:01:37.439> touch<00:01:38.009> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
flow smoothly through and just touch the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.109 
flow smoothly through and just touch the
effects<00:01:38.759> in<00:01:39.030> each<00:01:39.270> one<00:01:40.369> here's<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.460> last<00:01:41.820> of

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
effects in each one here's the last of

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.999 
effects in each one here's the last of
those<00:01:42.270> essence<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.899> now<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.290> turn<00:01:43.680> is

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
those essence and now this turn is

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.280 
those essence and now this turn is
really<00:01:44.850> tough<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.299> go<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.630> through<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.840> flat

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
really tough you go it through a flat

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.670 
really tough you go it through a flat
out<00:01:46.530> on<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.610> foot<00:01:48.060> on<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.299> floor<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:49.320> can<00:01:49.530> get

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
out on the foot on the floor you can get

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.410 
out on the foot on the floor you can get
through<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.159> but<00:01:50.340> it's<00:01:50.520> scary<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:51.240> don't

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
through it but it's scary you don't

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.679 
through it but it's scary you don't
think<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:52.049> can<00:01:52.290> okay<00:01:53.189> every<00:01:53.759> break<00:01:54.000> in<00:01:54.210> here

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
think you can okay every break in here

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.490 
think you can okay every break in here
into<00:01:55.590> oak<00:01:55.950> tree<00:01:56.399> turn<00:01:56.729> slowest<00:01:57.509> slowest<00:01:58.290> turn

on<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.770> course<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.820> can<00:02:00.000> see<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.299> oak<00:02:00.390> tree

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
on the course you can see the oak tree

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.219 
on the course you can see the oak tree
just<00:02:01.380> playing<00:02:01.590> around<00:02:01.880> okay<00:02:02.880> now<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.200> the

cones you see passing on the right side
are<00:05:08.570> to<00:05:08.690> block<00:05:08.990> off<00:05:09.260> an<00:05:10.270> alternative<00:05:11.270> shorter

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
are to block off an alternative shorter

through here the fact so rate hard this

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.900 
through here the fact so rate hard this
is<00:05:29.090> down<00:05:29.300> into<00:05:29.690> the<00:05:29.810> hog<00:05:30.020> pen<00:05:30.410> very<00:05:31.280> crucial

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
is down into the hog pen very crucial

is down into the hog pen very crucial
turner<00:05:32.240> I<00:05:33.220> really<00:05:34.450> need<00:05:35.450> more<00:05:35.690> practice<00:05:36.260> on

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
turner I really need more practice on
