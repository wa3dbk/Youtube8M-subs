dark<00:02:20.180> skinned<00:02:20.510> either<00:02:20.780> I'm<00:02:21.080> more<00:02:21.380> medium

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
dark skinned either I'm more medium

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.810 
dark skinned either I'm more medium
toned<00:02:22.960> but<00:02:23.960> i<00:02:23.990> chose<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.770> dark<00:02:25.370> yellow

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
toned but i chose the dark yellow

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.360 
toned but i chose the dark yellow
because<00:02:26.690> if<00:02:27.020> i<00:02:27.320> were<00:02:27.560> to<00:02:27.740> because<00:02:28.130> I<00:02:28.160> thought

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
because if i were to because I thought

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.470 
because if i were to because I thought
about<00:02:28.550> it<00:02:28.700> and<00:02:29.030> if<00:02:29.810> i<00:02:30.020> were<00:02:30.260> to<00:02:31.330> supplement<00:02:32.330> a

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
about it and if i were to supplement a

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.150 
about it and if i were to supplement a
moisturizer<00:02:33.110> into<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:33.980> mixture<00:02:34.280> then<00:02:35.020> um<00:02:36.160> it

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
moisturizer into the mixture then um it

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.980 
moisturizer into the mixture then um it
would<00:02:37.340> only<00:02:37.520> get<00:02:37.850> lighter<00:02:38.210> so<00:02:38.570> it<00:02:38.600> makes<00:02:38.840> sense

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
would only get lighter so it makes sense

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.960 
would only get lighter so it makes sense
to<00:02:39.260> get<00:02:39.500> actually<00:02:39.890> a<00:02:39.920> shade<00:02:40.190> that<00:02:40.220> is<00:02:40.430> darker

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
to get actually a shade that is darker

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.000 
to get actually a shade that is darker
for<00:02:41.180> you<00:02:41.270> whereas<00:02:41.900> if<00:02:42.140> i<00:02:42.320> bought<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.800> light

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
for you whereas if i bought the light

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.580 
for you whereas if i bought the light
yellow<00:02:43.460> and<00:02:43.700> it<00:02:44.090> was<00:02:44.420> too<00:02:44.630> light<00:02:44.840> for<00:02:44.870> me<00:02:45.080> there

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
yellow and it was too light for me there

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.810 
yellow and it was too light for me there
would<00:02:45.770> have<00:02:46.100> been<00:02:46.160> no<00:02:46.700> way<00:02:46.910> for<00:02:47.240> me<00:02:47.270> to<00:02:47.500> make

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
would have been no way for me to make

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.810 
would have been no way for me to make
the<00:02:50.950> formula<00:02:51.950> any<00:02:52.640> darker<00:02:53.210> to<00:02:53.480> fit<00:02:53.690> my<00:02:53.990> shade

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
the formula any darker to fit my shade

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.290 
the formula any darker to fit my shade
anyways<00:02:56.470> some<00:02:57.470> you<00:02:57.770> know<00:02:57.800> it<00:02:58.160> is<00:02:58.460> it<00:02:58.790> sounds

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
anyways some you know it is it sounds

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.930 
anyways some you know it is it sounds
like<00:02:59.540> a<00:02:59.600> downfall<00:03:00.280> actually<00:03:01.280> only<00:03:01.520> having

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
like a downfall actually only having

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.000 
like a downfall actually only having
four<00:03:02.180> shades<00:03:02.420> but<00:03:02.960> the<00:03:03.080> point<00:03:03.260> is<00:03:03.560> it's<00:03:03.830> it's

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
four shades but the point is it's it's

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.740 
four shades but the point is it's it's
called<00:03:04.310> a<00:03:04.430> colour<00:03:04.670> supplement<00:03:05.000> so<00:03:05.630> you're

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
called a colour supplement so you're

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:06.670 
called a colour supplement so you're
supposed<00:03:05.840> to<00:03:06.050> supplement<00:03:06.560> to<00:03:06.650> your

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
supposed to supplement to your

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.820 
supposed to supplement to your
moisturizer<00:03:07.370> that<00:03:07.550> you're<00:03:07.880> using<00:03:08.380> into<00:03:09.380> or

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
moisturizer that you're using into or

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.890 
moisturizer that you're using into or
mix<00:03:10.220> it<00:03:10.400> with<00:03:10.580> your<00:03:10.730> formula<00:03:11.300> or<00:03:11.510> it<00:03:11.660> makes<00:03:11.780> it

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
mix it with your formula or it makes it

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.590 
mix it with your formula or it makes it
with<00:03:12.020> your<00:03:12.430> colour<00:03:13.430> supplement<00:03:13.610> so<00:03:14.450> that

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
with your colour supplement so that

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.390 
with your colour supplement so that
becomes<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:14.960> right<00:03:15.080> color<00:03:15.320> for<00:03:15.440> you<00:03:15.770> and<00:03:16.040> so

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
becomes the right color for you and so

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.000 
becomes the right color for you and so
that<00:03:16.490> you<00:03:16.580> can<00:03:16.700> put<00:03:16.820> it<00:03:16.910> on<00:03:17.030> and<00:03:17.650> that's<00:03:18.650> kind

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
that you can put it on and that's kind

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.660 
that you can put it on and that's kind
of<00:03:19.220> um<00:03:20.440> it's<00:03:21.440> kind<00:03:21.740> of<00:03:21.800> time<00:03:22.070> consuming

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
of um it's kind of time consuming

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.730 
of um it's kind of time consuming
actually<00:03:23.090> if<00:03:23.180> you<00:03:23.270> think<00:03:23.300> about<00:03:23.540> it<00:03:23.720> um<00:03:24.680> I

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:24.740 
actually if you think about it um I

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.340 
actually if you think about it um I
don't<00:03:25.070> personally<00:03:25.520> do<00:03:26.090> that<00:03:26.270> or<00:03:26.450> I<00:03:26.720> do<00:03:26.780> do<00:03:27.200> it

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
don't personally do that or I do do it

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.460 
don't personally do that or I do do it
but<00:03:28.010> um<00:03:28.459> i<00:03:28.550> really<00:03:28.790> don't<00:03:29.180> mix<00:03:29.780> it<00:03:29.959> together<00:03:30.110> on

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
but um i really don't mix it together on

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.510 
but um i really don't mix it together on
the<00:03:30.530> back<00:03:30.680> of<00:03:30.800> my<00:03:30.860> hand<00:03:31.100> or<00:03:31.160> anything<00:03:31.250> i<00:03:31.490> just

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
the back of my hand or anything i just

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.150 
the back of my hand or anything i just
put<00:03:31.790> my<00:03:31.940> fountain<00:03:32.300> my<00:03:32.570> moisturizer<00:03:33.500> on<00:03:33.680> and

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
put my fountain my moisturizer on and

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.910 
put my fountain my moisturizer on and
then<00:03:34.490> I<00:03:34.520> just<00:03:34.670> put<00:03:34.880> a<00:03:35.060> little<00:03:35.150> bit<00:03:35.620> on<00:03:36.620> my

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
then I just put a little bit on my

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.500 
then I just put a little bit on my
fingertips<00:03:37.459> and<00:03:37.610> I<00:03:37.700> just<00:03:37.880> thought<00:03:38.060> it<00:03:38.300> in<00:03:38.420> the

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
fingertips and I just thought it in the

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.120 
fingertips and I just thought it in the
places<00:03:38.810> I<00:03:38.930> don't<00:03:39.020> want<00:03:39.260> it<00:03:39.410> and<00:03:39.530> then<00:03:39.680> I<00:03:39.709> mix<00:03:40.010> it

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
places I don't want it and then I mix it

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.150 
places I don't want it and then I mix it
in<00:03:40.280> while<00:03:40.489> my<00:03:40.730> moisturizer<00:03:41.300> is<00:03:41.690> still<00:03:42.020> um<00:03:42.350> you

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
in while my moisturizer is still um you

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.010 
in while my moisturizer is still um you
know<00:03:43.280> soaking<00:03:43.610> into<00:03:43.880> my<00:03:44.120> skin<00:03:44.480> so<00:03:44.720> that's<00:03:44.870> how

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
know soaking into my skin so that's how

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.830 
know soaking into my skin so that's how
I<00:03:45.080> do<00:03:45.260> it<00:03:45.440> but<00:03:46.100> I<00:03:46.130> don't<00:03:46.310> actually<00:03:46.640> mix<00:03:47.330> it<00:03:47.600> so

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
I do it but I don't actually mix it so

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.110 
I do it but I don't actually mix it so
that<00:03:47.989> becomes<00:03:48.410> the<00:03:48.650> right<00:03:48.830> color<00:03:49.310> for<00:03:49.430> me<00:03:49.790> just

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
that becomes the right color for me just

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.260 
that becomes the right color for me just
because<00:03:50.180> I<00:03:50.720> don't<00:03:51.470> really<00:03:51.680> see<00:03:51.800> a<00:03:51.950> difference

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
because I don't really see a difference

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.100 
because I don't really see a difference
um<00:03:53.800> but<00:03:54.800> the<00:03:55.520> reason<00:03:55.670> why<00:03:55.880> I<00:03:55.940> call<00:03:56.300> it<00:03:56.720> a

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
um but the reason why I call it a

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.650 
um but the reason why I call it a
foundation<00:03:57.800> and<00:03:57.950> concealer<00:03:58.280> in<00:03:59.120> one<00:03:59.420> is

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
foundation and concealer in one is

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:07.290 
foundation and concealer in one is
because<00:04:00.110> the<00:04:00.560> consistency<00:04:01.370> of<00:04:01.400> it<00:04:02.020> alone<00:04:05.620> is

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
because the consistency of it alone is

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.880 
because the consistency of it alone is
actually<00:04:08.300> um<00:04:09.040> quite<00:04:10.040> thick<00:04:11.470> it's<00:04:12.470> kind<00:04:12.770> of

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
actually um quite thick it's kind of

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.080 
actually um quite thick it's kind of
like<00:04:13.100> um<00:04:14.380> it's<00:04:15.380> kind<00:04:15.560> of<00:04:15.590> like<00:04:15.709> yogurt<00:04:16.190> it's

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
like um it's kind of like yogurt it's

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.349 
like um it's kind of like yogurt it's
not<00:04:17.270> like<00:04:17.480> sheer<00:04:18.049> like<00:04:18.530> NARS<00:04:19.400> sheer<00:04:19.549> glow<00:04:19.970> or

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
not like sheer like NARS sheer glow or

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.180 
not like sheer like NARS sheer glow or
anything<00:04:20.660> like<00:04:20.690> that<00:04:20.810> it's<00:04:21.049> not<00:04:21.200> sheer<00:04:21.620> it's

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
anything like that it's not sheer it's

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.890 
anything like that it's not sheer it's
it's<00:04:22.460> kind<00:04:22.610> of<00:04:22.790> thick<00:04:23.150> it's<00:04:23.420> thick<00:04:23.630> enough<00:04:23.660> to

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
it's kind of thick it's thick enough to

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.140

anywhere where I had a lot of
discoloration<00:04:30.890> or<00:04:31.370> darkness<00:04:31.760> and<00:04:32.210> it<00:04:32.780> worked

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
discoloration or darkness and it worked

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.620 
discoloration or darkness and it worked
it's<00:04:33.500> worked<00:04:33.740> okay<00:04:34.010> you<00:04:34.340> know<00:04:34.460> I<00:04:34.970> haven't<00:04:35.450> used

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
it's worked okay you know I haven't used

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.470 
it's worked okay you know I haven't used
very<00:04:35.930> many<00:04:36.430> concealers<00:04:37.430> in<00:04:37.640> my<00:04:37.760> lifetime<00:04:38.000> so<00:04:38.450> I

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
very many concealers in my lifetime so I

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.480 
very many concealers in my lifetime so I
can't<00:04:38.720> really<00:04:38.870> compare<00:04:39.260> it<00:04:39.350> to<00:04:39.470> anything<00:04:39.740> but

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
can't really compare it to anything but

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.760 
can't really compare it to anything but
it<00:04:40.940> works<00:04:41.180> okay<00:04:41.600> and<00:04:41.930> I<00:04:42.080> don't<00:04:42.290> have<00:04:42.470> anything

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770

anyways um let's see what else did I

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.570 
anyways um let's see what else did I
have<00:05:07.850> to<00:05:08.000> um<00:05:08.240> yeah<00:05:09.050> so<00:05:09.290> it's<00:05:09.710> it's<00:05:10.010> very<00:05:10.310> thick

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
have to um yeah so it's it's very thick

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.430 
have to um yeah so it's it's very thick
formula<00:05:11.210> um<00:05:12.250> and<00:05:13.540> if<00:05:14.540> I<00:05:14.930> had<00:05:15.200> to<00:05:15.410> choose

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
formula um and if I had to choose

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.280 
formula um and if I had to choose
whether<00:05:15.980> it<00:05:16.160> was<00:05:16.310> Dewey<00:05:16.640> or<00:05:16.910> Matt<00:05:17.300> it's<00:05:17.960> a<00:05:18.080> lot

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
whether it was Dewey or Matt it's a lot

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.220 
whether it was Dewey or Matt it's a lot
more<00:05:18.320> dewy<00:05:18.920> than<00:05:19.220> it<00:05:19.340> is<00:05:19.460> Matt<00:05:19.790> but<00:05:20.720> it's<00:05:20.960> not

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230 
more dewy than it is Matt but it's not

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.890 
more dewy than it is Matt but it's not
like<00:05:21.410> extremely<00:05:22.010> Dewey<00:05:22.460> or<00:05:22.820> shiny<00:05:23.180> it's<00:05:23.570> just

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
like extremely Dewey or shiny it's just

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.260 
like extremely Dewey or shiny it's just
in<00:05:24.260> the<00:05:24.320> middle<00:05:25.010> I<00:05:25.340> wouldn't<00:05:25.850> say<00:05:26.000> that<00:05:26.030> it's

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
in the middle I wouldn't say that it's

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.950 
in the middle I wouldn't say that it's
really<00:05:26.390> Matt<00:05:26.810> either<00:05:27.169> um<00:05:27.560> but<00:05:28.430> when<00:05:29.240> I<00:05:29.270> do<00:05:29.419> wear

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
really Matt either um but when I do wear

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.400 
really Matt either um but when I do wear
it<00:05:30.080> alone<00:05:30.200> and<00:05:30.710> without<00:05:30.800> a<00:05:31.010> moisturizer<00:05:31.700> I

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
it alone and without a moisturizer I

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.409 
it alone and without a moisturizer I
find<00:05:33.410> that<00:05:33.680> it's<00:05:33.919> very<00:05:34.190> very<00:05:34.640> thick<00:05:35.030> and<00:05:35.210> it

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
find that it's very very thick and it

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:38.920 
find that it's very very thick and it
doesn't<00:05:35.780> like<00:05:36.310> you<00:05:37.310> know<00:05:37.430> the<00:05:38.330> feeling<00:05:38.780> of

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
doesn't like you know the feeling of

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.720 
doesn't like you know the feeling of
this<00:05:39.110> the<00:05:39.320> stickiness<00:05:39.860> doesn't<00:05:40.340> really<00:05:40.490> go

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:40.730 
this the stickiness doesn't really go

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.820 
this the stickiness doesn't really go
away<00:05:40.760> when<00:05:41.390> it<00:05:41.510> is<00:05:41.870> when<00:05:42.080> I<00:05:42.110> where<00:05:42.320> the<00:05:42.440> formula

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
away when it is when I where the formula

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.340 
away when it is when I where the formula
alone<00:05:43.220> but<00:05:43.700> when<00:05:43.850> I<00:05:43.940> do<00:05:44.000> wear<00:05:44.270> and<00:05:44.540> mix<00:05:45.020> it<00:05:45.169> in

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.350 
alone but when I do wear and mix it in

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.920 
alone but when I do wear and mix it in
with<00:05:45.380> my<00:05:45.650> moisturizer<00:05:46.280> it<00:05:47.030> does<00:05:47.960> um<00:05:49.630> it<00:05:50.630> does

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
with my moisturizer it does um it does

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:57.670 
with my moisturizer it does um it does
feel<00:05:51.320> a<00:05:51.350> lot<00:05:51.680> lighter<00:05:51.860> on<00:05:52.130> my<00:05:52.160> skin<00:05:52.730> um<00:05:55.870> so<00:05:56.870> yeah

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
feel a lot lighter on my skin um so yeah

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.530 
feel a lot lighter on my skin um so yeah
I<00:05:58.010> think<00:05:58.160> that's<00:05:58.460> all<00:05:58.550> I<00:05:58.669> really<00:05:58.820> have<00:05:58.970> to<00:05:59.210> say

00:05:59.530 --> 00:05:59.540 
I think that's all I really have to say

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.470 
I think that's all I really have to say
about<00:05:59.660> it<00:05:59.860> overall<00:06:00.860> I<00:06:01.190> probably<00:06:01.580> would<00:06:02.240> not

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:02.480 
about it overall I probably would not

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.750 
about it overall I probably would not
purchase<00:06:02.900> it<00:06:03.290> again<00:06:03.680> I<00:06:03.890> don't<00:06:04.340> absolutely

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760 
purchase it again I don't absolutely

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.700 
purchase it again I don't absolutely
hate<00:06:05.360> it<00:06:05.419> but<00:06:05.780> I<00:06:05.870> do<00:06:05.930> have<00:06:06.110> to<00:06:06.169> say<00:06:06.260> it's<00:06:06.500> quite

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
hate it but I do have to say it's quite

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.920 
hate it but I do have to say it's quite
thick<00:06:07.070> um<00:06:07.430> but<00:06:08.360> that's<00:06:08.540> because<00:06:08.690> you're

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:08.930 
thick um but that's because you're

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.090 
thick um but that's because you're
supposed<00:06:09.140> to<00:06:09.200> mix<00:06:09.320> it<00:06:09.440> with<00:06:09.470> your<00:06:09.650> moisturizer

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.100 
supposed to mix it with your moisturizer

um anyways so you know like you can't
really<00:06:13.490> say<00:06:13.669> that<00:06:13.820> it's<00:06:13.970> thick<00:06:14.150> it<00:06:14.300> depends<00:06:14.690> on

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
really say that it's thick it depends on

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.870 
really say that it's thick it depends on
how<00:06:15.050> you<00:06:15.080> choose<00:06:15.290> to<00:06:15.590> use<00:06:15.740> a<00:06:15.860> product<00:06:16.160> but<00:06:16.820> i
