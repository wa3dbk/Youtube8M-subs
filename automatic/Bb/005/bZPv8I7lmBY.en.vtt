00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.519
 today I want to tell you about photo g 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.960
 cable with additional power loss 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:13.139
 in principle, it has already collected everything myself 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:18.449
 I will tell everything I collected in detail 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:21.240
 about this scheme, one can it 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.029
 found on the internet wrote here then with 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.859
 extra power on yanyk sat on 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.580
 google if you find in principle this 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:35.250
 scheme you know that we have here is the entrance 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:37.200
 micro usb micro usb on which 5 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:44.760
 contacts this is the one that is inserted into 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:46.980
 the phone that is here it is here with us 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:52.260
 plus clipped but i will call him 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:58.079
 in this case near the twist here he 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:02.340
 I markings on 4 and 5 contacts 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:06.390
 we have closed 5 pins this is a minus and 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.780
 legends how he better unfortunately me 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.040
 the focus is very bad and poorly visible but in 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.439
 general here it is jumper 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.460
 unfortunately ken thick wire did not find 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.619
 and nothing less at home here a 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:25.710
 touched nothing more just locked 4 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:27.290
 5 contact sandals we have everywhere mom then 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.520
 there is where to insert 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:37.100
 also flash drive mouse keyboard 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.100
 all other nonsense if you arrange 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:44.100
 contact input is the right one 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.210
 it we will have a minus which is soldered to 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.409
 minus 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.390
 on the battery that's from the white wire 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:55.670
 the next one goes this is our green which 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:01.200
 also comes from here next goes white 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:04.619
 here's a white green and the next wire is 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.130
 red that is plus which is also 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.130
 we buy 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.900
 which is also battling plus 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:18.660
 battery in principle the whole scheme is very 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.010
 simple 1 part of this was tormented not 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.790
 I worked plus 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.040
 not plus x minus he gnd was solder 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.150
 body is gloating 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.010
 I had to solder it solder and 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:37.860
 then everything earned you now want 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.790
 show it that everything works yes 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.180
 to show 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.870
 battery charging did it 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:50.400
 normal charge 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:53.070
 issued 42 volts 07 Empire does not issue 5 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.610
 volt in practice I checked 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.980
 With a multimeter, it produces 42 volts 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.300
 another tap with a regular lesbian 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.230
 from here we get here goes two 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.600
 wires and divide and here we are 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.730
 insert it here and the battery is charging 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.620
 Unfortunately there is no charge level indicator 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.510
 I think it will not be difficult 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.950
 define as a flash drive will not 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:20.970
 work or will scientists come on phone 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:25.890
 here it was all going for the phone 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:29.340
 philips 6500 w500 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:34.500
 here on this model it all works not 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:36.860
 I know how to connect on other models 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.860
 flash drive 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.720
 run o t r yu knocked down by an assistant 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.530
 when this usb device is connected 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.530

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:07.260
 contained within a flash drive that yuizbi 2 and 1 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:10.849
 gigabytes from her families 6 and here they are 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:14.670
 files contained on usb flash drives 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:19.729
 everything works through 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.729
 choose what 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.390

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:36.770

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:42.140
 the keyboard has not been shown to us lawsuit 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:45.110
 we claim unfortunately me not yusbi here 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:52.010
 Connect the keyboard Yusbi connector here 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:55.910
 keyboard so here you see I click 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:05:01.130
 Nasa is kind and everything is typed here 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:05.300
 also these numbers include numlock here they are 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:08.170
 the numbers also work all these upper 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:12.410
 the numbers press shift and we select 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:15.680

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:18.230
 skate there is a way out backspace unity what 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:21.680
 I still do not understand how to change the language, that is 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:24.620
 on the keyboard this is control alt I click 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.770
 but unfortunately the language does not change but I 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.620
 I also think that I pressed express 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:34.990
 erased from kei 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:37.630
