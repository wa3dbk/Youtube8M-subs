was barely I yeah I think that was a
collat<00:02:03.240> if<00:02:03.659> I'm<00:02:04.700> correct<00:02:05.960> but<00:02:06.960> that's<00:02:07.110> either

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
collat if I'm correct but that's either

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.080 
collat if I'm correct but that's either
five<00:02:07.560> or<00:02:07.590> six<00:02:07.920> people<00:02:08.069> in<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.489> kill<00:02:08.729> cam<00:02:08.910> it

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
five or six people in that kill cam it
