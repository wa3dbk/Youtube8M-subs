00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
hi Craig Patel with safe to play today I

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.530 
hi Craig Patel with safe to play today I
want<00:00:04.680> to<00:00:04.770> go<00:00:04.890> over<00:00:05.130> with<00:00:05.609> you<00:00:05.850> just<00:00:06.180> a<00:00:06.299> few<00:00:06.330> of

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
want to go over with you just a few of

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.419 
want to go over with you just a few of
the<00:00:06.629> things<00:00:06.870> that<00:00:07.109> I<00:00:07.140> use<00:00:07.529> to<00:00:07.890> make<00:00:08.010> sure<00:00:08.069> that

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
the things that I use to make sure that

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.610 
the things that I use to make sure that
your<00:00:08.639> playground<00:00:09.090> is<00:00:09.240> safe<00:00:09.510> when<00:00:10.380> I<00:00:10.410> do<00:00:10.530> a

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
your playground is safe when I do a

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.339 
your playground is safe when I do a
certified<00:00:11.190> safety<00:00:11.790> inspection<00:00:12.480> some<00:00:13.200> of<00:00:13.290> the

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
certified safety inspection some of the

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.010 
certified safety inspection some of the
tools<00:00:13.920> I<00:00:14.130> use<00:00:14.160> are<00:00:14.730> items<00:00:15.389> like<00:00:15.570> this

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
tools I use are items like this

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.580 
tools I use are items like this
and<00:00:16.109> what<00:00:16.830> these<00:00:16.980> do<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.609> measure<00:00:18.590> Petrosian

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
and what these do is measure Petrosian

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.950 
and what these do is measure Petrosian
that<00:00:19.800> could<00:00:20.010> be<00:00:20.189> possibly<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.970> hazard<00:00:21.720> on<00:00:21.810> your

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
that could be possibly a hazard on your

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.939 
that could be possibly a hazard on your
playground<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:22.769> things<00:00:23.519> like<00:00:24.650> bolts<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:25.859> are

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
playground so things like bolts that are

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.179 
playground so things like bolts that are
sticking<00:00:26.220> out<00:00:26.460> with<00:00:26.640> more<00:00:26.789> than<00:00:26.849> two<00:00:27.150> threads

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
sticking out with more than two threads

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.650 
sticking out with more than two threads
different<00:00:29.189> items<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.789> might<00:00:30.029> be<00:00:30.179> protruding

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
different items that might be protruding

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.110 
different items that might be protruding
from<00:00:31.199> some<00:00:31.710> part<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:31.980> your<00:00:32.130> playground

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
from some part of your playground

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.080 
from some part of your playground
equipment<00:00:33.840> could<00:00:34.620> be<00:00:34.800> possible<00:00:35.489> items<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.059> I

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
equipment could be possible items that I

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.090 
equipment could be possible items that I
would<00:00:36.239> look<00:00:36.360> at<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.870> possibly<00:00:37.530> write<00:00:37.739> up<00:00:37.890> in

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
would look at and possibly write up in

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.959 
would look at and possibly write up in
my<00:00:38.370> report<00:00:39.140> other<00:00:40.140> things<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:41.370> would<00:00:41.730> use

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
my report other things that I would use

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.850 
my report other things that I would use
is<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:43.460> head<00:00:44.460> probe<00:00:44.899> and<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.289> this<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.739> a

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
is a head probe and this is a this is a

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.729 
is a head probe and this is a this is a
probe<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:48.030> measure<00:00:48.239> any<00:00:48.750> gap<00:00:49.079> that's<00:00:49.350> three

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
probe to measure any gap that's three

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.799 
probe to measure any gap that's three
and<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.890> half<00:00:50.039> inches<00:00:50.430> or<00:00:50.550> larger<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:51.660> that

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
and a half inches or larger so that

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.860 
and a half inches or larger so that
would<00:00:51.960> maybe<00:00:52.289> be<00:00:52.440> where<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.760> body<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.629> kid

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
would maybe be where a a body of a kid

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.410 
would maybe be where a a body of a kid
the<00:00:55.110> feet<00:00:55.320> would<00:00:55.620> go<00:00:55.770> first<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.340> then<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.149> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
the feet would go first and then the the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.540 
the feet would go first and then the the
head<00:00:57.570> would<00:00:57.719> follow<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:59.070> would<00:00:59.190> be<00:00:59.280> more

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
head would follow so that would be more

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.680 
head would follow so that would be more
of<00:00:59.609> this<00:01:00.079> probe<00:01:01.079> here<00:01:01.500> which<00:01:02.010> could<00:01:02.520> imitate

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
of this probe here which could imitate

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.920 
of this probe here which could imitate
a<00:01:03.960> head<00:01:04.439> at<00:01:04.769> 9<00:01:05.220> inches<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.420> feet<00:01:06.630> would<00:01:06.810> go

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
a head at 9 inches so the feet would go

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.630 
a head at 9 inches so the feet would go
in<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.380> then<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.619> head<00:01:07.770> would<00:01:07.920> get<00:01:08.040> stuck<00:01:08.369> so

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
in and then the head would get stuck so

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.289 
in and then the head would get stuck so
obviously<00:01:09.090> we<00:01:09.210> don't<00:01:09.420> want<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:10.049> happen

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
obviously we don't want that to happen

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.750 
obviously we don't want that to happen
this<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.360> for<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.619> called<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.950> fish<00:01:14.159> probe<00:01:14.460> and

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
this is for a is called a fish probe and

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.109 
this is for a is called a fish probe and
it's<00:01:14.970> for<00:01:15.420> partially<00:01:15.930> bound<00:01:16.790> entrapments<00:01:17.790> so

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
it's for partially bound entrapments so

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.230 
it's for partially bound entrapments so
up<00:01:18.720> on<00:01:18.960> top<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.770> structure<00:01:20.310> we<00:01:20.850> would<00:01:21.000> use

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
up on top of the structure we would use

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.960 
up on top of the structure we would use
this<00:01:21.650> so<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.860> fish<00:01:23.040> probe<00:01:23.369> what<00:01:23.820> you'd

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
this so on the fish probe what you'd

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.450 
this so on the fish probe what you'd
like<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.240> do<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.630> measure<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.470> opening<00:01:25.979> on<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
like to do is measure the opening on the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.940 
like to do is measure the opening on the
top<00:01:26.490> here<00:01:26.970> if<00:01:27.119> it's<00:01:27.360> larger<00:01:28.140> than<00:01:28.409> this<00:01:28.560> area

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
top here if it's larger than this area

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.130 
top here if it's larger than this area
right<00:01:29.159> here<00:01:29.220> which<00:01:29.970> this<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.509> just<00:01:30.780> under

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
right here which this is just under

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.160 
right here which this is just under
that's<00:01:32.040> good<00:01:32.220> news<00:01:32.369> what<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.240> do<00:01:33.509> then<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.930> is

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
that's good news what you do then is is

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.010 
that's good news what you do then is is
flip<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.619> around<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.460> if<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.759> sticks<00:01:36.180> drops

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
flip it around and if it sticks drops

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.350 
flip it around and if it sticks drops
down<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.530> there<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:38.070> again<00:01:38.460> would<00:01:38.610> imitate

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
down in there that again would imitate

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.679 
down in there that again would imitate
the<00:01:39.750> head<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:41.009> child<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:42.329> one<00:01:42.600> is

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
the head of a child so this one is

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.230 
the head of a child so this one is
compliant<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.790> obviously<00:01:44.790> we're<00:01:44.970> not<00:01:45.119> going

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
compliant and obviously we're not going

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.030 
compliant and obviously we're not going
to<00:01:45.270> write<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.600> up<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.799> measure

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
to write that up this is to measure

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.520 
to write that up this is to measure
anything<00:01:47.850> that's<00:01:48.149> greater<00:01:48.930> than<00:01:49.049> three<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.470> a

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
anything that's greater than three and a

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.109 
anything that's greater than three and a
half<00:01:49.619> inches<00:01:49.860> sometimes<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.490> find<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.939> gap

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
half inches sometimes I find a gap

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.639 
half inches sometimes I find a gap
between<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.780> upright<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:53.299> barrier

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
between the upright and the barrier

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.679 
between the upright and the barrier
measuring<00:01:55.649> about<00:01:56.210> larger<00:01:57.210> than<00:01:57.360> three<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.600> a

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
measuring about larger than three and a

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.600 
measuring about larger than three and a
half<00:01:57.810> eighty<00:01:58.049> four<00:01:58.320> inches<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:59.250> then<00:01:59.369> the

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
half eighty four inches and then the

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.249
