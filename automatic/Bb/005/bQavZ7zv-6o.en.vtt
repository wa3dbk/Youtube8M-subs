00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
therefore they are not wasted but this

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.920 
therefore they are not wasted but this
trick<00:00:45.960> should<00:00:46.289> only<00:00:46.649> be<00:00:46.920> done<00:00:47.160> if<00:00:47.700> your<00:00:48.000> CRT<00:00:48.510> TV

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
trick should only be done if your CRT TV

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.790 
trick should only be done if your CRT TV
have<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:50.149> sixteen<00:00:51.149> by<00:00:51.360> nine<00:00:51.390> mode<00:00:51.870> to

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
have this sixteen by nine mode to

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.310 
have this sixteen by nine mode to
correct<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.309> stretch<00:00:53.579> picture<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:55.140> will

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
correct a stretch picture that will

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.990 
correct a stretch picture that will
happen<00:00:55.770> on<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.039> later<00:00:56.250> portion<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.820> this

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
happen on the later portion of this

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.380 
happen on the later portion of this

to<00:01:32.799> sixteen<00:01:33.189> by<00:01:33.340> nine<00:01:36.360> then<00:01:37.360> finish

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.710 

now<00:01:48.710> you<00:01:49.340> notice<00:01:49.730> that<00:01:49.760> the<00:01:50.030> picture<00:01:50.510> now

also notice that the picture is thrashed
this<00:02:07.790> is<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.270> stretched<00:02:08.570> picture<00:02:09.260> that<00:02:09.500> I<00:02:09.649> had

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
this is the stretched picture that I had

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.820 
this is the stretched picture that I had
mentioned<00:02:10.100> earlier<00:02:10.729> just<00:02:11.470> turn<00:02:12.470> on<00:02:12.680> the

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
mentioned earlier just turn on the

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.760 
mentioned earlier just turn on the
sixteen<00:02:13.310> by<00:02:13.490> nine<00:02:13.520> mode<00:02:13.940> of<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.300> CRT<00:02:14.600> TV<00:02:15.110> to

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
sixteen by nine mode of the CRT TV to

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.490 
sixteen by nine mode of the CRT TV to
correct<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.250> aspect<00:02:16.760> ratio<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:17.450> on<00:02:18.380> the

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
correct the aspect ratio and on the

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.730 
correct the aspect ratio and on the
sixteen<00:02:18.950> by<00:02:19.130> nine<00:02:19.160> mode<00:02:19.610> of<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:19.910> CRT<00:02:20.210> TV<00:02:20.750> there

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
sixteen by nine mode of the CRT TV there

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.840 
sixteen by nine mode of the CRT TV there
are<00:02:21.860> no<00:02:22.070> active<00:02:22.610> lines<00:02:22.880> here<00:02:23.330> and<00:02:23.510> here<00:02:23.680> so

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
are no active lines here and here so

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.440 
are no active lines here and here so
nothing<00:02:25.850> is<00:02:26.030> wasted<00:02:26.620> all<00:02:27.620> of<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:28.190> 480i<00:02:29.000> lines

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
nothing is wasted all of the 480i lines

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.650 
nothing is wasted all of the 480i lines
of<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.810> CRT<00:02:30.080> TV<00:02:30.650> are<00:02:31.220> now<00:02:31.580> concentrated<00:02:32.450> on<00:02:32.570> a

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
of the CRT TV are now concentrated on a

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.580 
of the CRT TV are now concentrated on a
smaller<00:02:32.930> area<00:02:33.310> they<00:02:34.310> are<00:02:34.370> not<00:02:34.580> wasted<00:02:35.030> at<00:02:35.150> all

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
smaller area they are not wasted at all

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.260 
smaller area they are not wasted at all
so<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.770> picture<00:02:37.340> is<00:02:37.490> now<00:02:37.640> much<00:02:37.850> sharper

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
so the picture is now much sharper

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.780 
so the picture is now much sharper
because<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.530> active<00:02:39.920> lines<00:02:40.160> are<00:02:40.370> now<00:02:40.580> much

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
because the active lines are now much

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.070 
because the active lines are now much
closer<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.540> each<00:02:41.600> other<00:02:42.580> but<00:02:43.580> if<00:02:43.910> your<00:02:44.150> CRT<00:02:44.660> TV

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
closer to each other but if your CRT TV

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.770 
closer to each other but if your CRT TV
don't<00:02:45.320> have<00:02:45.560> a<00:02:45.590> sixteen<00:02:46.100> by<00:02:46.250> nine<00:02:46.280> mode<00:02:46.780> then

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
don't have a sixteen by nine mode then

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.110 
don't have a sixteen by nine mode then
do<00:02:48.020> not<00:02:48.230> set<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:48.890> PlayStation<00:02:49.550> 3<00:02:49.790> into<00:02:50.060> a

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
do not set the PlayStation 3 into a

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.510 
do not set the PlayStation 3 into a
sixteen<00:02:50.570> by<00:02:50.720> nine<00:02:51.040> because<00:02:52.040> you<00:02:52.340> cannot

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
sixteen by nine because you cannot

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.170 
sixteen by nine because you cannot
correct<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.090> stretch<00:02:53.390> picture
