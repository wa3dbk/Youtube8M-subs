00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
to keep testing ourselves without that

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.540 
to keep testing ourselves without that

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
world cup and certainly you know people

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.520 
world cup and certainly you know people
would<00:01:18.509> be<00:01:18.689> very<00:01:18.900> familiar<00:01:19.020> with<00:01:19.320> their

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530

physic<00:01:21.360> physical<00:01:21.840> side<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:24.650> yes<00:01:25.650> for<00:01:26.009> us<00:01:26.130> I

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
physic physical side and yes for us I

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.249 
physic physical side and yes for us I
think<00:01:26.340> that's<00:01:26.640> one<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.909> great<00:01:27.000> challenges

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
think that's one of the great challenges

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.469 
think that's one of the great challenges
and<00:01:28.259> Brett<00:01:28.770> Shane's<00:01:29.040> injury<00:01:29.430> how<00:01:29.939> serious<00:01:30.240> is

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
and Brett Shane's injury how serious is

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.399 
and Brett Shane's injury how serious is
out<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.810> when<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.110> expect<00:01:31.439> him<00:01:31.560> back<00:01:31.740> yeah<00:01:33.409> in

out and when you expect him back yeah in

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.990 
out and when you expect him back yeah in
terms<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.829> seriousness<00:01:35.159> probably<00:01:35.640> as<00:01:35.729> serious

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
terms of seriousness probably as serious

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.789 
terms of seriousness probably as serious
as<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.180> can<00:01:36.270> get<00:01:36.420> with<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.630> mcl<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.409> after

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
as you can get with the mcl so after

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.700 
as you can get with the mcl so after
three<00:01:37.920> months<00:01:38.159> has<00:01:38.369> had<00:01:38.520> surgery<00:01:39.409> he'll<00:01:40.409> start

the<00:01:40.829> preseason<00:01:41.220> with<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.640> probably<00:01:42.420> didn't

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
the preseason with this probably didn't

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.889 
the preseason with this probably didn't
come<00:01:43.530> at<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:44.100> really<00:01:44.460> good<00:01:44.700> time<00:01:44.939> for<00:01:45.299> us<00:01:45.329> or<00:01:45.840> for
