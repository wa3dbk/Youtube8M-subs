00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.940
 hello everyone in this video will teach them 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:12.459
 how to delete photos from your iphone 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.170
 all first if you want 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:15.940
 get them back quickly the first thing that 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.610
 have to do is simply in 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.010
 iTunes 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.500
 They can restore their iphone and they will 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.660
 delete all content 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.640
 then they can use that windows or 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.609
 mac yes 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.200
 the second method is in there forum that 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.989
 it's here that they can see the work in 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.820
 the center basically open you matter 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.470
 all your photos and from there it gives you the 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.090
 option to erase and erase all after 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.430
 we can challenge those that mattered 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.680
 they are the fastest ways to do it 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.519
 but since they want to make sunshine in their 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.500
 17 iPhone is a little more difficult and 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:53.260
 it was a little bit longer about 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.490
 5 minutes 10 minutes maximum we are going to 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.740
 go to photos 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.660
 now it depends on the thrown cloaks in 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.720
 my channel they deleted enough to start 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:06.350
 with 2000 and right now they're at 600 but they're going 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:09.370
 to see how 600 is done 0 fast 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.140
 let's click on photos below 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.730
 and he's going to give us this option here 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.090
 to have to be late in any part of 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.210
 here 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.250
 since the exseleccionado sixth we are going to 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.640
 select this first part that 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.119
 I want to delete we select that part the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.119
 let's go up 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:35.640
 yes and we will select for example 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.860
 all this here that I do not want then 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.220
 if you want to select all this they are going to 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.030
 go in select 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.940
 I just thought they were going to give him tapen select 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.930
 here also select and they will see 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.050
 how do i know 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.820
 they select all these photos and the same 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.190
 they will be down they will continue 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.040
 putting select and zone select 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.010
 all the folders and they will see how 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.490
 it really is quick this way 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.440
 obviously with ios 6 is even more 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.600
 fast because they can go to settings and 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.630
 from there they can select everything and 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.640
 but in them 7 it's up to them to make this 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.700
 way which will not take long 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.520
 especially if they have some 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.880
 few folders with many photos are going to 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.690
 to be able to erase them very very quickly in this 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.390
 case as you can see 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.460
 in fact it's not going badly I'm going to 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.860
 erase only up there to teach them the 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:37.000
 next step that is to select this 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.000
 from here the dumpster 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:46.340
 and as you can see already selection in 247 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:49.340
 air plus photos and all were erased 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.480
 all those who select then that 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.730
 they have to remain apart 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.459
 folders that you want to erase and that's the 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.160
 third fastest option to do as you 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.840
 I said the other two options is like a 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.670
 computer if they want to do is the 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.160
 cell phone no matter how much they have any 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.730
 iphone that are 17 will work like this 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.709
 make it for iphone 5 4 or 33 that 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.879
 that in fact I do not think it goes to 7 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:16.160
 but if there are some who could 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:17.690
 so if they have version 7 this is 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.150
 the way to ask any question 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.310
 what can you do to me here on my channel if 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.870
 they do not work any error equally 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.030
 here in the comments part I do not know 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.030
 forget to subscribe and put it and scissors
