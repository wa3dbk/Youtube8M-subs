00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:33.690
 Kahn in a very soft very soft hand 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.210

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.610
 My hand is very badly treated and the 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.450
 house cleaning does not help much 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.809
 so I'll start by removing all the 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.270
 enamel and preparing a fine scrub 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.930
 powerful in this exfoliation we will 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.760
 need a spoonful of sugar or 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.399
 sugar works as one of the most 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.949
 has been powerful since its 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.770

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.409

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.360
 sodium bicarbonate 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.210
 if you still believe that bicarbonate 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.540
 sodium chloride is only useful for 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.880

 exfoliating moisturizer like bicarbonate 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.280

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.790
 mixed with the other ingredients 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:47.240
