by the end of the first measure and then

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.800 
by the end of the first measure and then
you're<00:01:24.020> gonna<00:01:24.110> go<00:01:24.350> back<00:01:24.560> down<00:01:24.590> to<00:01:24.830> piano<00:01:25.810> then

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
you're gonna go back down to piano then

the<00:02:22.700> C<00:02:22.910> sharp<00:02:23.120> F<00:02:23.360> sharp<00:02:23.390> a<00:02:23.720> sharp<00:02:23.989> that's<00:02:24.319> an<00:02:24.470> F

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
the C sharp F sharp a sharp that's an F

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.600 
the C sharp F sharp a sharp that's an F
sharp<00:02:25.090> major<00:02:26.090> chord<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:26.980> then<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.190> next<00:02:28.459> to

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
sharp major chord and then the next to

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.370 
sharp major chord and then the next to
last<00:02:28.760> quarter<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.239> first<00:02:29.510> line<00:02:29.720> you<00:02:29.870> got<00:02:29.989> B<00:02:30.170> d

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
last quarter the first line you got B d

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.309 
last quarter the first line you got B d
sharp<00:02:30.410> F<00:02:30.769> sharp<00:02:30.829> and<00:02:31.459> then<00:02:31.730> you<00:02:32.299> go<00:02:32.390> back<00:02:32.599> to<00:02:32.840> C

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
sharp F sharp and then you go back to C

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.350 
sharp F sharp and then you go back to C
sharp<00:02:33.349> F<00:02:33.829> sharp<00:02:33.890> a<00:02:34.370> sharp<00:02:34.730> so<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.000> lot<00:02:35.150> of<00:02:35.180> the

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
sharp F sharp a sharp so a lot of the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.250 
sharp F sharp a sharp so a lot of the
scene<00:02:35.569> or<00:02:36.760> it's<00:02:37.760> what<00:02:37.910> you<00:02:38.030> get<00:02:38.120> up<00:02:38.239> down<00:02:38.450> they

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
scene or it's what you get up down they

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:48.400 
scene or it's what you get up down they
repeat<00:02:39.650> so<00:02:39.950> it's<00:02:40.329> easier

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.960 

all<00:02:49.410> right<00:02:49.830> and<00:02:50.160> then<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.580> want<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.790> try<00:02:50.910> to

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
all right and then you want to try to

00:02:50.970 --> 00:03:06.100 
all right and then you want to try to
put<00:02:51.210> the<00:02:51.330> first<00:02:51.510> line<00:02:51.750> hands<00:02:51.930> together

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.650 

pretty<00:03:06.740> easy<00:03:06.980> so<00:03:07.250> far<00:03:07.430> actually<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:07.880> last<00:03:08.120> two

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
pretty easy so far actually the last two

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.290 
pretty easy so far actually the last two
measures<00:03:08.930> there<00:03:09.170> should<00:03:09.350> have<00:03:09.380> been<00:03:09.470> softer

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:28.630 

so<00:03:14.300> one<00:03:14.390> more<00:03:14.540> time<00:03:25.450> there<00:03:26.450> we<00:03:26.600> go<00:03:27.340> on<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.520> next

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
so one more time there we go on the next

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.620 
so one more time there we go on the next
line

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.830 

you<00:03:32.630> got<00:03:32.920> pretty<00:03:33.920> much<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.310> same<00:03:34.700> thing<00:03:35.060> so

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
you got pretty much the same thing so

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.800 
you got pretty much the same thing so
you<00:03:35.870> got<00:03:36.140> B<00:03:36.470> be<00:03:36.980> sharp<00:03:37.340> they're<00:03:37.940> not<00:03:38.090> B<00:03:38.300> C<00:03:38.690> sharp

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
you got B be sharp they're not B C sharp

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.270 
you got B be sharp they're not B C sharp
d<00:03:39.230> sharp<00:03:39.260> e<00:03:39.770> d<00:03:40.730> sharp<00:03:41.000> C<00:03:41.270> sharp<00:03:41.300> B<00:03:41.660> a<00:03:42.200> sharp<00:03:42.770> same

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
end which is a repeat sign if you look

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.210 
end which is a repeat sign if you look

at the bar line at the very end double
bar<00:05:19.400> line<00:05:19.670> there<00:05:19.940> so<00:05:20.480> you<00:05:20.900> got<00:05:21.020> a<00:05:21.050> repeat<00:05:21.380> we
