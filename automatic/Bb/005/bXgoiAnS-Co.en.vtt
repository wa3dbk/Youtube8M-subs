these<00:00:19.260> tips<00:00:19.529> are<00:00:19.710> basically<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.340> same<00:00:20.609> for

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
these tips are basically the same for

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.990 
these tips are basically the same for
all<00:00:21.240> genetically<00:00:21.750> modified<00:00:22.320> plants<00:00:23.000> first

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
all genetically modified plants first

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.120 
all genetically modified plants first
step<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.480> extraction<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.260> DNA<00:00:25.590> then

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
step is the extraction of the DNA then

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.070 
step is the extraction of the DNA then
the<00:00:26.310> second<00:00:26.699> step<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.090> clone<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.689> single

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
the second step is the clone of a single

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.330 
the second step is the clone of a single
gene<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.680> interest

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340

third<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.000> designing<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.869> gene<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.769> be

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
third is the designing the gene to be

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.310

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
genie inside the plant cell then the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.810
