 I'll teach you how to cook healthy like this 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.530
 Welcome to my recipe channel 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.389
 light and with this the summer has arrived 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.340
 Solecito and bikinis so there's 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.990
 have to see how to keep the line and 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.480
 today everything to teach to make a salsita 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.760
 so you can look at those roasted meats 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.680
 and grills that you have very much in style 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.410
 chihuahua because it 's with buttermilk 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.600
 we will need I am doing alone 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.220
 of milk from three cups of milk yo 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.739
 always promotes light milk today 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.110
 let's make whole milk for three 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.270
 cups I'm going to put four lemons here in 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.250
 milk we're just going to 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.400
 squeeze here I have milk in a 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.030
 container 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:51.200
 and I squeeze my lemons and we're going to leave it 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.270
 this resting for 15 minutes to 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.670
 to be able to cut the milk and get the 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.070
 serum of this milk there are places about 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.320
 all in my very dear Mexico where already 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.090
 they sell you the buttermilk made by 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.800
 here we have to engineer them 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.960
 invent the way to get the serum out of 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.310
 milk and see here I also have the 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.340
 spit 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.950
 I started to take some tomatitos that are already 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.530
 I'm going to put them here to avoid 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.450
 make a mess in the house I have some 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.689
 jalapeños 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.579
 I have here a clove of garlic and 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.649
 pieces of onion that I'm just going to put 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:27.539
 so whole and know that I'm not going to 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:31.439
 remove the shell nothing to make it look 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:34.530
 if that little brown roast beef and 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.490
 we are removing the tail just here 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.220
 of our jalapeños 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.940
 that's there I have a little consommé 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.030
 chicken look over here 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.300
 and now with a container or I have 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.300
 here he 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.500
 this food processor to give you 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.320
 I do not want them to stay 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.190
 just like that, half shakes and I 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.140
 I put here 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.630
 we are placing them in this next to 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.280
 horse all splashed there goes I want that 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.240
 the pieces are half whole so 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.240
 we will not give much 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.800
 no more that our little 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.850
 chillies and activate the other chilitos for 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.850
 that is spicy 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.740
 and to this we are going to add it to the serum 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.630
 of milk no more what if you have left very 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.069
 well derailed is garlic if it does not have 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.439
 take a surprise 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.439
 look, that's how you're going to start seeing 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:32.540
 your milk this means that the serum 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:34.370
 is already separating and with those who 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.129
 that creampie they see there we can 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:41.180
 make a rich dip just adding a little 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:42.920
 of vegan something of cucumber olive oil 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.959
 and how delicious to botanize you with 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.389
 good chips do not do desert with 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.939
 light totopos made with toast and 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:51.829
 well let's see what we are going to expect 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:54.360
 We have five minutes to go 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:56.430
 just put that milk in 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.320
 well now yes we go sector in the yard 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.090
 so I brought a pan from the kitchen 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.100
 and what I'm going to do after 15 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.080
 minutes already cut my milk I'm going to put 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.650
 here the colander so that what goes away 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.620
 be the buttermilk and the creampie 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.170
 we stay upstairs look to take our 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.120
 whey this suits you better if you 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.610
 you do with a cloth because it's not going 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.200
 nothing of the cream that is not supposed to 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.600
 more should be serum and now not 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.890
 I have a rag so let's see how 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.980
 is this what I'm going to do is that 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.870
 probably give you two filtered look 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.570
 I have a piece of a shirt here 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.940
 that we are going to use it to hang this 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.920
 that if the serum of him the serum of the 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.540
 milk look and the boiled helped me 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.540
 further separate the milk 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.299
 so let's go like that is what I 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:45.970
 I want it is watery that is falling down 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.910
 that's what we need there goes everything 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.220
 our soil 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.380
 I'm going to leave this serum here what's missing 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.810
 to drain it and this we are going to place 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.410
 in the pot that is just what 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.350
 we need 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:04.350

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.350
 let's let it have the first boil 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.880

 They see us from Zacatecas and stirred it up 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.790
 with some fresh cheese because it's 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.410

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.530
 just to have the flavor but without 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.660
 But we do not want to just put that 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.580
