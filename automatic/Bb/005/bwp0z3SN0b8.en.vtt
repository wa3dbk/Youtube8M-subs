00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:09.179
 then test number two we shoot the same 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.690
 most duplex monolith from the same gun 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.880
 benelli m3 super 90 same 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.779
 I won't twist anything with collimator 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.289
 and I don't even want a distance of 50 meters, but we 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.800
 decided to put Sergei got 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:28.580
 I will shoot the same mode is not very 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:33.019
 fast to one patron 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.019
 giving the opportunity to the shaft as will give and 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:21.300
 comments we can not nothing 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.300
 let's see what 's finished there 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.340
 judging by the impact 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:40.110
 different ammo is weaker there is 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.700
 more powerful failure well here it came out 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.940
 the last one was meaner 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.620
 I myself generally understand the top of the axis 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:53.190
 speed is higher 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:55.410
 the whole and the speed will be higher with 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.450
 ballistic test data 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.030
 read on the site there 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:04.470
 actually numbers speed variation 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:08.660
 pressure as if the variation within 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.660
 normal donnie most prominent 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:44.770
 duplex monolith in the middle 5 covered 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.770
 ugly with 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.360
 daddy 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.360
 to targets 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:04.900
 I can not say the phrase that knocks 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.410
 straight on my head for a patron price 140 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.990
 rubles 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:13.920
 terrible very arch put now not 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:16.920
 cartridge opochka to navigate 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.920
 space 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:27.120
 nothing again also waving its tail 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.660
 I will get to say the company correctly 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:33.020
 duplex monavie glass accuracy much 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.020
 it is better 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.000
 I think what to understand
