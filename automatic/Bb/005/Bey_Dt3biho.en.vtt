have questions for me related to their

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.349 
have questions for me related to their
knitting<00:00:19.439> not<00:00:20.039> really<00:00:20.460> knitting<00:00:20.760> questions

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
knitting not really knitting questions

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.689 
knitting not really knitting questions
but<00:00:21.990> things<00:00:22.199> that<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.439> can<00:00:22.650> answer<00:00:22.830> because

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
but things that I can answer because

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.429 
but things that I can answer because
they<00:00:23.880> they<00:00:24.330> do<00:00:24.390> have<00:00:24.689> everything<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.230> do<00:00:25.410> with

let me know I'm always looking for new

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.250 
let me know I'm always looking for new
ideas<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:35.309> add<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.700> new<00:00:35.910> series<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.660> in

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
ideas to add to this new series and in

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.250 
ideas to add to this new series and in
this<00:00:37.380> first<00:00:37.770> math<00:00:38.399> for<00:00:38.730> knitters<00:00:38.940> video<00:00:39.930> we're

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
this first math for knitters video we're

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.830 
this first math for knitters video we're
going<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.500> talk<00:00:40.710> about<00:00:40.739> how<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.489> calculate<00:00:42.210> how

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
going to talk about how to calculate how

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.619 
going to talk about how to calculate how
many<00:00:43.050> yards<00:00:43.350> are<00:00:43.860> in<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.370> partial<00:00:44.879> ball<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.390> yarn

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
many yards are in a partial ball of yarn

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.770 
many yards are in a partial ball of yarn
let's<00:00:46.530> say<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.070> have<00:00:47.309> some<00:00:48.300> leftover

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
let's say that you have some leftover

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.250 
let's say that you have some leftover
yarn<00:00:49.020> from<00:00:49.410> another<00:00:49.739> project<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.840> there's<00:00:51.840> a

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
yarn from another project and there's a

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.189 
yarn from another project and there's a
great<00:00:52.980> hat<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.489> want<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.850> make<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
great hat that you want to make and the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.439 
great hat that you want to make and the
Hat<00:00:55.379> takes<00:00:55.680> 87<00:00:56.340> yards<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.910> you're<00:00:57.239> not<00:00:57.420> sure

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
Hat takes 87 yards and you're not sure

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.360 
Hat takes 87 yards and you're not sure
if<00:00:57.750> there's<00:00:58.050> enough<00:00:58.379> in<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.710> partial<00:00:59.190> ball

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
if there's enough in this partial ball

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.580 
if there's enough in this partial ball
and<00:00:59.940> it'd<00:01:00.030> be<00:01:00.059> great<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.329> use<00:01:00.600> up<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:00.930> extra

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
and it'd be great to use up this extra

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.770 
and it'd be great to use up this extra
yarn<00:01:01.920> rather<00:01:02.190> than<00:01:02.430> going<00:01:02.879> out<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.120> buy<00:01:03.390> more

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
yarn rather than going out to buy more

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.600 
yarn rather than going out to buy more
so<00:01:04.350> we<00:01:04.500> can<00:01:04.680> figure<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.100> out

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
so we can figure this out

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.960 
so we can figure this out
the<00:01:06.150> first<00:01:06.420> thing<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.780> need<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.799> know<00:01:08.130> what

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
the first thing you need is to know what

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.320 
the first thing you need is to know what
yarn<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.570> if<00:01:09.960> it's<00:01:10.380> mystery<00:01:10.799> yarn<00:01:11.100> mm<00:01:11.909> it's

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
yarn it is if it's mystery yarn mm it's

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.060 
yarn it is if it's mystery yarn mm it's
gonna<00:01:12.479> be<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> little<00:01:13.020> bit<00:01:13.290> more<00:01:13.470> difficult<00:01:13.979> to

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
gonna be a little bit more difficult to

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.560 
gonna be a little bit more difficult to
determine<00:01:14.460> because<00:01:14.909> you're<00:01:15.060> going<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.420> have

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
determine because you're going to have

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.590 
determine because you're going to have
to<00:01:15.750> base<00:01:16.400> the<00:01:17.400> known<00:01:17.610> facts<00:01:17.939> about<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.390> yarn

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
to base the known facts about the yarn

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.230 
to base the known facts about the yarn
on<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.869> similar<00:01:19.619> yarn<00:01:20.009> but<00:01:20.460> let's<00:01:20.670> say<00:01:20.850> we<00:01:21.030> know

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
on a similar yarn but let's say we know

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.710 
on a similar yarn but let's say we know
what<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.570> yarn<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:23.240> if<00:01:24.240> you'll<00:01:24.479> know

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
what this yarn is and if you'll know

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.560 
what this yarn is and if you'll know
because<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.320> have<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.860> yarn<00:01:26.340> label<00:01:26.670> or<00:01:27.150> you

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
because you have the yarn label or you

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.280 
because you have the yarn label or you
can<00:01:27.780> jump<00:01:28.020> on<00:01:28.229> Ravelry<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.750> look<00:01:30.750> up<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.110> yarn

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
can jump on Ravelry and look up the yarn

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.060 
can jump on Ravelry and look up the yarn
to<00:01:31.920> see<00:01:32.100> how<00:01:32.369> many<00:01:32.430> yards<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.409> in<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.560> full<00:01:34.829> ball

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
to see how many yards is in a full ball

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.109 
to see how many yards is in a full ball
and<00:01:35.400> how<00:01:36.060> many<00:01:36.270> grams<00:01:37.070> that<00:01:38.070> full<00:01:38.579> ball<00:01:38.820> weighs

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
and how many grams that full ball weighs

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.700 
and how many grams that full ball weighs
because<00:01:39.479> that's<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.930> information<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.530> need

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
because that's the information you need

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.370 
because that's the information you need
to<00:01:40.740> start<00:01:41.070> with<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.240> have<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:43.110> next

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
to start with so you have that the next

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.260 
to start with so you have that the next
thing<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.680> need<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.130> kitchen<00:01:44.700> scale<00:01:45.000> I

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
thing you need is a kitchen scale I

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.030 
thing you need is a kitchen scale I
think<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.659> postal<00:01:46.049> scale<00:01:46.170> will<00:01:46.530> work<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.860> same

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
think a postal scale will work the same

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.859 
think a postal scale will work the same
way<00:01:47.100> but<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.640> use<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.030> kitchen<00:01:48.479> scale<00:01:48.600> on<00:01:48.810> my

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
way but I use a kitchen scale on my

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.600 
way but I use a kitchen scale on my
kitchen<00:01:49.290> scale<00:01:49.560> measures<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.040> grams<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.579> so

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
kitchen scale measures and grams and so

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.080 
kitchen scale measures and grams and so
you<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.390> measure<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.380> see<00:01:52.939> what<00:01:53.939> the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
you you measure that to see what the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.940 
you you measure that to see what the
actual<00:01:54.450> weight<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:55.140> partial<00:01:55.560> ball<00:01:55.770> of

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
actual weight of the partial ball of

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.300 
actual weight of the partial ball of
yarn<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.399> so<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.600> things<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.020> need<00:01:58.229> are<00:01:58.469> the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
yarn is so the things you need are the

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.520 
yarn is so the things you need are the
yardage<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.939> full<00:02:00.240> ball<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.600> yarn<00:02:00.810> the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
yardage of the full ball of yarn the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.980 
yardage of the full ball of yarn the
weight<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.159> full<00:02:02.399> ball<00:02:02.579> of<00:02:02.729> yarn<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.270> the

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
weight of the full ball of yarn and the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.410 
weight of the full ball of yarn and the
weight<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:05.070> partial<00:02:05.549> ball<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:05.909> yarn<00:02:06.119> and

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
weight of the partial ball of yarn and

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.749 
weight of the partial ball of yarn and
then<00:02:07.140> we<00:02:07.320> can<00:02:07.439> get<00:02:07.560> into<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.829> math<00:02:08.009> part<00:02:08.280> I'm

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
then we can get into the math part I'm

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.460 
then we can get into the math part I'm
going<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.239> simplify<00:02:09.780> this<00:02:09.840> as<00:02:10.170> much<00:02:10.200> as

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
going to simplify this as much as

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.170 
going to simplify this as much as
possible<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:11.280> get<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.550> from<00:02:11.700> point<00:02:11.910> A<00:02:12.150> to

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
possible to get you from point A to

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.950 
possible to get you from point A to
point<00:02:12.300> B<00:02:12.599> there's<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.349> lot<00:02:13.500> of<00:02:13.590> math

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
point B there's a lot of math

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.960 
point B there's a lot of math
between<00:02:14.260> I'm<00:02:14.500> going<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:14.980> show<00:02:15.130> you<00:02:15.160> just<00:02:15.850> how

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
between I'm going to show you just how

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.300 
between I'm going to show you just how
to<00:02:16.120> figure<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.630> to<00:02:17.110> get<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.380> your<00:02:17.500> answer<00:02:17.830> let's

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
to figure it to get to your answer let's

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.880 
to figure it to get to your answer let's
go<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:18.580> take<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.700> look<00:02:22.170> okay<00:02:23.170> this<00:02:23.650> is<00:02:23.770> the

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
go and take a look okay this is the

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.760 
go and take a look okay this is the
information<00:02:24.160> that<00:02:24.430> we<00:02:24.550> need<00:02:24.820> to<00:02:24.970> get<00:02:25.120> going

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
information that we need to get going

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.990 
information that we need to get going
first<00:02:26.770> we're<00:02:27.010> going<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.190> just<00:02:27.430> look<00:02:27.610> at<00:02:27.790> this

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
first we're going to just look at this

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.800 
first we're going to just look at this
half<00:02:28.240> of<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:29.200> equation<00:02:29.530> a<00:02:30.090> full<00:02:31.090> ball<00:02:31.420> of<00:02:31.600> yarn

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
half of the equation a full ball of yarn

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.690 
half of the equation a full ball of yarn
is<00:02:32.370> 100<00:02:33.370> grams<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:34.560> 200<00:02:35.560> yards<00:02:35.920> I've<00:02:36.370> kept

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
is 100 grams and 200 yards I've kept

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.430 
is 100 grams and 200 yards I've kept
this<00:02:36.850> math<00:02:37.060> really<00:02:37.330> simple<00:02:37.780> but<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.020> formula

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
this math really simple but the formula

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.950 
this math really simple but the formula
is<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.590> same<00:02:38.770> regardless<00:02:39.250> so<00:02:39.640> a<00:02:40.390> full<00:02:40.690> ball<00:02:40.870> of

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
is the same regardless so a full ball of

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.200 
is the same regardless so a full ball of
yarn<00:02:41.110> is<00:02:41.290> 100<00:02:41.800> grams<00:02:42.010> and<00:02:42.280> 200<00:02:42.730> yards<00:02:43.000> I've

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
yarn is 100 grams and 200 yards I've

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.470 
yarn is 100 grams and 200 yards I've
weighed<00:02:43.960> my<00:02:44.680> yarn<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:45.250> I<00:02:45.460> have<00:02:45.640> 50<00:02:46.060> grams<00:02:46.300> of

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
weighed my yarn and I have 50 grams of

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.280 
weighed my yarn and I have 50 grams of
yard<00:02:46.980> 50<00:02:47.980> grams<00:02:48.190> of<00:02:48.310> yarn<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:49.750> question<00:02:50.140> is

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
yard 50 grams of yarn the question is

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.850 
yard 50 grams of yarn the question is
how<00:02:50.770> many<00:02:51.070> yards<00:02:51.370> in<00:02:51.760> 50<00:02:52.420> grams<00:02:52.690> okay<00:02:53.560> to

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
how many yards in 50 grams okay to

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.180 
how many yards in 50 grams okay to
figure<00:02:54.190> this<00:02:54.370> we<00:02:55.270> want<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.810> look<00:02:56.440> at<00:02:56.800> this

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
figure this we want to look at this

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.100 
figure this we want to look at this
number<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:57.700> this<00:02:58.000> number<00:02:58.060> we<00:02:58.810> want<00:02:58.990> to

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
number and this number we want to

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.850 
number and this number we want to
multiply<00:02:59.520> 200<00:03:00.520> by<00:03:00.880> 50<00:03:01.530> first<00:03:02.530> thing<00:03:02.650> you<00:03:02.710> want

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
multiply 200 by 50 first thing you want

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.740 
multiply 200 by 50 first thing you want
to<00:03:02.890> do<00:03:03.040> go<00:03:03.430> diagonal<00:03:03.970> across<00:03:04.210> the<00:03:04.360> equation

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
to do go diagonal across the equation

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.610 
to do go diagonal across the equation
here<00:03:04.960> 200<00:03:05.740> times<00:03:05.950> 50<00:03:06.340> is<00:03:06.600> 10,000<00:03:07.600> the<00:03:08.320> next

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
here 200 times 50 is 10,000 the next

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.880 
here 200 times 50 is 10,000 the next
thing<00:03:08.770> you<00:03:08.860> want<00:03:09.040> to<00:03:09.100> do<00:03:09.280> is<00:03:09.550> divide<00:03:10.350> 10,000<00:03:11.350> by

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
thing you want to do is divide 10,000 by

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.440 
thing you want to do is divide 10,000 by
the<00:03:11.950> third<00:03:12.490> number<00:03:12.700> in<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.300> equation<00:03:14.010> 100

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
the third number in the equation 100

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.180 
the third number in the equation 100
excuse<00:03:16.450> me

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
excuse me

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.770 
excuse me
so<00:03:18.190> 10,000<00:03:19.000> divided<00:03:19.510> by<00:03:19.600> 100<00:03:20.260> is<00:03:20.380> 100<00:03:21.540> let's<00:03:22.540> go

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
so 10,000 divided by 100 is 100 let's go

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.530 
so 10,000 divided by 100 is 100 let's go
over<00:03:22.960> this<00:03:23.080> again<00:03:24.030> this<00:03:25.030> half<00:03:25.330> of<00:03:25.450> the

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
over this again this half of the

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.780 
over this again this half of the
equation<00:03:25.780> is<00:03:25.990> what<00:03:26.200> we<00:03:26.320> know<00:03:26.500> a<00:03:26.740> full<00:03:27.490> ball<00:03:27.670> of

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
equation is what we know a full ball of

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.920 
equation is what we know a full ball of
yarn<00:03:28.000> is<00:03:28.270> 100<00:03:28.930> grams<00:03:29.140> in<00:03:29.790> 200<00:03:30.790> yards<00:03:31.120> the

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
yarn is 100 grams in 200 yards the

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.200 
yarn is 100 grams in 200 yards the
partial<00:03:32.380> ball<00:03:32.500> of<00:03:32.650> yarn<00:03:32.770> we<00:03:32.980> have<00:03:33.190> is<00:03:33.430> 50<00:03:33.940> grams

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 
partial ball of yarn we have is 50 grams

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.410 
partial ball of yarn we have is 50 grams
and<00:03:34.660> an<00:03:34.930> unknown<00:03:35.350> number<00:03:35.560> of<00:03:35.740> yards<00:03:36.420> we

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
and an unknown number of yards we

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.250 
and an unknown number of yards we
multiply<00:03:38.580> this<00:03:39.580> by<00:03:40.240> this<00:03:40.300> and<00:03:40.870> divide<00:03:41.560> by<00:03:41.740> this

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
multiply this by this and divide by this

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.220 
multiply this by this and divide by this
that<00:03:44.260> lets<00:03:44.620> us<00:03:44.740> finish<00:03:45.130> the<00:03:45.280> equation<00:03:46.230> 100

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
that lets us finish the equation 100
