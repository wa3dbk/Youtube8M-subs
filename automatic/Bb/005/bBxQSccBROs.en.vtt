00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.520
 very good girls very good guys today 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.549
 we are in a new boxing in the 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.320
 channel as you know a lot ago 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.500
 years since we are collaborators of 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.900
 avermedia and good here we have the last 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.630
 acquisition the last of the last of 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.840
 have me today today here you have the 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:31.250
 Extract 3 with a great peculiarity 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:34.930
 not that it's 1080p and 60 frames per second 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.790
 capture at 1080p and at 60 frames per second 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.160
 logically you need a very good 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.730
 computer because it needs a processor 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.280
 very powerful and usb 3.0 until the day of 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.379
 today we could not have it because 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.230
 logically we did not have a computer 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:54.050
 adequate to be able to use it so 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.110
 good avermedia right away we have 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.820
 had computer and know us by 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.430
 good has sent for us to do the 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.410
 review and here you have everything we are going to 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.420
 proceed now to long boxing to see what 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.430
 is what this box contains as it is 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.280
 the capturing and good to see the 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.380
 intricacies and their characteristics and about 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.680
 everything at the end you will have a video of 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.509
 as a capture at 60 frames per second and 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.270
 well this will also serve us for 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.909
 future gameplays can capture 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.979
 logically in games that go to 60 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.600
 frames per second you can do them to that 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.630
 quality and that you have here on the channel 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.009
 well also part of the gameplays 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.380
 fun then also a little bit of 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.420
 quality so thank you all for 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.730
 be there I hope you enjoy the 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.190
 review and see you right now 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.530
 well, we already have the capture 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.060
 extinct q3 on the table we are going to 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.860
 proceed to open it 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.960
 He had already helped me a little bit to 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.200
 open it because it was pretty hermetic 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.810
 so well let's proceed to see what 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.340
 it is what contains its interior 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.490
 logically is the capturing the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.130
 stream capu 3 what good if I have to 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:06.050
 to say something is that it is extremely 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:09.720
 small and extremely beautiful because 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.360
 there you see that it fits in the palm of your hand 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.340
 and I could assure that of all the 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.470
 captured hours of having half already you know 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.680
 that we have been able to prove all this 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.260
 is the most beautiful in terms of design is 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.130
 very neat is very nice on the outside 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.530
 visually it is really very very very 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.150
 pretty what is the box that has 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.950
 is what it contains so good 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.410
 now you will be able to see it on screen 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.670
 logically in the capturing a cable 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:41.970
 USB 3.0 and a component video cable to 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.310
 double stereo audio cable that 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.180
 you can see it there perfectly now 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:51.030
 here is the captor the cable that 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.960
 We will place well and the cable of good 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.570
 so that it goes from the usb 3.0 to so 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.750
 that the feed does not capture 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:03.180
 and a simple guide that can help us 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.620
 Well, good to solve certain 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.780
 quibbles we may have at the time 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.090
 to ride it but good as you are 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.570
 watching is very easy now let's do 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.760
 a close view of the capturing 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.550
 so you can see it good in 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.940
 all its splendor shines is very beautiful and 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.920
 I really tell you, there you see it 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.230
 little girl 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.880
 very good design now we will see in 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.489
 screen technical specifications 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.540
 everything that everything has to do 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:33.319
 you want to ask about 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.819
 connections connections all fine 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.630
 detailed on screen so that you do not 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.070
 lose detail 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.290
 well now you are watching on screen 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.390
 everything that has to do with connections 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.250
 capture formats requirements of 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.980
 system for both windows and mac 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.140
 how are you seeing on the screen 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.730
 I'm going to stop to list each of 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.970
 the things I'm going to name you the most 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.090
 important of this former trinca 3 that is 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:00.540
 a card is a non-usb capture 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.900
 3.0 that is really capable of recording and 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.060
 transmit gameplay in 1080p at 60 fps is 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.120
 remember to record and be able to do 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.180
 streaming at 60 fps is through hdmi and 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.730
 of component input is a 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.730
 capturing that allows good good that 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.799
 hd not capture raw data not 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.290
 say it in some way thanks to his 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.930
 Direct show support only 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.690
 you have to connect the console to the 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.870
 capturing and ready is practically not 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.960
 so simple we can enjoy without 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.030
 lag in 1080p and 60 fps 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.130
 also offers the possibility thanks to 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.700
 the central network of voice comments does not 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:44.470
 you know what 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:48.010
 well you can comment a gameplay to the 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:52.270
 the same time you 're capturing and good 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:53.410
 it is a very easy life not in 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.880
 this sense 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.170
 you can play and record in it 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.970
 monitor because that thanks to usb 3.0 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:03.460
 you can transfer content almost 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.590
 simultaneously to the pc then you can 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.960
 play directly from the window 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.210
 preview not of the software or that is 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.890
 you do not need any other monitor or 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.980
 worry about latency because 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.900
 really low we can work without 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.930
 problems with our favorite software 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:23.020
 and this implies a lot of programs not 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.970
 either explained or bs widecast vlc media 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.160
 player 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:30.700
 etcetera etcetera we will not be able to edit and 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:33.190
 transmit uncompressed hd video with the 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.230
 software that we like no and there 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.780
 comes one thing that I love no and 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:40.930
 is that we can edit with sony vegas and 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.850
 adobe premiere pro of 6 with plugins 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.249
 that come with the package that 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:48.620
 You can download from the website 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:50.630
 these packages provide good 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.850
 a much more fluid operation 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.070
 smart to use the 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:57.350
 video tools audio effects 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:06:00.490
 of these programs so that they do not 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:03.650
 we have any kind of problems and 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:06.699
 definitely another tool that is 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:09.979
 the usb diagnostic tool 3.0 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:11.960
 is included in the software to be able 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:16.490
 test the performance of our port 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:19.000
 usb 3.0 from our pc this does not and 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.410
 check well then well I can 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.680
 show sample to say it of some 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:28.180
 form the usb port of our pc and 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:31.520
 can see if it transmits the data 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:34.789
 correctly if it is failing and 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:38.090
 well you can improve that connection 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:40.910
 some way so good up here 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:43.580
 this a boxing this review if you have 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.800
 some doubt do not hesitate to do it in the 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.300
 comments in the description you already know 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.699
 that we have direct contact with 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:52.760
 avermedia and any questions you may have 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:54.490
 have then try to solve already you know 

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.710
 So nothing 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.840
 I hope you enjoyed it thanks to 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:02.190
 everyone for being there like and favorites and 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.190
