things<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.960> start<00:01:46.140> but<00:01:46.350> as<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.560> game

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
things to start but as the game

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.649 
things to start but as the game
progresses<00:01:47.100> they'll<00:01:47.670> be<00:01:47.700> able<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.970> spec<00:01:48.570> out

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
progresses they'll be able to spec out

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.760 
progresses they'll be able to spec out
there<00:01:48.840> got<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:48.990> little<00:01:49.110> more<00:01:49.320> they'll<00:01:49.500> be<00:01:49.590> able

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
there got a little more they'll be able

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.560 
there got a little more they'll be able
to<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.549> set<00:01:50.700> up<00:01:50.820> their<00:01:50.909> skills<00:01:51.240> everything

however<00:01:51.689> they<00:01:51.930> want<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:54.030> seems<00:01:54.240> tight

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
however they want so so it seems tight

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.240 
however they want so so it seems tight
at<00:01:54.659> first<00:01:54.689> but<00:01:55.110> as<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.380> gameplay<00:01:55.710> expands<00:01:56.100> it

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
at first but as the gameplay expands it

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.399 
at first but as the gameplay expands it
just<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.610> gets<00:01:56.909> wider<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.210> wider<00:01:57.360> oh<00:01:57.689> cool<00:01:58.140> and

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
things that people come out they're

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.300 
things that people come out they're
amazing<00:02:47.080> I<00:02:47.260> think<00:02:47.739> that's<00:02:47.860> a<00:02:47.950> brilliant<00:02:48.040> idea

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
amazing I think that's a brilliant idea

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.470 
amazing I think that's a brilliant idea
because<00:02:48.700> I<00:02:48.790> think<00:02:48.850> one<00:02:49.090> of<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.239> things<00:02:49.300> that

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
because I think one of the things that

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.840 
because I think one of the things that
MMOs<00:02:49.900> are<00:02:50.050> kind<00:02:50.230> of<00:02:50.290> falling<00:02:50.800> short<00:02:51.100> on<00:02:51.310> is<00:02:51.459> the

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
MMOs are kind of falling short on is the

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.490 
MMOs are kind of falling short on is the
frequency<00:02:52.090> of<00:02:52.300> the<00:02:52.390> content<00:02:52.810> so<00:02:53.080> people<00:02:53.110> are

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
frequency of the content so people are

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.110 
frequency of the content so people are
making<00:02:53.650> it<00:02:53.890> and<00:02:54.040> there<00:02:54.370> you<00:02:54.760> have<00:02:54.820> the<00:02:54.910> most

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
making it and there you have the most

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.970 
making it and there you have the most
creative<00:02:55.330> minds<00:02:55.690> out<00:02:55.780> there<00:02:55.930> just<00:02:56.140> working

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
creative minds out there just working

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
kind of parsing system is some guy

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.830 
kind of parsing system is some guy
checking<00:03:57.549> it<00:03:57.760> and<00:03:57.880> then<00:03:58.000> being<00:03:58.120> like<00:03:58.299> this<00:03:58.690> is
