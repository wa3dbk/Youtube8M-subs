shoe<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.899> thought<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.020> was<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.140> nice<00:00:49.350> touch

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
shoe I thought it was a nice touch

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.430 
shoe I thought it was a nice touch
because<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.010> brings<00:00:50.340> back<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:51.030> Mike<00:00:51.809> Michael

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
because it brings back the Mike Michael

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.900 
because it brings back the Mike Michael
Jordan<00:00:52.739> looked<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.039> he<00:00:53.190> wore<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.610> court

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
Jordan looked that he wore on the court

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.670 
Jordan looked that he wore on the court
and<00:00:54.090> then<00:00:54.210> also<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.660> course<00:00:54.870> their

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
and then also of course their

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.560 
and then also of course their
resemblance<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:57.030> clean<00:00:57.300> look<00:00:57.539> that

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
resemblance that the clean look that

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.660 
resemblance that the clean look that
that<00:00:58.109> brought<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.469> shoes<00:00:58.680> out<00:00:58.890> was<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.520> white

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
that brought the shoes out was the white

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.950 
that brought the shoes out was the white
laces<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.270> me<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.420> think<00:01:02.510> going<00:01:03.510> back<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.870> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
laces to me I think going back to the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.210 
laces to me I think going back to the
bin<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.769> fives

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
bin in fives

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.590 
bin in fives
so<00:01:06.000> anyways<00:01:06.570> there<00:01:06.960> they<00:01:07.110> are<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:08.420> got<00:01:09.420> that

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
so anyways there they are I got that

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.460 
so anyways there they are I got that
right<00:01:09.750> there

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
right there

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.460 
right there
I've<00:01:11.540> only<00:01:12.540> laced<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.990> all<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> way<00:01:13.290> up<00:01:13.320> to

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
I've only laced it all the way up to

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.210 
I've only laced it all the way up to
here

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
here

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.080 
here

gonna<00:01:24.509> be<00:01:24.689> these<00:01:24.900> plastic<00:01:25.439> pins<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:26.460> can<00:01:26.610> pick

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
gonna be these plastic pins you can pick

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.609 
gonna be these plastic pins you can pick
them<00:01:26.909> up<00:01:27.090> from<00:01:28.040> the<00:01:29.040> Container<00:01:29.490> Store<00:01:30.350> so<00:01:31.350> it

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
them up from the Container Store so it

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.810 
them up from the Container Store so it
has<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.950> right<00:01:32.040> there<00:01:32.340> at<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.490> Container

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
has it right there at the Container

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.149 
has it right there at the Container
Store<00:01:32.909> if<00:01:33.869> they<00:01:34.049> don't<00:01:34.200> have<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.380> store<00:01:34.680> locally

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
Store if they don't have a store locally

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.359 
Store if they don't have a store locally
you<00:01:36.000> can<00:01:36.150> actually<00:01:36.329> just<00:01:36.600> get<00:01:36.780> them<00:01:36.900> from

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
you can actually just get them from

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:43.370 
you can actually just get them from
online<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:39.290> that's<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.530> right<00:01:40.680> there<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:42.380> my

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
online and that's it right there so my

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.600 
online and that's it right there so my
pair<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.610> swapped<00:01:45.950> space<00:01:46.950> gems<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.490> I'm

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
pair so swapped space gems that I'm

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.850 
pair so swapped space gems that I'm
actually<00:01:47.820> trying<00:01:48.180> out<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> new<00:01:48.899> formula<00:01:49.649> for

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
actually trying out a new formula for

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.560 
actually trying out a new formula for
the<00:01:49.950> sauce<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.520> think<00:01:50.549> I've<00:01:50.850> got<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.060> narrowed

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
the sauce I think I've got that narrowed

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.999 
the sauce I think I've got that narrowed
down<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.170> way<00:01:52.350> at<00:01:52.470> least<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.829> don't<00:01:52.890> have

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
down so that way at least I don't have

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.280 
down so that way at least I don't have
to<00:01:53.100> buy<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.340> sauce<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.850> can<00:01:53.970> make<00:01:54.119> my<00:01:54.240> own<00:01:54.450> but

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
to buy the sauce I can make my own but

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.780 
to buy the sauce I can make my own but
you<00:01:55.500> can<00:01:55.530> kind<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:55.920> see<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.159> difference<00:01:56.549> ready

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
you can kind of see the difference ready

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.510 
you can kind of see the difference ready
that<00:01:57.540> was<00:01:57.600> just<00:01:57.810> one<00:01:57.960> session<00:01:58.229> but<00:01:59.130> anyways

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
that was just one session but anyways

clear<00:02:17.180> so<00:02:17.590> this<00:02:18.590> is<00:02:18.800> supposed<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.250> be<00:02:19.370> a

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
clear so this is supposed to be a

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.610 
clear so this is supposed to be a
different<00:02:19.670> color<00:02:20.090> right<00:02:20.390> here<00:02:20.690> we<00:02:21.290> all<00:02:21.410> know

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
different color right here we all know

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.710 
different color right here we all know
that<00:02:21.830> I<00:02:22.099> just<00:02:22.819> want<00:02:23.150> to<00:02:23.180> clear<00:02:23.360> it<00:02:23.390> up<00:02:23.569> these

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
that I just want to clear it up these

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.690 
that I just want to clear it up these
are<00:02:23.780> not<00:02:24.140> fake<00:02:24.530> these<00:02:24.709> are<00:02:24.890> just<00:02:25.040> so<00:02:25.220> swamped

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
are not fake these are just so swamped

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.300

so I swapped out the soles on these and

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.259 
so I swapped out the soles on these and

because they're falling apart you can

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:33.460 
because they're falling apart you can
kinda<00:02:32.540> see<00:02:32.569> right<00:02:32.810> there's<00:02:32.989> slight

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
kinda see right there's slight

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.070 
kinda see right there's slight
separation<00:02:34.209> but<00:02:35.209> no<00:02:35.420> everything's<00:02:35.870> on<00:02:36.050> point

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
separation but no everything's on point

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.339
