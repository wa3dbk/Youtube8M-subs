so I'll know I'm gonna have to check it
in<00:05:06.120> the<00:05:06.180> mirror<00:05:06.360> when<00:05:06.870> I<00:05:06.960> get<00:05:07.139> going

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.260

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.810 
because I it's not extremely wet but
it's<00:05:19.410> printed<00:05:20.410> now<00:05:20.560> because<00:05:21.040> I<00:05:21.070> rolled<00:05:21.400> it<00:05:21.580> so

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
it's printed now because I rolled it so

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:28.680 
it's printed now because I rolled it so
late<00:05:22.060> last<00:05:22.300> night<00:05:22.720> so<00:05:26.910> that's<00:05:27.910> why<00:05:28.180> my<00:05:28.360> curls

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
late last night so that's why my curls

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:44.770 
late last night so that's why my curls
are<00:05:28.840> not<00:05:28.960> extremely<00:05:29.410> tight<00:05:29.770> today

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780
