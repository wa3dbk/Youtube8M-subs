color where it has SPF 15 in it as well

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.779

so<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.680> have<00:00:26.130> natural<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.599> also<00:00:27.810> have<00:00:28.140> medium

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
so I have natural and I also have medium

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:34.610 
so I have natural and I also have medium
natural<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:30.060> really<00:00:30.480> fair<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:32.690> medium<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:34.290> a

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
natural is really fair and medium is a

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.869 
natural is really fair and medium is a
lot<00:00:35.010> darker<00:00:35.750> so<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:37.340> mix<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.610> two

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
lot darker so I mix the two

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.020
