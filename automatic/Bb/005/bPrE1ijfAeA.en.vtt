00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.280 
do is using your multimeter you want to
put<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.369> resistance<00:01:09.090> mode<00:01:09.330> if<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:10.020> have

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
put it to resistance mode if you have

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.399 
put it to resistance mode if you have
some<00:01:10.950> kind<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.189> audible<00:01:11.580> alarm<00:01:11.960> that's<00:01:12.960> nice

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
some kind of audible alarm that's nice

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.340 
some kind of audible alarm that's nice
to<00:01:13.619> have<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:14.070> gives<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:15.140> indicator<00:01:16.140> when

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
to have it gives you a indicator when

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.800 
to have it gives you a indicator when
you<00:01:16.470> have<00:01:16.650> continuity<00:01:17.150> and<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.330> want<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.659> put

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
you have continuity and you want to put

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.929 
you have continuity and you want to put
your<00:01:18.930> probes<00:01:19.290> on<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:20.280> connector<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.700> goes

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.830 
clicking sound as
the<00:02:13.370> solenoid<00:02:14.370> inside<00:02:14.609> the<00:02:14.999> relay<00:02:15.359> which<00:02:15.689> is

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
the solenoid inside the relay which is

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.470 
the solenoid inside the relay which is
just<00:02:16.049> a<00:02:16.140> magnetic<00:02:16.439> winding<00:02:17.099> pulls<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.939> relay

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
just a magnetic winding pulls the relay

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.589 
just a magnetic winding pulls the relay
shut<00:02:18.889> and<00:02:19.889> allows<00:02:20.219> it<00:02:20.249> to<00:02:20.549> connect<00:02:21.239> those<00:02:21.359> two

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
shut and allows it to connect those two

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.110 
shut and allows it to connect those two
posts<00:02:21.900> together<00:02:22.019> so<00:02:22.709> if<00:02:23.099> you<00:02:23.430> do<00:02:23.639> not<00:02:23.790> get

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
posts together so if you do not get

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.420 
posts together so if you do not get
continuity<00:02:25.019> and<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.650> don't<00:02:26.099> get<00:02:26.249> that

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
continuity and you don't get that

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.879 
continuity and you don't get that
clicking<00:02:26.909> sound<00:02:26.959> then<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.260> relay<00:02:28.530> is<00:02:28.680> most

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:28.889 
clicking sound then the relay is most

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:32.689 
clicking sound then the relay is most
likely<00:02:29.129> bad<00:02:29.459> and<00:02:29.730> needs<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.209> be<00:02:30.299> replaced
