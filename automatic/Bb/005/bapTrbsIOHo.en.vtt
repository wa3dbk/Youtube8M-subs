00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.890
 special a faithful and little friend a 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:12.650

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.510
 the book is a very small breed dog 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.189
 known around the world maybe 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.500
 thanks to the movies of men 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.930
 in black is one of the most 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.540
 desired by many for their peculiar 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.940
 face because of its small size that makes it 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.190
 apt for apartments and for his charisma 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.269
 lovely that all pop fan 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.430

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:47.070
 if you like this breed of dogs take 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.380
 note because this special puppy is going 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.010
 to reveal everything about him 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:55.320
 [Music] 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.110
 many say that the origin of the book is 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.000
 from england but it's not like that really 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.880
 the puppies are from China 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.699
 england sponsored them around the 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.430
 world 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.770
 If your decision for a dog is for the 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.240
 get a book you have to know that you 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.539
 you are bringing home a small 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.509
 brave the owl is not a scary dog 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:19.310
 in fact for this reason you may have 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.670
 problems with dogs that are older 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:26.090
 that the natural color of the owl is 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.280
 common grayish that everyone knows exist 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.159
 black variants and some other very 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.460
 peculiar but usually the races 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.159
 grayish as I said before the ship is a 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.849
 dog suitable for apartments this due 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.099
 to its small size but do not neglect it 

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:45.860
 tend to have a lot of energy and 

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:49.280
 like to leave especially when they have not yet 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.750
 over 45 years of life will take you 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.649
 many smiles with this little 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.409
 little animal maybe his face prayed maybe 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:00.220
 his bulging eyes or the herd of noise 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.709
 What does he do for his flat nose for the owl 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.429
 have that I do not know what what do I know that 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:06.429
 we all love 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.040
 It is one of the most popular breeds in the world 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:16.640
 and at the intelligence level it occupies the place 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.160
 number 57 are a bit stubborn already 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.220
 Sometimes they do not heed the call of their masters 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.780
 but do not worry they love it very much 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.599
 live with their owners and do not 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.000
 they will separate a lot from you the boom is a 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:31.760
 puppy with a sturdy body a little 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.010
 healthy looks athletic has the coat 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.010
 short and the musculature can reach 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.500
 excel can run very well and 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.470
 also jumping is after a certain age 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.480
 average at 45 years that the putt was 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.880
 he came back a little more calm enjoying 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.519
 of staying resting in an armchair 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.310
 to go outside but this is not 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.290
 means that I should not remove it remember 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.940
 that the vitality of a dog is 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.099
 find in how much time we dedicate 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.540
 so that the deployment all its 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.540
 energies outside our home 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:08.180
 this race is lovely, no doubt for 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:11.630
 me is one of my favorites but the boom 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.640
 it has a counterpart and it's sad but 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.450
 there is another side of the coin with 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.450
 regarding the owl 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.520
 so much tenderness takes its share in this 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.920
 little animal the health they have 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.540
 these dogs is very delicate compared 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.780
 with other races that enjoy more 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.720
 vitality putts are one of the races 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.600
 which are frac and cef wings what it means 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.940
 that his head is very rounded with a 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.060
 snout very short and with very eyes 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:50.900
 protuberant the book has a system 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.030
 very poor respiratory due to this the 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.240
 an owl's respiratory system is 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.820
 compared to a human with asthma ever 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.140
 make the puig work harder than 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.290
 what is due 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.970
 you could cause a cardiac arrest 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.340
 it's not good that you feed it 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:11.620
 exceedingly and this is something that looks very 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:14.480
 often in the overweight pug race 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.090
 they usually eat very measured portions 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.459
 of food followed by a much needed 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.730
 ride to burn calories and make 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.920
 exercise according to your ability a 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.440
 'book' with overweight usually has 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.880
 joint problems and also its 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.190
 respiratory system gets worse 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.370
 keep in mind that a little average weighs 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.080
 between about 8 to 12 kilograms the vessel 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.690
 has a spiral tail that is 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.120
 quite common in them this is due 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.760
 a problem in the column that already with the 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.130
 go from years and inbreeding to 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.410
 which is submitted this race is quite 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.360
 common sometimes affects the 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.470
 joints or other members of the 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:58.440
 animal but normally this does not happen 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:00.840
 for this tension takes good care of the toilet 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.880
 of your wrinkles and your eyes too 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:07.010
 his ears can come to present 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.010
 infections moisture generated 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.860
 1 percent of puppies can 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:15.350
 present a deadly disease 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:18.320
 Exclusive to the race called encephalitis 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.510
 of the owl if your puppy suffers from this 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.670
 disease I have to announce you with 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.800
 pity that your puppy has no salvation 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:29.030
 of this is a genetic disease 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:31.960
 mortal that has no cure I hope not 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.960
 be this your case 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.000
 [Music] 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:42.000
 maybe you get scared for everything you can 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.520
 suffer a puppy and if the truth is that 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.790
 the case of the pool is a bit alarming 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:50.220
 since a healthy dog does not present any 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:54.240
 of the evils that the puig may suffer 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:57.030
 since its birth we are talking about 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.580
 that you are already born with an asthmatic problem of 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:03.120
 that your eyes are so exposed that 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:06.420
 you can have accidents for it and if it is 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.920
 adorable but it should not be like this anymore 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:11.730
 that the quality of life of the puppy 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:15.060
 decreases if you have one at home remember 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:18.480
 that his life is not easy maybe a 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:20.730
 caress or your attention are the only thing 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.100
 that keeps them today sends 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:26.080
 offering you the love and joy that 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:29.500
 nothing else this race can give you 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:33.129
 maybe we should rethink the standards 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.659
 for the races worrying more about the 

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:38.020
 health of our dogs that for their 

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:41.349
 appearance and only then we would not have 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:44.439
 these problems the bus is not the only 

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:47.770
 that suffers these consequences there are 

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:51.870
 even more sad and alarming cases but 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.870
 of that I will speak to you on another occasion 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:58.310
 if today you have a pool or you want 

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:02.150
 have one I hope you have this 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:05.690
 present that these delicate puppies and 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:08.360
 playful admirable and beautiful need 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:10.400
 a lot of you and although you do not believe it

 can give and never forget this the boom

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.900
 of life
