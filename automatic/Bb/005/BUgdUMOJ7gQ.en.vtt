00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.509
 since the micro sound was destroyed 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:31.919
 my memory is disintegrating 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.919
 I stayed too long on the other side 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:38.610
 now it devours my mind by erasing 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.339
 what's left of it 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.579
 My memories are very confusing if 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:48.960
 self-destructing slowly assuming as a 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.960
 I dream to wake up 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.420
 I 'm losing track of time. 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.570
 I do not know what happened before or 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.570
 after 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.630
 everything is spinning in my head 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.300
 Same time 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.980
 It's like watching the same movie being repeated 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:13.590
 several several times 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.590
 a picture chaos sir dem 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.619
 so I've been writing days and nights there 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:23.830
 weeks trying to put my life in the 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.830
 paper 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.670
 if I forgot everything 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:34.210
 the pages mancini mal 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.260
 three months after the fact the investigation 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.450
 to be continued 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:42.370
 in order to determine the cause of the accident 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.770
 which cost 283 lives on a military base 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.390
 of the pentagon 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.220
 Government representatives confirm that 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.950
 authorities work with the 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.810
 researchers to shed light on this 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.560
 horrible tragedy 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.270
 the company also leaving more for now 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.930
 are too busy building another 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.930
 with ten needles 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.820
 I know I will not abandon the 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.660
 experiments 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:17.040
 now that they know what's on the other side 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:19.850
 Look, I do not have to rebuild. 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.850
 my life 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.140
 and without vanity 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:34.810
 as long as I can remember 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.810
 sangay live without it 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:41.470
 detached without his constant presence 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.470
 by my side 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.600
 I could not believe 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.480
 and I've never been so tight in all my 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.480
 life 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.600
 and met 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.600
 a part of me in that sense 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.290
 I cried all day 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.569
 I know it's stupid, damn it. 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.000
 I miss him. 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:08.970
 the book or even months without happening 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:15.709
 Nothing, so I woke up I did not know it was 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:15.709
 hourly to start a new life 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:25.370
 It was so obvious, deep down, I always 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.370
 I knew 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:33.590
 I just needed a little silence 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.590
 to hear what I felt 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.930
 I told the gain that I did not see my 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.430
 future with him 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:49.009
 we go through many difficult times and 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:52.999
 together moments that I want to forget 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:54.999
 he said he understood that he would expect the 

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:59.499
 time it was 

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:59.499
 I know you feel something for him. 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.349
 but it was not that strong 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:12.440
 They welcomed me when I was alone. 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:14.820
 when I was thinking of dying 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:18.930
 They shared the little they had to me 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:26.070
 know or judge in the background knew that 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:28.230
 My place was there with them. 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:31.610
 nozzles in various places 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:35.280
 The team is back at school and it's clean now. 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:38.760
 work at sea and water care 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:43.700
 o are not small swimming 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.700
 money over giving 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.740
 I never talked about my past and never 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:54.599
 they asked 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:58.849
 love me for what I'm a good girl 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:58.849
 weird talking to the holy spirit 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:08.310
 Zamg liked me right away 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.650
 there is something in her big eyes and 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:15.630
 that reminds me of the little girl I 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:17.990
 was I knew he was different since 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:22.910
 that life 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:26.410
 we do not say anything but we both know 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.410
 that we have something in common 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.280
 finally things 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.970
 scary things 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.909
 I say to myself that it's just regret 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.909
 any less 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:49.420
 I do not know it's not true 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:55.960
 is a person who can save this world 

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:59.370
 a little girl I have to prepare her 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.370
 I know I do not have time 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:03.729
 After I can shower 

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.950

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.840
 It's what's happening.
