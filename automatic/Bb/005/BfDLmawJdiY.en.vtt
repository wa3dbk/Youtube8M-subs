really simple attack there it is really

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.979 
really simple attack there it is really
unique<00:03:50.709> view<00:03:51.190> as<00:03:51.400> well<00:03:52.000> but<00:03:52.300> the<00:03:52.450> thing<00:03:52.480> is

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
unique view as well but the thing is

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.600 
unique view as well but the thing is
it's<00:03:53.620> hard<00:03:53.980> to<00:03:54.100> unleash<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.450> attacks<00:03:56.610> because

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
it's hard to unleash the attacks because

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.070 
it's hard to unleash the attacks because
the<00:03:57.700> enemy<00:03:58.030> is<00:03:58.060> always<00:03:58.390> trying<00:03:58.660> to<00:03:58.690> hit<00:03:58.870> you

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.870 
the enemy is always trying to hit you
but<00:03:59.260> that<00:03:59.440> is<00:03:59.650> pretty<00:03:59.920> much<00:04:00.190> it<00:04:00.550> there's

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
but that is pretty much it there's

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.050 
but that is pretty much it there's
nothing<00:04:01.239> else<00:04:01.720> to<00:04:02.050> go<00:04:02.200> over<00:04:02.680> and<00:04:02.950> that<00:04:03.700> was
