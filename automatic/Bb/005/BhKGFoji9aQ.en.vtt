00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
attachable rod handle system I put in

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.709 
attachable rod handle system I put in
brick<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.239> block<00:00:45.510> for<00:00:45.899> 25<00:00:46.350> years<00:00:47.210> so<00:00:48.210> my<00:00:48.390> hands

brick and block for 25 years so my hands

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.380 
brick and block for 25 years so my hands
and<00:00:48.809> arms<00:00:48.929> are<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> little<00:00:49.440> shot<00:00:53.300> angle<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
and arms are a little shot angle the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.489 
and arms are a little shot angle the
hole<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.749> rod<00:00:56.329> takes<00:00:57.329> all<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.690> pressure

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:58.499 
hole in the rod takes all the pressure

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:00.739 
hole in the rod takes all the pressure
off<00:00:58.649> your<00:00:58.859> wrist<00:00:59.129> from<00:00:59.249> being<00:00:59.550> event<00:00:59.789> doesn't

and you're fighting it all day that's

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.940 
and you're fighting it all day that's
where<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.479> pressure<00:01:16.140> isn't<00:01:16.380> your<00:01:16.590> wrist<00:01:16.740> but

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
where the pressure isn't your wrist but

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.649 
where the pressure isn't your wrist but
this<00:01:17.100> keeps<00:01:17.399> your<00:01:17.490> arm<00:01:17.640> straight<00:01:18.030> when<00:01:18.450> lying

right position so

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.260 
right position so
there's<00:01:22.090> no<00:01:22.210> threat<00:01:22.390> around<00:01:22.630> at<00:01:22.900> all<00:01:24.120> you<00:01:25.120> can

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
see definitely fighting a fish it's

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.860 
see definitely fighting a fish it's
gonna<00:01:26.890> have<00:01:27.760> a<00:01:27.790> lot<00:01:27.970> more<00:01:28.000> torque<00:01:28.600> on<00:01:28.840> it

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
gonna have a lot more torque on it

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:53.820 
gonna have a lot more torque on it
pulling<00:01:29.260> back<00:01:29.500> I<00:01:52.260> came<00:01:53.260> up<00:01:53.560> with<00:01:53.590> this

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
pulling back I came up with this

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.060 
pulling back I came up with this

traditional fishing rod holding it in
the<00:01:59.830> normal<00:02:00.220> position<00:02:00.400> and<00:02:00.990> noticed<00:02:01.990> after

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
the normal position and noticed after

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.830 
the normal position and noticed after
some<00:02:02.680> period<00:02:02.920> of<00:02:03.070> time<00:02:03.160> a<00:02:03.369> fishing<00:02:04.000> spinner

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
some period of time a fishing spinner

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.290 
some period of time a fishing spinner
bait<00:02:05.110> that<00:02:05.860> I<00:02:05.920> was<00:02:06.160> experiencing<00:02:06.850> a<00:02:06.970> lot<00:02:07.000> of

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
bait that I was experiencing a lot of

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.990 
bait that I was experiencing a lot of
pain<00:02:07.660> and<00:02:08.050> strain<00:02:08.440> in<00:02:08.830> through<00:02:09.280> my<00:02:09.429> wrists<00:02:09.759> and

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
pain and strain in through my wrists and

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.190 
pain and strain in through my wrists and
through<00:02:10.209> my<00:02:10.360> arm<00:02:10.540> and<00:02:10.899> I<00:02:11.739> started<00:02:12.190> to<00:02:12.310> question

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
through my arm and I started to question

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.040 
through my arm and I started to question
my<00:02:14.200> hand<00:02:14.470> position<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.480> asked<00:02:16.480> is<00:02:16.690> there<00:02:17.020> a

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
my hand position and asked is there a

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.940 
my hand position and asked is there a
better<00:02:17.320> position<00:02:17.620> for<00:02:17.980> my<00:02:18.340> hand<00:02:18.610> to<00:02:18.760> be<00:02:18.910> in<00:02:19.060> and

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
better position for my hand to be in and

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.110 
better position for my hand to be in and
naturally<00:02:20.950> when<00:02:21.160> you<00:02:21.250> look<00:02:21.459> at<00:02:21.610> your<00:02:21.700> hand<00:02:21.970> and

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
naturally when you look at your hand and

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.940 
naturally when you look at your hand and
location<00:02:22.780> and<00:02:22.870> your<00:02:23.020> position<00:02:23.350> in<00:02:23.590> your<00:02:23.650> hand

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
location and your position in your hand

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.729 
location and your position in your hand
as<00:02:24.160> it<00:02:24.430> sits<00:02:24.640> by<00:02:24.880> your<00:02:25.060> side<00:02:25.360> it's<00:02:25.810> straight

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
as it sits by your side it's straight

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.590 
as it sits by your side it's straight
and<00:02:27.489> when<00:02:27.640> you<00:02:27.730> hold<00:02:27.910> your<00:02:28.150> hand<00:02:28.390> it's

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
and when you hold your hand it's

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.280 
and when you hold your hand it's
straight<00:02:29.040> so<00:02:30.040> using<00:02:30.310> this<00:02:30.640> idea<00:02:30.940> I<00:02:31.420> basically

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
straight so using this idea I basically

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.949 
straight so using this idea I basically
came<00:02:32.769> up<00:02:32.830> with<00:02:33.250> a<00:02:33.549> handle<00:02:34.390> that<00:02:34.570> would

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
came up with a handle that would

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.320 
came up with a handle that would
simulate<00:02:35.290> putting<00:02:36.190> your<00:02:36.310> hand<00:02:36.519> on<00:02:36.760> a<00:02:36.850> fishing

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
simulate putting your hand on a fishing

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.390 
simulate putting your hand on a fishing
rod<00:02:37.510> in<00:02:37.810> a<00:02:38.080> straight<00:02:38.380> position<00:02:38.620> it's<00:02:39.190> almost

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
rod in a straight position it's almost

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.890 
rod in a straight position it's almost
like<00:02:39.640> somebody<00:02:40.000> else<00:02:40.150> is<00:02:40.269> holding<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.690> pole

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
like somebody else is holding the pole

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.970 
like somebody else is holding the pole
for<00:02:41.170> me<00:02:41.730> for<00:02:42.730> decades<00:02:43.410> fishing<00:02:44.410> rods<00:02:44.650> have

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
for me for decades fishing rods have

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.370 
for me for decades fishing rods have
virtually<00:02:45.489> gone<00:02:45.670> unchanged<00:02:46.630> in<00:02:46.780> their<00:02:46.959> design

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
virtually gone unchanged in their design

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.870 
virtually gone unchanged in their design
until<00:02:48.280> today
