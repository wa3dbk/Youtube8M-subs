world<00:00:32.950> that<00:00:33.579> was<00:00:33.820> the<00:00:34.030> challenge<00:00:38.160> what<00:00:39.160> if<00:00:39.250> we

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
world that was the challenge what if we

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:41.340 
world that was the challenge what if we
could<00:00:39.640> create<00:00:39.879> something<00:00:40.390> that<00:00:40.629> could<00:00:40.989> really

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
could create something that could really

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.470 
could create something that could really
function<00:00:41.829> with<00:00:42.010> humans<00:00:42.430> and<00:00:42.609> be<00:00:42.760> useful<00:00:42.969> and

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
function with humans and be useful and

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.200 
function with humans and be useful and
so<00:00:44.410> the<00:00:44.530> outcome<00:00:44.890> was<00:00:45.039> this<00:00:45.219> robotic<00:00:45.640> system

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.470 
around it the main idea is that these
four<00:02:13.460> screens<00:02:13.820> look<00:02:14.060> like<00:02:14.270> they're

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
four screens look like they're

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.930 
four screens look like they're
transparent<00:02:15.050> and<00:02:15.350> so<00:02:15.920> to<00:02:15.980> do<00:02:16.220> this<00:02:16.400> we<00:02:16.700> used

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
transparent and so to do this we used

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.180 
transparent and so to do this we used
state<00:02:17.240> of<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.510> art<00:02:17.660> lasers<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.770> huge

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
state of the art lasers and a huge

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.490 
state of the art lasers and a huge
database<00:02:19.670> of<00:02:19.850> photographs<00:02:20.660> of<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.050> model<00:02:21.380> and

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
database of photographs of the model and

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.160 
database of photographs of the model and
we<00:02:21.890> had<00:02:22.100> as<00:02:22.250> a<00:02:22.370> digital<00:02:22.550> layer<00:02:23.120> of<00:02:23.510> information

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
we had as a digital layer of information

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.210 
we had as a digital layer of information
so<00:02:25.160> users<00:02:25.670> could<00:02:26.030> explore<00:02:26.720> all<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.620> experts

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
so users could explore all the experts

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.940 
so users could explore all the experts
that<00:02:28.310> we<00:02:28.490> don't<00:02:28.850> see<00:02:29.210> or<00:02:29.480> understand<00:02:30.140> all<00:02:30.740> the

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
that we don't see or understand all the

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.490 
that we don't see or understand all the
facilities<00:02:31.220> we<00:02:31.610> can<00:02:31.760> find<00:02:32.500> architectural

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
facilities we can find architectural

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.190 
facilities we can find architectural
details<00:02:34.180> something<00:02:35.180> there's<00:02:35.390> concerns<00:02:35.990> about

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
details something there's concerns about

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:43.450 
details something there's concerns about
ours<00:02:36.650> all<00:02:36.980> over<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.610> city<00:02:37.910> and<00:02:38.330> so<00:02:39.080> on<00:02:42.460> these

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
ours all over the city and so on these

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.520 
ours all over the city and so on these
new<00:02:43.790> trends<00:02:44.090> concerning<00:02:44.990> digital

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
new trends concerning digital

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.920 
new trends concerning digital
architecture<00:02:45.820> will<00:02:46.820> become<00:02:47.240> a<00:02:47.480> common

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
architecture will become a common

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.960 
architecture will become a common
feature<00:02:48.170> in<00:02:48.590> public<00:02:49.010> spaces<00:02:49.310> in<00:02:49.550> the<00:02:49.640> future

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
feature in public spaces in the future

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.270 
feature in public spaces in the future
and<00:02:50.240> we<00:02:50.810> thought<00:02:50.990> this<00:02:51.350> environment<00:02:51.890> in<00:02:52.160> the

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
and we thought this environment in the

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.350 
and we thought this environment in the
financial<00:02:52.730> City<00:02:52.940> View<00:02:53.570> Cemetery

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360
