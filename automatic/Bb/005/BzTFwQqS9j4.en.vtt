00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 gold bars to finished product in 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.370
 average about 2 months continuous 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.560
 work 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.730
 first of all the metal is mixed alloy 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.300
 copper and aluminum 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.400
 the more impurities , the lower the sample to 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.230
 make a batch of rings sketch each 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.050
 parts first creates on paper 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.000
 the artist claims the size of the color of gold and 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.100
 even a stone that will decorate the ring and 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.939
 only after this layout is printed on 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.939
 three-dimensional printer 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.369
 for example, this model took leave of hours 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.079
 model wax pattern for the whole picture 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.629
 you need it to create an exact copy 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.550
 silverware on this model will 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:43.339
 make a mold for casting each new 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.339
 party gold jewelry Arise and catch 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:51.149
 on time somewhere both eat 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.250
 half a day in the oven and the cast is ready now in 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.129
 it can pour precious metal 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.180
 few hours and gold straight with the right one 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.549
 form here they are the future of ringlets each 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.680
 Decorating them is difficult to call. 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:07.140
 gold has become the usual yellow 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.420
 it needs to be properly processed hi 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.420
 I filmed a coarser metal particle 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.030
 and now I take off flew layer old already 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.220
 pure metal 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.740
 ready for polishing here everyone 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.200
 Workplace dust by a column not easy 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.689
 and gold to precious metal micro 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.280
 bout cleaning every half hour vacuums 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.090
 itâ€™s not just tools 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.860
 but also the hands are going torn 200 300 and 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.229
 more than anyone dust 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.290
 which for a month is natural 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.270
 again there is a quarter redistribution of such garbage 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.760
 send for recycling and rings on 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.830
 the next stage in this workshop is they are inserted 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.350
 gems and do it 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.380
 manually and under the microscope so thin 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.840
 do not trust the work of the equipment after that 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.549
 the final polished in this tea is not 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.979

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.049
 but for gold to really shine 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.000
 here comes the walnut shells 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.399
 ground to dust it polishes 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.179
 decoration is no worse than velvet after this 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.540
