00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
different to its competitors the cube is

with<00:02:06.240> my<00:02:06.299> purchase<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:07.079> it's<00:02:07.439> just<00:02:07.649> fun<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:07.920> be

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
with my purchase and it's just fun to be

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.889 
with my purchase and it's just fun to be
creative<00:02:08.280> with<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.149> doesn't<00:02:09.330> have<00:02:09.509> all<00:02:09.629> the

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
creative with it it doesn't have all the

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.900 
creative with it it doesn't have all the
features<00:02:10.049> that<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.410> GoPro<00:02:10.830> has<00:02:11.039> however<00:02:11.549> that's

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
features that a GoPro has however that's

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.610 
features that a GoPro has however that's
a<00:02:12.000> really<00:02:12.450> good<00:02:12.599> thing<00:02:12.810> because<00:02:13.049> it's<00:02:13.349> the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
simplicity of it that makes it fantastic

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.479

unclear how to charge it basically when

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.040 
unclear how to charge it basically when
you<00:03:04.520> plug<00:03:04.700> it<00:03:04.850> into<00:03:05.000> a<00:03:05.120> computer<00:03:05.300> to<00:03:05.630> charge

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
you plug it into a computer to charge

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.440 
you plug it into a computer to charge
the<00:03:06.470> light<00:03:06.680> goes<00:03:06.920> from<00:03:06.950> yellow<00:03:07.520> to<00:03:07.820> green<00:03:08.120> to

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
the light goes from yellow to green to

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.240 
the light goes from yellow to green to
let<00:03:08.570> you<00:03:08.690> know<00:03:08.870> when<00:03:09.050> it's<00:03:09.170> done<00:03:09.260> and<00:03:09.650> any

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
let you know when it's done and any

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.400 
let you know when it's done and any
other<00:03:10.490> power<00:03:10.760> source<00:03:11.090> it's<00:03:11.360> just<00:03:11.630> green<00:03:11.960> the

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
other power source it's just green the

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.880 
other power source it's just green the
whole<00:03:12.620> time<00:03:13.180> so<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:14.540> cons<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:15.080> LED<00:03:15.590> light

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
whole time so the cons the LED light

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.710 
whole time so the cons the LED light
isn't<00:03:16.310> very<00:03:16.490> bright<00:03:16.700> on<00:03:16.910> a<00:03:16.940> day<00:03:17.150> like<00:03:17.360> today<00:03:17.420> so

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
isn't very bright on a day like today so

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.420 
isn't very bright on a day like today so
what<00:03:18.050> I<00:03:18.080> recommend<00:03:18.290> doing<00:03:18.710> is<00:03:18.920> turning<00:03:19.310> the

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
what I recommend doing is turning the

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.160 
what I recommend doing is turning the
big<00:03:19.610> sound<00:03:19.850> up<00:03:20.090> a<00:03:20.180> little<00:03:20.360> bit<00:03:20.570> so<00:03:20.990> you<00:03:21.050> can

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
big sound up a little bit so you can

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.110 
big sound up a little bit so you can
hear<00:03:21.560> what<00:03:21.800> functions<00:03:22.220> you're<00:03:22.400> using<00:03:22.610> then

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
hear what functions you're using then

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.480 
hear what functions you're using then
make<00:03:23.360> sure<00:03:23.570> you<00:03:23.720> re<00:03:24.050> turn<00:03:24.350> them<00:03:24.590> back<00:03:24.770> down<00:03:25.040> for

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
make sure you re turn them back down for

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.230 
make sure you re turn them back down for
when<00:03:25.640> you<00:03:25.760> go<00:03:25.910> inside<00:03:26.270> and<00:03:26.540> want<00:03:27.110> to<00:03:27.200> film<00:03:28.240> so

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
when you go inside and want to film so

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.730 
when you go inside and want to film so
this<00:03:29.390> camera<00:03:29.720> isn't<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:30.020> best<00:03:30.170> in<00:03:30.350> low-light

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
this camera isn't the best in low-light

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.920 
this camera isn't the best in low-light
however<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.250> footage<00:03:31.550> is<00:03:31.730> usable<00:03:32.300> if<00:03:32.750> you

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
however the footage is usable if you

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.440 
however the footage is usable if you
have<00:03:33.140> no<00:03:33.350> choice<00:03:33.620> I<00:03:33.950> use<00:03:34.460> a<00:03:34.490> plug-in<00:03:34.850> to<00:03:35.180> remove

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
have no choice I use a plug-in to remove

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.690 
have no choice I use a plug-in to remove
noise<00:03:35.690> and<00:03:36.080> the<00:03:36.350> info<00:03:36.740> is<00:03:36.920> in<00:03:36.950> the<00:03:37.160> description
