00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.379
 life is shorter brother the whole thing 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:10.980
 it means everyone there are different problems 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.660
 of the people here and now here I am trying 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.870
 to replace 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:19.080
 lower arm lever lower suspension 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.930
 front on the classics here and meet up with 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.930
 such a task that turns me 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:28.109
 lower arm bolt 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:30.740
 what in such cases do the first could 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.559
 step was that I was mated and in short 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.059
 the second step man came up with it will not 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.390
 very clearly visible but I will try 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.489
 explain everything comes to wants shorter 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.050
 the lower arm we have here with this 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.850
 sides this bolt this applies to 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.870
 left block to the right such a hole is not 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:56.370
 found shorter than this our lower arm 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:58.289
 this is a screwdriver any screwdriver than 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.350
 we make here two holes here 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.620
 one goes like a dick knows the lever that 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.540
 whether 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:09.150
 protection by 2 in front of her here she is there 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.320
 such as if he were for what he seemed 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.450
 there must be 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.229
 poyan shorter but do not know how to 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.650
 called the manufacturing process so 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.710
 say this whole thing here he has to 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.659
 be welded but he was not there welded 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.350
 what we do we stupidly put in there 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.619
 screwdriver and this garbage we do not 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:35.610
 scrolls 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:38.490
 here it is damn how to show here 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.270
 directly itself then heads china 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.020
 they will show 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:48.289
 we don't have enough light not enough 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.259
 That is, well, you understand that in two 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:54.590
 holes can be seen yes and almost see this bolt 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:57.399
 insert a screwdriver and unscrew like this 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.399
 here you can turn off 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:05.799
 scrolling bolt axle lower arm 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.799
