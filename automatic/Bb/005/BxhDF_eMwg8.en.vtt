00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.290
 I have a friend of crops that does not live 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.990
 distant from me is a beautiful morning me 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.750
 he calls and tells me I 'm in the apiary but not 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:27.100
 there flight was in ten in the morning at 25 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:29.050
 degrees impossible and I run into the square 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.180
 that I had closer to home indeed 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:38.410
 no ceravolo what had happened were 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:41.500
 disappeared so many ap we are due 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.469
 run away at night to bring these 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.960
 bees in a secure location in one 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.879
 nature reserve was underway 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.219
 apple blossom and flowering 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.050
 contextual of the dandelion we had to 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.510
 make this move for 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.309
 avoid creating you continued to 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.410
 import this toxic substance 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.820
 within their real we are 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.530
 we started with this adventure 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.899
 with the organic after the episodes of the year 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.840
 last that francesco will be told the 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:09.880
 conviction no longer returned ideological but 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.810
 we are asked for a different product ho 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.380
 started going on the internet call 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.659
 the national beekeeping institute 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.030
 go on the internet to see and I have 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.880
 discovered this terrible word 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.270
 neonicotinoid which is a type of 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.310
 pesticide that came and also comes 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.380
 currently used even if fit 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.509
 different on corn and I didn't think that 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.369
 and that the neighbor's grass could ruin 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.890
 my garden happy thing that it is instead 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.360
 happened bearing a small apiary for 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.000
 carry out routine work and the 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.490
 marking of the scheme in that case on the 18th 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.049
 to open I was with a workout 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.240
 in progress 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.840
 ap death on the bottom of the dead bees 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.579
 on the running foot dead bees dying in front 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.770
 more were found at the cash desks 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.210
 neonicotinoid active ingredients in 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.030
 particular this that I found some 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.390
 midal cover associated starter 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.610
 xantia netina there are two years a 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.310
 understand that at that time they sowed the 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.989
 Corn and when sowed the corn 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.959
 beehives we had near corn 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.599
 they lost the bees the moment the 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.120
 corn was sown the maize seed 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.190
 it was covered with a powder 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.989
 and this powder while the farmer 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.970
 he sowed and scattered over the whole 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.400
 territory surrounding our bees 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.360
 nectar water was collected from 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.790
 small flowers at the edges of fields in the meadows 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.620
 close to the cornfields and straight line 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.900
 they are organisms must neither more nor less 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.569
 all other organisms recover 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.850
 these matrices from the campaign etc and the 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.920
 bring the hive in that case the bees 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.170
 they lost orientation as obviously 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.299
 and explained the science to me 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.160
 have been in contact with these pesticides e 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.959
 I didn't fit anymore , I evaluated you 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.109
 in the years of poisoning in cases 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.269
 worst in a few days had one 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.519
 disappearance of bees that in number yes 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:03.109
 could obviously quantify a lot 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:05.060
 spans between 18 and 25 thousand t party of 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:06.850
 this pollen poisoned the bees if they did 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.989
 they brought pollen home 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.950
 fundamental to feed their nars 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.069
 said the little ones 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.640
 then giving the little ones to eat of 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.260
 poisoned food was born of little creatures 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.840
 deformed width that were thrown away 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.360
 out in front of the hive bees than not 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.090
 they were born and the hive to a balance 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.640
 which is very important to maintain and therefore 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.150
 but when we had that kind of 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.400
 poisoning died nor died so many 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.739
 how they die because of custom 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:43.349
 they worked but they were not born 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:45.360
 last year of wild bumblebees that 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:48.690
 were years that I had not seen so bumblebees 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:52.739
 many of them work for free and to me them 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.750
 go kill killed the la 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.819
 crazy efficiency of this one of this 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.569
 animal efficiency of the animal 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:02.370
 single in itself and of the super organism of 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.599
 super hive organism we have 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.519
 installed here can a station of 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:09.329
 monitoring with a module of three beehives 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:11.599
 see that they have three blue boxes in front 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:15.359
 these blue boxes are traps 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:17.579
 under basket of net and we can read 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:20.459
 the fall of the dead bees dying with 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:23.880
 any symptoms from poisoning or in 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.520
 course or I have just occurred in fact the 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.830
 sim in that surrounding territory 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.930
 then it was done in 3 4 days then 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.910
 my ap had that damage I could 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.560
 say perennial for having flown only between 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.510
 four days on that territory to the 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.919
 beyond the aim of which we could very well 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.900
 do without 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.820
 with this going from flower to flower 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:46.830
 allies against pollination 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:49.050
 in the orchard or in the small fruits 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:53.510
 children must enter to play with 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:57.660
 Mica dogs have a place and 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:59.280
 inhospitable and also ugly to see 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.680
 I ask the minister for agriculture there 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.750
 European commission to protect ap 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.340
 agriculture by prohibiting the use of 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.669
 insecticides harmful to the 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:11.190
 as a beekeeper but as a person I ask 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.870
 to the Italian government to the Europe of 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.729
 block the use of these pesticides 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.470
 that make bees die and 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:18.800
 compromise the future of ours 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.800
 agriculture
