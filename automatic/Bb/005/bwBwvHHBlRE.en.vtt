00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello very good to all welcome to 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.520
 your home welcome giving crol 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.319
 we return to the axis stand since we 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.639
 we had left some little thing that I 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.429
 I think it's interesting that we tell you 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.099
 from here today we come with the axis I am the 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.109
 entry access terminal the more 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.160
 economic of the axis family that we 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.570
 has presented in this world mode 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.080
 congress we are going to teach it now 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.220
 same 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.390
 Well, we started seeing this 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.070
 on the outside as you are seeing we are 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.810
 before a small terminal not only range 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.460
 low but also accompany him the 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.230
 dimensions since it has a 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.820
 4 inch screen and that makes 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.830
 the whole body is relatively 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.960
 measured in terms of dimensions but 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.309
 not so restrained eye is in regards to his 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.680
 thickness as you are seeing we are facing 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.320
 a relatively thick terminal for 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.489
 for the days that are good and what 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.649
 you are seeing the design in the part 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.390
 front is not any innovation is 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.280
 pretty much the axis style we know it 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.379
 and most of us are not 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.120
 too disruptive and on the other hand 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.489
 back we found a plastic material 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.230
 a certain roughness yes that is true 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.510
 different from what we have seen with others 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.670
 terminals from the mid-range shaft to me 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.800
 particularly it seems to me even 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.510
 better this roughness the material 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.339
 plastic than not when it's totally 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.409
 smooth at least it gives me feeling 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.149
 of better grip and grip with this 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.770
 device as you see here in the part 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.960
 back we also have the camera without 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.819
 flash led you have seen it we do not have 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.829
 no flash is usually relatively 

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:18.630
 usual in low-end terminals and in 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:20.640
 the bottom part although we have it a 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.170
 tidy covered by this anchor we 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.329
 we found with the speaker of 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.159
 device on this occasion in the part 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:27.750
 back if we go to one of the 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.340
 lateral we find in the classic 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.560
 unlock button I think it's 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.179
 in the best possible location arrives 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.130
 perfectly to your thumb 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:37.289
 right hand and it will be very simple 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.090
 lock and unlock the terminal in the 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.709
 another side find the button 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.899
 go up and down volume too pretty 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:44.369
 accessible and at the top as is 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.409
 usual here there are no surprises the chat 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.939
 from 3 to 5 in the hardware section 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.170
 here yes we quickly realize 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.819
 that we are facing a terminal range 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.369
 low why because we have a 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:56.489
 dual core dual-core processor running 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.379
 to 1,2 and aerios and also accompany 512 

00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:59.819
 megas de ram good then we understand 

00:01:58.379 --> 00:02:02.280
 we are in front of one of the terminals 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:04.289
 more accessible that we find in this 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.640
 new batch although obviously these 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.530
 they are preaching that you have to go 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.810
 with a little bit of care since we know 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.640
 that are good is a bit justito system 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.920
 of storage we found 4 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.200
 gigas of storage and on the battery 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.850
 we have 900 thousand milliamps to me 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.470
 honestly it does not leave me bad 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.270
 sensations that have 900 thousand 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.950
 milliamps as we always have to 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.620
 try it but remember we are facing a 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.050
 low-end terminal and access for 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.610
 this device important things in 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.110
 how much connectivity are you seeing 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.180
 here, well, we did not find any 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.800
 boast we have wifi connectivity we have 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.600
 bluetooth but obviously we do not have 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.390
 things that usually accompany the ranges 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.370
 medium and high as connectivity 4g or 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.050
 for example something like the guy in 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.850
 already talk about software and 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.520
 this is where good as we put on a 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.730
 little suspicious at least we found the 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.050
 4.4 version kitkat the vast majority of 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.400
 terminals that we are finding the 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.890
 mobile world congress come with 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.480
 lollipop understand that by requirements of 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.519
 hardware we mentioned earlier 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.430
 only 512 megabytes of ram and a processor 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.260
 dual-core because probably lollipop not 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.239
 run excessively well with this 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.100
 device but it's also true that 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.200
 many users as is the market 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.390
 engines and company that already come with 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.760
 lollipop find a new terminal 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.190
 appeared with kitkat pos is the least 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.300
 a tad worrisome nonetheless 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.980
 having this version as you are 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.110
 watching the device runs at a thousand 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.340
 wonders is not the latest version but 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.600
 the truth is that it works works without 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.120
 problem is saying multitasking 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.160
 classic multitasking that had the axis in 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.770
 tic-tac pressures area a tad 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.910
 other than lollipop applications this 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.400
 yes that seems a bit logical and 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.200
 we found the classic settings like 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.630
 you are seeing we also have is good 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.120
 classic box divided into applications 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.950
 now yes and widgets that obviously 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.690
 we can also reorder and we can go 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.690
 modifying therefore the software 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.280
 it works fine although we repeat again 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.900
 is running the fifth version 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.000
 logical for the screen we offer the 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.520
 terminal principle compact terminal 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.140
 small and they are four to the inches of 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.320
 this device the resolution that has 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.090
 wv gea a good resolution that makes 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.830
 time since it did not run much at least 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.450
 for these parts but good nonetheless 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.330
 to think that a screen of 4 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.850
 inches this gives us 233 pixels per 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.190
 inch which is decent if we do not do 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.660
 a very heavy multimedia consumption that does not 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.549
 I think it 's the target of the users 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.989
 who are going to count this device 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.640
 we have the experience as you are 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.860
 looking pretty quite acceptable 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.030
 also the amount of brightness is to run 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.039
 is consistent at least in the 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.689
 light conditions that we have here and 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:30.240
 as always we will try it a little bit 

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:32.490
 later on camera issue here we have 5 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.069
 megapixels for this device already os 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.319
 we said earlier that we do not have 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:39.419
 LED flash on the back and good 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:40.860
 Well you are seeing the camera is therefore 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.449
 justita as it is usually in all 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.310
 low-end terminals to take out 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:45.599
 some punctual photograph it will remove 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.849
 of the step but obviously it is very 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:49.110
 justita and just like we do not have big 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:50.939
 Well, we do not have a camera either 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.469
 front for the celtics we already put 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:54.810
 you have seen this camera device 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:56.759
 economic terminal access we do not have 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.990
 very cheap closed price has to be 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:00.120
 I also tell you so I can 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.129
 compete with interesting options like 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.900
 a new engine and yet I think that at 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:06.150
 minus the axis has made an effort to 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.560
 also reach this target of users 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.150
 as always I hope you liked it 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.659
 the video we see very soon that go 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.659
 well chao
