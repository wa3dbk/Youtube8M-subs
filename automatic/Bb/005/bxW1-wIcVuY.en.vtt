of that which is really good that's what
I<00:01:24.810> look<00:01:25.020> for<00:01:25.729> uniqueness<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:27.150> something<00:01:27.479> else

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
I look for uniqueness is something else

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.450 
I look for uniqueness is something else
I<00:01:27.780> look<00:01:27.960> for<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.409> guy<00:01:28.650> did<00:01:29.310> something

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
is obviously photoshopped but it's

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.080 
is obviously photoshopped but it's
really<00:01:34.380> unique<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.340> works<00:01:35.579> really<00:01:35.909> well

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090

a nice vignette it's muted it's pulled
back<00:01:44.130> slightly<00:01:44.369> but<00:01:44.700> it's<00:01:44.790> kind<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.000> nice<00:01:45.180> one

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
back slightly but it's kind of nice one

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.410 
back slightly but it's kind of nice one
of<00:01:45.509> those<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:46.170> know<00:01:46.259> late<00:01:46.939> afternoon<00:01:47.939> dusk

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
of those you know late afternoon dusk

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.990 
of those you know late afternoon dusk
when<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.409> light<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.829> Sun<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.130> going<00:01:50.280> down<00:01:50.430> and

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
when the light the Sun is going down and

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.969 
when the light the Sun is going down and
it's<00:01:51.119> just<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.450> different<00:01:51.930> color<00:01:52.259> it's<00:01:52.470> amazing

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
it's just a different color it's amazing

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.920 
it's just a different color it's amazing
what<00:01:53.130> can<00:01:53.159> be<00:01:53.310> done<00:01:53.520> with<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.820> raw<00:01:53.970> files<00:01:54.299> when

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
what can be done with the raw files when

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.090 
what can be done with the raw files when
you<00:01:55.140> know<00:01:55.229> we<00:01:55.439> weren't<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.860> actual

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
you know we weren't in the actual

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.069 
you know we weren't in the actual
situation<00:01:56.820> but<00:01:57.000> we<00:01:57.090> can<00:01:57.210> edit<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.780> see<00:01:58.049> the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
situation but we can edit it and see the

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.319 
situation but we can edit it and see the
differences<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.729> are<00:01:59.850> there<00:02:00.119> so

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
differences that that are there so

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.420 
differences that that are there so
really<00:02:00.840> awesome<00:02:01.229> right<00:02:01.560> there<00:02:01.590> here's

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
really awesome right there here's

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.039 
really awesome right there here's
another<00:02:02.610> one<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.850> mean<00:02:03.030> we<00:02:03.119> can<00:02:03.270> see<00:02:03.450> we<00:02:03.810> can<00:02:03.840> see

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
another one I mean we can see we can see

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.090 
another one I mean we can see we can see
the<00:02:04.170> difference<00:02:04.469> here<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:04.860> less

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
the difference here this is less

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.889 
the difference here this is less
contrast<00:02:05.610> II<00:02:05.790> this<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.030> more<00:02:06.299> contrast<00:02:06.810> see

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
contrast II this is more contrast see

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.930 
contrast II this is more contrast see
this<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.170> little<00:02:07.530> bit<00:02:07.740> over<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.129> top<00:02:08.160> but<00:02:08.580> I

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
this is a little bit over the top but I

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.029 
this is a little bit over the top but I
like<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.300> realistic<00:02:09.959> colors<00:02:10.349> here<00:02:10.590> on<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.860> on

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
like the realistic colors here on the on

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.070 
like the realistic colors here on the on
the<00:02:11.069> sand<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.760> believe<00:02:12.599> they<00:02:12.720> said<00:02:12.900> they<00:02:12.989> were

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
the sand I believe they said they were

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.850 
the sand I believe they said they were
going<00:02:13.200> for<00:02:13.440> more

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
going for more

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.850 
going for more
more<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.820> um<00:02:17.180> midday<00:02:18.180> look<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.350> know<00:02:19.470> so

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
more of a um midday look and you know so

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.820 
more of a um midday look and you know so
they<00:02:20.160> pumped<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:20.820> up<00:02:20.910> there<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.240> I<00:02:21.300> like<00:02:21.480> it

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
they pumped it up there and I like it

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.650 
they pumped it up there and I like it
this<00:02:22.830> is<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.010> cool<00:02:23.250> crop<00:02:23.580> I<00:02:23.790> really<00:02:24.150> think<00:02:24.480> it's

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
this is a cool crop I really think it's

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.420 
this is a cool crop I really think it's
an<00:02:24.780> interesting<00:02:25.080> crop<00:02:25.500> obviously<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.370> looks

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
an interesting crop obviously it looks

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.820 
an interesting crop obviously it looks
like<00:02:26.640> it's<00:02:26.880> a<00:02:26.970> little<00:02:27.000> bit<00:02:27.510> of<00:02:27.720> an<00:02:27.930> HDR<00:02:28.410> image

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
like it's a little bit of an HDR image

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.850 
like it's a little bit of an HDR image
interesting<00:02:29.580> colors<00:02:29.910> it's<00:02:30.300> very<00:02:30.660> very<00:02:31.080> harsh

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
interesting colors it's very very harsh

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.640 
interesting colors it's very very harsh
in<00:02:32.220> terms<00:02:32.820> of<00:02:33.000> contrast<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:34.080> being<00:02:34.230> punchy

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
in terms of contrast and being punchy

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.380 
in terms of contrast and being punchy
but<00:02:34.860> hey<00:02:35.070> you<00:02:35.670> know<00:02:35.760> I<00:02:35.790> just<00:02:35.970> wanted<00:02:36.180> to<00:02:36.240> point

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
but hey you know I just wanted to point

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.760 
but hey you know I just wanted to point
it<00:02:36.510> out<00:02:36.600> there's<00:02:36.840> all<00:02:37.050> different<00:02:37.080> ways<00:02:37.590> to

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
it out there's all different ways to

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.580 
it out there's all different ways to
edit<00:02:38.010> that<00:02:38.130> file<00:02:38.430> uh<00:02:38.970> I<00:02:39.270> like<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.080> colors<00:02:40.410> on

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
edit that file uh I like the colors on

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.020 
edit that file uh I like the colors on
this<00:02:40.709> also<00:02:40.980> even<00:02:41.370> though<00:02:41.400> they're<00:02:41.580> muted

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
this also even though they're muted

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.460 
this also even though they're muted
because<00:02:42.390> that's<00:02:42.690> how<00:02:42.810> they<00:02:42.930> were<00:02:43.020> muted<00:02:43.380> in

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
because that's how they were muted in

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.170 
because that's how they were muted in
the<00:02:43.560> first<00:02:43.770> place<00:02:43.980> but<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.550> thought<00:02:44.850> it<00:02:44.940> was<00:02:45.030> a

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
the first place but I thought it was a

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.660 
the first place but I thought it was a
good<00:02:45.900> representation<00:02:46.650> of<00:02:47.010> what<00:02:47.070> this<00:02:47.459> could

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
good representation of what this could

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.120 
good representation of what this could
look<00:02:47.730> like<00:02:47.940> when<00:02:48.390> tweaked<00:02:48.810> this<00:02:49.740> is<00:02:49.890> just<00:02:50.070> a

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
look like when tweaked this is just a

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.680 
look like when tweaked this is just a
very<00:02:50.310> simple<00:02:50.550> oh<00:02:50.790> this<00:02:50.970> is<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.209> one<00:02:51.330> I<00:02:51.360> think

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
very simple oh this is the one I think

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.180 
very simple oh this is the one I think
said<00:02:51.900> they<00:02:51.930> went<00:02:52.140> for<00:02:52.320> a<00:02:52.380> midday<00:02:52.650> thing<00:02:53.040> they

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
said they went for a midday thing they

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.520 
said they went for a midday thing they
put<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.489> lens<00:02:53.700> flare<00:02:54.090> in<00:02:54.360> here<00:02:54.690> or<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.260> Sun

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
put the lens flare in here or the Sun

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.520 
put the lens flare in here or the Sun
flare<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.239> just<00:02:57.239> another<00:02:57.660> it's<00:02:58.080> amazing<00:02:58.320> how

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
flare and just another it's amazing how

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.870 
flare and just another it's amazing how
we've<00:02:58.739> looked<00:02:58.890> at<00:02:59.010> five<00:02:59.250> or<00:02:59.430> six<00:02:59.670> different

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
we've looked at five or six different

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.720 
we've looked at five or six different
ones<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:01.110> none<00:03:01.739> of<00:03:01.770> them<00:03:01.980> are<00:03:02.130> exactly<00:03:02.550> the

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
ones and none of them are exactly the

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.510 
ones and none of them are exactly the
same<00:03:02.760> so<00:03:03.480> that<00:03:03.600> just<00:03:03.780> shows<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.520> the

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
same so that just shows you the the the

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.740 
same so that just shows you the the the
amount<00:03:05.790> of<00:03:05.850> edits<00:03:06.180> that<00:03:06.239> can<00:03:06.390> be<00:03:06.480> done<00:03:06.600> to

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
amount of edits that can be done to

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.080 
amount of edits that can be done to
landscapes<00:03:07.260> are<00:03:07.410> just<00:03:07.620> incredible<00:03:08.100> this<00:03:08.880> is

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
going on here but I just thought it was

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.890 
going on here but I just thought it was
unique<00:03:17.220> to<00:03:17.489> play<00:03:17.910> with<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.180> different<00:03:18.269> colors

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
unique to play with the different colors

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.060 
unique to play with the different colors
and<00:03:18.930> it<00:03:19.290> kind<00:03:19.500> of<00:03:19.530> looks<00:03:19.680> like<00:03:19.739> different

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
and it kind of looks like different

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.440 
and it kind of looks like different
currency<00:03:20.519> from<00:03:20.640> different<00:03:21.060> parts<00:03:21.299> of<00:03:21.390> the

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
currency from different parts of the

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.539

world you know Canadians I got that red
thing<00:03:23.580> I<00:03:23.940> think<00:03:24.209> I<00:03:24.390> don't<00:03:24.600> know<00:03:24.690> who<00:03:24.810> has<00:03:25.019> it

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.400 
thing I think I don't know who has it
but<00:03:25.380> it<00:03:26.010> was<00:03:26.130> a<00:03:26.160> nice<00:03:26.280> job<00:03:26.610> nice<00:03:27.150> edit<00:03:27.510> there<00:03:27.810> I

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
it's the best of the four and I'm not

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.229 
it's the best of the four and I'm not
just<00:03:44.010> saying<00:03:44.100> that<00:03:44.310> because<00:03:44.400> I<00:03:44.730> took<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:45.090> I

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
just saying that because I took it I

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:46.699 
just saying that because I took it I
just<00:03:45.810> think<00:03:45.959> it's<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.170> best<00:03:46.290> of<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.530> four

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
just think it's the best of the four

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.580 
just think it's the best of the four
because<00:03:47.010> he<00:03:47.100> did<00:03:47.220> a<00:03:47.250> cool<00:03:47.459> pose<00:03:47.700> and<00:03:48.120> all<00:03:49.110> that

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
because he did a cool pose and all that

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.080 
because he did a cool pose and all that
but<00:03:49.739> maybe<00:03:49.950> it<00:03:50.100> is<00:03:50.190> because<00:03:50.340> I<00:03:50.610> took<00:03:50.670> it<00:03:50.970> I

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
but maybe it is because I took it I

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.150 
but maybe it is because I took it I
don't<00:03:51.360> know<00:03:51.540> um<00:03:51.870> I<00:03:52.260> just<00:03:52.320> like<00:03:52.650> that<00:03:52.799> picture<00:03:53.010> I
