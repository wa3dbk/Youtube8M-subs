to zero degrees at the core okay I'm

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.560 
to zero degrees at the core okay I'm
going<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.680> demonstrate<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.340> soft<00:01:17.640> automatic

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
going to demonstrate the soft automatic

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.209 
going to demonstrate the soft automatic
cycle<00:01:18.899> which<00:01:19.020> uses<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.530> probe<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.070> is

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:20.219 
cycle which uses the probe and is

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:22.010 
cycle which uses the probe and is
automatic<00:01:20.820> based<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.329> the<00:01:21.479> temperature<00:01:21.810> of

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
automatic based on the temperature of

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.690 
automatic based on the temperature of
the<00:01:22.110> product<00:01:22.500> first<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.250> would<00:01:23.399> select<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
the product first I would select the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.580 
the product first I would select the
soft<00:01:24.000> cycle<00:01:24.540> now<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.110> see<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.500> the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
soft cycle now you see that the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.590 
soft cycle now you see that the
automatic<00:01:25.950> immanuel<00:01:26.549> buttons<00:01:26.850> flash<00:01:27.149> I<00:01:27.390> hit

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
automatic immanuel buttons flash I hit

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.179 
automatic immanuel buttons flash I hit
the<00:01:27.689> automatic<00:01:28.259> button<00:01:28.439> which<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.890> I'm<00:01:29.070> going

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
the automatic button which is I'm going

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.889 
the automatic button which is I'm going
to<00:01:29.250> use<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.520> probe<00:01:29.789> which<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.479> machine<00:01:30.750> will

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
to use the probe which the machine will

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:32.929 
to use the probe which the machine will
control<00:01:31.310> automatically<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.610> now<00:01:32.759> I'm<00:01:32.820> gonna

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
control automatically and now I'm gonna

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.899 
control automatically and now I'm gonna
hit<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.149> stop<00:01:33.390> button<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.960> now<00:01:34.710> will<00:01:35.369> put<00:01:35.759> some

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
hit the stop button I now will put some

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.690 
hit the stop button I now will put some
broccoli<00:01:36.360> in<00:01:36.590> to<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.680> chiller<00:01:37.950> I'm<00:01:38.430> going<00:01:38.640> to

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
broccoli in to the chiller I'm going to

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.190 
broccoli in to the chiller I'm going to
take<00:01:38.850> my<00:01:39.000> pro<00:01:39.270> but<00:01:39.479> I'm<00:01:39.539> going<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.719> insert<00:01:40.020> it

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
take my pro but I'm going to insert it

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.110 
take my pro but I'm going to insert it
into<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.009> core<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.579> my<00:01:42.240> broccoli

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
into the core of my broccoli

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.890 
into the core of my broccoli
I<00:01:44.180> now<00:01:44.870> can<00:01:45.080> close<00:01:45.290> the<00:01:45.530> door<00:01:45.710> and<00:01:46.660> the<00:01:47.660> unit

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
I now can close the door and the unit

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.200 
I now can close the door and the unit
will<00:01:48.020> run<00:01:48.260> until<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.010> broccoli<00:01:49.250> hits<00:01:49.640> 37

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
will run until the broccoli hits 37
