00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.930
 hello guys and girls very good of all 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.730
 what is it like and if you are welcome 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.170
 to the youtube channel of goltv 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.480
 I am to be as you can find in 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.430
 twitter for these 10 and in this video 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.619
 let's analyze a super video game 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.330
 super addictive pimp that's called 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.789
 touch geometry and that by the way I 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.740
 recommended my friend totti from the channel 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.449
 youtube from aiam takster or that you 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.919
 I recommend visiting because they have very 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.750
 good application recommendations 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.920
 also good because nothing will analyze 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.690
 a little bit the video game has two 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.610
 parties on the one hand let's play a 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.900
 super addictive video game with the 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.730
 graphics are nothing fancy 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.410
 we have lots of screens like 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.760
 you are seeing we have all these 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.320
 screens let's play the first one that 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.430
 is the one that I have played the most as you see 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.780
 reached 85 to 81 percent advance 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.430
 in the video game we are going to play a 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.960
 little bit so you can see it as subjugation 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.790
 we just have to touch the 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.740
 screen when we touch the screen of 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.630
 this way to fix that we jump to fix 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.490
 that we keep the screen pressed to 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.530
 jump several times we have to go 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.390
 overcoming the different obstacles this 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.490
 is the philosophy of the video game the truth 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.650
 is that it seems very simple but when 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.140
 we started playing you can not stop 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.120
 Play is a super super addictive game 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.659
 where we have to get to the end to 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.609
 pass us 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.109
 this mission that by the way I still do not 

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:18.999
 I've had it, but we're going to 

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:20.590
 back off let's go to the menu we're going to 

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:22.119
 go to play another mission so that 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.609
 see a little bit how to play let's go 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.859
 go for example to this one here that I 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:28.689
 I played a little bit to see how to see how 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:30.009
 these seem to see if you like not the 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.649
 it's really super complicated 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:35.259
 we have to go to pÃ©rez is very complicated 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.700
 because there are different traps that we 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.159
 are going to make jump in moments where no 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.240
 we need to jump us mother of mine is 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.399
 which is super complicated to see what 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.500
 we do here good this is the video game 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.929
 super super addictive where you have to 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.489
 As you can see, it is progressing in these 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:50.590
 missions but also has a second 

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:52.869
 pretty cool part because these maps 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.610
 we can do it ourselves we have 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.709
 here a creator this little button of the 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.629
 right is to create maps set that 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:00.610
 we can go to filters and from here 

00:01:58.629 --> 00:02:02.679
 we could see then online maps that has 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.000
 created people from the community and that the 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:05.079
 truth is that they are pretty cool and 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.049
 quite and we say so this 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:09.849
 videogame is a non-stop art of 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.500
 enjoyment and creativity we are not going to 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.150
 play for example to this map here 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.010
 so randomly so you can see a little bit 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.690
 for the maps that you can do all this 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.180
 what can you do in the creator 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.470
 of maps as you see to see now not as 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.810
 not how are we going to create a map 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.700
 and let's get out of here and let's see 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.440
 kate and notice that from here I have 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.240
 already created a map of sanÃ¡ flakes two 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.400
 polis giving the new to create a new one 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.350
 note that we are going to give you to see this 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.270
 map fix that we could avoid it from 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.490
 such that we are going to be able to go 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.320
 putting obstacles to fix that we can 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.420
 advance in this way and we could 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.010
 select obstacles and put the 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.900
 no and well when we got our map 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.840
 made simply let's give it 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.730
 to save and play and you will see what 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.220
 we can create this map to 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.390
 our taste to put challenges to 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.130
 our friends who have this 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.959
 video game to see if they are capable of 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.730
 pass it on not a video game like I say 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.260
 super super addictive that will do the 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.780
 techniques of all players like 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.040
 I always tell you not the truth is that this 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.660
 it is more is to reflect a little bit on 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.180
 the games that we have 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.320
 these days are not very good games that 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.990
 they really have spectacular graphics 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.870
 but sometimes the gameplay is not 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.700
 as much as they want to give us to understand 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.190
 sometimes so simple games with graphics 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.780
 as simple as this can be a lot 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.610
 more addictive than they can be 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.800
 games that seem more professional to 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.150
 simple view not really a super 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.560
 video game that I recommend to all 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.270

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.280
