00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.850 
Bulls my matchup was they're gross and
this<00:00:08.910> could<00:00:09.120> have<00:00:09.210> possibly<00:00:09.780> been<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:10.380> last

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
this could have possibly been the last

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.860 
this could have possibly been the last
time<00:00:11.250> that<00:00:11.429> I<00:00:11.550> was<00:00:11.670> coming<00:00:11.940> off<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.150> bench<00:00:12.480> and
