00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
840 SSD just got this the other day and

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.160 
840 SSD just got this the other day and
got<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.609> installed<00:00:17.970> last<00:00:18.330> night<00:00:19.010> did<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:21.170> fresh

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
got it installed last night did a fresh

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.099 
got it installed last night did a fresh
install<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.519> operating<00:00:24.090> system<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.840> I

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
install of the operating system and I

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.179 
install of the operating system and I
wiped<00:00:25.470> my<00:00:25.619> old<00:00:26.250> drive<00:00:27.470> to<00:00:28.470> just<00:00:28.680> use<00:00:28.890> as

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
wiped my old drive to just use as

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.339 
wiped my old drive to just use as
storage<00:00:29.910> for<00:00:29.939> everything<00:00:30.630> else<00:00:30.779> it's<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.170> 2

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
storage for everything else it's a 2

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.280 
storage for everything else it's a 2
terabyte<00:00:31.560> that's<00:00:32.160> what<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.369> had<00:00:32.610> before

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
terabyte that's what I had before

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.639 
terabyte that's what I had before
so<00:00:34.739> now<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:34.890> have<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.190> 120<00:00:35.910> gig<00:00:36.090> SSD<00:00:36.390> for<00:00:37.230> my<00:00:37.380> boot

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
so now I have a 120 gig SSD for my boot

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.010 
so now I have a 120 gig SSD for my boot
and<00:00:38.120> my<00:00:39.590> main<00:00:40.590> programs<00:00:41.460> as<00:00:41.910> well<00:00:42.180> as<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.450> two

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
and my main programs as well as the two

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.139 
and my main programs as well as the two
terabyte<00:00:43.320> for<00:00:43.770> everything<00:00:44.250> else<00:00:44.399> that's<00:00:45.000> why

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
terabyte for everything else that's why

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.529 
terabyte for everything else that's why
our<00:00:45.180> storage<00:00:45.539> goes<00:00:45.950> but<00:00:47.180> it<00:00:48.180> should<00:00:48.390> be<00:00:48.510> a

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
our storage goes but it should be a

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.110 
our storage goes but it should be a
quick<00:00:48.780> comparison<00:00:49.020> here<00:00:49.800> I'll<00:00:50.370> throw<00:00:50.640> them<00:00:50.940> up

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
quick comparison here I'll throw them up

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.380 
quick comparison here I'll throw them up
side-by-side<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.199> can<00:00:52.469> see<00:00:52.829> how<00:00:53.820> fast<00:00:54.149> it

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
side-by-side and you can see how fast it

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.340 
side-by-side and you can see how fast it
is<00:00:55.550> just<00:00:56.550> from<00:00:56.760> using<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.420> far<00:00:57.719> it's<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.140> lot

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
is just from using it so far it's a lot

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.799 
is just from using it so far it's a lot
faster<00:00:58.879> my<00:01:00.020> computer<00:01:01.020> rating<00:01:01.829> or<00:01:02.250> whatever

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
faster my computer rating or whatever

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.690 
faster my computer rating or whatever
experience<00:01:03.809> rating<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.470> up<00:01:04.799> much<00:01:05.670> higher

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
experience rating is up much higher

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.160 
experience rating is up much higher
hopefully<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.450> didn't<00:01:06.659> just<00:01:06.780> screw<00:01:06.900> up<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
hopefully I didn't just screw up the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.330 
hopefully I didn't just screw up the
audio<00:01:07.439> there

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
audio there

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.410 
audio there
I'm<00:01:09.030> opening<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.600> computer<00:01:10.380> quick<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.420> we'll

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
I'm opening the computer quick and we'll

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:21.410 
I'm opening the computer quick and we'll
see<00:01:12.780> go<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.409> properties<00:01:17.330> so<00:01:18.330> yeah<00:01:19.880> 7.6<00:01:20.880> vs.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
see go to properties so yeah 7.6 vs.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.770 
see go to properties so yeah 7.6 vs.
what<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.780> was<00:01:21.930> which<00:01:22.320> was<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.920> was<00:01:23.040> 5.9<00:01:23.909> on<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
what it was which was it was 5.9 on the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.100 
what it was which was it was 5.9 on the
hard<00:01:25.080> drive<00:01:25.350> last<00:01:25.680> time<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.220> now<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.869> at

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
hard drive last time and now that is at

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.380 
hard drive last time and now that is at
7.9<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.070> believe<00:01:30.049> so<00:01:31.049> yeah<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:32.850> hard<00:01:33.150> drive

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
7.9 I believe so yeah the hard drive

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.920 
7.9 I believe so yeah the hard drive
itself<00:01:33.509> was<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.619> bottleneck<00:01:35.250> before<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.970> now

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
itself was the bottleneck before and now

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.780 
itself was the bottleneck before and now
I<00:01:36.960> believe<00:01:37.380> my<00:01:38.600> CPU<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.720> RAM<00:01:39.810> are<00:01:40.200> both<00:01:40.380> at<00:01:40.790> 7.6

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
I believe my CPU and RAM are both at 7.6

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.840 
I believe my CPU and RAM are both at 7.6
I<00:01:42.240> haven't<00:01:42.810> overclocked<00:01:43.649> anything<00:01:44.130> yet<00:01:44.340> but<00:01:44.670> I

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
I haven't overclocked anything yet but I

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.910 
I haven't overclocked anything yet but I
might<00:01:45.149> do<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.329> down<00:01:45.689> line<00:01:46.020> but<00:01:46.649> anyways

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
might do that down line but anyways

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.149 
might do that down line but anyways
here's<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:48.229> comparison<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.470> see<00:01:50.009> for

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
here's the comparison and see for

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.539 
here's the comparison and see for
yourself

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.350 

alright<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.579> don't<00:01:53.880> know<00:01:53.939> if<00:01:54.060> I'm<00:01:54.149> gonna<00:01:54.270> use

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
alright I don't know if I'm gonna use

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.399 
alright I don't know if I'm gonna use
this<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.200> here<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.950> just<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:57.170> short<00:01:58.170> simple

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
this so here is just a short simple

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.039 
this so here is just a short simple
video<00:01:58.920> clip<00:01:59.219> I'm<00:02:00.060> not<00:02:00.240> going<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.479> do<00:02:00.600> too<00:02:00.630> much

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
video clip I'm not going to do too much

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.770 
video clip I'm not going to do too much
talking<00:02:01.520> just<00:02:02.520> showing<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.149> shutdown

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
talking just showing the shutdown

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.800 
talking just showing the shutdown
startup<00:02:04.850> pre<00:02:05.899> SSD<00:02:06.899> this<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.530> with<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:08.810> 2

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
startup pre SSD this is with a 2

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.450 
startup pre SSD this is with a 2
terabyte<00:02:10.640> Seagate<00:02:11.640> hard<00:02:11.879> drive

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.750 

7,200<00:02:15.460> I<00:02:15.580> believe<00:02:15.820> it<00:02:15.910> is<00:02:16.060> let's<00:02:16.900> just<00:02:17.020> do<00:02:17.290> a

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
7,200 I believe it is let's just do a

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:25.650 
7,200 I believe it is let's just do a
restart<00:02:19.890> see<00:02:20.890> how<00:02:20.950> fast<00:02:21.220> this<00:02:21.460> works<00:02:24.660> all

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
restart see how fast this works all

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.360 
restart see how fast this works all
right<00:02:25.720> I'm<00:02:25.930> gonna<00:02:26.050> do<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.320> voiceover<00:02:26.800> here<00:02:27.100> as<00:02:27.220> I

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
right I'm gonna do a voiceover here as I

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.360 
right I'm gonna do a voiceover here as I
had<00:02:27.490> a<00:02:27.520> long<00:02:27.820> period<00:02:27.850> of<00:02:28.540> just<00:02:28.810> silence<00:02:29.350> so<00:02:30.130> as

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
had a long period of just silence so as

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.710 
had a long period of just silence so as
you<00:02:30.490> can<00:02:30.610> see<00:02:30.670> on<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.060> right<00:02:31.210> side<00:02:31.480> with<00:02:31.690> the

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
you can see on the right side with the

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.020 
you can see on the right side with the
SSD<00:02:32.170> it's<00:02:32.560> much<00:02:32.800> faster<00:02:33.100> even<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.760> shut<00:02:34.000> down

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
SSD it's much faster even to shut down

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.780 
SSD it's much faster even to shut down
which<00:02:34.450> is<00:02:34.600> good<00:02:35.040> you're<00:02:36.040> gonna<00:02:36.190> see<00:02:36.490> pretty

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
which is good you're gonna see pretty

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.270 
which is good you're gonna see pretty
quick<00:02:37.060> here<00:02:37.420> some<00:02:38.320> other<00:02:38.470> screens<00:02:39.010> that<00:02:39.190> I

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
quick here some other screens that I

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.000 
quick here some other screens that I
didn't<00:02:39.610> actually<00:02:39.790> have<00:02:40.270> before<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:41.020> I<00:02:41.740> think

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
didn't actually have before and I think

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.530 
didn't actually have before and I think
that<00:02:42.160> goes<00:02:42.340> along<00:02:42.490> with<00:02:42.640> this<00:02:42.910> setup<00:02:43.180> I<00:02:43.390> have

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
that goes along with this setup I have

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.930 
that goes along with this setup I have
with<00:02:43.690> my<00:02:43.810> SSD<00:02:44.200> currently<00:02:44.860> but<00:02:45.400> I<00:02:45.430> should<00:02:45.790> be

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
with my SSD currently but I should be

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.910 
with my SSD currently but I should be
able<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.209> get<00:02:46.390> rid<00:02:46.540> of<00:02:46.660> that<00:02:46.840> especially<00:02:47.470> this

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
able to get rid of that especially this

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.970 
able to get rid of that especially this
one<00:02:48.160> now<00:02:48.370> that<00:02:48.580> you're<00:02:48.670> seeing<00:02:48.910> loadings

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
one now that you're seeing loadings

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.250 
one now that you're seeing loadings
operating<00:02:50.980> system<00:02:51.340> I<00:02:51.430> believe<00:02:51.670> it<00:02:51.760> is<00:02:51.880> I

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
operating system I believe it is I

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.440 
operating system I believe it is I
should<00:02:53.260> be<00:02:53.290> able<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.620> remove<00:02:53.920> that<00:02:54.450> screen

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
should be able to remove that screen

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.420 
should be able to remove that screen
altogether<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:56.350> that'll<00:02:56.560> save<00:02:56.709> me<00:02:56.770> even<00:02:57.220> more

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
altogether and that'll save me even more

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.570 
altogether and that'll save me even more
time<00:02:57.730> but<00:02:58.510> even<00:02:58.720> with<00:02:59.200> all<00:02:59.500> of<00:02:59.680> that<00:03:00.160> extra

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
time but even with all of that extra

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.070 
time but even with all of that extra
screens<00:03:01.510> and<00:03:01.690> everything<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.910> SSD<00:03:04.510> is<00:03:04.540> still

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
screens and everything the SSD is still

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.190 
screens and everything the SSD is still
faster<00:03:05.709> including<00:03:06.610> that<00:03:06.790> time<00:03:07.090> so<00:03:07.780> on<00:03:08.080> the

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
faster including that time so on the

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.600 
faster including that time so on the
left<00:03:08.410> with<00:03:08.620> my<00:03:08.680> old<00:03:08.980> hard<00:03:09.220> drive<00:03:09.459> without

left with my old hard drive without
those<00:03:09.940> screens<00:03:10.360> I'm<00:03:10.870> already<00:03:11.230> on<00:03:11.560> that<00:03:12.040> page

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
those screens I'm already on that page

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.260 
those screens I'm already on that page
and<00:03:12.580> I<00:03:12.670> just<00:03:12.700> got<00:03:13.209> over<00:03:13.510> to<00:03:13.690> it<00:03:13.840> with<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.709> SSD

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
and I just got over to it with the SSD

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.850 
and I just got over to it with the SSD
but<00:03:16.270> as<00:03:16.750> you<00:03:16.930> can<00:03:17.050> see<00:03:17.230> it<00:03:17.320> didn't<00:03:17.530> even<00:03:17.650> have<00:03:17.800> a
