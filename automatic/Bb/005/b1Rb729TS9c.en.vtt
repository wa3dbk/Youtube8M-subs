00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
bolts to free up the skylight assembly

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.240 
bolts to free up the skylight assembly
here<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.600> we<00:01:39.780> can<00:01:39.990> push<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.380> out<00:01:40.590> six<00:01:40.890> inches

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
here so we can push it out six inches

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.660 
here so we can push it out six inches
and<00:01:41.720> you<00:01:42.720> know<00:01:42.840> basically<00:01:43.380> get<00:01:43.650> this<00:01:44.250> bolt

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
and you know basically get this bolt

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.120 
and you know basically get this bolt
right<00:01:44.940> here<00:01:45.350> because<00:01:46.350> as<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.560> can<00:01:46.710> see<00:01:46.770> this

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
right here because as you can see this

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.360 
right here because as you can see this
bolt<00:01:47.370> is<00:01:47.780> right<00:01:48.780> here<00:01:48.990> look<00:01:49.800> how<00:01:49.950> long<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.280> is

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
bolt is right here look how long it is

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.400 
bolt is right here look how long it is
and<00:01:50.610> it's<00:01:51.120> not<00:01:51.270> gonna<00:01:51.390> come<00:01:51.630> out<00:01:51.810> if<00:01:52.170> you're

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
and it's not gonna come out if you're

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.570 
and it's not gonna come out if you're
trying<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.680> take<00:01:52.830> it<00:01:52.980> out<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.220> here

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
trying to take it out of here

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.820 
trying to take it out of here
so<00:01:53.730> you<00:01:54.390> got<00:01:54.510> to<00:01:54.600> push<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:54.930> forward<00:01:54.990> just

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
so you got to push this forward just

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.130 
so you got to push this forward just
like<00:01:55.980> so<00:01:56.420> because<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.570> don't<00:01:57.720> have<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.930> bolt

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
like so because I don't have the bolt

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.660 
like so because I don't have the bolt
there<00:01:58.380> that's<00:01:58.650> why<00:01:58.830> I'm<00:01:58.920> able<00:01:59.010> to<00:01:59.190> move<00:01:59.430> this

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
there that's why I'm able to move this

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.260 
there that's why I'm able to move this
so<00:02:00.560> basically<00:02:01.560> move<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.040> six<00:02:02.370> inches<00:02:02.520> as<00:02:03.060> much

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
so basically move it six inches as much

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.230 
so basically move it six inches as much
as<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.570> need<00:02:03.720> to<00:02:03.750> move<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.170> don't<00:02:04.620> go<00:02:04.920> crazy

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
as you need to move it don't go crazy

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.290 
as you need to move it don't go crazy
because<00:02:06.240> you'll<00:02:06.570> throw<00:02:06.870> off<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:08.300> spindle

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
because you'll throw off the spindle

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.900 
because you'll throw off the spindle
basically<00:02:09.899> but

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
basically but

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.290 
basically but
other<00:02:12.180> than<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:12.600> yeah<00:02:13.530> once<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:14.070> do<00:02:14.250> that

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
other than that yeah once you do that

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.940 
other than that yeah once you do that
you<00:02:15.300> know<00:02:15.420> just<00:02:15.600> wiggle<00:02:15.960> it<00:02:16.050> out<00:02:16.230> it'll<00:02:16.590> come

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
you know just wiggle it out it'll come

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.730 
you know just wiggle it out it'll come
out<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.060> heavy<00:02:18.300> so<00:02:18.600> watch<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.080> kind<00:02:19.650> of

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
out is heavy so watch it kind of

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.640 
out is heavy so watch it kind of
dropped<00:02:20.040> on<00:02:20.190> my<00:02:20.310> finger<00:02:20.670> there<00:02:21.410> let<00:02:22.410> me<00:02:22.500> show

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
dropped on my finger there let me show

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:30.050 
dropped on my finger there let me show
you<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:22.890> other<00:02:23.010> side<00:02:27.350> now<00:02:28.640> this<00:02:29.640> is<00:02:29.880> what<00:02:30.030> I

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
you the other side now this is what I

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.290 
you the other side now this is what I
was<00:02:30.210> talking<00:02:30.450> about<00:02:30.660> so<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:32.090> remember<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.120> was

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
was talking about so I remember I was

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.200 
was talking about so I remember I was
saying<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.660> go<00:02:33.780> in<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.020> order<00:02:34.110> which<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:34.800> didn't

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
saying to go in the order which I didn't

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.000 
saying to go in the order which I didn't
so<00:02:36.210> this<00:02:36.420> I<00:02:36.810> basically<00:02:37.410> went<00:02:37.560> ahead<00:02:37.710> and

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
so this I basically went ahead and

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.780 
so this I basically went ahead and
unbolted<00:02:38.820> this<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.260> did<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.620> took<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.460> bolt<00:02:41.670> out

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
unbolted this I did I took the bolt out

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.880 
unbolted this I did I took the bolt out
of<00:02:41.970> here<00:02:42.210> I<00:02:42.360> just<00:02:42.990> basically<00:02:43.170> put<00:02:43.590> this<00:02:43.710> in

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
of here I just basically put this in

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.650 
of here I just basically put this in
here<00:02:44.010> so<00:02:44.250> he<00:02:44.310> can<00:02:44.610> basically<00:02:44.940> just<00:02:45.360> hold<00:02:45.540> the

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
here so he can basically just hold the

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.160 
here so he can basically just hold the
assembly<00:02:46.400> so<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.730> took<00:02:47.910> all<00:02:48.180> these<00:02:48.330> bolts<00:02:48.690> out<00:02:48.810> I

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
assembly so I took all these bolts out I

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.700 
assembly so I took all these bolts out I
already<00:02:50.160> took<00:02:50.280> this<00:02:50.490> bolt<00:02:50.760> out<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:52.230> then<00:02:52.440> once

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
I'm done with that when I try to go

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.260 
I'm done with that when I try to go
ahead<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.130> pull<00:02:56.280> this<00:02:56.430> out<00:02:56.610> it<00:02:56.850> doesn't<00:02:57.090> want

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.700 
ahead and pull this out it doesn't want
to<00:02:57.330> come<00:02:57.390> out<00:02:57.600> because<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.110> ball<00:02:58.290> joint<00:02:58.590> is

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710
