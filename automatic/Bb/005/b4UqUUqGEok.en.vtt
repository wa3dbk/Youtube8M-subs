00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:10.500
 a new review this time about the anime 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:12.570
 date alive in dayton live is about 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.160
 young china experiences together with his 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.260
 little sister in a city the 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.970
 Often this gives to space 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.199
 have an unknown origin and 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.820
 hurt and kill again and again 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.570
 People 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.279
 luckily, the humans could 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.199
 Machines are developing around space 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.340
 to predict and so they can 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.230
 always on time in safety 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.550
 bring 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.289
 one day, sheen makes an appointment 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.520
 his sister is exactly this 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.500
 day will come to give space 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.450
 warning and as she has promised him 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.010
 waiting for him he believes that she 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.620
 not retired to a bunker 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.969
 has and he is looking for her 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.250
 he lands in the middle of a space to whom 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.180
 and what he sees there were astonished 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.190
 he meets a girl 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.140
 superpowers and shortly thereafter come too 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.070
 still other girls with fight suits the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.140
 fight against them 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.030
 but then he is even more surprised 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.399
 the fact that he is from a secret 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.050
 Organization learns that the girls 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.710
 to shake space with the superpowers 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.750
 trigger 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.670
 and there are only two possibilities 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.680
 To prevent either one kills the 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.189
 girl with the super powers or 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.080
 mandated them I first anticipated needs 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.760
 say that I had fun with the anime 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.799
 and he entertained me, too 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.259
 nevertheless he has some weaknesses over the 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.880
 you can not just look away 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.070
 first to history this had 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.570
 so far hardly a right to exist 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.200
 was only told about a basic premise 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.490
 but never gets treated more accurately 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.100
 you do not know why china is the only one 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.900
 is that the girls dated why some 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.990
 Girls have powers where they come from 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.400
 what your goals are you have to be as 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.680
 Just look at all these facts 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.180
 I do not suppose that either 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.320
 that these questions in later stages 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.390
 someday be clarified 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.250
 you just needed an introduction 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.590
 later the hair history around 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.340
 introduce china 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.290
 Guido is also learning pretty fast 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.579
 quite a few girls know and 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.470
 At some point there will be no new ones 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.570
 but built again and again the 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.890
 same only with the difference that 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.719
 Now you are with several girls 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.340
 meet and know at the same time 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.590
 Of course, nothing from each other and should 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.670
 nothing know about each other get 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.240
 We also sometimes to the positive 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.710
 points 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.899
 I really liked the anime 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.340
 good by only having one 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.080
 low number of girls meets 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.030
 could be more accurate on the individual girl 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.100
 be received and even if 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.330
 do not deny 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.370
 that the single girl the 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.020
 classic stereotypical match-making 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.910
 it's always fun for the individual 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.250
 to track down that they are strong 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.630
 differ from each other 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.430
 a funny component that also 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.020
 was built is the linkage of 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.480
 a dating game with the 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.980
 There are also dates taking place 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.150
 again and again next to stories too 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.040
 the individual characters or 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.720
 Conflicts among the girls for 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.200
 all sorts of action-packed moments worry 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.550
 which then offer a little variety 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.930
 Finally, I can only say that 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.820
 the optics do not blame themselves 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.100
 can let and musically great 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.210
 entertaining is never more so has 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.800
 quite his weaknesses 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.690
 but I still find it entertaining 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.550
 And that's always the most important thing 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.630
 and that's why he gets animated by me 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.800
 77 out of 100 points 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.990
 the anime is certainly not a masterpiece 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.670
 and he does not stay long-lived 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.560
 I would remember in all 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.230
 hair fans among you in any case 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.620
 recommend and thus conclude and until 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.620
 next time
