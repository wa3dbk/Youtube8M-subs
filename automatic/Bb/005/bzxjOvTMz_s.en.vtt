00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.719
 related to what we are preparing 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.010

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.399
 at home so you take one of the ingredients 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.149

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.610
 proportions 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.280

 insisted up to collapse to 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.740
 really got our infusion 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.960
 some water yes our welding so-called 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.020
 cools down to a pleasant temperature for us 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.150
 no need to lower annoyed pens 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.040
 we let some hot water 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.890
 warm pleasant for you as much as possible 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.159

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.869

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.060
 minutes we get pens and for some water and 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.369
 moisturize good moisturizer 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.350
 the second recipe is a hand mask 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.050
 which I also apply of course with me 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.790
 there are purchase masks on sometimes advice 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.970
 mighty want to do something myself 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.130
 I want to mix some ingredients 5 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.790
 same which i can easily find u 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.820
 yourself at home 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.330
 so I actively applied this winter 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.290
 very mask of two ingredients first 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.690
 the ingredient is 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.510
 we only need one egg yolk 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.510
 and the second ingredient is two teahouses 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.510
 spoons of honey and so we mix these two 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.940
 ingredient until smooth consistency 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.790
 then apply well on the handles on the handle 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.890
 dry naturally then wrap 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.820
 film or 2 polyethylene 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.280
 gloves 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.210
 and of course we need this mask very much 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.880
 warm well 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.010
 for this we either dress terry what 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.480
 what mittens 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.970
 towel mi can try we can 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.460
 wear cotton gloves and 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.050
 special given spa treatments viz 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.870
 all that you have all that you have 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.730
 on hand you can use it 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.890
 leave for approximately 20 30 minutes 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.780
 then wash off with warm water 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.670
 again the same moisturizer and 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.850
 actually after this masochka 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.459
 the handles are very smooth moisturized and the most 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.340
 the main mask is absolutely harmless to 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.080
 your skin brings only benefit well and 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.270
 now we have moved to the third recipe 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.260
 this does not really apply to 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.850
 folk remedies 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.459
 It has long been used in 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.310
 cosmetology is very actively used 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.290
 in expensive salons and this is 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.020
 fairly expensive procedure if 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.030
 do it all in the cabin and so we 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.560
 do we need the most ordinary 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.290
 cosmetic paraffin 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:35.459
 means paraffin us applied in order 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.950
 to improve enhance the impact of the cream 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:41.130
 of this remedy to the caretaker 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.320
 skin from paraffins are created enough 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.810
 such greenhouse conditions for our skin 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.880
 deep into the skin the deep layers they become 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.870
 more available for cream 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.700
 then the pores expand from paraffin here 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.250
 all this cream starts to penetrate 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.630
 will skin hydration occurs deeper 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.110
 what are we just here 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.840
 inflicted cream left does not mean 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.580
 besides all this paraffin is actually 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.260
 that's what it's good for his face 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.870

 flatten out when here we are shooting 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.600
 paraffin is all very noticeable in general
