00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:21.770
 Let us now work on another type of 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:26.480
 very important opening 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:29.750
 what is app 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.369
 so here we have this part of 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.369
 en this part that is bent 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.750
 there in modeling classes in a 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.070
 explanation of how we do for 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.800
 build the petta and this carpet she can 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.170
 be made and simply fold makes the 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:54.239
 more finish 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.100
 It is very used for the first interlining 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.530
 get harder and look more handsome 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.350
 work between the screen can be applied 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:07.590
 this part can also be applied 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:09.390
 this part depends on the interest and 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.850
 work you are developing from having 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.770
 been cited working because if by 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.470
 a transparent fabric I apply in 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.740
 I intend here when I fold what to play 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.600
 A shadow here will appear here . 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.180
 other side but if I 'm working 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.790
 How I'm working as cotton? 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.430
 shadow is insignificant but with the 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:34.430
 work with a more delicate fabric 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.430
 that 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.650
 is to take the beauty of the play 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.049
 so let's go first thing to 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.530
 people are going to do it here now is to spend a 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:47.659
 Hot iron to learn this entry. 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.570
 her in the tissue 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.190
 her company is already fixed on facebook 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.970
 already near the state né 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:59.360
 with warm weather for management and heat 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:03.350
 certain pressure has already been 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.830
 made fold here and we will fold one 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:10.269
 second time to build the chapel there 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:13.700
 now has no job, there's a 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:18.040
 just a cult and I came here to 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:20.890
 avoid clamping the stepping foot in 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.209
 presser miss a smart owner of 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.970
 just start 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:29.959
 there is no need in our case to 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:35.100
 backspace neither at the bottom 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:38.460
 or at the top is only the sack's hard 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.970
 7 was very close 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.970
 on here 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.150
 our capeta is ready and I come back to 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.920
 insist with you 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.500
 The goal is to work with the 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.540
 white line today exclusively and exclusively 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.760
 to draw your attention to the 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.580
 seams 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.890
 this is a type of theta we have 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.760
 others do we can make this okay 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:25.190
 separate black make with other fabric 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.530
 imagine you are our only fabric 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.620
 I could make it so far that I need it 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.770
 looks that the more tissue that 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.510
 so much and more the departure was of brahmos né 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:40.270
 so I see, I can do this 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.270
 separately and an example 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:56.400
 in this case, we have a 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:04:00.480
 and the fabric was 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.329
 it was little of interest to design this 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:07.260
 Special rug, but it's clear to you. 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:10.290
 choice was an amendment that behind the plan 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.049
 I could not go up here to bend 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.920
 It was only so far that he did not leave the small 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.560
 space 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.859
 look at what you did to save fabric at 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.750
 Sometimes you will buy a wide piece 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.630
 but I already feel more then you 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.600
 can do this use the cushion as 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:31.020
 object decoration part of the piece and 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:35.490
 using it, I believe that this 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:38.669
 there is an amendment here and it has doubled and turned 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.580
 by now understood 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:43.560
 another type of da pt 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.789
 imagine what I wanted to do 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:50.729
 this tapestry more as different as 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:53.340
 It's so in the face at the moment the shirts 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:55.800
 a road with a print with a 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.470
 different size carpet or just the 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.310
 internal part of the loss of a new 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.590
 print 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:09.680
 So this is nice, this is fashion is the 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.680
 face of the moment is using moment
