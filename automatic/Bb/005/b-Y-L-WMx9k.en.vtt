there is a red cheeks red nose rosacea

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.419 
there is a red cheeks red nose rosacea
in<00:01:07.780> the<00:01:08.020> beginning<00:01:08.409> rosacea<00:01:08.799> is<00:01:09.009> very

00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:09.429 
in the beginning rosacea is very

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:12.090 
in the beginning rosacea is very
superficial<00:01:09.810> but<00:01:10.810> some<00:01:11.409> property<00:01:11.890> the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
superficial but some property the

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.279 
superficial but some property the
pathogenesis<00:01:12.520> or<00:01:12.969> Robuchon<00:01:13.450> goes<00:01:13.780> into<00:01:14.170> the

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:14.289 
pathogenesis or Robuchon goes into the

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:17.010 
pathogenesis or Robuchon goes into the
deeper<00:01:14.590> tissue<00:01:14.859> and<00:01:15.250> then<00:01:15.789> rosacea<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:16.600> skin

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
deeper tissue and then rosacea the skin

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.620 
deeper tissue and then rosacea the skin
become<00:01:17.380> rough<00:01:17.649> scaly<00:01:18.039> and<00:01:18.369> bumped<00:01:19.149> comes<00:01:19.390> up

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
become rough scaly and bumped comes up

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.959 
become rough scaly and bumped comes up
so<00:01:20.259> this<00:01:20.499> is<00:01:20.770> a<00:01:20.799> chronic<00:01:21.340> rosacea

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:21.969
