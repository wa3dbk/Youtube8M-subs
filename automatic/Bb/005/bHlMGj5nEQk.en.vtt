00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:19.080
 first I wanted to thank the title of 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:22.430
 citizen of Mato Grosso and also wanted to 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.430
 thank the title of citizen 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.430
 rondonopolitana 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.850
 I thank the deputy and the councilor who 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.300
 granted me 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.629
 I want to tell you what I 'm doing 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:46.379
 extremely grateful for this because 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.989
 the president of Brazil I am president 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:54.480
 of all Brazilians 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:57.449
 but I feel more and more attached to 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.320
 each state and upon receiving the 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.750
 I feel that the population of that 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.030
 state 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.460
 as I hold each of the 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.820
 mato grossenses citizens 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:17.310
 they also hug me the picture sometimes 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.750
 speaks much more than any text 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.930
 written 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:26.790
 the image has an immense power of 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.990
 convincing because it puts in 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.939
 of people 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:35.520
 what can be and what is here 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.450
 listen to what is being 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:44.220
 but I also got to see what I can 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:50.310
 be built here and then I 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:54.329
 I came to a conclusion that I think 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:58.409
 It is very important to share with you 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:03.930
 Brazil is also strategic that there are 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:07.290
 medium-sized enterprises that become large in 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:11.769
 railway area and I'm seeing here 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:16.580
 one big plus one big 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:21.080
 potential possibility not only for the 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:24.319
 railway section but what this 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:29.870
 railway section allows for construction 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:32.840
 of an intermodal complex a complex 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.950
 intermodal is a place that attracts other 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.980
 companies 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.680
 an intermodal complex is a place where 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.790
 employment and income are created 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:47.079
 a first intermodal complex of the 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:52.400
 Latin America has the condition of 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:55.069
 transform businesses and businesses around 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.430
 your environment so I give the 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:01.519
 Congratulations to you and I'm very comfortable. 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:06.019
 to do this because we always 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:09.890
 we had a fierce discussion at 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:12.859
 respect of the need for this 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:17.150
 rondonópolis be completed because he 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:20.180
 I was in the chat for me so it's actually 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.599
 a special staff moment the first 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.870
 time as president of the republic 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:32.109
 celebrating precisely that day the 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:36.680
 completion of the railroad to rondonópolis and 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:40.010
 I know that this work has a history in 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.739
 1901 eurides da cunha already talked about the 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:47.630
 importance of linking this region to 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:50.120
 coast from the 70s to fight 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.090
 of the Matogrossenses by the 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.379
 railway has won supporters 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:04:00.620
 under the leadership of senator vicente vuolo 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:02.769
 that name of this railway and here I 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.049
 wanted to greet 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.780
 I ask you to get up and receive the 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:11.420
 our palaver 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:14.830
 greeting the whole family 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.830
 the dead senator 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:22.580
 I want to tell you that the question 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:25.520
 railway in Brazil was always a 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:29.230
 very poorly resolved issue 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:35.360
 all major continental countries 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:37.070
 sought to enter into a process of 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:41.800
 development 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:44.979
 to build highways and 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:50.000
 internalize development through 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:53.180
 of the railways and the history is terrible 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.710
 this point because this happened in the 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:05:01.460
 end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:08.889
 especially we are in the 21st century and we 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:13.100
 we're running behind to eliminate 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:16.490
 that this immense fragility of 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:21.620
 structure of Brazil, which is a country 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:25.210
 food exporter with 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:31.330
 large agribusiness with a strong 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:34.370
 mineral and an immense capacity of 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.919
 intercommunication with markets 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:41.380
 diversified companies that need 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:41.380
 without railway structure 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:48.830
 This is a special moment because this 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:55.700
 stretch to rondonopolis is an issue 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:59.960
 that we see here in presence what 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:03.979
 means an intermodal logistics that 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:08.150
 has its center on the railway means 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:11.300
 lower costs means greater agility 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:15.039
 also means a 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:19.669
 optimize the highway and railroad relationship 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:20.720
 waterway and also consider the structure 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:24.020
 out 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:27.920
 so you can be sure that we 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:31.070
 the federal government we will be attentive 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:35.570
 here not only to invest in logistics 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:38.650
 on infrastructure roads throughout the 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:42.410
 in all matters relating to energy 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:45.680
 we are also attentive to 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:49.310
 ensure that this region has 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:53.570
 qualified social programs 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:56.020
 ensure that the population here has a 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:58.270
 characteristic that I think fundamental 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:01.250
 an 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:06.080
 we can not think that the 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:09.290
 development is the development of the 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:12.740
 gross domestic product a development 

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:16.910
 justified only when the 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:18.800
 the best product to provide employment and 

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:22.210
 population education 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.210
 Many thanks to you.
