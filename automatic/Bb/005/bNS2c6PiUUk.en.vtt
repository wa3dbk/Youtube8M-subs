let's do it

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.830 
let's do it
I<00:00:50.160> mean<00:00:50.340> first<00:00:50.670> thing<00:00:50.789> easiest<00:00:51.510> way<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.690> all

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
I mean first thing easiest way to all

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.420 
I mean first thing easiest way to all
hyper<00:00:52.079> curb<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.379> just<00:00:52.590> straight<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:52.920> and

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
hyper curb is just straight on and

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.430 
hyper curb is just straight on and
generally<00:00:54.360> that's<00:00:54.510> how<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.750> will<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.020> prefer

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
generally that's how you will I prefer

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.810 
generally that's how you will I prefer
but<00:00:55.620> straight<00:00:55.829> on<00:00:55.949> but<00:00:56.160> when<00:00:56.280> you're<00:00:56.399> cruising

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
but straight on but when you're cruising

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.580 
but straight on but when you're cruising
like<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.120> said<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.840> could<00:00:57.989> hit<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.199> at<00:00:58.379> any

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
like I said you could hit it at any

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.799 
like I said you could hit it at any
angle<00:00:58.879> so<00:00:59.879> let's<00:00:59.910> try<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.449> first<00:01:00.660> just

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
angle so let's try it first just

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.720 
angle so let's try it first just
straight<00:01:01.170> on<00:01:01.199> up<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:01.680> teeny<00:01:02.039> little<00:01:02.160> buffer

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
straight on up this teeny little buffer

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.719 
straight on up this teeny little buffer
of<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.969> curb<00:01:03.180> right<00:01:03.420> here

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
of a curb right here

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.950 
of a curb right here
so<00:01:05.729> we're<00:01:05.850> basically<00:01:05.939> standing<00:01:06.570> right<00:01:06.780> in<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
so we're basically standing right in the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.130 
so we're basically standing right in the
middle<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.409> street<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.920> we<00:01:08.340> both<00:01:08.490> might<00:01:08.820> die

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
middle of a street and we both might die

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.719 
middle of a street and we both might die
so<00:01:10.140> yeah<00:01:10.710> straight<00:01:11.010> on<00:01:11.130> remember<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.520> keep

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
now we're going to go out an angle at

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.390 
now we're going to go out an angle at
this<00:01:34.200> one<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.860> gonna<00:01:35.009> be<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.220> little

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
this one this is gonna be a little

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.100 
this one this is gonna be a little
harder<00:01:35.759> I'm<00:01:35.880> not<00:01:36.060> gonna<00:01:36.210> lie<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.659> why<00:01:36.960> it's

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
harder I'm not gonna lie to you why it's

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.740 
harder I'm not gonna lie to you why it's
also<00:01:37.470> windy<00:01:37.799> it's<00:01:38.759> harder<00:01:39.060> just<00:01:39.299> because

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
also windy it's harder just because

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.560 
also windy it's harder just because
you'll<00:01:40.140> see<00:01:40.350> why<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.530> guess<00:01:40.920> because<00:01:41.909> it's<00:01:42.060> it's

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
you'll see why I guess because it's it's

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.200 
you'll see why I guess because it's it's
more<00:01:42.899> awkward<00:01:43.200> okay<00:01:44.130> you'll<00:01:44.579> learn<00:01:44.729> why<00:01:44.970> when

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
more awkward okay you'll learn why when

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.030 
more awkward okay you'll learn why when
you<00:01:45.299> fall<00:01:45.570> you're<00:01:46.140> like<00:01:46.290> fall<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.890> then

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
you fall you're like fall and then

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:59.800 
you fall you're like fall and then
you're<00:01:47.159> like<00:01:47.280> oh<00:01:47.460> that's<00:01:47.640> harder

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.810 

what<00:02:00.810> first<00:02:01.710> troll

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
what first troll

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.090 
what first troll
maybe<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.600> wasn't<00:02:03.750> harder<00:02:04.170> at<00:02:04.290> all<00:02:04.440> maybe<00:02:04.920> it

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
maybe it wasn't harder at all maybe it

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.400 
maybe it wasn't harder at all maybe it
was<00:02:05.190> easier<00:02:06.260> okay

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
was easier okay

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.020 
was easier okay
so<00:02:07.830> that<00:02:07.950> would<00:02:08.070> be<00:02:08.190> what<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.399> would<00:02:08.520> take<00:02:08.790> kind

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
so that would be what I would take kind

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.140 
so that would be what I would take kind
of<00:02:09.090> like<00:02:09.240> a<00:02:09.270> frontside<00:02:09.930> angled<00:02:10.860> ollie<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:12.120> now

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
of like a frontside angled ollie so now

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.940 
of like a frontside angled ollie so now
we're<00:02:12.420> going<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.570> go<00:02:12.720> back<00:02:12.990> side<00:02:13.320> angle<00:02:13.740> dolly

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
we're going to go back side angle dolly

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.950 
we're going to go back side angle dolly
so<00:02:14.430> your<00:02:14.580> back<00:02:14.820> is<00:02:15.060> facing<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.540> curb<00:02:15.750> because

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
so your back is facing the curb because

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.150 
so your back is facing the curb because
every<00:02:16.320> now<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.560> then<00:02:16.620> you're<00:02:16.830> going<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.040> need

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
every now and then you're going to need

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.280 
every now and then you're going to need
to<00:02:17.250> pop<00:02:17.430> on<00:02:17.610> like<00:02:17.820> that<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.660> we're<00:02:19.140> going<00:02:19.260> to

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
to pop on like that and we're going to

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.600 
to pop on like that and we're going to
have<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.470> come<00:02:19.650> up<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:20.010> hill<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.220> little<00:02:20.370> bit

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
have to come up the hill a little bit

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.130 
have to come up the hill a little bit
this<00:02:20.910> would<00:02:21.060> be<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.180> common<00:02:21.600> spot<00:02:21.810> where<00:02:21.990> you

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
this would be a common spot where you

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.630 
this would be a common spot where you
are<00:02:22.170> cruising<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.830> you<00:02:22.890> had<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.130> pop<00:02:23.340> up<00:02:23.490> the

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
are cruising and you had to pop up the

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.340 
are cruising and you had to pop up the
curb<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.180> then<00:02:24.420> roll<00:02:24.630> off<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.810> curb<00:02:25.110> on<00:02:25.230> the

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
curb and then roll off the curb on the

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.200 
curb and then roll off the curb on the
other<00:02:25.470> side<00:02:25.740> so<00:02:26.580> let's<00:02:26.730> just<00:02:26.880> give<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.030> little

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
other side so let's just give a little

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:40.100 
other side so let's just give a little
push<00:02:35.630> what<00:02:37.670> you<00:02:38.670> barely<00:02:39.090> made<00:02:39.300> it<00:02:39.510> but<00:02:40.080> the

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
push what you barely made it but the

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.980 
push what you barely made it but the
point<00:02:40.440> being<00:02:40.560> that<00:02:40.800> you<00:02:40.950> made<00:02:41.310> it<00:02:41.780> which<00:02:42.780> is

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
point being that you made it which is

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.690 
point being that you made it which is
just<00:02:43.290> incredible<00:02:43.860> that<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:44.190> didn't<00:02:44.400> have<00:02:44.550> to

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
just incredible that you didn't have to

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.790 
just incredible that you didn't have to
try<00:02:44.910> any<00:02:45.120> of<00:02:45.180> those<00:02:45.420> again<00:02:45.750> yeah<00:02:46.080> I've<00:02:46.320> learned

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
try any of those again yeah I've learned

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.500 
try any of those again yeah I've learned
so<00:02:47.070> much<00:02:47.190> about<00:02:47.370> committing<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.150> realized

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
so much about committing and I realized

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.150 
so much about committing and I realized
this<00:02:48.780> all<00:02:48.960> it<00:02:49.230> is<00:02:49.350> on<00:02:49.560> these<00:02:49.710> little<00:02:49.860> things

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160

this all it is on these little things
you<00:02:50.310> know<00:02:50.490> go<00:02:51.210> faster<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:51.810> commit<00:02:52.170> yeah<00:02:52.740> so

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
I'm just I'm basically just going I'm

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.479 
I'm just I'm basically just going I'm
not<00:02:55.140> going<00:02:55.320> to<00:02:55.380> step<00:02:55.590> my<00:02:55.620> feet<00:02:55.920> off<00:02:56.070> this<00:02:56.250> and

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
not going to step my feet off this and

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.000 
not going to step my feet off this and
no<00:02:56.700> matter<00:02:56.850> what<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.270> then<00:02:57.390> I<00:02:57.480> land<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:58.010> okay

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
cool so we have the front side angle

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.320 
cool so we have the front side angle
back<00:03:01.020> side<00:03:01.290> angle<00:03:01.650> what<00:03:02.430> about<00:03:02.640> going<00:03:02.880> like

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
back side angle what about going like

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.600 
back side angle what about going like
we're<00:03:03.870> going<00:03:04.170> parallel<00:03:04.860> with<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.220> curb<00:03:05.459> and

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
we're going parallel with the curb and

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.240 
we're going parallel with the curb and
then<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:05.820> have<00:03:05.940> to<00:03:06.090> pop<00:03:06.300> on<00:03:06.510> to<00:03:06.750> it<00:03:06.920> just<00:03:07.920> right

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
alright let's give it a shot so this is

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.720 
alright let's give it a shot so this is
a<00:03:12.870> probably<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.410> most<00:03:13.709> common<00:03:14.310> way<00:03:14.700> that

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
a probably the most common way that

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.960 
take it at each angle that you might hit
that<00:05:52.810> helps<00:05:53.680> you<00:05:53.830> because<00:05:54.100> then<00:05:54.280> when<00:05:54.910> you

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970
