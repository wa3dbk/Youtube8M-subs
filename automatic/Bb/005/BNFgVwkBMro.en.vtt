00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.629
 where it was enough with the bomb where are you going where 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.629
 you 're improving 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.750
 Hi, guys and girls, how are you? 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.610
 I'm out with his through is that nothing 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.660
 to answer the question of the title of the 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.820
 video for me if not what you said that 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.279
 He has said blasphemy before you 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.470
 put to write like crazy possessed 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.480
 for the power of the pc listen to me 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.390
 listening to listen to me calmly today 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.090
 I want to compare my experience my 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.680
 perception when to battlefield 4 for a 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.970
 side on the ps4 which is what you are 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.730
 watching the gameplay that you are watching from 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.500
 background and on the other hand I started that I was 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.760
 playing the previous days also goes up 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.019
 a video etcetera is worth 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.449
 then I have compared my 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:50.420
 experiences attention does not look look like 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:52.280
 killed one in the water so cool that no 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.760
 I'm talking about neither technique nor 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.860
 power neither of anything nor of things that 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.989
 I knew because I do not know about computers 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.360
 but I'm talking about my attention 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.150
 aim of my experience my 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.470
 experience is that both games look 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.880
 vitamin a vitamin is that I can not 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.220
 talk I can not talk because you know 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.520
 they destroy things you are talking about and you 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.890
 disassemble the map my experience in both 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.640
 games is very similar so similar that 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.670
 I'm going to keep playing bat 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.530
 4 in console before pc that's a 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.180
 my decision that I have 2 and 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.190
 I can make a streak of 3 with the sniper 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.320
 it's my decision based on my 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.810
 experience and what I want for me 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.850
 graphically and you are seeing it 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.990
 difference between both platforms between 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.240
 ps4 and pc a normal pc I do not play in 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.310
 ultra but if in high quality for me the 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.259
 graphic difference if there is is minimal or 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.390
 nonexistent or at least not 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.130
 noticeable when you're playing 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.170
 agreement before recording this video I've 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.340
 put to look what I had captured 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.940
 just in this map that you are 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.070
 seeing what I had captured on the pc and 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.530
 what I have captured in pin in play 4 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.420
 to compare and honestly yes there are 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.910
 some things that are better in one the 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.759
 others in another I do not know what colors but 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.009
 really when you're playing not notes 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.690
 the difference in neither of the two me 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.970
 I do not notice it as I always am 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.890
 talking about me I'm not saying the 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.840
 absolute truth I'm not saying what 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.880
 you have to think I accept that other people 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.220
 have other opinions I'm talking about 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.720
 my perception is worth and a perceptions that 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.220
 graphically there is no difference 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.500
 in terms of gameplay and such as 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.570
 you know I like more to play with command 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.010
 therefore that is not a difference 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.440
 you know I started you can also play 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.630
 command with command we go but let's go 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.700
 that is for me to play in console for 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.280
 I do not have any disadvantage 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.960
 to play on pc and talk about him battlefield 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.750
 4 no other battlefield only games 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.090
 4 yes, I miss a little less 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.680
 in the console what is the bat in what 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.750
 which is the way the bat works in 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.100
 what I started that is quite comfortable that 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.480
 yes I have to say it but also 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.030
 I have to say that in the time I played 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.640
 in the console I had no problem 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.650
 I was not hanged, I did not leave the game, 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.420
 did anything weird while with 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.120
 the pc if it happens to me not therefore for me 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.770
 the difference is minimal and I'm glad 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.990
 a lot of that because there is nothing I 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.510
 bother more than a game is very 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.890
 different between platforms I can put 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.470
 examples for example battlefield 3 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.630
 battlefield 3 you do it in console in 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.090
 the one that was and then in pc and it was another 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.160
 world I started was an enjoyment and in the 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.900
 console those limitations were noted not 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.250
 instead, combat the end 4 has not 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.700
 gone and also happens the other way there 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.319
 games like for example nba 2k 14 that 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.260
 I started it is very good but 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.879
 it's not as good as in the console 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.730
 new generation from what I've seen 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:40.650
 okay then I really do not want 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.659
 enter a platform debate and that 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.280
 Now you start telling me that's the fault of 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.810
 the developers who do not want 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.430
 nobody already knew it I know I do not I do not want 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.709
 get into that I know that fish can 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.359
 be cheaper that are more powerful than 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.639
 you can customize it if you have a 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.560
 very powerful pc you can play not in ultra 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.870
 but in ultra ghost very well and 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.599
 friends week and drum that is already has 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.150
 5000 pixels of resolution I already know but 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:05.099
 for me for my pc that is a pc 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.799
 normalito that as I said all the 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:11.790
 props is an average pc for me 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:13.379
 now this game Battlefield 4 me 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.209
 It's equally important to play it in any of the 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:18.090
 two platforms and therefore I'm going to 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.799
 keep playing it on console in play 4 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.150
 ok I also have to say and this at 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.250
 You can help me better in the 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.000
 comments please no no do not comment 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.889
 let's comment with arguments is not 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.470
 you are fanboys of anything of any of the 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.150
 two it is worth that you have opted for 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.220
 a platform does not mean that that 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.200
 platform is perfect no matter what the 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.850
 better for someone else 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.620
 others worry that the platform 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.320
 that you have chosen is the best for 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.240
 you and what is important and then 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.550
 it is already then I have to say that 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.960
 for me to see if you can second it 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.080
 understand at least what I'm going to 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.420
 say in the console he knew that by the 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.450
 made to move with command and such not 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.520
 has that unreal movement look here me 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.270
 I kill with a skewer that I spike you 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.860
 made a Christian and the gray captain 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.050
 with him with the mouse you can move from 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.530
 abnormal form the player can not go from 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.390
 side to side and do it in agreement and 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.210
 that which is an advantage in chur is vital 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.800
 because it gives you a lot of mobility to me 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.370
 for me it takes away realism maybe because 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.690
 I've played all my life more 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.300
 console not for yours and maybe already 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.400
 and that's why the console has a 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.560
 softness I'm not talking about fluency is 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.450
 but it has a softness everything how it 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.070
 move that I like more, not then 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.260
 I do not know if that has an explanation 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.120
 technical or not but always when the 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.210
 same game has the same quality 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.400
 graphic or very similar that I kill you 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.470
 when they have the same graphic quality or 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.470
 similar I prefer to play in console 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.090
 for I do not know for that feeling too 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.410
 can influence many things in terms of 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.000
 the colors for example said that the 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.979
 I liked the colors of the console more 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.419
 that those of pc can influence for example 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:56.759
 the monitor obviously where I am 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:58.199
 playing not in fact the monitor with the 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:01.500
 who plays the console is a little better 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:03.330
 that the one I use for the pc because you're 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.220
 crazy because I play less on pc not 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.340
 then I would like this video 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.289
 serve to open a debate on 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.030
 good debates and for you to comment what 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:14.220
 that you want on this subject but with 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:17.130
 respect is worth and above all I'm interested in 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.500
 opinion of people who have tried 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:22.530
 battlefield 4 in a new console 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.210
 generation and I started that I can talk not 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.160
 do not tell me what you want in videos of 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:29.280
 youtube because it depends on how you capture 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.320
 it's on both platforms it depends on you 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.539
 You die depends on how you upload to YouTube 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.490
 it depends on a thousand things then what you see 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:37.080
 on youtube you can never trust 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.639
 much power you can make corrections of 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.009
 color and corrections of much type 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:43.139
 so I would like you to do it 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:45.509
 have you tried give me your opinion 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:46.200
 about it I would like it to be valid 

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:49.590
 that debate 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:52.530
 in the comments and I insist this is my 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:54.600
 fijaros view of my experience has 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:56.310
 received a message from álex bunkers that 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.780
 is someone with whom I played two games 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.760
 followed then there is some time 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.710
 of the game to see the message look at what 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.650
 nice look how nice your videos are 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:06.650
 general thanks alex how nice are you 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:10.710

 subscribe no thanks, good that 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.710
 I hope there is a bit of debate 

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:16.650
 thank you very much for listening to me I hope that 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:19.440
 I liked it and I hope you discover 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:21.390
 that is battlefield 4 for console then 

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.020
 it's pretty good see you guys later 

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.020
 goodbye
