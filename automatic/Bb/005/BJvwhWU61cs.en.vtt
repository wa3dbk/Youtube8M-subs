00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.320
 audi goes completely crazy with the new rs3 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.620
 especially the Japanese are having a hard time 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.680
 the d-segment corsa fabia and mondeo 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.030
 the most important newcomers tested 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.670
 hello and nice that you look at it again 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.990
 300-week car week and the 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.880
 compact middle class we watch 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.520
 nowadays not even more help and 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.010
 even if the audi s3 already has 300 hp 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.510
 how much does the audi rs3 not get 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.550
 yes that ask him of course alexander i 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.860
 mia well i will tell but well 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.989
 that will be quite a bit because according to the 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:40.420
 German media comes the power of that 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:43.070
 car out at 360 to 400 hp from one 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.870
 five-cylinder happiness you continue to be 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.879
 anyway my fine performed he sees 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.260
 5 cylinders everywhere disappear for something 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.030
 they still become four cylinders but audi 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.129
 remains of the vessel 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.079
 yes that is a very conscious choice 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.329
 the engineers said because that was anyway 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.280
 a little part of the DNA to the 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.179
 car they have to make it more special 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.039
 said 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:03.620
 so no 4 cylinder but one press 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.970
 five-cylinder and that audi rs3 you go ie 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.340
 then the appearance still very 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.020
 distinguished from s3 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.210
 After it will of course be something bruthor 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.350
 eyes but it is traditional so it 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.149
 again not so bad 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.950
 screaming car is going to be 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:19.070
 that is what there is probably fans 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.270
 want exactly so that in the style 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.159
 it will be again as in the 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.869
 so other models is actually good 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.430
 surely a very different wants walked again 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.030
 have to say because yes that comes a lot 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.219
 nice stuff but yes the leon cupra r yes 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.520
 of course that's just what low really 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:37.369
 so you indeed have the a45 amg 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.409
 that the that already exists 360 hp and there are 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.829
 now rumors that BMW 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.180
 the in 2 so 2 series there are coupé 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.950
 of course yes 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.020
 that probably goes around 400 hp 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.609
 getting that is fun because a pastor 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.079
 1m coupé was also a competitor 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:53.929
 actually from that rs3 in terms of power 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:56.659
 yes that is that at 340 hp we both have one 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:59.030
 well it seems that the bmw that whole 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.320
 keep an eye on it and then 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.450
 finally goes there again 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.490
 respond well yes it is a bit 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.079
 very much then I think yes if I look what 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.850
 there arrives in the class until that dog pk 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.710
 that research typewriter also quite whole 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.420
 nice that is a very nice car 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.310
 indeed and then it goes back on its way 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.489
 try to score in your own way with a 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.290
 fastest time for a front wheel drive 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.940
 for the nordschleife but that is actually 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.870
 a bit the difference between the real ones 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.090
 toppers who have then 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.470
 four-wheel drive yes and below 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.330
 you the more affordable 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.739
 front wheel drive th which in itself is already one 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.450
 Try supply drion hp 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.060
 yes if more than I still enjoyed it 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.530
 a nice time to be quiet again 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.930
 and fruit look at such cars 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.890
 okay once such a thank you now complete 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.140
 read story 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.750
 then look at car week 44 and it is located 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.310
 in the shops on Wednesday 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.870
 well alexander i'm gonna go with you 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.280
 have about d-segment because that leads you 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.500
 to flourish with newcomers like the 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.239
 the mondeo exists but she then looks again 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.470
 to hard numbers then that class is that 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.090
 middle class that traditional 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.019
 middle class more so important 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.730
 earlier 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.319
 and the Japanese are having a hard time yes 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.870
 they have indeed been difficult must 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.950
 you make a dichotomy with 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.739
 premium brands yes then they are those again 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.049
 actually have it better than ever 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.280
 because if you have competence BMW 4 series 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.129
 of course also have the gran coupe that 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.569
 story better than all skoda superb 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.510
 to begin with but they are 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.150
 so the brands that are not really that premium 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.170
 sauce we have more 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.209
 home-garden-and-kitchen brands like you 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.069
 for example who could call it it 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.290
 have a difficult time and then especially 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.920
 in the japanese corner that it's really hard 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.480
 is 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.670
 the suzuki kizashi that is the 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.310
 worst sold 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.349
 middle class in europe that is really very 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.840
 very bad as it goes but indeed 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.519
 also the agreement that is actually like you 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.200
 just doesn't look at the numbers 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.370
 maintain and arrived six years ago 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.680
 that as a new model on the market 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.610
 yes but the 100 so decided that car 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.269
 not to feed anymore 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.310
 well that is according to the australian branch 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.180
 from honda that was indeed because 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.090
 they have the same thing there 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.860
 model but honda benelux have to order one 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.930
 asked for a response and she said no 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.819
 for next year just the agreement 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.500
 but what happens afterwards 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.659
 that is unclear so it is not yet 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.260
 100% seliga and theo to have recently 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.970
 see passing by with a 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.530
 a whole new one and sisters coming 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.060
 anyway yes that will come 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.340
 it was indeed one of those 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.290
 the question of toyota then still goes 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.000
 find more because avensis has it 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.769
 also difficult when you look at it 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.680
 the statistics are the real german 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.780
 brands that simply dominate and fort 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.240
 and Opel are in between, but 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.580
 yes the bmw 3 series is the best-selling 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.919
 middle class of europe so still 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.660
 striking and even very good cars 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.979
 and Mazda 6 is just having a hard time 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.520
 Well difficult blood in itself 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:37.500
 nice but yes if you compare that with 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.000
 the sales of much more expensive howdies and 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.669
 bmw falls we still have a little 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.600
 against him facelift to those of those 6 yes 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:47.190
 that's right ok thank you lex other we 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.990
 have a busy week behind us 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.729
 we say because in a week that reason 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.410
 very new skoda fabia 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.850
 the completely new Opel corsa and also 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.460
 once the brand new one 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.720
 ford mondeo de skoda fabia is the 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.100
 most modern base moments of the 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.260
 volkswagen group 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.270
 the open corsa takes over the baton 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.350
 a model that is very good right up to the end 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.760
 sold 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.800
 the three-cylinder turbo performs 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.770
 excellent the cracks about the engines 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.880
 do not have to do with this new opel 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.310
 and new ford mondeo 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.500
 yes it turns out to drive very well again 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.760
 all in all three very important ones 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.130
 newcomers and the first driving test 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.800
 of which nation car week no. 44 and that 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.669
 appears on Wednesday in the trio test of 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.130
 this week 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:28.110
 the bmw 2-series active tourer those two 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.479
 against the ford c-max and the volkswagen 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.590
 golf sportsvan 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:33.449
 furthermore we have a whole new one 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.970
 series on the dynamometer 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:37.440
 all kinds of cars came by to 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.599
 see how much power how many couples 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.830
 for example , one of them is the 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:42.750
 kia rio 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.030
 a point a series and very economical 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.590
 dieseltje but he seems more 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.820
 capacity than factory specifies 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.440
 to be continued 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.669
 that was again for the Tuesday version of 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.750
 the car week is journal and Friday 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:54.620
 of course a new episode 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.620
 until then
