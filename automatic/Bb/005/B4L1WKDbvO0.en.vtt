another<00:03:15.830> poem<00:03:16.070> I<00:03:16.220> ran<00:03:16.460> into<00:03:16.820> is<00:03:17.000> that<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.330> game

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
another poem I ran into is that the game

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.620 
another poem I ran into is that the game
at<00:03:17.660> times<00:03:17.870> can<00:03:18.080> become<00:03:18.260> a<00:03:18.620> bit<00:03:18.890> repetitive

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
at times can become a bit repetitive

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.880 
at times can become a bit repetitive
especially<00:03:20.630> later<00:03:20.900> on<00:03:21.140> when<00:03:21.380> all<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:21.680> main

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
especially later on when all the main

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.310 
especially later on when all the main
missions<00:03:22.150> essentially<00:03:23.150> become<00:03:23.450> chase<00:03:24.080> this

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
missions essentially become chase this

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.380 
missions essentially become chase this

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
bad guy to a random location have a

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.480 
bad guy to a random location have a
fight<00:03:26.690> and<00:03:26.720> move<00:03:27.140> to<00:03:27.350> another<00:03:27.410> area<00:03:27.950> to<00:03:27.980> do<00:03:28.250> the

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
fight and move to another area to do the

fight and move to another area to do the
exact<00:03:28.910> same<00:03:29.030> thing<00:03:29.600> and<00:03:30.350> after<00:03:30.770> a<00:03:30.800> while<00:03:31.100> this

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
exact same thing and after a while this

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.760 
exact same thing and after a while this
gets<00:03:31.700> very<00:03:31.790> very<00:03:32.270> grating<00:03:33.080> as<00:03:33.260> you<00:03:33.440> could<00:03:33.560> end

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
gets very very grating as you could end

gets very very grating as you could end
up<00:03:33.890> in<00:03:34.010> one<00:03:34.310> mission<00:03:34.700> I<00:03:34.910> could<00:03:35.360> just<00:03:35.540> pretty

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
up in one mission I could just pretty

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.420 
up in one mission I could just pretty
