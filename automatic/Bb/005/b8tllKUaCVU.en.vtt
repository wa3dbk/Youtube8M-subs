one<00:00:28.320> way<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.529> get<00:00:28.710> around<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.070> problem<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.519> to

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
one way to get around this problem is to

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.339 
one way to get around this problem is to
use<00:00:29.699> these<00:00:29.820> external<00:00:30.449> battery<00:00:30.750> packs<00:00:31.050> and

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
use these external battery packs and

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.840 
use these external battery packs and
these<00:00:31.590> plug<00:00:31.890> into<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.189> front<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.460> your<00:00:32.579> flash

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
these plug into the front of your flash

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.000 
these plug into the front of your flash
and<00:00:33.180> then<00:00:33.750> they<00:00:33.840> clip<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.260> your<00:00:34.380> belt<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.860> it

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
and then they clip to your belt and it

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.290 
and then they clip to your belt and it
just<00:00:35.190> gives<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.460> twice<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.000> amount<00:00:36.090> of

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
just gives you twice the amount of

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.750 
just gives you twice the amount of
battery<00:00:36.600> power<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.110> normally<00:00:37.230> have

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
battery power that you normally have

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.889 
battery power that you normally have
actually<00:00:38.760> bought<00:00:38.940> one<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.210> these<00:00:39.300> units<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.809> I

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
actually bought one of these units and I

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.479 
actually bought one of these units and I
find<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.290> never<00:00:40.620> use<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:40.920> mainly<00:00:41.340> because

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
find that I never use it mainly because

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.220 
find that I never use it mainly because
I<00:00:41.760> don't<00:00:41.850> like<00:00:42.090> having<00:00:42.270> things<00:00:42.570> connected<00:00:43.200> to

from<00:01:09.570> cameras<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.200> past<00:01:10.439> now<00:01:11.130> there's<00:01:11.369> a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
from cameras in the past now there's a

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.160 
from cameras in the past now there's a
battery<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.090> camera<00:01:12.270> itself<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.930> a

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
battery in the camera itself and a

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.499 
battery in the camera itself and a
second<00:01:13.619> battery<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.189> grip<00:01:14.490> this<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.180> great

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
second battery in the grip this is great

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.300 
second battery in the grip this is great
because<00:01:15.689> now<00:01:16.049> we<00:01:16.110> can<00:01:16.290> take<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.770> battery<00:01:17.070> pack

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
because now we can take the battery pack

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.429 
because now we can take the battery pack
out<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.240> camera<00:01:18.570> still<00:01:18.750> operates<00:01:19.200> with

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
out and the camera still operates with

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.429 
out and the camera still operates with
one<00:01:19.770> battery<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.490> camera<00:01:21.200> since<00:01:22.200> I'm<00:01:22.350> only

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
one battery in the camera since I'm only

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.350 
one battery in the camera since I'm only
using<00:01:22.680> one<00:01:22.830> battery<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.549> camera<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:24.119> have<00:01:24.330> a

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
using one battery in the camera I have a

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.450 
using one battery in the camera I have a
lot<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.659> empty<00:01:24.990> space<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.500> my<00:01:25.590> vertical<00:01:25.860> grip<00:01:26.220> I

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
lot of empty space in my vertical grip I

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.219 
lot of empty space in my vertical grip I
think<00:01:26.850> it'd<00:01:27.150> be<00:01:27.180> great<00:01:27.390> if<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.689> third<00:01:27.900> party

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
think it'd be great if a third party

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.899 
think it'd be great if a third party
company<00:01:28.439> would<00:01:28.890> come<00:01:29.100> up<00:01:29.189> with<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.369> little<00:01:29.610> tray

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
company would come up with a little tray

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.910 
company would come up with a little tray
that<00:01:30.060> holds<00:01:30.240> double-a<00:01:30.780> batteries<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.590> fits

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
that holds double-a batteries that fits

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.710 
that holds double-a batteries that fits
into<00:01:32.310> our<00:01:32.340> grip<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.850> then<00:01:33.299> with<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.540> little

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
into our grip and then with a little

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.929 
into our grip and then with a little
wire<00:01:34.020> coming<00:01:34.380> out<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.680> side<00:01:34.860> plugs<00:01:35.640> power

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
wire coming out the side plugs power

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.120 
wire coming out the side plugs power
into<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.450> front<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.810> our<00:01:36.900> flash<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.920> would

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
into the front of our flash this would

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.010 
into the front of our flash this would
be<00:01:38.250> great<00:01:38.400> we<00:01:39.030> would<00:01:39.180> have<00:01:39.329> one<00:01:39.600> battery<00:01:39.960> in

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
be great we would have one battery in

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.539 
be great we would have one battery in
our<00:01:40.140> camera<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.710> then<00:01:40.979> we<00:01:41.130> would<00:01:41.189> have<00:01:41.250> our

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
our camera and then we would have our

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.850 
our camera and then we would have our
entire<00:01:41.939> vertical<00:01:42.479> grip<00:01:42.720> powering<00:01:43.350> our<00:01:43.500> flash

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
entire vertical grip powering our flash

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.920 
entire vertical grip powering our flash
this<00:01:44.670> would<00:01:44.880> allow<00:01:45.060> our<00:01:45.090> camera<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.540> look<00:01:45.810> and

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
this would allow our camera to look and

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.170 
this would allow our camera to look and
operate<00:01:46.079> exactly<00:01:46.920> as<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.159> did<00:01:47.280> before<00:01:47.399> without
