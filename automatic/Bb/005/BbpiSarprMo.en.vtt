00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:05.490
 mirage the red guide and you 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.200
 intimate poses and I wish you the 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.469
 welcome for this new jt throw geek 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.550
 with a special hub usb 3.0 yes because 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.540
 that you are going to produce photo is good 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.920
 but seeing it on video is better in 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.570
 town halls of words and discovers a 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.139
 rotating saitek world of shenzhen in 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.369
 China 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.600
 she explains to you all that pre generic 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.600
 and reconquered 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.690
 maybe you too have a pc 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.700
 in which there will never be enough 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.830
 usb plugs or so there are only a few 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.300
 some that works or maybe so 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:46.080
 that like me you spent a game 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.030
 realized that frankly 4th did 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.769
 was not enough then necessarily he not 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.960
 that you put your mouse 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:55.589
 your 3-1 microbial keyboard that plugs 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.820
 in usb 4 a webcam for example also on 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:57.750
 could also put a dvd player 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.100
 external 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.720
 and then we will definitely need 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.180
 also a time of books plug a 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.090
 phone or card reader but 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.880
 Well here we are already at 7 without forcing and 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.150
 in addition well we have less than eight or 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:16.320
 nine so we have the solution with the 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:20.330
 hub usb 04 report yes because like 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.330
 only Monday that it is in usb 3.0 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.490
 it is also compatible with 1.0 and 2.0 and 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.460
 remind you if you like with 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.689
 happiness and kindness to be in 3.0 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.670
 you can have flow rates of 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.710
 transfer that are up to 100 megabits 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.719
 second that's why it's 3.0 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.700
 not bad so they will turn with a 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:44.130
 usb hub 3.0 over the worries of usb 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.990
 because with cards like that you 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.299
 you will see rather royal 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.890
 So how is the pub of the sb 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.700
 local to find a usb plug or if 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.890
 a second there a third here and 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.929
 finally the fourth room on it but he 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.549
 drinking were actually withheld by us 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:00.390
 confide that they light up they send you 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.719
 31 sec 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.560
 at the back we find politics at 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:10.050
 micro usb with usb 3.0 connectors 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.960
 a master a better transfer here the 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.430
 plug hole 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.010
 will confirm that the device 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.620
 diamond so it's clearly on and 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.990
 supply 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.470
 we will see the much reminiscent 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.260
 mutations 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.230
 then we run the connectivity all that 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.260
 team 3.0 some will also have to be 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:34.640
 from scratch but happiness and pleasure 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:38.360
 more the 3.0 will then do one branch 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.880
 our music and our free behind a 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.350
 other mac mini and this to all after in 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.010
 swiss there is full dodger does it 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:50.630
 will be enough to take with you the same 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:54.860
 usb time like that one is going better alec 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:03:00.440
 have held here relieves alleva not a 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:04.670
 the worst amount here it recognizes the 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:10.430
 talent and especially see him sing so 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:19.190
 all practices and it's true that I 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:21.320
 I'm like that it's always a step 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.940
 extra that's not a luxurious 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.400
 it was revealed but also the fact that this 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.440
 in 3.0 are only 100 km from beebe 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.990
 so we're important for there to be a 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.590
 usb plug in 30 seconds on any 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.060
 which computer 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.890
 if what you can usually buy 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.060
 the little boxes and it's him who 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.800
 will actually make it to the point 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.940
 zero its rates down also from 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.540
 plug in switzerland works 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.700
 automatically 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.380
 it's easy to use 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.780
 liked the transfer from May to 5 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.080
 gigabits per second thanks to the place of 3 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.880
 0 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.270
 atkinson also with the elders 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.260
 criticize the mails v10 see 2.0 which 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.060
 are therefore democratizing them 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.770
 we have revealed but the factor are 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.070
 actually powered by a plug 220 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.740
 volt 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:01.430
 it would have a little more nor 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:04.310
 ried restriction is only 4 or 5 b / 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.820
 a-1 not mentioned by name at least one 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.290
 little recruited but the apparatus of 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.770
 notification that allows to be a geek 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.740
 and two draws between two plants used 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:18.980
 finally we would have liked a bonus and yes the 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.570
 price-minus euros to 50 euros it's not 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.580
 dear you still have a man of 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.740
 quality that works very well they 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.500
 have right right around it all 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.040
 like what to emphasize 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.420
 America is everything for today 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.740
 if you too have but this video you 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.570
 can feel it abroad who is 3rd 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.800
 the flesh r by sharing this video 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.520
 on social networks the r of 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.420

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.530
 comment to tell me what you 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.360
 think this pretty lob 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.980
 and then as usual if we reach 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.020
 by miracle and 300 comments are 1 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.010
 between you who will hold this pretty a usb 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.750
 it's easy I give him a 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.430
 comment and no sends you a hub to 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.830
 whoever wins is drawn by 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.150
 hiking the magician here and r 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.800
 blue thumb because it's always 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.600
 pleasure and not that allows us 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.560
 encourage for our work more 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.720
 technique that's all for today 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.340

 the weakest blogger and the web the 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.800
 only bloggers who tests you 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.270
 high tech with a little bit of humor 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.850
 sometimes not always today it was 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.100
