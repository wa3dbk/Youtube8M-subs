00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
ingredients now don't be put off this

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.539 
ingredients now don't be put off this
doesn't<00:01:32.350> look<00:01:32.500> particularly<00:01:32.799> appetizing<00:01:33.009> yet

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
doesn't look particularly appetizing yet

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.969 
doesn't look particularly appetizing yet
but<00:01:33.790> it<00:01:33.880> will<00:01:34.090> trust<00:01:34.570> me<00:01:34.780> so<00:01:35.619> what<00:01:35.740> we<00:01:35.799> need<00:01:35.920> to

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
but it will trust me so what we need to

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.260 
but it will trust me so what we need to
start<00:01:36.159> with<00:01:36.310> is<00:01:36.490> a<00:01:36.520> bit<00:01:36.700> of<00:01:36.789> tomato<00:01:37.030> puree

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
start with is a bit of tomato puree

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.490 
start with is a bit of tomato puree
roughly<00:01:38.170> about<00:01:38.229> two<00:01:38.590> tablespoons<00:01:39.310> worth

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
roughly about two tablespoons worth

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.810 
roughly about two tablespoons worth
which<00:01:41.500> will<00:01:41.649> make<00:01:41.830> the<00:01:41.979> sauce<00:01:42.220> quite<00:01:42.490> thick

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
which will make the sauce quite thick

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.310 
which will make the sauce quite thick
but<00:01:42.850> also<00:01:43.270> it<00:01:43.360> gives<00:01:43.630> it<00:01:43.869> quite<00:01:44.140> a

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
but also it gives it quite a

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.429 
but also it gives it quite a
concentrated<00:01:45.070> tomato<00:01:46.060> flavor<00:01:46.479> so<00:01:47.080> you<00:01:47.140> just

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
concentrated tomato flavor so you just

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.700 
concentrated tomato flavor so you just
want<00:01:47.619> to<00:01:47.649> coat<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:49.450> meat<00:01:49.630> that's<00:01:49.810> in<00:01:49.990> here<00:01:50.320> in

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
want to coat the meat that's in here in

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.859 
want to coat the meat that's in here in
the<00:01:51.580> tomato<00:01:51.850> and<00:01:52.090> you<00:01:52.149> will<00:01:52.240> see<00:01:52.450> it<00:01:52.539> running

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
the tomato and you will see it running

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.190 
the tomato and you will see it running
into<00:01:53.080> the<00:01:53.200> juice<00:01:53.409> as<00:01:53.590> well<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.899> once<00:01:56.050> you've

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
into the juice as well and once you've

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.590 
into the juice as well and once you've
done<00:01:56.229> that<00:01:56.759> it's<00:01:57.759> time<00:01:58.000> to<00:01:58.149> add<00:01:58.299> even<00:01:58.509> more

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
done that it's time to add even more

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.210 
done that it's time to add even more

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
pair of scissors it makes it really easy

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.570 
pair of scissors it makes it really easy
and<00:02:11.260> it's<00:02:11.590> less<00:02:11.739> washing<00:02:12.010> up<00:02:12.130> which<00:02:12.280> is<00:02:12.370> always

pound<00:03:37.780> thick<00:03:38.140> slices<00:03:39.069> and<00:03:39.310> you<00:03:39.370> can<00:03:39.520> keep<00:03:39.610> the

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
pound thick slices and you can keep the

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.760 
pound thick slices and you can keep the
skins<00:03:39.940> on<00:03:40.090> that's<00:03:40.270> absolutely<00:03:40.660> fine<00:03:40.840> add<00:03:41.500> them

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
skins on that's absolutely fine add them

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:42.900 
skins on that's absolutely fine add them
to<00:03:41.860> the<00:03:41.950> pan<00:03:42.160> and<00:03:42.190> you'll<00:03:42.490> need<00:03:42.580> to<00:03:42.640> cook<00:03:42.790> them

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
to the pan and you'll need to cook them

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.610 
to the pan and you'll need to cook them
in<00:03:42.940> batches<00:03:43.360> because<00:03:43.510> 3ob<00:03:44.080> Jews<00:03:44.290> will<00:03:44.410> be<00:03:44.440> way

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
in batches because 3ob Jews will be way

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.199 
in batches because 3ob Jews will be way
too<00:03:44.680> much<00:03:44.980> for<00:03:45.250> one<00:03:45.370> frying<00:03:45.700> pan<00:03:45.910> no<00:03:46.060> matter

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
too much for one frying pan no matter

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.000 
too much for one frying pan no matter
how<00:03:46.390> big<00:03:46.570> it<00:03:46.690> is<00:03:46.720> you<00:03:47.050> need<00:03:47.650> to<00:03:47.740> make<00:03:47.830> sure<00:03:47.860> that

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
how big it is you need to make sure that

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.710 
how big it is you need to make sure that
they<00:03:48.250> go<00:03:48.430> Brown<00:03:48.670> on<00:03:48.880> both<00:03:49.060> sides<00:03:49.330> so<00:03:49.600> they're

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
they go Brown on both sides so they're

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.180 
they go Brown on both sides so they're
golden<00:03:50.170> and<00:03:50.290> when<00:03:50.650> they're<00:03:50.800> done<00:03:50.920> you<00:03:51.100> can

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
golden and when they're done you can

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.470 
golden and when they're done you can
just<00:03:51.220> pop<00:03:51.430> them<00:03:51.610> in<00:03:51.670> a<00:03:51.700> bowl<00:03:51.850> and<00:03:52.030> set<00:03:52.330> them

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
just pop them in a bowl and set them

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.820 
just pop them in a bowl and set them
aside<00:03:52.570> and<00:03:53.020> we'll<00:03:53.170> use<00:03:53.200> them<00:03:53.470> later

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
aside and we'll use them later

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.620 
aside and we'll use them later
next<00:03:54.730> we'll<00:03:54.819> need<00:03:54.850> to<00:03:54.970> make<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.209> white<00:03:55.360> sauce

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
next we'll need to make the white sauce

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.470 
next we'll need to make the white sauce
and<00:03:55.930> for<00:03:56.500> that<00:03:56.680> you<00:03:57.010> can<00:03:57.190> melt<00:03:57.459> butter<00:03:58.150> in<00:03:58.300> a

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
and for that you can melt butter in a

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.660 
and for that you can melt butter in a
pan<00:03:58.660> over<00:03:58.930> a<00:03:59.140> medium<00:03:59.170> heat<00:03:59.620> and<00:03:59.890> then<00:03:59.980> add<00:04:00.520> the

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
pan over a medium heat and then add the

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.009 
pan over a medium heat and then add the
flour<00:04:00.790> bit<00:04:01.090> by<00:04:01.239> bit<00:04:01.270> and<00:04:01.630> you<00:04:01.720> need<00:04:01.840> to<00:04:01.930> make

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
flour bit by bit and you need to make

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.050 
flour bit by bit and you need to make
sure<00:04:02.230> that<00:04:02.410> you're<00:04:02.590> stirring<00:04:02.950> it<00:04:03.190> in<00:04:03.340> really

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
sure that you're stirring it in really

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.759 
sure that you're stirring it in really
thoroughly<00:04:04.269> you<00:04:04.600> don't<00:04:04.780> want<00:04:04.959> a<00:04:05.050> lumpy<00:04:05.470> source

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
thoroughly you don't want a lumpy source

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.190 
thoroughly you don't want a lumpy source
so<00:04:06.519> flour<00:04:07.120> goes<00:04:07.300> in<00:04:07.450> bit<00:04:07.600> by<00:04:07.630> bit<00:04:07.720> and<00:04:08.080> then

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
so flour goes in bit by bit and then

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.810 
so flour goes in bit by bit and then
once<00:04:08.380> that's<00:04:08.560> all<00:04:08.769> mixed<00:04:08.800> in<00:04:09.250> you<00:04:09.489> can<00:04:09.610> start

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
once that's all mixed in you can start

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.460 
once that's all mixed in you can start
to<00:04:09.940> add<00:04:10.030> the<00:04:10.060> milk<00:04:10.330> and<00:04:10.600> again<00:04:10.989> take<00:04:11.200> it<00:04:11.290> really

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
to add the milk and again take it really

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.650 
to add the milk and again take it really
slowly<00:04:11.800> in<00:04:12.010> this<00:04:12.130> step<00:04:12.430> and<00:04:12.700> mix<00:04:13.180> it<00:04:13.330> in<00:04:13.420> really

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
slowly in this step and mix it in really

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.449 
slowly in this step and mix it in really
really<00:04:13.780> thoroughly<00:04:14.190> once<00:04:15.190> you've<00:04:15.310> done<00:04:15.400> that

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
really thoroughly once you've done that

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.159 
really thoroughly once you've done that
bit<00:04:15.970> of<00:04:16.060> salt<00:04:16.239> and<00:04:16.329> pepper<00:04:16.390> and<00:04:16.840> then<00:04:16.989> it<00:04:17.079> can

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
bit of salt and pepper and then it can

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.650 
bit of salt and pepper and then it can
be<00:04:17.230> set<00:04:17.470> aside<00:04:18.060> before<00:04:19.060> it<00:04:19.120> gets<00:04:19.239> assembled

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
be set aside before it gets assembled

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.240 
be set aside before it gets assembled
into<00:04:19.840> the<00:04:19.959> main<00:04:20.109> mix<00:04:20.290> now<00:04:20.769> all<00:04:21.040> of<00:04:21.160> our

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
into the main mix now all of our

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.040 
into the main mix now all of our
elements<00:04:21.640> are<00:04:21.730> ready<00:04:21.880> and<00:04:22.120> we're<00:04:22.480> ready<00:04:22.510> for

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
elements are ready and we're ready for

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.780 
elements are ready and we're ready for
assembly<00:04:23.260> so<00:04:23.980> we're<00:04:24.070> going<00:04:24.160> to<00:04:24.220> start<00:04:24.490> with

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
assembly so we're going to start with

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.970 
assembly so we're going to start with
putting<00:04:25.570> the<00:04:25.840> over<00:04:26.169> genes<00:04:26.380> which<00:04:26.560> are<00:04:26.650> lovely

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
putting the over genes which are lovely

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.719 
putting the over genes which are lovely
and<00:04:27.010> golden<00:04:27.250> brown<00:04:27.640> on<00:04:27.940> the<00:04:28.030> base<00:04:28.780> of<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:29.020> tin

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
and golden brown on the base of the tin

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:33.420 
and golden brown on the base of the tin
you<00:04:30.729> can<00:04:30.880> overlap<00:04:31.180> these<00:04:31.390> slightly<00:04:32.430> because

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
you can overlap these slightly because

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.150 
you can overlap these slightly because
we've<00:04:33.520> got<00:04:33.669> quite<00:04:33.880> a<00:04:33.940> few<00:04:34.919> and<00:04:35.919> that's<00:04:35.979> going

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
we've got quite a few and that's going

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.890 
we've got quite a few and that's going
to<00:04:36.220> make<00:04:36.310> a<00:04:36.370> really<00:04:36.729> lovely<00:04:37.180> base<00:04:37.479> for<00:04:37.780> the

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
to make a really lovely base for the

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.080 
to make a really lovely base for the
regu<00:04:38.350> sauce<00:04:38.650> to<00:04:38.860> go<00:04:38.950> on<00:04:38.979> top<00:04:39.100> to<00:04:39.669> be<00:04:39.760> honest<00:04:40.000> I

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
regu sauce to go on top to be honest I

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.159 
regu sauce to go on top to be honest I
could<00:04:40.180> probably<00:04:40.330> eat<00:04:40.540> them<00:04:40.660> just<00:04:40.870> like<00:04:40.960> this

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
could probably eat them just like this

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:42.930 
could probably eat them just like this
but<00:04:41.650> I'm<00:04:41.800> not<00:04:41.919> going<00:04:42.250> to<00:04:42.280> I'm<00:04:42.550> going<00:04:42.580> to<00:04:42.700> save

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
but I'm not going to I'm going to save

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.980 
but I'm not going to I'm going to save
them<00:04:43.180> once<00:04:44.169> you<00:04:44.290> have<00:04:44.410> your<00:04:44.500> first<00:04:44.770> layer<00:04:45.460> down

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
them once you have your first layer down

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.420 
them once you have your first layer down
it's<00:04:46.990> then<00:04:47.140> time<00:04:47.169> to<00:04:47.350> add<00:04:47.530> the<00:04:47.710> ragout<00:04:48.070> with

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
it's then time to add the ragout with

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.820 
it's then time to add the ragout with
the<00:04:48.700> lamb<00:04:49.300> in<00:04:49.540> and<00:04:50.050> take<00:04:50.260> the<00:04:50.350> cinnamon<00:04:50.500> stick

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
the lamb in and take the cinnamon stick

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.020 
the lamb in and take the cinnamon stick
out<00:04:50.979> can<00:04:51.190> definitely<00:04:51.460> don't<00:04:51.580> wanna<00:04:51.700> be<00:04:51.760> eating

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
out can definitely don't wanna be eating

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.760 
out can definitely don't wanna be eating
that<00:04:52.210> but<00:04:53.020> it<00:04:53.080> would<00:04:53.200> have<00:04:53.290> given<00:04:53.410> a<00:04:53.500> lovely

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
that but it would have given a lovely

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.370 
that but it would have given a lovely
flavor<00:04:54.040> to<00:04:54.280> the<00:04:54.370> sauce<00:04:54.870> so<00:04:55.870> a<00:04:55.900> couple<00:04:56.320> of

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
flavor to the sauce so a couple of

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.320 
flavor to the sauce so a couple of
spoons<00:04:56.680> of<00:04:56.800> this<00:04:56.860> on<00:04:57.190> top

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.510 

and<00:05:00.510> then<00:05:01.260> all<00:05:01.410> we're<00:05:01.500> going<00:05:01.590> to<00:05:01.650> do<00:05:01.890> is<00:05:02.130> do

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
and then all we're going to do is do

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.160 
and then all we're going to do is do
exactly<00:05:02.550> the<00:05:03.060> same<00:05:03.090> and<00:05:03.510> layer<00:05:03.690> some<00:05:03.960> more

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
exactly the same and layer some more
