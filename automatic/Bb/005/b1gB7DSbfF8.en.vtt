defender has their a fence or
de-escalation<00:01:00.479> stands<00:01:00.989> up<00:01:01.229> and<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.799> happens

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
de-escalation stands up and it happens

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:04.520 
de-escalation stands up and it happens
from<00:01:02.399> conversation<00:01:03.390> range<00:01:03.629> now<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
from conversation range now the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.830 
from conversation range now the
technique<00:01:05.070> outlined<00:01:05.700> for<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.119> drill<00:01:06.450> is

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
technique outlined for this drill is

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.770 
technique outlined for this drill is
basically<00:01:07.500> as<00:01:07.860> soon<00:01:07.950> as<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.610> defender<00:01:09.210> sees

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
basically as soon as the defender sees

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.990 
basically as soon as the defender sees
that<00:01:09.990> knife<00:01:10.229> being<00:01:10.860> drawn<00:01:11.189> from<00:01:11.759> wherever

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
that knife being drawn from wherever

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.450 
that knife being drawn from wherever
it's<00:01:12.780> being<00:01:12.840> ruled<00:01:13.229> from<00:01:13.500> he<00:01:13.950> has<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.310> then

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
it's being ruled from he has to then

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.179 
it's being ruled from he has to then
launch<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.240> palm<00:01:15.509> strike<00:01:15.770> directly<00:01:16.770> into<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
launch a palm strike directly into the

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.609 
launch a palm strike directly into the
face<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:18.090> attacker<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.750> then<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.200> second

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
face of the attacker and then the second

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.289 
face of the attacker and then the second
one<00:01:19.770> which<00:01:19.979> acts<00:01:20.190> more<00:01:20.369> like<00:01:20.460> as<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> push<00:01:21.060> and

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
one which acts more like as a push and

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.109 
one which acts more like as a push and
then<00:01:21.899> at<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.200> same<00:01:22.229> time<00:01:22.759> creating<00:01:23.759> distance

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
then at the same time creating distance

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:48.450 
then at the same time creating distance
and<00:01:24.390> then<00:01:24.569> escaping<00:01:24.929> this<00:01:25.229> thing

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.889 

so<00:01:49.460> what<00:01:49.610> we<00:01:49.670> found<00:01:49.880> in<00:01:50.090> this<00:01:50.180> drill<00:01:50.509> is

lips split but what it cannot protect

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.830 
lips split but what it cannot protect
you<00:02:36.140> from<00:02:36.380> is<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:37.280> concussive<00:02:37.790> effect<00:02:38.090> of

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
you from is the concussive effect of

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.930 
you from is the concussive effect of
your<00:02:38.989> brain<00:02:39.320> being<00:02:39.920> shaking<00:02:40.459> inside<00:02:40.579> the

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
your brain being shaking inside the

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.729 
your brain being shaking inside the
skull<00:02:41.239> and<00:02:41.480> that<00:02:41.510> is<00:02:41.900> of<00:02:42.079> course<00:02:42.110> what<00:02:42.530> chip

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
skull and that is of course what chip

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.030 
skull and that is of course what chip
achieves<00:02:43.190> a<00:02:43.340> knockout<00:02:43.700> and<00:02:44.380> so<00:02:45.380> you<00:02:45.440> see<00:02:46.010> I

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
achieves a knockout and so you see I

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.430 
achieves a knockout and so you see I
stopped<00:02:46.489> there<00:02:46.760> like<00:02:46.970> that<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.810> reason<00:02:48.200> we<00:02:48.290> do

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
stopped there like that the reason we do

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.140 
stopped there like that the reason we do
it<00:02:48.620> is<00:02:48.650> because<00:02:49.100> it<00:02:49.370> just<00:02:49.700> it's<00:02:50.060> very

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
it is because it just it's very

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.380 
it is because it just it's very
effective<00:02:50.690> now<00:02:51.410> as<00:02:51.620> a<00:02:51.650> defender<00:02:52.310> what<00:02:53.030> what<00:02:53.360> I

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
effective now as a defender what what I

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.020 
effective now as a defender what what I
found<00:02:53.780> personally<00:02:54.200> is<00:02:54.769> them<00:02:54.980> on<00:02:55.250> that<00:02:55.579> initial

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
found personally is them on that initial

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.690 
found personally is them on that initial
palm<00:02:56.269> strike<00:02:56.660> what<00:02:57.170> I<00:02:57.200> wanted<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.709> do<00:02:57.860> was<00:02:58.370> drop

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
palm strike what I wanted to do was drop

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.210 
palm strike what I wanted to do was drop
a<00:02:58.810> bit<00:02:59.810> of<00:02:59.840> weight<00:03:00.170> into<00:03:00.470> it<00:03:00.620> I<00:03:00.709> wanted<00:03:00.950> to<00:03:01.040> put

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
a bit of weight into it I wanted to put

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.340 
a bit of weight into it I wanted to put
some<00:03:01.400> some<00:03:01.850> some<00:03:02.209> force<00:03:02.540> behind<00:03:02.750> it<00:03:03.079> dropped

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
some some some force behind it dropped

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.650 
some some some force behind it dropped
some<00:03:03.500> body<00:03:03.709> weight<00:03:03.920> into<00:03:04.160> it<00:03:04.310> to<00:03:05.120> add<00:03:05.450> more

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
some body weight into it to add more

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.270 
some body weight into it to add more
force<00:03:06.019> to<00:03:06.109> that<00:03:06.350> palm<00:03:06.680> strike

force to that palm strike

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.780 
force to that palm strike
but<00:03:08.530> what<00:03:09.530> what<00:03:09.859> seemed<00:03:10.100> to<00:03:10.250> happen<00:03:10.430> was

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
but what what seemed to happen was

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.180 
but what what seemed to happen was
because<00:03:11.290> there<00:03:12.290> has<00:03:12.470> to<00:03:12.500> be<00:03:12.680> a<00:03:12.799> bit<00:03:13.010> of<00:03:13.100> a

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
because there has to be a bit of a

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.699 
because there has to be a bit of a
polarity<00:03:13.700> change<00:03:14.390> in<00:03:14.630> your<00:03:14.780> in<00:03:14.930> your<00:03:14.959> in<00:03:15.530> your

polarity change in your in your in your
nervous<00:03:16.280> system<00:03:16.459> when<00:03:16.790> you<00:03:16.880> do<00:03:17.030> that<00:03:17.269> because

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
nervous system when you do that because

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.479 
nervous system when you do that because
what<00:03:18.170> happens<00:03:18.500> if<00:03:18.709> you've<00:03:18.859> said<00:03:19.160> when<00:03:19.340> your

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
what happens if you've said when your

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.550 
what happens if you've said when your
weight<00:03:19.670> not<00:03:20.209> one<00:03:20.420> or<00:03:20.570> all<00:03:20.720> of<00:03:20.750> it<00:03:21.019> but<00:03:21.200> some<00:03:21.260> of

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
weight not one or all of it but some of

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.349 
weight not one or all of it but some of
your<00:03:21.680> weight<00:03:21.890> into<00:03:22.100> that<00:03:22.220> strike<00:03:22.640> you've<00:03:23.120> now

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
your weight into that strike you've now

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:27.250 
your weight into that strike you've now
got<00:03:23.600> to<00:03:23.750> stop<00:03:24.109> and<00:03:24.410> now<00:03:25.040> reverse<00:03:25.280> and<00:03:26.079> cause<00:03:27.079> it

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
got to stop and now reverse and cause it

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.319 
got to stop and now reverse and cause it
a<00:03:27.410> totally<00:03:27.859> opposite<00:03:28.370> reaction<00:03:28.880> to<00:03:28.940> happen<00:03:29.209> in

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
a totally opposite reaction to happen in

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.870 
a totally opposite reaction to happen in
your<00:03:29.420> body<00:03:29.570> in<00:03:30.079> order<00:03:30.410> to<00:03:30.530> get<00:03:31.459> that<00:03:31.579> distance

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
your body in order to get that distance

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.970 
your body in order to get that distance
so<00:03:32.660> what<00:03:32.870> was<00:03:32.989> happening<00:03:33.380> when<00:03:33.530> I<00:03:33.560> did<00:03:33.799> that

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
so what was happening when I did that

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.710 
so what was happening when I did that
there<00:03:34.130> was<00:03:34.220> a<00:03:34.280> bit<00:03:34.430> of<00:03:34.519> a<00:03:34.579> time<00:03:34.850> lag<00:03:35.120> and<00:03:35.600> we

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
there was a bit of a time lag and we

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.270 
there was a bit of a time lag and we
found<00:03:36.019> that<00:03:36.230> I<00:03:36.260> was<00:03:36.500> getting<00:03:36.739> stabbed<00:03:37.070> at

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
found that I was getting stabbed at

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.020 
found that I was getting stabbed at
least<00:03:37.459> once

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
least once

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.000 
least once
and<00:03:38.180> although<00:03:38.629> the<00:03:38.930> palm<00:03:39.140> strike<00:03:39.470> was<00:03:39.709> very

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
and although the palm strike was very

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.830 
and although the palm strike was very
effective<00:03:40.610> I

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
effective I

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.960 
effective I
was<00:03:42.019> also<00:03:42.290> catching<00:03:42.739> one<00:03:42.920> on<00:03:43.160> the<00:03:43.640> way<00:03:43.760> in

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
was also catching one on the way in

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.070 
was also catching one on the way in
before<00:03:44.269> I<00:03:44.510> made<00:03:44.900> my<00:03:44.930> kind<00:03:45.769> of<00:03:46.060> exit<00:03:47.060> out<00:03:47.269> so

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
before I made my kind of exit out so

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.500 
before I made my kind of exit out so
when<00:03:48.590> I<00:03:48.620> changed<00:03:49.160> that<00:03:49.340> and<00:03:49.700> what<00:03:49.879> I<00:03:49.940> did<00:03:50.150> was

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
when I changed that and what I did was

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.770 
when I changed that and what I did was
instead<00:03:50.900> just<00:03:51.170> use<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:52.190> power<00:03:52.430> of<00:03:52.519> my<00:03:52.760> arm<00:03:53.030> so

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
instead just use the power of my arm so

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.930 
instead just use the power of my arm so
I<00:03:53.810> hit<00:03:54.470> and<00:03:54.709> kind<00:03:55.370> of<00:03:55.489> move<00:03:55.700> back

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
I hit and kind of move back

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.420 
I hit and kind of move back
simultaneously<00:03:56.840> I<00:03:57.050> found<00:03:57.709> as<00:03:57.860> I<00:03:58.010> didn't<00:03:58.280> get

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
simultaneously I found as I didn't get

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.400 
simultaneously I found as I didn't get
stabbed<00:03:58.730> because<00:03:59.480> I<00:03:59.510> was<00:03:59.750> already<00:03:59.900> out<00:04:00.140> of

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
stabbed because I was already out of

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:01.809 
stabbed because I was already out of
there<00:04:00.530> by<00:04:00.680> the<00:04:00.709> time<00:04:00.980> the<00:04:01.160> knife<00:04:01.310> was<00:04:01.549> drawn

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
there by the time the knife was drawn

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.920 
there by the time the knife was drawn
and<00:04:02.890> what<00:04:03.890> the<00:04:04.099> defender<00:04:04.670> found<00:04:04.940> was<00:04:05.450> that<00:04:05.480> the

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
and what the defender found was that the

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.720 
and what the defender found was that the
palm<00:04:06.170> strike<00:04:06.440> was<00:04:06.620> still<00:04:06.860> just<00:04:06.890> as<00:04:07.250> effective

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
palm strike was still just as effective

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.180 
palm strike was still just as effective
so<00:04:08.239> if<00:04:08.330> you<00:04:08.540> just<00:04:09.379> takes<00:04:09.620> a<00:04:09.709> bit<00:04:09.860> of<00:04:09.890> training

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
so if you just takes a bit of training

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.100 
so if you just takes a bit of training
and<00:04:10.459> I<00:04:10.489> guess<00:04:10.700> to<00:04:10.910> be<00:04:11.150> able<00:04:11.360> to<00:04:11.450> develop<00:04:11.690> enough

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
and I guess to be able to develop enough

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.199 
and I guess to be able to develop enough
power<00:04:12.379> in<00:04:12.680> in<00:04:13.220> the<00:04:13.310> armor<00:04:13.730> though<00:04:13.880> without

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
power in in the armor though without

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.610 
power in in the armor though without
relying<00:04:14.870> on<00:04:15.140> hips<00:04:16.010> motion<00:04:16.430> just<00:04:16.669> enough

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
relying on hips motion just enough

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.740 
relying on hips motion just enough
strike<00:04:18.620> just<00:04:18.979> from<00:04:19.160> the<00:04:19.250> arm<00:04:19.489> and<00:04:20.329> I'm<00:04:20.570> not<00:04:20.720> a

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
strike just from the arm and I'm not a

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.040 
strike just from the arm and I'm not a
big<00:04:21.220> muscley<00:04:22.220> guy<00:04:22.430> and<00:04:22.700> yet<00:04:23.389> it<00:04:23.570> still<00:04:23.810> had<00:04:24.020> a

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
big muscley guy and yet it still had a

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.379 
big muscley guy and yet it still had a
concussive<00:04:24.530> effect<00:04:24.800> on<00:04:25.460> currents<00:04:26.000> so<00:04:26.150> if<00:04:26.270> I

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
concussive effect on currents so if I

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:32.830 
concussive effect on currents so if I
can<00:04:26.600> pull<00:04:26.840> that<00:04:26.870> off<00:04:27.020> then<00:04:27.320> then<00:04:28.070> anybody<00:04:28.310> can

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.590 

okay<00:04:33.710> so<00:04:33.800> in<00:04:34.160> the<00:04:34.280> next<00:04:34.490> variation<00:04:35.030> of<00:04:35.510> the

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
okay so in the next variation of the

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.760 
okay so in the next variation of the
drill<00:04:35.840> the<00:04:36.710> only<00:04:37.160> difference<00:04:37.520> is<00:04:37.700> now<00:04:37.940> the<00:04:38.770> the

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
drill the only difference is now the the

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.830 
drill the only difference is now the the
attacker<00:04:40.130> already<00:04:40.610> has<00:04:40.880> the<00:04:41.030> knife<00:04:41.210> out<00:04:41.510> so<00:04:41.750> he

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
attacker already has the knife out so he

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.020 
attacker already has the knife out so he
doesn't<00:04:42.110> have<00:04:42.200> to<00:04:42.350> draw<00:04:42.650> it<00:04:42.860> but<00:04:43.370> it<00:04:43.490> sits<00:04:43.730> down

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
doesn't have to draw it but it sits down

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.180 
doesn't have to draw it but it sits down
by<00:04:44.389> his<00:04:44.600> side<00:04:44.840> and<00:04:45.169> it's<00:04:45.290> already<00:04:45.620> in<00:04:45.800> his<00:04:45.919> hand

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
by his side and it's already in his hand

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.909 
by his side and it's already in his hand
and<00:04:46.370> what<00:04:47.240> we<00:04:47.360> found<00:04:47.540> was<00:04:48.320> pretty<00:04:48.470> much<00:04:48.740> the

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
and what we found was pretty much the

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.100 
and what we found was pretty much the
same<00:04:49.100> thing<00:04:49.400> it<00:04:49.940> was<00:04:50.090> just<00:04:50.120> slightly<00:04:50.510> more

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
same thing it was just slightly more

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.590 
same thing it was just slightly more
likely<00:04:51.620> that<00:04:52.190> the<00:04:52.400> defender<00:04:52.850> will<00:04:52.940> get<00:04:53.180> nicked

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
likely that the defender will get nicked

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.770 
likely that the defender will get nicked
by<00:04:54.350> the<00:04:54.410> knife<00:04:54.830> but<00:04:55.550> the<00:04:56.000> effect<00:04:56.360> on<00:04:56.600> the

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
by the knife but the effect on the

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.650 
by the knife but the effect on the
attacker<00:04:57.200> and<00:04:57.700> the<00:04:58.700> effect<00:04:59.030> on<00:04:59.210> that<00:04:59.240> on<00:04:59.510> the

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
attacker and the effect on that on the

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.880 
attacker and the effect on that on the
knife<00:05:00.010> person<00:05:01.010> was<00:05:01.340> still<00:05:01.580> the<00:05:01.700> same
