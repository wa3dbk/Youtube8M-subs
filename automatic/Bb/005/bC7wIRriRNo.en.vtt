be very effective in putting each of

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.640 
be very effective in putting each of
them<00:03:27.099> in<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.280> positions<00:03:27.730> they<00:03:27.940> need<00:03:28.090> to<00:03:28.180> be<00:03:28.330> in

them in the positions they need to be in

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.900 
them in the positions they need to be in
therefore<00:03:29.650> you<00:03:29.739> need<00:03:29.859> to<00:03:29.950> develop<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:30.340> habits

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
therefore you need to develop the habits

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.870 
therefore you need to develop the habits
that<00:03:31.030> allow<00:03:31.390> you<00:03:31.450> to<00:03:32.220> automatically<00:03:33.220> put<00:03:33.730> your

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
head paddle boat and body in the right

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.920 
head paddle boat and body in the right
positions<00:03:36.670> and<00:03:36.910> then<00:03:37.269> that's<00:03:37.450> right<00:03:37.720> those

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
positions and then that's right those

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.330 
positions and then that's right those
are<00:03:37.959> the<00:03:38.140> four<00:03:38.410> things<00:03:38.709> that<00:03:38.980> you're<00:03:39.190> gonna

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
are the four things that you're gonna

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.400 
are the four things that you're gonna
want<00:03:39.640> to<00:03:39.760> learn<00:03:39.940> to<00:03:40.120> control<00:03:40.510> head<00:03:40.930> paddle

want to learn to control head paddle

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.590 
want to learn to control head paddle
boat<00:03:41.560> and<00:03:41.739> body<00:03:41.920> so<00:03:42.670> that's<00:03:42.850> our<00:03:43.030> primary

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600
