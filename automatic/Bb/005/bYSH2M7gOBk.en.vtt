00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.870 
to actually add low-back backing to that
because<00:02:48.299> it<00:02:48.599> would<00:02:48.750> quite<00:02:49.110> kick<00:02:49.440> my<00:02:50.310> grills<00:02:50.610> I

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
because it would quite kick my grills I

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.900 
because it would quite kick my grills I
guess<00:02:51.269> bigger<00:02:51.510> than<00:02:51.769> the<00:02:52.769> most<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:54.120> then<00:02:54.209> some

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
guess bigger than the most and then some

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.670 
guess bigger than the most and then some
so<00:02:56.910> there<00:02:57.269> we<00:02:57.360> go<00:02:57.390> there's<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.989> meat<00:02:58.170> over<00:02:58.620> it

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
so there we go there's the meat over it

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.270 
so there we go there's the meat over it
won't<00:02:59.069> be<00:02:59.190> able<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.430> close<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.989> lid<00:03:01.040> but<00:03:02.040> that

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
won't be able to close the lid but that

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:13.530 
won't be able to close the lid but that
should<00:03:02.519> be<00:03:02.549> what<00:03:03.450> should<00:03:03.629> be<00:03:03.660> fine<00:03:10.489> looks<00:03:11.489> good

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
should be what should be fine looks good

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.819 
should be what should be fine looks good
well<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:15.310> proof<00:03:15.549> is<00:03:15.760> in<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:15.939> eating<00:03:16.829> we'll

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
well the proof is in the eating we'll

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.959 
well the proof is in the eating we'll
see<00:03:18.329> i'll<00:03:19.329> just<00:03:19.540> keep<00:03:19.719> flipping<00:03:20.140> this<00:03:20.700> ever<00:03:21.700> so

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:21.969 
see i'll just keep flipping this ever so

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:29.820 
see i'll just keep flipping this ever so
often

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:37.440 

it's<00:03:30.400> definitely<00:03:30.910> hot<00:03:34.350> looks<00:03:35.350> good<00:03:36.450> can't

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
it's definitely hot looks good can't

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.300 
it's definitely hot looks good can't
wait<00:03:37.510> to<00:03:37.630> eat<00:03:37.900> it<00:03:40.650> okay<00:03:41.650> let's<00:03:41.890> flip<00:03:42.160> it<00:03:42.280> and

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
wait to eat it okay let's flip it and

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.550 
wait to eat it okay let's flip it and
see<00:03:42.520> what<00:03:42.640> it<00:03:42.700> looks<00:03:42.910> like<00:03:43.200> been<00:03:44.200> on<00:03:44.320> there<00:03:44.530> for

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
see what it looks like been on there for

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:56.710 
see what it looks like been on there for
a<00:03:44.800> few<00:03:45.010> minutes<00:03:45.840> smells<00:03:46.840> good

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.140

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.559 

definitely<00:04:02.150> hotter

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.270 

for<00:04:06.230> the<00:04:06.349> middle<00:04:06.590> so<00:04:06.709> I'm<00:04:06.769> going<00:04:06.920> to<00:04:06.950> move<00:04:07.099> some

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
for the middle so I'm going to move some

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:15.160 
for the middle so I'm going to move some
coals<00:04:07.519> around<00:04:13.180> looks<00:04:14.180> good<00:04:14.420> and<00:04:14.599> smells<00:04:14.659> good

this<00:04:15.650> point<00:04:16.090> had<00:04:17.090> to<00:04:17.180> move<00:04:17.299> some<00:04:17.359> of<00:04:17.600> the<00:04:17.750> coals

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
this point had to move some of the coals

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.099 
this point had to move some of the coals
around<00:04:18.380> because<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:18.949> end<00:04:19.910> down<00:04:20.120> here<00:04:20.389> didn't

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
around because the end down here didn't

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:33.749 
around because the end down here didn't
seem<00:04:21.229> like<00:04:21.259> it<00:04:21.410> was<00:04:21.530> getting<00:04:22.360> grilled<00:04:23.360> as<00:04:23.599> well

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:46.969 

sounds<00:04:34.759> good

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:05:25.520 

okay<00:04:47.979> start<00:04:49.169> slicing<00:04:50.169> some<00:04:50.560> of<00:04:50.710> this

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:51.679

00:05:51.679 --> 00:05:51.689 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:06:04.960 

it's<00:05:52.689> medium<00:05:53.110> anywhere

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:30.110
