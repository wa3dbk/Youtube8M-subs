00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.020
 You have a bag 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.640
 constitution that you want to close 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.950
 for example, a rice packaging or 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.360
 then have a candy under pack 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.769
 I now a super practical 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.809
 closure and portioned trick 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.760
 just cuts the upper one 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.050
 End of a plastic water bottles 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.340
 turn your packaging tight 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.140
 and the water bottle end dies 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.580
 You can now open the packaging 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.320
 and then you can just do that 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:31.410
 Cover the packaging wisely 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.030
 and goals have just cooked and that 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.300
 with onions and garlic 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.010
 delicious but not for the nose after 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.480
 hook wind around your hands namely 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.040
 disgusting and this odor gets her 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.620
 unfortunately not really so bad with soaps 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.149
 but write with a spoon 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.340
 Hands on washing simply on the spoon 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.219
 by the metal is the bad garlic 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.989
 and onion smell neutralized because 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.770
 Metal splits the smell leaving it 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.630
 no longer quite a display shortage 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.780
 if you scratch on your smartphone 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.310
 You can easily display this with display 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.840
 toothpaste either distributes the paste 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.610
 with circular movements on the 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.330
 display and will it with a damp 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:13.400
 towel back down works well too 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.400
 dvd body but unfortunately not at 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.929
 delicious first website but always this 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.340
 annoying in struckum with the knife if 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:24.560
 you do not make it as easy as me 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.140
 now you cut because this is too much 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.270
 from the value but there is one 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.770
 Simple trick next to a straw 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.659

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.100

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.100

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.240
 screw 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.960
 You have to have a screw solution 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.430
 unfortunately not the right one 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.790

 elastic band on the screw head lays and 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.430
 Now press the screwdriver on it and 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.030
 then turns that will not fit 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.030
 made suitable 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.110
