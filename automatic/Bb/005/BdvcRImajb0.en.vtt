gonna lie I have a really bad set of
armor<00:04:18.099> on<00:04:18.280> right<00:04:18.759> now<00:04:19.259> so<00:04:20.259> kind<00:04:20.560> of<00:04:20.620> don't<00:04:20.680> pay

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:20.949 
armor on right now so kind of don't pay

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:24.240 
armor on right now so kind of don't pay
attention<00:04:21.039> attention<00:04:21.760> to<00:04:22.120> that

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
attention attention to that

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.860 

but<00:04:25.060> yeah<00:04:26.490> now<00:04:27.490> this<00:04:27.670> is<00:04:27.790> me<00:04:27.940> my<00:04:28.180> dragon<00:04:28.600> armor

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
but yeah now this is me my dragon armor

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.220 
but yeah now this is me my dragon armor
this<00:04:29.500> is<00:04:29.620> what<00:04:29.770> I<00:04:29.800> would<00:04:29.920> normally<00:04:30.400> be<00:04:30.760> wearing

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
this is what I would normally be wearing

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.710 
this is what I would normally be wearing
so<00:04:32.230> it<00:04:32.650> blends<00:04:32.920> in<00:04:33.100> fairly<00:04:33.760> well<00:04:33.910> I<00:04:34.120> guess<00:04:34.390> I

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
so it blends in fairly well I guess I

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.290 
so it blends in fairly well I guess I
think<00:04:35.290> it<00:04:35.410> would<00:04:35.530> look<00:04:35.560> best<00:04:35.890> with<00:04:36.190> like<00:04:36.820> a

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
think it would look best with like a

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.140 
think it would look best with like a
heavy<00:04:37.690> Falmer<00:04:38.140> armor<00:04:38.470> on<00:04:38.680> so<00:04:39.640> you<00:04:39.700> guys<00:04:39.880> can

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150
