00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.310
 the staff what these three ladies have 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.450

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.540
 snapdragon processor 4 410 block 306 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.969
 and everyone here I think everyone here I believe 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.299
 that are one with the day of the 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:07.729
 Worth the memory right here I am in the 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:11.930
 android lollipop 5.1.1 here i am on 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:13.710
 444 as well as here are 44 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.710
 46 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:20.700
 64 bits have not enabled module 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:23.370
 64-bit pro pro moto gp third generation 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.470
 personal touch but the video is not for 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.430
 that this was only part of the video 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.390
 I have it here 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.760
 besides the year, I have to show you have 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:37.050
 here some tricks here summarized the video 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.320
 is a bit like the students to pay the screen 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:43.350
 I go now for a little while the cell phone 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.410
 is what he has this feature here that 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.840
 It's the one that comes from the bike, right? 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.810
 I remember I even had the g2 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.270
 I think you get it so shake it 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.760
 calls you up to display the time 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.100
 he already paid again and I 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.990
 I tried to do this, not being able to 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.350
 first first second of his video 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:07.770
 you do so he goes and rocks 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:13.470
 balance and it shows that there are two 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:15.390
 times led twice he goes out to 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:20.130
 people pick up the same here on the bike x too 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:25.680
 without waiting to do so รณ it connects to the 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:28.950
 his personal camera to prove it 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.500
 is that books pr is always forget, huh? 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.110
 and now I'll tell you he has 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.600
 here is the camera side of the home well 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.940
 side where you can see that he has 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.100
 something different I think this one is 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.000
 the light sensor and the side here 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:47.310
 is the so-called notifications led 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.110
 so that's probably what he has 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.760
 so take notifications 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.430
 I tried to send a message to me. 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.380
 same civilian who arrived here a message 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.190
 that in the gmail 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.810
 only he did not turn on the led then I took the 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.310
 sismmar I still want to do another test 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.080
 to see if it has led 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:10.020
 we can also test in the zap batch 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:12.750
 right people is what I hope 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.570
 You liked it and the tricks there. 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.880
 benchmarks that are very well indeed 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.220

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.090
