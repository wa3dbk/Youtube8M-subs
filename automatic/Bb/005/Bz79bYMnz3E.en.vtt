00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.550 

well<00:00:14.850> the<00:00:15.120> Hawaiian<00:00:15.810> series<00:00:16.139> has<00:00:16.260> stemmed

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
well the Hawaiian series has stemmed

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.560 
well the Hawaiian series has stemmed
from<00:00:19.070> techniques<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.970> techniques<00:00:21.330> I've<00:00:21.450> been

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
from techniques the techniques I've been

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.590 
from techniques the techniques I've been
using<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:22.050> make<00:00:22.890> my<00:00:23.040> glass<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.610> it's<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:23.970> they

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
using to make my glass and it's and they

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.040 
using to make my glass and it's and they
should<00:00:24.750> devolved<00:00:25.200> into<00:00:25.380> one<00:00:25.800> doing<00:00:26.070> now<00:00:26.250> so

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
should devolved into one doing now so

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.019 
should devolved into one doing now so
the<00:00:28.050> main<00:00:28.230> technique<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:29.189> use<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.730> basically

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
the main technique of use is basically

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:38.630 
the main technique of use is basically
by<00:00:30.210> overlaying<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.840> colored<00:00:31.140> glass<00:00:37.489> to<00:00:38.489> what

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
by overlaying the colored glass to what

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.280 
by overlaying the colored glass to what
the<00:00:38.760> woven<00:00:39.060> series<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:41.630> is<00:00:42.630> made<00:00:42.960> up<00:00:43.140> of

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
the woven series is is is made up of

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.520 
the woven series is is is made up of
over<00:00:43.890> lazed<00:00:44.340> canes<00:00:44.880> so<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.570> premade<00:00:46.140> canes

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
over lazed canes so the premade canes

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.460 
over lazed canes so the premade canes
which<00:00:46.860> are<00:00:47.720> some<00:00:48.720> of<00:00:48.810> them<00:00:48.900> have<00:00:49.080> hurts<00:00:49.320> or

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
which are some of them have hurts or

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.840 
which are some of them have hurts or
three<00:00:49.710> layers<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.040> color<00:00:50.280> on<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.640> they're

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
three layers of color on and they're

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.890 
three layers of color on and they're
stretched<00:00:51.180> out<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:52.130> cut<00:00:53.130> up<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.730> then<00:00:54.570> added

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
stretched out and cut up and then added

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.260 
stretched out and cut up and then added
to<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.080> surface<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.710> clear<00:00:55.950> piece<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.490> blown

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
to the surface of a clear piece a blown

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.930 
to the surface of a clear piece a blown
clear<00:00:57.600> please<00:00:59.480> once<00:01:00.480> I've<00:01:00.660> done<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:00.900> then

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
clear please once I've done that then

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.210 
clear please once I've done that then
I'd<00:01:02.940> let<00:01:03.210> them<00:01:03.360> blow<00:01:03.630> the<00:01:03.780> piece<00:01:03.960> up<00:01:04.170> into<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
I'd let them blow the piece up into the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.670 
I'd let them blow the piece up into the
form<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.759> need<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.240> then<00:01:07.020> let<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.530> cool

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
form that I need and then let it cool

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.020 
form that I need and then let it cool
down<00:01:11.540> once<00:01:12.540> it's<00:01:12.720> cold<00:01:12.990> pulled<00:01:13.439> down<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.770> kiln

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
down once it's cold pulled down the kiln

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.720 
down once it's cold pulled down the kiln
then<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.420> pieces<00:01:15.750> then<00:01:15.930> cut<00:01:16.310> to<00:01:17.310> reveal<00:01:17.580> with

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.730 
then the pieces then cut to reveal with

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:24.050 
then the pieces then cut to reveal with
each<00:01:17.880> layer<00:01:18.120> from<00:01:18.659> each<00:01:18.780> cane<00:01:22.730> there's<00:01:23.730> no<00:01:23.880> way

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
each layer from each cane there's no way

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.940 
each layer from each cane there's no way
really<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.450> making<00:01:24.810> these<00:01:25.140> on<00:01:25.350> their<00:01:25.500> own<00:01:25.650> each

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
really of making these on their own each

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.660 
really of making these on their own each
process<00:01:26.430> needs<00:01:27.260> needing<00:01:28.260> the<00:01:28.380> system<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:29.640> that

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
process needs needing the system so that

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.640 
process needs needing the system so that
creates<00:01:30.270> an<00:01:30.390> environment<00:01:30.470> quite<00:01:31.470> an

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
creates an environment quite an

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.820 
creates an environment quite an
environment<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.130> workshop<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:33.800> like<00:01:34.800> a

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
environment in workshop I like a

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:35.600 
environment in workshop I like a
challenge

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
challenge

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.230 
challenge
I<00:01:35.870> like<00:01:36.870> to<00:01:36.990> try<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.229> perfect<00:01:38.240> certain

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
I like to try and perfect certain

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.110 
I like to try and perfect certain
techniques<00:01:39.690> and<00:01:40.490> what<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.520> really<00:01:41.909> like<00:01:42.090> about

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
techniques and what I really like about

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.120 
techniques and what I really like about
them<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:44.720> they<00:01:45.720> have<00:01:45.900> a<00:01:45.930> they're<00:01:46.710> quite<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.979> few

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
them is they have a they're quite a few

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.110 
them is they have a they're quite a few
different<00:01:47.400> processes<00:01:47.940> to<00:01:48.120> them<00:01:48.330> so<00:01:50.000> which<00:01:51.000> is

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
different processes to them so which is

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.510 
different processes to them so which is
quite<00:01:51.330> nice<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:52.440> just<00:01:52.470> makes<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.040> police<00:01:53.250> more

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
quite nice it just makes the police more

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.149 
quite nice it just makes the police more
elaborate<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.210> when<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.600> add<00:01:54.860> process<00:01:55.860> after

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
elaborate and when you add process after

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.080 
elaborate and when you add process after
process<00:01:56.869> then<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.020> end<00:01:58.200> up<00:01:58.380> with<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:59.060> lot<00:02:00.060> of

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
process then you end up with a lot of

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:08.400 
process then you end up with a lot of
detail

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.470 

you
