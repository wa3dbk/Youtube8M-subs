00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.819
 hello people i am there i am new 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.020
 at youtube and me now actually 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.389
 regularly here 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.099
 h how to put it in I'll take a look 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.420
 also very many yourself and find it 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.370
 actually quite sweet as the girls 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.570
 do something about it inside and 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.880
 she is also very interested 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.800
 and has me already well 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.680
 helped 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:26.369
 I still have weapons themselves appropriated 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.019
 of course, and yes I will you in the 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.650
 Hot mush because I hate that 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.710
 a limited three minutes talking and 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.250
 that then tilts or hair video or 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.620
 otherwise only really starts and said 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.760
 drives for girls the thick and heavy 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.910
 and volume does not matter 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.800
 Normally , I'm really okay 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.410
 It has previously really long hair 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.000
 content must be cut short because 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.829
 in short, if you get really fat and 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.820
 volume really had it if you had the 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.489
 have to cut a bit shorter 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.410
 hang down you really expect 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.930
 Logically , I usually have 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.909
 totally supple and has somewhere 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.850
 curly hair and until March also before 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.320
 all things in winter when you are in one 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.000
 had thick scarf when hang the 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.430
 hair then it just looks totally 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.650
 catastrophic from now and now I have 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.650
 finally for a few months 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.659
 we were figured out like it was not 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:30.390
 works that my hair look smoother 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:33.020
 light wind and shine good looks 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.170
 one is not so clever camera 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:42.329
 So wash it out if the hair 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:46.110
 really still ask are because use 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:50.820
 this fruit the miracle oil really that 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:54.689
 I think so expensive but that stops 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.350
 because I 've had that for five now 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.360
 months and just four empty and 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.520
 Thirdly, it's okay because you 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.310
 really only ever uses a drop 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.409
 and that's what you use 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.390
 A drop of up on the bark schmid 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.600
 is a profit you do that only in the 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.720
 lower havel is 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:20.660
 One is really not so voluminous 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:23.000
 and gaps leaf without summit center because 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.780
 down here from the ear not so pure 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:32.090
 top down 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:36.680
 then was put your hair and 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.700
 shampoo and conditioner and if you have the 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.740
 Rinses in it but really 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.870
 have pressed then knows the hair 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.120
 Again, I always do it that way 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.730
 I think it's great here I am 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:51.530
 after washing easier the years 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:54.140
 to be able to and I turn it off and 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.940
 too if I stop my hair hand 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:01.090
 I have dried towel here 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.680
 as I have music again purely make 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.120
 I do not always do it 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.350
 you do not have enough with me actually 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.670
 even if i am this fruity 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.230
 rhyming make washing wondered before 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.060
 But whoever wants to can hold the way to school 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.940
 At the Rhein we make it to the for 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.880
 Run and do that's just what you have left 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.030
 smoother and then take your time 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.580
 air dry and so can everyone 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.440
 through the dry and over again 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.900
 if you just brush your brush over 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.790
 times the hair really know your hair 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.840
 are dry 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:36.050
 because they are so smooth with me 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:39.350
 supple yes maybe you try 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.760
 I think it's quite good because 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.400
 I think I'm the only one 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.220
 one has a clue problems and above 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.170
 All in all, I find this method great because 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:53.440
 she does not necessarily have a good four years 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:55.910
 is and a good alternative then 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.360
 thanks for watching and see you 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.360
 next time
