00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
exciting you know and I think two really

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.499 
exciting you know and I think two really
key<00:01:03.100> changes<00:01:04.000> that<00:01:04.149> you<00:01:04.210> can<00:01:04.330> sort<00:01:04.449> of

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
key changes that you can sort of

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:06.540 
key changes that you can sort of
identify<00:01:04.600> really<00:01:05.110> easily<00:01:05.470> is<00:01:05.590> it<00:01:05.649> because<00:01:06.430> of

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
identify really easily is it because of

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.540 
identify really easily is it because of
all<00:01:06.700> the<00:01:06.850> research<00:01:07.570> about<00:01:07.840> the<00:01:07.960> brain<00:01:08.200> we<00:01:08.860> can

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
all the research about the brain we can

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.820 
all the research about the brain we can
teach<00:01:09.759> our<00:01:09.970> children<00:01:10.180> about<00:01:10.930> the<00:01:11.350> knowledge

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
teach our children about the knowledge

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.260 
teach our children about the knowledge
of<00:01:12.039> the<00:01:12.100> brain<00:01:12.310> how<00:01:12.550> does<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:12.789> brain<00:01:13.000> learn

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
of the brain how does the brain learn

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.149 
of the brain how does the brain learn
and<00:01:13.690> so<00:01:13.990> we<00:01:14.110> start<00:01:14.350> off<00:01:14.470> talking<00:01:14.710> about<00:01:14.890> the

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
and so we start off talking about the

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.880 
and so we start off talking about the
physical<00:01:15.490> structure<00:01:15.990> right<00:01:16.990> from<00:01:17.409> a<00:01:17.619> really

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
physical structure right from a really

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:18.539 
physical structure right from a really
young<00:01:18.310> age

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
young age

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:20.670 
young age
yeah<00:01:18.850> and<00:01:19.030> else<00:01:19.240> Jim<00:01:19.570> the<00:01:19.840> children<00:01:20.380> love<00:01:20.560> it

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
yeah and else Jim the children love it

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.350 
yeah and else Jim the children love it
don't<00:01:20.830> they<00:01:20.920> they<00:01:21.159> get<00:01:21.310> so<00:01:21.520> fascinated<00:01:22.299> about

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
don't they they get so fascinated about

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.140 
don't they they get so fascinated about
their<00:01:22.659> brain<00:01:22.869> and<00:01:23.170> then<00:01:24.010> on<00:01:24.340> top<00:01:24.670> of<00:01:24.729> that<00:01:24.880> we

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
their brain and then on top of that we

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.899 
their brain and then on top of that we
talk<00:01:25.360> about<00:01:25.630> how<00:01:26.110> their<00:01:26.409> brain<00:01:26.680> learns<00:01:27.369> you

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
talk about how their brain learns you

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:29.760 
talk about how their brain learns you
know<00:01:28.030> and<00:01:28.360> we<00:01:28.990> talk<00:01:29.170> about<00:01:29.290> that<00:01:29.560> we're<00:01:29.680> all

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
know and we talk about that we're all

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.469 
know and we talk about that we're all
different<00:01:29.979> in<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:30.580> own<00:01:30.880> in<00:01:31.000> different<00:01:31.330> ways

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
different in the own in different ways

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.289 
different in the own in different ways
and<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:33.220> that's<00:01:33.400> actually<00:01:33.700> really<00:01:33.850> exciting

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
and and that's actually really exciting

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.090 
and and that's actually really exciting
because<00:01:34.450> it<00:01:34.659> gives<00:01:34.810> them<00:01:34.930> a<00:01:35.140> language<00:01:35.890> on<00:01:36.070> how

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
because it gives them a language on how

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.429 
because it gives them a language on how
to<00:01:36.479> think<00:01:37.479> about<00:01:37.689> themselves<00:01:37.840> as<00:01:38.229> learners

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
to think about themselves as learners

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.440 
to think about themselves as learners
yeah<00:01:39.010> so<00:01:39.220> it's<00:01:39.340> not<00:01:39.400> just<00:01:39.520> about<00:01:39.850> filling<00:01:40.270> our

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
yeah so it's not just about filling our

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.600 
yeah so it's not just about filling our
kids<00:01:41.049> heads<00:01:41.290> with<00:01:41.380> facts<00:01:41.740> and<00:01:41.979> figures<00:01:42.130> is<00:01:42.460> it

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
kids heads with facts and figures is it

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.249 
kids heads with facts and figures is it
it's<00:01:42.729> not<00:01:42.939> it's<00:01:43.270> it's<00:01:43.540> really<00:01:43.810> different<00:01:44.049> to

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
it's not it's it's really different to

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.620 
it's not it's it's really different to
that<00:01:44.380> who's<00:01:44.680> different<00:01:45.040> yet<00:01:45.340> and<00:01:45.580> it's<00:01:46.420> really

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
that who's different yet and it's really

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.929 
that who's different yet and it's really
exciting<00:01:46.869> yeah<00:01:47.439> and<00:01:47.799> how<00:01:48.310> does<00:01:48.369> that<00:01:48.490> work<00:01:48.729> in

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
exciting yeah and how does that work in

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.490 
exciting yeah and how does that work in
the<00:01:49.090> early<00:01:49.600> years<00:01:49.750> so<00:01:50.619> yeah<00:01:51.100> well<00:01:51.520> I<00:01:51.549> guess<00:01:51.759> I'm

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
the early years so yeah well I guess I'm

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.289 
the early years so yeah well I guess I'm
down<00:01:53.500> there<00:01:53.799> now<00:01:53.979> wind<00:01:54.189> because<00:01:54.790> we've<00:01:55.119> got

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
down there now wind because we've got

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.230 
down there now wind because we've got
very<00:01:55.479> active<00:01:55.630> bodies<00:01:56.470> so<00:01:57.009> we've<00:01:57.460> got<00:01:57.610> got<00:01:58.030> lots

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
very active bodies so we've got got lots

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.179 
very active bodies so we've got got lots
of<00:01:58.360> hands-on<00:01:59.020> engaging<00:01:59.380> things<00:01:59.920> which<00:02:00.070> you

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
of hands-on engaging things which you

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:01.740 
of hands-on engaging things which you
want<00:02:00.340> children<00:02:00.460> to<00:02:00.640> be<00:02:00.670> engaged<00:02:01.090> and<00:02:01.360> build<00:02:01.630> up

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
want children to be engaged and build up

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.270 
want children to be engaged and build up
that<00:02:01.900> love<00:02:02.079> of<00:02:02.229> learning<00:02:02.380> so<00:02:03.009> that<00:02:03.040> they're

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
that love of learning so that they're

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.679 
that love of learning so that they're
active<00:02:03.700> and<00:02:03.909> they're<00:02:04.090> they're<00:02:04.450> actually

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
active and they're they're actually

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:07.350 
active and they're they're actually
choosing<00:02:05.320> work<00:02:06.220> so<00:02:06.460> a<00:02:06.490> lot<00:02:06.610> of<00:02:06.640> time<00:02:06.850> goes<00:02:07.090> into

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
choosing work so a lot of time goes into

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.780 
choosing work so a lot of time goes into
the<00:02:07.420> prepared<00:02:07.780> environment<00:02:08.399> after<00:02:09.399> observing

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
the prepared environment after observing

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.400 
the prepared environment after observing
children<00:02:10.360> and<00:02:10.479> their<00:02:10.600> interests<00:02:11.049> so<00:02:11.380> that

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
children and their interests so that

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.350 
children and their interests so that
then<00:02:11.620> they<00:02:11.769> can<00:02:11.799> be<00:02:12.220> almost<00:02:12.549> leading<00:02:13.180> their

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
then they can be almost leading their

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.569 
then they can be almost leading their
learning<00:02:13.840> by<00:02:14.320> accessing<00:02:15.130> those<00:02:15.220> sorts<00:02:15.519> of

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:15.579 
learning by accessing those sorts of

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:17.039 
learning by accessing those sorts of
things<00:02:15.820> and<00:02:16.060> then<00:02:16.180> we<00:02:16.209> talk<00:02:16.510> with<00:02:16.720> them<00:02:16.840> too<00:02:17.019> a

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
things and then we talk with them too a

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.039 
things and then we talk with them too a
lot<00:02:17.230> about<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.650> strengths<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:18.459> the<00:02:18.579> habits

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
lot about the strengths and the habits

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.120 
lot about the strengths and the habits
of<00:02:20.049> their<00:02:20.320> learning<00:02:20.470> so<00:02:20.739> you<00:02:20.799> know<00:02:20.919> being

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
of their learning so you know being

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.410 
of their learning so you know being
persistent

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
persistent

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.210 
persistent
you<00:02:22.599> know<00:02:22.720> and<00:02:22.870> being<00:02:23.440> able<00:02:23.560> to<00:02:23.709> see<00:02:23.890> something

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
you know and being able to see something

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.559 
you know and being able to see something
through<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.610> end<00:02:24.760> rather<00:02:24.970> than<00:02:25.120> giving<00:02:25.450> up

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
through the end rather than giving up

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.600 
through the end rather than giving up
and<00:02:25.870> talking<00:02:26.290> about<00:02:26.440> problem-solving<00:02:26.920> and

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
and talking about problem-solving and

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.339 
and talking about problem-solving and
and<00:02:27.760> just<00:02:28.270> all<00:02:28.420> lots<00:02:28.690> of<00:02:28.810> those<00:02:28.989> sorts<00:02:29.290> of

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
and just all lots of those sorts of

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.229 
and just all lots of those sorts of
habits<00:02:29.709> in<00:02:29.860> or<00:02:30.069> in<00:02:30.280> wonderment<00:02:30.670> we<00:02:30.940> really

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
habits in or in wonderment we really

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.150 
habits in or in wonderment we really
want<00:02:31.420> to<00:02:31.540> engage<00:02:31.690> them<00:02:32.230> by<00:02:32.380> being<00:02:32.770> absolutely

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
want to engage them by being absolutely

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.850 
want to engage them by being absolutely
amazed<00:02:33.700> by<00:02:34.120> this<00:02:34.180> world<00:02:34.840> so<00:02:35.140> lots<00:02:35.709> of

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
amazed by this world so lots of

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.430 
amazed by this world so lots of
real-life<00:02:36.400> opportunities<00:02:37.150> and<00:02:37.270> experiences

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
real-life opportunities and experiences

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.470 
real-life opportunities and experiences
yeah<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:38.739> know<00:02:38.860> animals<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.550> look<00:02:39.670> after<00:02:39.910> and

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
yeah you know animals to look after and

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.090 
yeah you know animals to look after and
just<00:02:40.569> giving<00:02:41.110> them<00:02:41.200> that<00:02:41.350> independence<00:02:41.950> in

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
just giving them that independence in

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.130 
just giving them that independence in
their<00:02:42.250> learning<00:02:42.400> that's<00:02:43.239> great<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:43.780> then<00:02:43.930> how

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
their learning that's great and then how

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.540 
their learning that's great and then how
Allison<00:02:44.650> how<00:02:44.800> does<00:02:44.980> it<00:02:45.100> work<00:02:45.220> when<00:02:45.400> they're<00:02:45.520> a

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
Allison how does it work when they're a

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.180 
Allison how does it work when they're a
little<00:02:45.610> bit<00:02:45.880> older<00:02:46.470> once<00:02:47.470> they<00:02:47.620> get<00:02:47.709> to<00:02:47.860> you<00:02:47.980> -

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
little bit older once they get to you -

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.910 
little bit older once they get to you -
yes<00:02:48.880> well<00:02:49.120> that<00:02:49.780> follows<00:02:50.170> on<00:02:50.410> really<00:02:50.709> nicely

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
yes well that follows on really nicely

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.860 
yes well that follows on really nicely
from<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.700> early<00:02:51.940> learning<00:02:52.150> center

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
from the early learning center

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.550 
from the early learning center
so<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:54.700> junior<00:02:55.239> primary<00:02:55.569> classrooms<00:02:56.110> are<00:02:56.350> set

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
so the junior primary classrooms are set

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.729 
so the junior primary classrooms are set
up<00:02:56.800> with<00:02:57.130> you<00:02:57.910> know<00:02:58.000> eight<00:02:58.420> to<00:02:58.630> ten<00:02:58.900> different

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
up with you know eight to ten different

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.259 
up with you know eight to ten different
learning<00:02:59.890> areas<00:03:00.130> and<00:03:00.519> they're<00:03:00.640> based<00:03:00.910> on<00:03:01.120> the

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
learning areas and they're based on the

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.470 
learning areas and they're based on the
children's<00:03:01.690> interests<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:04.030> children

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
children's interests and the children

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.390 
children's interests and the children
once<00:03:05.290> again<00:03:05.620> they're<00:03:05.860> they're<00:03:06.160> learning

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
once again they're they're learning

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.190 
once again they're they're learning
through<00:03:08.459> exploration<00:03:09.569> through<00:03:10.569> talking<00:03:11.080> to

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
through exploration through talking to

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.150 
through exploration through talking to
each<00:03:11.350> other<00:03:12.480> following<00:03:13.480> their<00:03:13.840> own

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
each other following their own

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.009 
each other following their own
investigation<00:03:15.160> so<00:03:15.459> it's<00:03:15.700> very<00:03:16.019> self-directed

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
investigation so it's very self-directed

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.550 
investigation so it's very self-directed
that<00:03:17.560> that<00:03:17.950> period<00:03:18.489> but<00:03:19.299> of<00:03:19.510> course<00:03:19.780> in<00:03:20.110> the

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
that that period but of course in the

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.940 
that that period but of course in the
the<00:03:21.489> prime<00:03:21.790> junior<00:03:22.569> primary<00:03:22.959> area<00:03:23.319> we<00:03:23.739> also

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
the prime junior primary area we also

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.970 
the prime junior primary area we also
have<00:03:24.370> formalized<00:03:24.970> teaching<00:03:25.690> and<00:03:25.959> so<00:03:26.769> what

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
have formalized teaching and so what

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.420 
have formalized teaching and so what
we're<00:03:27.130> trying<00:03:27.250> to<00:03:27.489> achieve<00:03:28.299> is<00:03:29.100> the<00:03:30.100> learning

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
we're trying to achieve is the learning

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.050 
we're trying to achieve is the learning
outcomes<00:03:30.850> for<00:03:31.090> those<00:03:31.239> formal<00:03:31.780> lessons<00:03:33.060> making

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
outcomes for those formal lessons making

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.610 
outcomes for those formal lessons making
the<00:03:34.150> children<00:03:34.359> aware<00:03:34.810> of<00:03:34.989> how<00:03:35.230> they're

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
the children aware of how they're

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.430 
the children aware of how they're
practicing<00:03:36.459> those<00:03:36.970> learning<00:03:37.510> intentions<00:03:38.140> in

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
practicing those learning intentions in

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.750 
practicing those learning intentions in
their<00:03:39.070> their<00:03:39.850> own<00:03:40.090> self-directed<00:03:41.760> learning

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
their their own self-directed learning

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.780 
their their own self-directed learning
time<00:03:43.510> and<00:03:43.870> so<00:03:44.470> that<00:03:44.500> there's<00:03:44.890> a<00:03:44.980> nice<00:03:45.220> balance

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
time and so that there's a nice balance

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.729 
time and so that there's a nice balance
between<00:03:45.880> what<00:03:46.780> happens<00:03:47.230> in<00:03:47.530> the

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
between what happens in the

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.800 
between what happens in the
investigations<00:03:48.640> and<00:03:48.880> in<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:49.390> formal

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
investigations and in the formal

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.590 
investigations and in the formal
teaching<00:03:50.459> so<00:03:51.459> that<00:03:51.640> they're<00:03:51.880> interconnected

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
teaching so that they're interconnected

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.960 
teaching so that they're interconnected
and<00:03:53.350> yeah<00:03:53.560> and<00:03:53.799> so<00:03:54.340> children<00:03:54.519> are<00:03:54.760> still

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
and yeah and so children are still

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.640 
and yeah and so children are still
learning<00:03:55.329> to<00:03:55.420> live<00:03:55.570> read<00:03:55.750> and<00:03:56.079> write<00:03:56.320> and

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
learning to live read and write and

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.490 
learning to live read and write and
maths<00:03:56.920> and<00:03:57.130> all<00:03:57.220> those<00:03:57.489> things<00:03:57.760> and<00:03:58.120> all<00:03:58.239> those

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
maths and all those things and all those

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.420 
maths and all those things and all those
foundation<00:03:59.500> skills<00:03:59.769> are<00:03:59.950> still<00:04:00.130> there<00:04:00.310> but

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
foundation skills are still there but

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.890 
foundation skills are still there but
it's<00:04:00.579> the<00:04:00.700> way<00:04:00.880> we're<00:04:01.150> doing<00:04:01.269> it<00:04:01.480> that's<00:04:01.690> a<00:04:01.780> bit

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
it's the way we're doing it that's a bit

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.170 
it's the way we're doing it that's a bit
different<00:04:02.260> that's<00:04:02.739> right<00:04:03.070> and<00:04:03.579> so<00:04:04.000> they're

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
different that's right and so they're

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.670 
different that's right and so they're
practicing<00:04:04.950> in<00:04:05.950> real<00:04:06.400> authentic<00:04:07.680> situations

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
practicing in real authentic situations

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.090 
practicing in real authentic situations
so<00:04:09.040> you<00:04:09.609> know<00:04:09.730> if<00:04:10.209> they're<00:04:10.780> in<00:04:10.810> a<00:04:11.290> little<00:04:11.829> shop

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
so you know if they're in a little shop

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.440 
so you know if they're in a little shop
then<00:04:12.400> they're<00:04:12.579> practicing<00:04:13.120> all<00:04:13.269> their

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
then they're practicing all their

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.759 
then they're practicing all their
reading<00:04:13.840> and<00:04:13.900> writing<00:04:14.079> skills<00:04:14.410> they're

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
reading and writing skills they're

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.300 
reading and writing skills they're
practicing<00:04:15.280> all<00:04:15.430> their<00:04:15.670> math<00:04:16.620> about<00:04:17.620> it<00:04:17.799> for

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
practicing all their math about it for

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.180 
practicing all their math about it for
them<00:04:18.430> it's<00:04:18.639> an<00:04:18.760> authentic<00:04:18.910> situation<00:04:19.450> and<00:04:20.380> so

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
them it's an authentic situation and so

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.460 
them it's an authentic situation and so
the<00:04:21.400> learning<00:04:21.729> is<00:04:21.820> much<00:04:22.030> more<00:04:22.300> real<00:04:22.570> yeah<00:04:23.050> and

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
the learning is much more real yeah and

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.469 
the learning is much more real yeah and
how<00:04:23.620> and<00:04:23.919> and<00:04:24.250> and<00:04:24.490> it's<00:04:24.610> it's<00:04:24.970> it's<00:04:25.270> about

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
how and and and it's it's it's about

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:26.969 
how and and and it's it's it's about
learning<00:04:25.720> about<00:04:25.990> how<00:04:26.320> to<00:04:26.350> be<00:04:26.440> a<00:04:26.530> critical

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
learning about how to be a critical

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.839 
learning about how to be a critical

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 
think you know if we'll be looking at

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.120 
think you know if we'll be looking at
children<00:05:49.150> now<00:05:49.300> who<00:05:49.570> in<00:05:49.990> 20<00:05:50.470> years<00:05:50.590> time<00:05:50.890> who

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
children now who in 20 years time who

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.620 
children now who in 20 years time who
knows<00:05:51.160> what<00:05:51.640> jobs<00:05:51.880> are<00:05:52.120> going<00:05:52.240> to<00:05:52.390> be<00:05:52.510> out

knows what jobs are going to be out
there<00:05:52.930> so<00:05:53.320> rather<00:05:53.620> than<00:05:53.740> actually<00:05:54.040> giving

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
there so rather than actually giving

actually giving them the skills yeah so
that<00:05:58.300> no<00:05:58.600> matter<00:05:58.750> what<00:05:58.990> happens<00:05:59.380> in<00:05:59.500> their

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
world they'll be able to cope so they

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.150 
world they'll be able to cope so they
will<00:06:01.450> be<00:06:01.570> the<00:06:01.600> future<00:06:02.050> problem<00:06:02.560> solved<00:06:03.010> yeah

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 
will be the future problem solved yeah

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.040 
will be the future problem solved yeah
you<00:06:04.000> know<00:06:04.090> all<00:06:04.270> those<00:06:04.480> thoughts<00:06:04.720> are<00:06:04.930> things

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
you know all those thoughts are things

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.140 
you know all those thoughts are things
and<00:06:05.260> for<00:06:05.770> us<00:06:05.890> without<00:06:06.160> our<00:06:06.610> four<00:06:06.850> and<00:06:06.880> five

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
and for us without our four and five

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.090 
and for us without our four and five
year<00:06:07.330> olds<00:06:07.510> its<00:06:07.630> independence<00:06:08.530> and<00:06:08.710> we<00:06:08.800> very

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
year olds its independence and we very

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.540 
year olds its independence and we very
much<00:06:09.160> have<00:06:09.520> that<00:06:10.020> concept<00:06:11.020> of<00:06:11.230> oh<00:06:11.500> no<00:06:12.310> we<00:06:12.430> don't

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
much have that concept of oh no we don't

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.770 
much have that concept of oh no we don't
do<00:06:12.790> for<00:06:12.910> a<00:06:12.970> child<00:06:13.180> what<00:06:13.300> they<00:06:13.330> can<00:06:13.540> do<00:06:13.690> for

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780 
do for a child what they can do for

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.150 
do for a child what they can do for
themselves<00:06:13.900> because<00:06:14.470> we're<00:06:14.650> robbing<00:06:14.980> them<00:06:15.100> of

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160 
themselves because we're robbing them of

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.220 
themselves because we're robbing them of
those<00:06:15.340> learning<00:06:15.700> opportunities<00:06:16.390> and<00:06:16.570> you

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:17.230 
those learning opportunities and you

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.080 
those learning opportunities and you
know<00:06:17.320> and<00:06:17.620> just<00:06:17.860> kind<00:06:18.100> of<00:06:18.160> scaffold<00:06:18.730> them<00:06:18.880> with

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
know and just kind of scaffold them with

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.790 
know and just kind of scaffold them with
their<00:06:19.330> food<00:06:19.750> their<00:06:19.960> problem-solving<00:06:20.650> so

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
their food their problem-solving so

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.170 
their food their problem-solving so
getting<00:06:21.160> them<00:06:21.310> to<00:06:21.430> think<00:06:21.640> of<00:06:21.730> another<00:06:21.820> way

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.180 
getting them to think of another way

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.300 
getting them to think of another way
rather<00:06:22.510> than<00:06:22.690> it<00:06:22.900> all<00:06:23.020> just<00:06:23.230> you<00:06:23.860> know<00:06:23.980> and

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.310 
rather than it all just you know and

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.640 
rather than it all just you know and
think<00:06:24.700> oh<00:06:24.910> that's<00:06:25.330> yeah<00:06:25.660> exactly<00:06:26.020> and<00:06:26.380> being

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.650 
think oh that's yeah exactly and being

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.680 
think oh that's yeah exactly and being
building<00:06:27.280> on<00:06:27.340> their<00:06:27.490> resilience<00:06:27.910> so<00:06:28.420> that<00:06:28.600> you

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:28.690 
building on their resilience so that you

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.540 
building on their resilience so that you
know<00:06:28.780> things<00:06:29.230> don't<00:06:29.470> always<00:06:29.590> go<00:06:29.890> to<00:06:29.950> plan<00:06:30.040> and

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550 
know things don't always go to plan and

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:31.830 
know things don't always go to plan and
so<00:06:30.730> you<00:06:30.850> have<00:06:31.000> to<00:06:31.090> be<00:06:31.210> able<00:06:31.360> to<00:06:31.420> learn<00:06:31.540> that

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
so you have to be able to learn that

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.240 
so you have to be able to learn that
true<00:06:32.110> that<00:06:32.140> you<00:06:32.410> know<00:06:32.500> if<00:06:32.650> I'm<00:06:32.800> building<00:06:33.010> that

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.250 
true that you know if I'm building that

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.190 
true that you know if I'm building that
tower<00:06:33.490> and<00:06:33.820> it<00:06:33.910> keeps<00:06:34.180> on<00:06:34.360> falling<00:06:34.540> down<00:06:34.720> yeah

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:35.200 
tower and it keeps on falling down yeah

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.460 
tower and it keeps on falling down yeah

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:07.729 
went to school we were in those sort of

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:09.929 
went to school we were in those sort of
classroom<00:07:08.210> situations<00:07:08.810> where<00:07:09.020> we<00:07:09.289> were<00:07:09.439> fed

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:09.939 
classroom situations where we were fed

classroom situations where we were fed
information<00:07:10.939> and<00:07:11.090> facts<00:07:11.270> and<00:07:11.389> figures<00:07:11.599> from
