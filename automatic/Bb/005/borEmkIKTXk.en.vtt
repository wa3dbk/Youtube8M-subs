00:00:00.139 --> 00:00:04.290
 I start giving you hope, anyone 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.760
 it can come from the world 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.650
 anyone but I don't know algo because of the 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.380
 raw fk files 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.880
 no no statistically in the team 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.360
 opponent there are more trolls than in the 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.490
 your 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.980
 this is because in the first opponent there 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.630
 There are five potential cups in yours 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.240
 only four 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.939
 this is because you never go fk not 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.390
 insult anyone and always win a 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.589
 lane has but then you lose the game or 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.200
 first of all realize that you don't 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:36.780
 you are perfect player we all do 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.760
 many many mistakes sometimes without 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.760
 to realize we are the reason why 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.130
 is lost you know what the effect is 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.440
 tuning cover I quote the wikipedia 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.600
 the effect of a nightmare a distortion 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.190
 cognitive because of which 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.740
 individual experts tend 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.240
 overreach wrongly judging the 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.570
 own abilities as superior to 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.000
 average 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.410
 this distortion is attributed by 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.100
 inability of someone who is not an expert 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.660
 matter of recognizing one's mistakes 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.399
 that's to say, you suck at playing but 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.719
 don't worry, I suck 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:08.789
 all sucks 

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:11.460
 and from today therefore a process begins for 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:14.340
 improve yourself first of all concentrate 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.140
 exclusively yours 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.259
 in fact ciampiano is the only way that 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.159
 you have to change the course of events 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.200
 remember that unless you always do 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.460
 mail you have no way to change yours 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.890
 allies 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.140
 so nothing insults no chat 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.420
 if you want to accept it went on facebook 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.409
 tell you what things you use write 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.049
 gigi good job u have just finished blade 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.909
 here remember to keep yourself always 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.399
 positive and give the maximum in each 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.409
 game never think that a match 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.689
 lost and mistreat a game as if 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.380
 it was already won that it is then the wall 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.049
 no stress if someone does 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.569
 Start by saying anything negative 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:57.190
 change it instantly so you will avoid 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:59.560
 I constitute centered, etc. 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.600
 if you lose, take a minimum break of 10 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.450
 minutes when you don't think about anything 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.070
 concerning league then open would be 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.750
 of the game you just lost e 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.820
 look at it carefully 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.070
 look specifically at your every 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.370
 death and ask questions for example 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.950
 he could have avoided it if yes as I should have 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.630
 go back before i should have flashed 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.060
 etc 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.590
 if you won 4 same replay and search 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.640
 to understand how you took the 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.570
 advantage yes i know it's boring to watch 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.310
 play but if you want to go up the only way 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.900
 do 10 gen in this way and then 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.970
 write me in the comments if you understand 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.260
 something new 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.750
 once you have this mindset 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.060
 you can begin to focus on 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.800
 your personal skill call the 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.470
 your favorite role at the beginning of 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.050
 champions select revenue strong champions 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.330
 at present the best thing is to learn 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.790
 at least two champions for each role e 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.010
 learn them well so that if not 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.470
 manage to get your favorite 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.330
 and an opportunity to play support already 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.280
 because the support is also little air 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.860
 especially in the season when 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.330
 so don't complain 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.000
 set yourself goals to be overcome every 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.459
 game for example takes the snow tower 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.340
 in ten minutes do 90 million ten 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:18.370
 minutes etcetera or dying menadito face 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.940
 in the whole game do 10 who the match 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.620
 instead it is not a good goal 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.200
 you may have noticed that in this video you don't 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.510
 I'm talking about mechanics as a counter 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.019
 of the minions know when to make baron 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.630
 etc 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:34.330
 however, these concepts are essential 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.890
 to win but I'm not going to explain in now 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.750
 how they are the object of others guides me 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:42.330
 that I invite you to look at in my channel 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.330
 of youtube thanks to the next video
