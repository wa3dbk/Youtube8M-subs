hi<00:00:04.890> it's<00:00:05.069> mr.<00:00:05.339> Andersen<00:00:05.759> and<00:00:05.790> this<00:00:06.029> podcast

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
hi it's mr. Andersen and this podcast

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.600 
hi it's mr. Andersen and this podcast
I'm<00:00:06.960> going<00:00:06.990> to<00:00:07.109> talk<00:00:07.170> about<00:00:07.410> R<00:00:07.680> and<00:00:08.220> K

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
I'm going to talk about R and K

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.540 
I'm going to talk about R and K
selection<00:00:09.480> or<00:00:09.630> R<00:00:09.960> selected<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:10.920> K<00:00:11.190> selected

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
selection or R selected and K selected

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.030 
selection or R selected and K selected
species<00:00:12.090> right<00:00:12.990> here<00:00:13.170> we've<00:00:13.290> got<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.440> chameleon

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
species right here we've got a chameleon

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.369 
species right here we've got a chameleon
female<00:00:14.460> that's<00:00:14.700> just<00:00:14.940> laid<00:00:15.120> two<00:00:15.420> eggs<00:00:15.450> right

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
female that's just laid two eggs right

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.019 
female that's just laid two eggs right
here<00:00:16.590> we<00:00:16.740> have<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.920> frog<00:00:17.279> that's<00:00:17.640> just<00:00:17.880> laid

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
here we have a frog that's just laid

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.570 
here we have a frog that's just laid
thousands<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.900> eggs<00:00:19.050> one<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.890> these<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.189> an<00:00:20.310> R

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
thousands of eggs one of these is an R

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.640 
thousands of eggs one of these is an R
selected<00:00:20.820> one<00:00:21.449> is<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.600> case<00:00:21.869> selected<00:00:22.410> if<00:00:22.560> you

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
selected one is a case selected if you

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.410 
selected one is a case selected if you
know<00:00:22.800> exactly<00:00:23.279> which<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.730> which<00:00:23.910> right<00:00:24.240> now

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
know exactly which is which right now

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.730 
know exactly which is which right now
then<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.810> probably<00:00:25.019> don't<00:00:25.320> need<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.590> watch

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
then you probably don't need to watch

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.800 
then you probably don't need to watch
the<00:00:25.949> rest<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.340> video<00:00:26.580> but<00:00:27.210> for<00:00:27.449> those<00:00:27.630> of

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
the rest of the video but for those of

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.990 
the rest of the video but for those of
you<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:28.050> are<00:00:28.199> now<00:00:28.349> left<00:00:28.859> let<00:00:29.429> me<00:00:29.519> talk<00:00:29.730> about

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
you that are now left let me talk about

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.240 
you that are now left let me talk about
R<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.420> K<00:00:30.570> selection<00:00:31.109> basically<00:00:31.800> we<00:00:32.009> have<00:00:32.130> to

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
R and K selection basically we have to

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.299 
R and K selection basically we have to
talk<00:00:32.369> about<00:00:32.610> population<00:00:32.820> growth<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:33.989> any

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
talk about population growth and so any

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.729 
talk about population growth and so any
population<00:00:35.309> where<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.090> have<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.390> positive<00:00:36.899> R

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
population where you have a positive R

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.650 
population where you have a positive R
and<00:00:38.460> R<00:00:39.149> stands<00:00:39.660> for<00:00:39.899> growth<00:00:40.649> rate<00:00:41.329> if<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.390> ever

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
and R stands for growth rate if you ever

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.299 
and R stands for growth rate if you ever
have<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.140> positive<00:00:43.350> R<00:00:43.829> you're<00:00:44.129> going<00:00:44.250> to

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
have it a positive R you're going to

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.069 
have it a positive R you're going to
follow<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.760> curve<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.450> looks<00:00:45.660> kind<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:45.930> like

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
follow a curve that looks kind of like

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.750 
follow a curve that looks kind of like
this<00:00:46.320> you'll<00:00:46.890> first<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.399> all<00:00:47.520> have

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
this you'll first of all have

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.639 
this you'll first of all have
exponential<00:00:48.629> growth<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.170> then<00:00:49.379> eventually

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
exponential growth and then eventually

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.160 
exponential growth and then eventually
you'll<00:00:49.980> run<00:00:50.160> out<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.340> space<00:00:50.700> or<00:00:51.090> food<00:00:51.420> there's

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
you'll run out of space or food there's

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.840 
you'll run out of space or food there's
going<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.379> be<00:00:52.469> competition<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.430> eventually

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
going to be competition and eventually

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:54.650 
going to be competition and eventually
you're<00:00:53.969> going<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.120> hit<00:00:54.270> what's<00:00:54.480> called

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
you're going to hit what's called

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.200 
you're going to hit what's called
logistic<00:00:55.110> growth<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.550> we<00:00:56.670> call<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
logistic growth and so we call this the

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.660 
logistic growth and so we call this the
J<00:00:57.510> shaped<00:00:57.780> curve<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.320> exponential<00:00:58.949> or<00:00:59.399> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
J shaped curve the exponential or the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.549 
J shaped curve the exponential or the
sigmoid<00:01:00.120> alure<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.570> S<00:01:00.719> shaped<00:01:01.050> curve<00:01:01.140> which

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
sigmoid alure the S shaped curve which

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.969 
sigmoid alure the S shaped curve which
is<00:01:01.789> logarithmic<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.750> what<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.049> n<00:01:04.260> n<00:01:04.710> is

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
is logarithmic and so what is n n is

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.830 
is logarithmic and so what is n n is
going<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.250> be<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.610> number<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.180> individuals<00:01:06.720> in

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
going to be the number of individuals in

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.840 
going to be the number of individuals in
the<00:01:06.960> population<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:07.979> right<00:01:08.220> here<00:01:08.250> if<00:01:08.760> we

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
the population and so right here if we

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.210 
the population and so right here if we
put<00:01:09.030> n<00:01:09.180> on<00:01:09.360> this<00:01:09.540> side<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.080> we<00:01:10.140> put<00:01:10.380> time<00:01:10.740> on

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
put n on this side and we put time on

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.929 
put n on this side and we put time on
the<00:01:11.369> x<00:01:11.580> axis<00:01:11.760> as<00:01:12.210> time<00:01:12.990> goes<00:01:13.380> on<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:14.460> numbers

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
the x axis as time goes on the numbers

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.399 
the x axis as time goes on the numbers
are<00:01:15.180> going<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.360> increase<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.110> would<00:01:16.290> be<00:01:16.380> a

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
are going to increase so this would be a

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.649 
are going to increase so this would be a
low<00:01:16.740> n<00:01:17.040> value<00:01:17.490> right<00:01:17.729> here<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.299> this<00:01:18.420> would<00:01:18.540> be

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
low n value right here and this would be

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.090 
low n value right here and this would be
a<00:01:18.689> higher<00:01:18.990> end<00:01:19.259> value<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:19.830> would<00:01:19.979> be<00:01:20.070> a

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
a higher end value and this would be a

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.010 
a higher end value and this would be a
really<00:01:20.310> high<00:01:20.520> end<00:01:20.790> value<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:21.869> it's

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
really high end value and so it's

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.630 
really high end value and so it's
important<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.560> know<00:01:22.680> what<00:01:22.860> n<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.070> that's

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
important that you know what n is that's

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.640 
important that you know what n is that's
the<00:01:23.790> number<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.299> population<00:01:24.450> R<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
the number in the population R is the

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.020 
the number in the population R is the
growth<00:01:25.770> rate<00:01:26.009> remember<00:01:26.460> if<00:01:26.700> it's<00:01:26.820> ever

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
growth rate remember if it's ever

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.600 
growth rate remember if it's ever
positive<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.080> how<00:01:28.680> do<00:01:28.740> we<00:01:28.829> calculate<00:01:29.040> growth

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
positive and how do we calculate growth

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.940 
positive and how do we calculate growth
rate<00:01:29.850> it's<00:01:30.030> basically<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:31.140> number<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.680> people

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
rate it's basically the number of people

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.950 
rate it's basically the number of people
being<00:01:32.100> born<00:01:32.610> minus<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.479> number<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.810> people

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
being born minus the number of people

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.960 
being born minus the number of people
who<00:01:34.170> die<00:01:34.439> if<00:01:34.770> we<00:01:34.890> ever<00:01:35.009> have<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> positive<00:01:35.790> 1

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
who die if we ever have a positive 1

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.280 
who die if we ever have a positive 1
then<00:01:36.180> we're<00:01:36.329> going<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.509> get<00:01:36.600> this<00:01:36.780> curve<00:01:37.049> now

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
then we're going to get this curve now

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.080 
then we're going to get this curve now
it's<00:01:37.439> not<00:01:37.740> always<00:01:37.950> radical<00:01:38.790> like<00:01:38.939> this

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
it's not always radical like this

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.270 
it's not always radical like this
sometimes<00:01:39.479> it's<00:01:39.600> going<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.750> be<00:01:39.869> really

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
sometimes it's going to be really

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.770 
sometimes it's going to be really
gradual<00:01:41.280> like<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.640> sometimes<00:01:42.479> it's<00:01:42.659> going

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
gradual like this sometimes it's going

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.780 
gradual like this sometimes it's going
to<00:01:42.840> be<00:01:42.960> incredibly<00:01:43.770> quick<00:01:44.009> depending<00:01:44.460> on<00:01:44.579> what

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
to be incredibly quick depending on what

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.090 
to be incredibly quick depending on what
the<00:01:44.970> R<00:01:45.119> value<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.320> then<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.530> last<00:01:46.770> thing

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
the R value is and then the last thing

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.020 
the R value is and then the last thing
is<00:01:47.399> K<00:01:48.149> K<00:01:48.540> stands<00:01:48.869> for<00:01:49.020> carrying<00:01:50.009> let's<00:01:50.729> try<00:01:50.970> to

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
is K K stands for carrying let's try to

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.139 
is K K stands for carrying let's try to
spell<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.540> right<00:01:52.100> capacity<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.640> so

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
spell that right capacity and so

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.300 
spell that right capacity and so
basically<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.689> means<00:01:55.020> in<00:01:55.380> an<00:01:55.530> area<00:01:55.950> for<00:01:56.250> a

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
basically that means in an area for a

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.800 
basically that means in an area for a
certain<00:01:56.640> group<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.969> pop<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.390> certain

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
certain group of pop a certain

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.080 
certain group of pop a certain
population<00:01:58.200> there's<00:01:58.950> like<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.159> maximum<00:01:59.969> amount

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
population there's like a maximum amount

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.060 
population there's like a maximum amount
that<00:02:00.479> they<00:02:00.600> can<00:02:00.780> support<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.829> we<00:02:01.920> call

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
that they can support and so we call

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.069 
that they can support and so we call
that<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.280> carrying<00:02:02.909> capacity<00:02:03.149> that's<00:02:03.869> where

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
that the carrying capacity that's where

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.690 
that the carrying capacity that's where
the<00:02:04.229> limit<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:04.860> it's<00:02:05.130> eventually<00:02:05.520> going<00:02:05.640> to

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
the limit is it's eventually going to

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.700 
the limit is it's eventually going to
level<00:02:06.090> out<00:02:06.240> on<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.320> if<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.530> were<00:02:07.619> to

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
level out on that and so if I were to

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.499 
level out on that and so if I were to
talk<00:02:07.890> about<00:02:08.069> in<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.670> real<00:02:08.910> world<00:02:09.179> because

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
talk about in the real world because

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.380 
talk about in the real world because
this<00:02:09.629> is<00:02:09.810> just<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.170> math<00:02:10.440> formula<00:02:11.250> basically<00:02:12.180> in

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
this is just a math formula basically in

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.370 
this is just a math formula basically in
the<00:02:12.450> real<00:02:12.629> world<00:02:12.870> we<00:02:13.140> put

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
the real world we put

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.260 
the real world we put
wolves<00:02:13.710> back<00:02:13.890> in<00:02:14.040> Yellowstone<00:02:14.460> Park<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:15.000> so

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
wolves back in Yellowstone Park and so

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.960 
wolves back in Yellowstone Park and so
there<00:02:16.080> was<00:02:16.500> tons<00:02:16.770> of<00:02:17.010> food<00:02:17.220> there<00:02:17.520> not<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:17.790> lot

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
there was tons of food there not a lot

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.940 
there was tons of food there not a lot
of<00:02:18.000> competition<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:18.960> basically<00:02:19.350> their

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
of competition and so basically their

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.560 
of competition and so basically their
growth<00:02:20.220> rate<00:02:20.490> went<00:02:20.670> up<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.030> then<00:02:21.420> it's

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
growth rate went up and then it's

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.060 
growth rate went up and then it's
dropped<00:02:22.080> and<00:02:22.350> it's<00:02:22.440> gone<00:02:22.590> up<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:22.950> it's

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
dropped and it's gone up and it's

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.410 
dropped and it's gone up and it's
dropped<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.520> it's<00:02:23.640> kind<00:02:23.850> of<00:02:23.910> reached<00:02:24.150> this

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
dropped and it's kind of reached this

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.540 
dropped and it's kind of reached this
carrying<00:02:24.840> capacity<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:25.620> maximum<00:02:26.220> number<00:02:26.520> of

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
carrying capacity a maximum number of

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.740 
carrying capacity a maximum number of
wolves<00:02:26.880> that<00:02:26.970> you're<00:02:27.060> going<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.210> have<00:02:27.300> in

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
wolves that you're going to have in

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.110 
wolves that you're going to have in
Yellowstone<00:02:28.530> Park<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.070> so<00:02:29.580> it's<00:02:29.790> not<00:02:29.910> as

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
Yellowstone Park and so it's not as

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.090 
Yellowstone Park and so it's not as
smooth<00:02:30.480> as<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:30.960> but<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:31.350> certainly<00:02:31.530> has<00:02:31.950> an

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
smooth as that but it certainly has an

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.730 
smooth as that but it certainly has an
r-value<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:33.120> N<00:02:33.330> value<00:02:33.900> is<00:02:34.050> increased<00:02:34.530> and

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
r-value the N value is increased and

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.290 
r-value the N value is increased and
then<00:02:34.860> it's<00:02:35.010> reached<00:02:35.250> kind<00:02:35.520> of<00:02:35.640> a<00:02:35.700> K<00:02:35.940> so<00:02:36.000> it's

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
then it's reached kind of a K so it's

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.210 
then it's reached kind of a K so it's
important<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:36.810> know<00:02:36.960> what<00:02:37.110> n<00:02:37.290> R<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.860> K

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
important that you know what n R and K

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.340 
important that you know what n R and K
are<00:02:38.360> another<00:02:39.360> thing<00:02:39.630> that's<00:02:39.780> important<00:02:40.260> is

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
are another thing that's important is

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.650 
are another thing that's important is
that<00:02:40.380> you<00:02:40.530> understand<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.220> way<00:02:41.400> life<00:02:41.910> exists

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
that you understand the way life exists

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.820 
that you understand the way life exists
this<00:02:43.230> is<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.530> story<00:02:43.830> of<00:02:44.180> life<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.570> death<00:02:46.470> is

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
this is the story of life and death is

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.190 
this is the story of life and death is
going<00:02:47.070> to<00:02:47.160> vary<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:47.880> we<00:02:47.940> really<00:02:48.420> have<00:02:48.660> three

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
going to vary and we really have three

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.320 
going to vary and we really have three
different<00:02:49.380> types<00:02:49.890> so<00:02:50.580> you<00:02:50.640> happen<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.150> be<00:02:51.300> a

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
different types so you happen to be a

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.420 
different types so you happen to be a
type<00:02:51.630> 1<00:02:51.960> survivorship<00:02:52.590> curve<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.190> what<00:02:53.280> that

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
type 1 survivorship curve and what that

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.760 
type 1 survivorship curve and what that
means<00:02:53.670> is<00:02:54.000> think<00:02:54.690> about<00:02:54.750> all<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.380> kids<00:02:55.590> in

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
means is think about all the kids in

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.680 
means is think about all the kids in
your<00:02:55.950> class<00:02:56.340> or<00:02:56.700> all<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.060> kids<00:02:57.240> who<00:02:57.360> are<00:02:57.420> born

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
your class or all the kids who are born

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.020 
your class or all the kids who are born
on<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.020> same<00:02:58.200> day<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.530> you<00:02:59.010> were<00:02:59.220> basically

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
on the same day that you were basically

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.430 
on the same day that you were basically
most<00:03:00.600> of<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:00.810> are<00:03:00.900> going<00:03:01.020> to<00:03:01.080> survive<00:03:01.380> that

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
most of you are going to survive that

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.620 
most of you are going to survive that
first<00:03:01.920> day<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:02.400> most<00:03:02.910> of<00:03:03.120> you<00:03:03.270> are<00:03:03.300> going<00:03:03.540> to

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
first day and most of you are going to

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.360 
first day and most of you are going to
survive<00:03:03.930> now<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.290> few<00:03:04.620> people<00:03:04.950> will<00:03:05.130> die<00:03:05.340> right

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
survive now a few people will die right

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.740 
survive now a few people will die right
away<00:03:05.880> but<00:03:05.940> most<00:03:06.330> of<00:03:06.450> you<00:03:06.510> are<00:03:06.570> going<00:03:06.660> to

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
away but most of you are going to

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.480 
away but most of you are going to
survive<00:03:07.080> you're<00:03:07.830> going<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.040> make<00:03:08.190> it<00:03:08.340> through

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
survive you're going to make it through

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.250 
survive you're going to make it through
your<00:03:08.520> teenage<00:03:09.000> years<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.570> your<00:03:09.660> middle<00:03:09.900> ages

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
your teenage years and your middle ages

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.230 
your teenage years and your middle ages
and<00:03:10.470> eventually<00:03:10.950> you're<00:03:11.070> going<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.400> drop<00:03:12.000> off

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
and eventually you're going to drop off

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.670

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.670 
and all of you are going to die in these
last<00:03:13.980> 10<00:03:14.340> 15<00:03:14.520> 20<00:03:15.120> years<00:03:15.480> that's<00:03:16.140> because<00:03:16.530> we're

a frog here's some frog eggs down here
they<00:03:25.410> show<00:03:25.590> what's<00:03:25.830> called<00:03:26.100> a<00:03:26.220> type<00:03:26.430> 3

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
they show what's called a type 3

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.860

a<00:03:32.400> few<00:03:32.670> of<00:03:32.700> them<00:03:32.910> survive<00:03:33.270> and<00:03:33.510> then<00:03:33.720> they're

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
a few of them survive and then they're

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.300 
a few of them survive and then they're
going<00:03:33.960> to<00:03:34.020> level<00:03:34.410> off<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:34.890> then<00:03:35.040> there<00:03:35.280> are

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
going to level off and then there are

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.560 
going to level off and then there are
eventually<00:03:35.790> all<00:03:35.940> going<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.210> die

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
eventually all going to die

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.090 
eventually all going to die
now<00:03:36.960> we<00:03:37.020> also<00:03:37.230> have<00:03:37.440> something<00:03:37.680> in<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:37.950> middle

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
now we also have something in the middle

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.890 
now we also have something in the middle
type<00:03:38.370> -<00:03:38.580> we<00:03:38.730> call<00:03:38.880> that<00:03:38.910> songbirds<00:03:39.630> are<00:03:39.750> an

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
type - we call that songbirds are an

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.540 
type - we call that songbirds are an
example<00:03:40.170> of<00:03:40.410> that<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:40.770> so<00:03:41.220> they're<00:03:41.370> going<00:03:41.460> to

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
example of that and so they're going to

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.670 
example of that and so they're going to
die<00:03:41.700> off<00:03:41.910> at<00:03:42.150> a<00:03:42.180> linear<00:03:42.750> rate<00:03:42.930> throughout

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
die off at a linear rate throughout

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.740 
die off at a linear rate throughout
their<00:03:43.860> whole<00:03:44.010> lifecycle<00:03:44.459> and<00:03:44.880> so<00:03:45.060> Robins<00:03:45.600> our

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
their whole lifecycle and so Robins our

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.660 
their whole lifecycle and so Robins our
example<00:03:46.320> of<00:03:46.410> that<00:03:46.560> Robins<00:03:47.040> on<00:03:47.160> average<00:03:47.459> live

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
example of that Robins on average live

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.460 
example of that Robins on average live
about<00:03:47.850> a<00:03:47.910> year<00:03:48.240> but<00:03:48.480> some<00:03:48.720> live<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:48.930> few<00:03:49.140> months

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
about a year but some live a few months

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.470 
about a year but some live a few months
and<00:03:49.590> some<00:03:49.770> live<00:03:49.980> three<00:03:50.220> years<00:03:50.520> but<00:03:51.030> on<00:03:51.150> average

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
and some live three years but on average

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.940 
and some live three years but on average
is<00:03:51.630> just<00:03:51.810> kind<00:03:51.959> of<00:03:51.990> drop<00:03:52.290> off<00:03:52.500> until<00:03:52.770> they're

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
is just kind of drop off until they're

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.920 
is just kind of drop off until they're
all<00:03:53.100> dead<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.520> ones<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:54.060> cohort<00:03:54.570> the<00:03:54.720> ones

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
all dead the ones the cohort the ones

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.000 
all dead the ones the cohort the ones
that<00:03:55.110> are<00:03:55.200> born<00:03:55.440> on<00:03:55.620> that<00:03:55.770> one<00:03:56.040> specific<00:03:56.730> day

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
that are born on that one specific day

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.320 
that are born on that one specific day
remember<00:03:59.010> our<00:03:59.250> environments<00:04:00.030> are<00:04:00.150> going<00:04:00.270> to

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
remember our environments are going to

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.730 
remember our environments are going to
differ<00:04:00.540> sometimes<00:04:01.080> we're<00:04:01.170> going<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.350> live<00:04:01.530> in

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
differ sometimes we're going to live in

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.800 
differ sometimes we're going to live in
environments<00:04:01.950> that<00:04:02.490> are<00:04:02.550> relatively<00:04:03.540> stable

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
environments that are relatively stable

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.780 
environments that are relatively stable
like<00:04:04.140> a<00:04:04.170> desert<00:04:04.470> and<00:04:04.800> sometimes<00:04:05.280> not<00:04:05.490> so<00:04:05.550> much

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
like a desert and sometimes not so much

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.970 
like a desert and sometimes not so much
like<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:06.209> rain<00:04:06.450> forest<00:04:06.870> or<00:04:06.959> even<00:04:07.020> a<00:04:07.410> coral<00:04:07.950> reef

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
like a rain forest or even a coral reef

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.460 
like a rain forest or even a coral reef
especially<00:04:08.790> right<00:04:09.030> now<00:04:09.060> they're<00:04:09.930> changing

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
especially right now they're changing

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.440 
especially right now they're changing
radically<00:04:10.680> almost<00:04:11.280> every<00:04:11.550> day<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:11.970> so

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
radically almost every day and so

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.880 
radically almost every day and so
basically<00:04:12.750> let's<00:04:13.080> get<00:04:13.260> to<00:04:13.380> what<00:04:13.590> in<00:04:13.709> our

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
basically let's get to what in our

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.460 
basically let's get to what in our
selected<00:04:14.459> species<00:04:14.880> is<00:04:15.180> are<00:04:15.450> selected<00:04:16.140> are

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
selected species is are selected are

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.710 
selected species is are selected are
going<00:04:16.680> to<00:04:16.739> be<00:04:16.859> those<00:04:17.100> that<00:04:17.700> base<00:04:18.060> their<00:04:18.359> life

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
going to be those that base their life

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.130 
going to be those that base their life
on<00:04:19.080> our<00:04:19.680> and<00:04:20.250> remember<00:04:20.700> our<00:04:20.910> is<00:04:21.180> growth<00:04:21.840> rate

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
on our and remember our is growth rate

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.350 
on our and remember our is growth rate
and<00:04:22.380> so<00:04:22.830> these<00:04:23.010> are<00:04:23.250> species<00:04:23.520> that<00:04:23.760> want<00:04:24.150> to

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
and so these are species that want to

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.870 
and so these are species that want to
quickly<00:04:24.780> grow<00:04:25.260> and<00:04:25.590> exploit<00:04:26.070> a<00:04:26.100> niche<00:04:26.490> as

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
quickly grow and exploit a niche as

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.300 
quickly grow and exploit a niche as
as<00:04:27.060> fast<00:04:27.480> as<00:04:27.780> they<00:04:27.930> can<00:04:28.230> and<00:04:28.500> so<00:04:28.560> these<00:04:29.250> are

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
as fast as they can and so these are

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.340 
as fast as they can and so these are
things<00:04:29.670> that<00:04:29.910> normally<00:04:30.300> live<00:04:30.540> in<00:04:30.750> an<00:04:30.900> unstable

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
things that normally live in an unstable

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.370 
things that normally live in an unstable
environment<00:04:32.160> they<00:04:32.850> have<00:04:32.880> -<00:04:33.630> de<00:04:34.020> T<00:04:34.140> what<00:04:34.320> does

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
environment they have - de T what does

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.260 
environment they have - de T what does
that<00:04:34.440> mean<00:04:34.770> fecundity<00:04:35.250> basically<00:04:35.850> means<00:04:36.060> is

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
that mean fecundity basically means is

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.120 
that mean fecundity basically means is
that<00:04:36.450> they<00:04:36.600> can<00:04:37.170> make<00:04:37.350> a<00:04:37.380> lot<00:04:37.650> of<00:04:37.680> babies

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
that they can make a lot of babies

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.010 
that they can make a lot of babies
really<00:04:38.370> really<00:04:38.670> quickly<00:04:38.910> in<00:04:39.420> general<00:04:39.840> these

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
really really quickly in general these

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.840 
really really quickly in general these
things<00:04:40.290> are<00:04:40.440> small<00:04:40.800> they<00:04:41.160> don't<00:04:41.190> live<00:04:41.610> that

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
things are small they don't live that

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.280 
things are small they don't live that
long<00:04:42.060> and<00:04:42.330> their<00:04:42.450> offspring<00:04:42.840> just<00:04:43.050> kind<00:04:43.200> of

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
long and their offspring just kind of

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.020 
long and their offspring just kind of

fish but some of them are able to
survive<00:05:14.550> and<00:05:14.850> so<00:05:15.270> that's<00:05:15.480> the<00:05:15.690> are<00:05:15.840> selected

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
they're in it for the long haul then it

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.580 
they're in it for the long haul then it
they're<00:05:29.490> in<00:05:29.640> it<00:05:29.760> for<00:05:30.140> exponential<00:05:31.140> and<00:05:31.470> then

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
they're in it for exponential and then

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.500 
they're in it for exponential and then
that<00:05:31.770> logistic<00:05:32.640> growth<00:05:32.670> they<00:05:33.150> want<00:05:33.300> to<00:05:33.360> live<00:05:33.480> a

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
that logistic growth they want to live a

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.080 
they're born they're just going to lay a
bunch<00:06:22.500> of<00:06:22.590> eggs<00:06:22.920> cover<00:06:23.400> them<00:06:23.550> up<00:06:23.670> in<00:06:23.820> a<00:06:23.850> hole

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.090 
bunch of eggs cover them up in a hole

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.690 
bunch of eggs cover them up in a hole
and<00:06:24.390> then<00:06:24.540> just<00:06:24.840> kind<00:06:25.050> of<00:06:25.110> swim<00:06:25.500> away<00:06:25.800> and<00:06:26.100> all

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:26.700 
and then just kind of swim away and all

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.340 
and then just kind of swim away and all
of<00:06:26.730> these<00:06:27.090> eggs<00:06:27.390> are<00:06:27.570> going<00:06:27.660> to<00:06:27.720> hatch<00:06:27.780> these

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
of these eggs are going to hatch these

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:29.930 
of these eggs are going to hatch these
little<00:06:28.680> baby<00:06:28.890> sea<00:06:29.130> turtles<00:06:29.460> are<00:06:29.580> kind<00:06:29.730> of<00:06:29.790> on

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
little baby sea turtles are kind of on

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.700 
little baby sea turtles are kind of on
their<00:06:30.120> own<00:06:30.270> and<00:06:30.510> so<00:06:30.960> that<00:06:31.110> would<00:06:31.230> be<00:06:31.350> more<00:06:31.590> of

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 
their own and so that would be more of

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.890 
their own and so that would be more of
an<00:06:31.830> are<00:06:32.040> selected<00:06:32.580> and<00:06:32.760> so<00:06:32.940> even<00:06:33.540> within<00:06:33.720> a

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 
an are selected and so even within a

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.930 
an are selected and so even within a
lifetime<00:06:34.110> you<00:06:34.500> can<00:06:34.530> be<00:06:34.740> R<00:06:34.890> and<00:06:35.130> K<00:06:35.310> selected<00:06:35.520> and

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 
lifetime you can be R and K selected and

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.150 
lifetime you can be R and K selected and
even<00:06:36.510> by<00:06:36.630> gender<00:06:36.990> so<00:06:37.290> if<00:06:37.470> you<00:06:37.530> think<00:06:37.680> about<00:06:37.860> it

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 
even by gender so if you think about it

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.189 
even by gender so if you think about it
not<00:06:38.310> not<00:06:38.700> humans<00:06:39.180> per<00:06:39.360> se<00:06:39.570> but<00:06:39.720> in

our selected species produce as many as
they<00:06:45.719> can<00:06:45.960> spread<00:06:46.499> as<00:06:46.680> much<00:06:46.949> of<00:06:47.129> their<00:06:47.249> sperm

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:47.550 
they can spread as much of their sperm

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.790 
they can spread as much of their sperm
as<00:06:47.759> far<00:06:47.969> as<00:06:48.090> they<00:06:48.240> can<00:06:48.300> whereas<00:06:48.990> females<00:06:49.289> are

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 
as far as they can whereas females are

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.580 
as far as they can whereas females are
more<00:06:49.949> k-selected<00:06:50.479> investing<00:06:51.479> a<00:06:51.569> lot<00:06:51.810> in<00:06:52.050> those

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:52.590 
more k-selected investing a lot in those

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.519 
more k-selected investing a lot in those
offspring<00:06:53.069> in<00:06:53.370> that<00:06:53.520> long<00:06:53.849> haul<00:06:54.360> so<00:06:54.629> let's<00:06:55.409> go

00:06:55.519 --> 00:06:55.529 
offspring in that long haul so let's go

00:06:55.529 --> 00:06:57.140 
offspring in that long haul so let's go
back<00:06:55.560> and<00:06:56.009> look<00:06:56.099> at<00:06:56.219> that<00:06:56.310> first<00:06:56.610> slide<00:06:56.879> the

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:57.150 
back and look at that first slide the

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.959 
back and look at that first slide the
chameleon<00:06:57.749> is<00:06:57.870> it<00:06:58.139> R<00:06:58.379> or<00:06:58.710> K<00:06:59.009> selected<00:06:59.249> well

00:06:59.959 --> 00:06:59.969 
chameleon is it R or K selected well

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:01.939 
chameleon is it R or K selected well
it's<00:07:00.479> investing<00:07:01.050> in<00:07:01.169> just<00:07:01.379> these<00:07:01.499> two<00:07:01.740> eggs

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:01.949 
it's investing in just these two eggs

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:03.170 
it's investing in just these two eggs
and<00:07:02.279> so<00:07:02.430> it's<00:07:02.550> in<00:07:02.669> it<00:07:02.789> for<00:07:02.909> the<00:07:02.969> long<00:07:03.120> haul

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.180 
and so it's in it for the long haul

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.089 
and so it's in it for the long haul
where<00:07:03.689> this<00:07:03.810> would<00:07:04.020> be<00:07:04.110> in<00:07:04.199> our<00:07:04.499> selected

00:07:05.089 --> 00:07:05.099 
where this would be in our selected

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:08.930 
where this would be in our selected
species<00:07:05.340> and<00:07:05.819> I<00:07:06.539> hope<00:07:06.659> that's<00:07:06.870> helpful
