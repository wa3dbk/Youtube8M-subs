00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.220
 Ha 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.910
 ana 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.810
 Haie so far Kai it here is a work of 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.320
 It is bolt to fork 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:18.550
 To the bottom of the fork 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:23.870
 Center bolt these two could be inserted 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:27.520
 In make the machine be removed to it that the front four schools is yet to come 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:31.990
 It is first, it took a tire after the 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:34.840
 For example we will remove example it is an anti-say meter cables 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:39.010
 It is a front child to the axle shaft 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:41.040
 When removing it, first of all it is 9 bolts 4 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.280
 I will get this 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.950
 When it is malt, it is only the first shot 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.500
 That power is 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:53.040
 In this wrench it takes products 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.040
 I can read 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:05.100
 After that you see, hey a little wrench 0 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.100
 I will press 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.410
 Yes I 'm waiting for some time now 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.060
 Next access shaft, here is the same as the first one 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.480
 Because that talk takes 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.390
 In the movie first 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:32.040
 It moves after moving 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:35.990
 Because I do not understand well with most 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.990
 lancet But have you been 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:02:00.190
 9 exterior parts department is because most jelly is not already bought 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:04.750
 I'm turning from set to set 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:10.770
 It's a point Well if there is a lot of space then it 's better than z 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.770
 The c-type lens can move faster 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.610
 Yes now it was taken by the brake caliper 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.530
 It is still coming in 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.130
 To the idea to Brown 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.400
 I Econo brake it 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:39.770
 I 'm going to put a heavy burden on the tube 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.770
 I think it is better to keep it on this day or another without leaving it blank 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:52.019
 It is a string on the day 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:58.849
 I am worried about the power from the brake hose 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:58.849
 It is dirty burden is not Nari Are you sure you want to It is a sea a take a 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:16.430
 Now loosen this four or more ginger 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:17.450
 I'm in the process of pulling out the front fork, but usually I miss the spot underwear in this state 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.600
 But 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.850
 It is as you can see here 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.700
 There are not many fork cases 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:31.940
 It has been s erosion 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:35.349
 It's so high , I guess it's quite easy to pull back here to make it so small. 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.349
 I'm riding in a bad situation
