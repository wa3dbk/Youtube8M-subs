00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.229 
I'm going to let it sit for just a
second<00:03:43.840> so<00:03:43.989> the<00:03:44.109> glue<00:03:44.349> can<00:03:44.560> become<00:03:44.980> tacky<00:03:45.970> and

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
second so the glue can become tacky and

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.110 
second so the glue can become tacky and
