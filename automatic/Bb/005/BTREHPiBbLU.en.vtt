00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.470
 in this video we show how it is 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.139
 You can manually clean the heads 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:15.750
 for canon large format printers 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:19.980
 series i pf the heads in question are 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.660
 of pf heads with various with various 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.710
 final numbers but essentially the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.900
 structure is always the same 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.130
 first we note that it is necessary 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.140
 manually clean a head when 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.840
 printing the reason of verification of the 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.170
 birds the nose is there that we find gods 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.450
 sectors that are not perfectly i 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.579
 myths that do not print all the lines 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.010
 who should print in this case 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.300
 normally we can use the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.180
 printer control panel 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.920
 to do an aob or o type cleaning 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.579
 less thorough to try to 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.199
 restore the situation in some 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.930
 cases the situation is restored 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.840
 simply and we can continue to 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.659
 print in other cases would be 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.040
 requests more cleaning unfortunately doing 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.619
 cleaning at the control panel yes 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.689
 risks running out prematurely 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.250
 maintenance and waste tank 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.810
 a lot of ink from others too 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.119
 colors 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.310
 then the procedure can be started 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.009
 head replacement once 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.479
 that we understood which head 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.310
 it comes in the printers with two 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.439
 heads for example is indicated 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.030
 head left head to the right 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.729
 in this case for example we have 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.840
 provided that the defect c 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.540
 we were on black 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.310
 we proceeded to uninstall that 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.700
 to start the replacement procedure for 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.220
 the head the right once extracted 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.220
 we have the head from the printer 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.500
 here for manual cleaning we use 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.340
 our specific cleaning liquid 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:57.060
 for canon series pf heads 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.590
 there are various degrees of say so of 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.630
 depth of the police we can 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.960
 reaching the first is very simple 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.549
 we use a plastic tray or 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.719
 any container that if able to 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.719
 contain our party 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.720
 we use my advice is always 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.450
 that of using cotton buds 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.280
 somehow make it so 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.959
 nozzles do not touch the bottom but 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.940
 remain suspended in this way not 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.590
 let's do nothing but just soak 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.400
 the end of the head of 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:33.660
 birds in a minimum amount of that 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:38.019
 that cleaning putting hand to the head 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.670
 cleaning liquid penetrates into the 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.400
 nozzles from below 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.810
 removing and crumbling any 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.810
 ink residue 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.190
 let's see now in the second part how 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.190
 proceed
