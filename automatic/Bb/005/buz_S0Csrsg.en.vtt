you know my pedigree so to speak is in
high-energy<00:00:22.040> physics<00:00:22.460> so<00:00:23.390> I<00:00:23.420> started<00:00:23.810> as<00:00:23.960> a

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990

there's another of curious rule if you

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.930 
there's another of curious rule if you
looked<00:01:09.200> at<00:01:09.290> a<00:01:09.409> mammal<00:01:09.740> that<00:01:09.770> was<00:01:10.159> ten<00:01:10.430> thousand

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
looked at a mammal that was ten thousand

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.440 
looked at a mammal that was ten thousand
times<00:01:11.150> bigger<00:01:12.280> than<00:01:13.280> another<00:01:13.580> mammal<00:01:14.090> it

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
times bigger than another mammal it

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.320 
times bigger than another mammal it
would<00:01:14.810> live<00:01:15.380> ten<00:01:15.950> times<00:01:16.190> as<00:01:16.370> long<00:01:16.400> if<00:01:16.970> you<00:01:17.180> look

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
would live ten times as long if you look

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.630 
would live ten times as long if you look

at say heart rate heart rates decrease
if<00:01:19.909> you<00:01:20.060> have<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.420> same<00:01:20.659> factor<00:01:21.080> of<00:01:21.170> 10,000<00:01:21.890> by

if you have the same factor of 10,000 by

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.100 
if you have the same factor of 10,000 by
a<00:01:22.280> factor<00:01:22.729> of<00:01:22.759> 10<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:23.060> if<00:01:23.329> you<00:01:23.420> multiply<00:01:23.899> those

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
a factor of 10 and if you multiply those

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.800 
a factor of 10 and if you multiply those
together<00:01:24.350> what<00:01:25.039> you<00:01:25.189> discover<00:01:25.610> is<00:01:25.939> that

ecosystems<00:02:27.440> are<00:02:27.650> networks<00:02:28.160> and<00:02:28.490> so<00:02:28.610> on<00:02:28.730> so<00:02:28.880> the

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
ecosystems are networks and so on so the

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.790 
ecosystems are networks and so on so the
idea<00:02:29.420> is<00:02:29.720> that<00:02:30.280> networks

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
idea is that networks

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.590 
idea is that networks
circle<00:02:32.040> properties<00:02:32.550> of<00:02:32.700> networks<00:02:33.120> for<00:02:33.420> their

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
circle properties of networks for their

circle properties of networks for their
universal<00:02:34.440> laws<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:35.870> one<00:02:36.870> of<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.080> questions

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
universal laws and one of the questions

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.400 
universal laws and one of the questions
that<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.770> automatically<00:02:38.370> think<00:02:38.520> of<00:02:38.910> is<00:02:39.410> gee

the patterns the number of people you

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.850 
the patterns the number of people you

talk to on your mobile phone whatever

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.979

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
per capita in a systematic way so if you

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.440 
per capita in a systematic way so if you
double<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.650> size<00:03:52.950> of<00:03:53.160> a<00:03:53.250> city<00:03:53.489> instead<00:03:54.300> of

double the size of a city instead of

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.020 
double the size of a city instead of

getting twice as many AIDS cases you get

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.900 
getting twice as many AIDS cases you get
twice<00:03:57.330> plus<00:03:57.720> 15%<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:58.860> it's<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.340> same<00:03:59.580> whether

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
twice plus 15% and it's the same whether

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
you look in the United States

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.440 
you look in the United States

about it and what you do is you're

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.120 
about it and what you do is you're

zooming up this curve you would crash

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.910 
zooming up this curve you would crash
and<00:05:20.520> you<00:05:20.970> change<00:05:21.330> the<00:05:21.450> paradigm<00:05:21.930> you<00:05:22.500> invent

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:22.920 
and you change the paradigm you invent

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.090 
and you change the paradigm you invent
computers<00:05:23.610> or<00:05:23.940> you<00:05:24.540> invent<00:05:24.900> suddenly<00:05:25.350> IT<00:05:25.530> and

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
computers or you invent suddenly IT and

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.700 
computers or you invent suddenly IT and
this<00:05:26.220> completely<00:05:27.150> changes<00:05:27.750> all<00:05:27.960> the<00:05:28.320> boundary

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
systematic way so the question is is

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.990 
systematic way so the question is is
that<00:05:43.320> sustainable<00:05:43.980> where<00:05:44.400> you<00:05:44.520> believe<00:05:44.790> any

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
of this obviously it isn't so you know

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.370 
of this obviously it isn't so you know
you<00:05:47.580> ask<00:05:47.790> yourself<00:05:48.150> what's<00:05:48.390> the<00:05:48.570> way<00:05:48.690> out<00:05:48.870> what

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
you ask yourself what's the way out what

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.010 
you ask yourself what's the way out what
is<00:05:49.530> the<00:05:49.740> solution<00:05:49.920> to<00:05:50.340> this<00:05:50.490> and<00:05:50.780> there<00:05:51.780> isn't

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020

sustainability so that's my
approximation<00:06:34.220> thank<00:06:35.220> you<00:06:35.370> very<00:06:35.580> much

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:47.480 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.700 

tell<00:06:48.480> me<00:06:48.570> if<00:06:48.630> this<00:06:48.750> is<00:06:48.930> wrong<00:06:49.080> you'd<00:06:49.350> like<00:06:49.560> to

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:49.710 
tell me if this is wrong you'd like to

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.990 
tell me if this is wrong you'd like to
put<00:06:49.920> bacteria<00:06:51.980> selected<00:06:53.000> artificially

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 
put bacteria selected artificially

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.100 
put bacteria selected artificially
engineered<00:06:54.210> whatever<00:06:55.080> it<00:06:55.200> takes<00:06:55.530> to<00:06:56.130> work<00:06:56.340> in

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 
engineered whatever it takes to work in

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.510 
engineered whatever it takes to work in
order<00:06:58.110> to<00:06:58.260> achieve<00:06:58.530> great<00:06:59.070> things<00:06:59.100> for

00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 
order to achieve great things for

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.500 
order to achieve great things for
Humanity<00:06:59.820> the<00:07:00.660> fact<00:07:00.870> that<00:07:00.960> we<00:07:01.110> can<00:07:01.260> now<00:07:01.500> design

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:02.510 
Humanity the fact that we can now design

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.680 
Humanity the fact that we can now design
DNA<00:07:03.510> software<00:07:04.170> in<00:07:04.260> the<00:07:04.380> computer<00:07:05.690> yeah

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:06.690 
DNA software in the computer yeah

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.410 
DNA software in the computer yeah
everything<00:07:07.350> is<00:07:07.440> possible<00:07:07.830> yeah<00:07:08.490> right<00:07:09.120> that

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:09.420 
everything is possible yeah right that

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.070 
everything is possible yeah right that
it's<00:07:10.290> a<00:07:10.440> it's<00:07:10.710> a<00:07:10.800> design<00:07:11.190> challenge<00:07:11.840> much<00:07:12.840> more

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 
it's a it's a design challenge much more

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.550 
it's a it's a design challenge much more
than<00:07:13.260> that's<00:07:13.470> any<00:07:13.650> other<00:07:13.860> kind<00:07:14.100> of<00:07:14.160> challenge
