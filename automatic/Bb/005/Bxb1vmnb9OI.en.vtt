00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
it look pretty cool

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.030 
it look pretty cool
I<00:00:11.519> guess<00:00:11.880> I'm<00:00:12.330> not<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.809> best<00:00:13.080> builder<00:00:13.469> but<00:00:13.799> um

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
I guess I'm not the best builder but um

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.369 
I guess I'm not the best builder but um
basically<00:00:14.940> what<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:15.179> does<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:15.599> it<00:00:15.780> dispenses

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
basically what it does is it dispenses

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.650 
basically what it does is it dispenses
automatic<00:00:17.039> eggs<00:00:17.220> so<00:00:17.640> that<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:18.000> can<00:00:18.240> just<00:00:18.480> turn

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
automatic eggs so that you can just turn

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.840 
automatic eggs so that you can just turn
up<00:00:18.869> turn<00:00:19.680> on<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.859> lever<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.400> then<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:20.699> can

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
up turn on a lever and then you can

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.670 
up turn on a lever and then you can
automatically<00:00:21.330> get<00:00:21.630> all<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.930> free<00:00:22.170> feathers

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680

a<00:00:26.430> redstone<00:00:26.820> pulsar<00:00:27.420> I'm<00:00:27.539> pretty<00:00:27.810> sure

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
a redstone pulsar I'm pretty sure

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.960 
a redstone pulsar I'm pretty sure
everybody<00:00:28.859> who<00:00:29.130> does<00:00:29.310> are<00:00:29.460> its<00:00:29.580> own<00:00:29.760> knows

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
everybody who does are its own knows

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.580 
everybody who does are its own knows
what<00:00:30.150> this<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.510> obviously<00:00:30.990> it's<00:00:31.230> just<00:00:31.380> that's

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
what this is obviously it's just that's

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.580 
what this is obviously it's just that's
how<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:31.949> make<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.219> um<00:00:32.630> this<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.809> dispenser

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
how you make it um this is a dispenser

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.319 
how you make it um this is a dispenser
just<00:00:34.829> fill<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.160> up<00:00:35.250> with<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.460> few<00:00:35.640> eggs<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.090> guess

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
just fill it up with a few eggs I guess

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.319 
just fill it up with a few eggs I guess
and<00:00:36.710> the<00:00:37.710> problem<00:00:38.219> with<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.149> why<00:00:39.300> I

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
and the problem with this this is why I

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.209 
and the problem with this this is why I
had<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.660> put<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.870> water<00:00:40.079> here<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.559> when<00:00:41.070> you

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
had to put the water here is when you

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.440 
had to put the water here is when you
fire<00:00:41.460> something<00:00:41.670> out<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.969> dispenser

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
fire something out of a dispenser

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.150 
fire something out of a dispenser
doesn't<00:00:42.750> matter<00:00:42.930> what<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.260> when<00:00:44.040> you're

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
doesn't matter what it is when you're

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.619 
doesn't matter what it is when you're
fired<00:00:44.370> something<00:00:44.670> out<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.329> shoots

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
fired something out of it it shoots

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.250 
fired something out of it it shoots
about<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.379> far<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:47.160> think<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.239> about<00:00:48.840> as

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
about this far I think this is about as

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
about this far I think this is about as
far<00:00:49.739> as<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.039> shoots<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:50.940> whenever<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.930> does

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
far as it shoots so whenever it does

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.720 
far as it shoots so whenever it does
whenever<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.460> does<00:00:53.610> like<00:00:55.129> throw<00:00:56.129> an<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.399> you're

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
whenever it does like throw an a you're

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.580 
whenever it does like throw an a you're
throwing<00:00:57.420> egg<00:00:57.600> what<00:00:57.750> am<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:57.899> saying<00:00:58.050> whenever

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
throwing egg what am I saying whenever

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.549 
throwing egg what am I saying whenever
it<00:00:59.129> dispenses<00:00:59.789> an<00:00:59.969> egg<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.510> makes<00:01:01.410> a

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
it dispenses an egg and it makes a

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.560 
it dispenses an egg and it makes a
chicken<00:01:01.980> then<00:01:02.160> chicken<00:01:02.370> will<00:01:02.609> just<00:01:02.820> gently

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.249 
whole thing bro so as you can see
they're<00:01:50.460> just<00:01:50.490> kind<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.329> baby<00:01:51.750> chickens

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
they're just kind of a baby chickens

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.800 
they're just kind of a baby chickens
usually<00:01:52.710> like<00:01:52.950> they<00:01:53.159> can<00:01:54.000> they<00:01:54.149> even<00:01:54.360> jump<00:01:54.630> one

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
usually like they can they even jump one

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.139 
usually like they can they even jump one
block<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.590> don't<00:01:56.430> think<00:01:56.610> like<00:01:56.850> they're<00:01:57.060> not

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
block I don't think like they're not

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.670 
block I don't think like they're not
even<00:01:57.390> trying<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.719> jump<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:57.990> block<00:01:58.320> so<00:01:58.560> this

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
even trying to jump the block so this

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.859 
even trying to jump the block so this
actually<00:01:59.640> works<00:01:59.820> better<00:02:00.090> than<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.450> thought<00:02:00.689> it

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
actually works better than I thought it

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.709 
actually works better than I thought it
would<00:02:01.079> but<00:02:03.320> this<00:02:04.320> one<00:02:04.560> kind<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.890> meat<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.159> know

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
dispensing them you can put gonna have a

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.920 
dispensing them you can put gonna have a
gate<00:02:18.610> here<00:02:18.880> or<00:02:18.970> something<00:02:19.330> you<00:02:19.450> can<00:02:19.570> just<00:02:19.750> come

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
gate here or something you can just come

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.710 
gate here or something you can just come
in<00:02:20.050> here<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:20.440> then<00:02:21.150> slaughter<00:02:22.150> them<00:02:22.390> but<00:02:22.630> of

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
in here and then slaughter them but of

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.300 
in here and then slaughter them but of
course<00:02:22.960> you<00:02:23.110> have<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.380> wait<00:02:23.530> till<00:02:23.710> they<00:02:24.010> grow

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
course you have to wait till they grow

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.230 
course you have to wait till they grow
up<00:02:24.430> so<00:02:24.880> they<00:02:24.970> can<00:02:25.180> get<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.450> chicken<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:25.960> stuff

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
up so they can get the chicken and stuff

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.630 
up so they can get the chicken and stuff
I<00:02:28.240> guess<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:29.380> eggs<00:02:29.590> are<00:02:29.800> probably<00:02:29.950> eggs<00:02:30.400> don't

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
I guess the eggs are probably eggs don't

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.850 
I guess the eggs are probably eggs don't
do<00:02:30.820> damage<00:02:31.030> so<00:02:31.750> they're<00:02:32.050> not<00:02:32.200> going<00:02:32.350> to<00:02:32.380> Vegas

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
do damage so they're not going to Vegas

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.310 
do damage so they're not going to Vegas
I'm<00:02:33.130> gonna<00:02:33.310> kill<00:02:33.550> them<00:02:33.730> or<00:02:33.880> anything<00:02:34.060> so<00:02:34.990> if
