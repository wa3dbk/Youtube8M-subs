doing<00:04:13.040> the<00:04:13.130> back<00:04:13.280> you<00:04:13.489> could<00:04:13.670> repeat<00:04:14.120> what<00:04:14.750> you

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
the back and I'm going to repeat that

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.550 
the back and I'm going to repeat that
for<00:05:22.590> all<00:05:23.250> of<00:05:23.670> these<00:05:24.030> other<00:05:24.090> three<00:05:24.930> quadrants

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
for all of these other three quadrants

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.890 
for all of these other three quadrants
as<00:05:25.740> well<00:05:25.920> so<00:05:26.640> for<00:05:26.820> the<00:05:26.970> rest<00:05:27.180> of<00:05:27.510> the<00:05:27.720> design

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
as well so for the rest of the design

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.140 
as well so for the rest of the design
here<00:05:28.680> what<00:05:29.160> we're<00:05:29.310> going<00:05:29.520> to<00:05:29.670> do<00:05:29.820> is<00:05:29.970> we're

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
here what we're going to do is we're

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.000 
here what we're going to do is we're
just<00:05:30.180> going<00:05:30.420> to<00:05:30.540> make<00:05:30.720> the<00:05:30.930> webbed<00:05:31.200> look<00:05:31.530> so

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
just going to make the webbed look so

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.830 
just going to make the webbed look so
I'm<00:05:32.070> just<00:05:32.250> putting<00:05:32.490> a<00:05:32.550> little<00:05:32.580> bit<00:05:33.090> of<00:05:33.360> water

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
I'm just putting a little bit of water

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.110 
I'm just putting a little bit of water
again<00:05:34.110> there<00:05:34.680> and<00:05:34.920> then<00:05:35.460> I'm<00:05:35.610> just<00:05:35.640> going<00:05:36.000> to

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
again there and then I'm just going to

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.230 
again there and then I'm just going to
slightly<00:05:36.870> Bend<00:05:37.380> these<00:05:37.740> and<00:05:38.100> then<00:05:38.640> put<00:05:38.670> them<00:05:39.030> in

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
slightly Bend these and then put them in

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.680 
slightly Bend these and then put them in
between<00:05:39.480> the<00:05:40.410> two<00:05:40.620> lines<00:05:40.890> like<00:05:41.370> that<00:05:41.610> and<00:05:42.030> this

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
between the two lines like that and this

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.800 
between the two lines like that and this
press<00:05:43.080> the<00:05:43.260> edges<00:05:43.410> towards<00:05:44.100> the<00:05:44.700> other<00:05:44.970> lines

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
press the edges towards the other lines

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.140 
press the edges towards the other lines
there<00:05:46.230> and<00:05:46.440> then<00:05:46.950> I'm<00:05:47.040> going<00:05:47.220> to<00:05:47.310> just<00:05:47.670> like

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
there and then I'm going to just like

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.090 
there and then I'm going to just like
put<00:05:48.360> another<00:05:48.600> one<00:05:48.840> here<00:05:49.290> where<00:05:49.500> it<00:05:49.620> meets<00:05:49.830> it

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
put another one here where it meets it

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.080 
put another one here where it meets it
there<00:05:50.370> and<00:05:50.960> do<00:05:51.960> that<00:05:52.140> again<00:05:52.790> just<00:05:53.790> putting

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
there and do that again just putting

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.210 
there and do that again just putting
them<00:05:54.210> in<00:05:54.390> between<00:05:54.830> it's<00:05:55.830> a<00:05:55.890> little<00:05:56.130> bit

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
them in between it's a little bit

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.280 
them in between it's a little bit
finicky<00:05:56.400> works<00:05:57.390> if<00:05:57.570> you<00:05:57.660> have<00:05:57.720> small<00:05:58.080> hands

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.290 
finicky works if you have small hands

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:02.450 
finicky works if you have small hands
and<00:05:59.930> just<00:06:00.930> like<00:06:01.110> that<00:06:01.320> and<00:06:01.620> so<00:06:02.160> then<00:06:02.340> I'm<00:06:02.430> going

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
and just like that and so then I'm going

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.160 
and just like that and so then I'm going
to<00:06:02.580> go<00:06:02.730> up<00:06:02.940> a<00:06:03.090> couple<00:06:03.300> more<00:06:03.510> times<00:06:03.810> and<00:06:04.080> I'll

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.170 
to go up a couple more times and I'll

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.140 
to go up a couple more times and I'll
just<00:06:04.320> show<00:06:04.470> another<00:06:04.710> one<00:06:04.950> here<00:06:05.400> just<00:06:05.520> a<00:06:05.940> little

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
just show another one here just a little

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.050 
just show another one here just a little
bit<00:06:06.270> higher<00:06:06.660> up<00:06:06.960> on<00:06:07.170> to<00:06:07.530> the<00:06:08.130> top<00:06:08.370> of<00:06:08.670> the<00:06:08.850> head

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
bit higher up on to the top of the head

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.810 
bit higher up on to the top of the head
here<00:06:09.420> and<00:06:09.860> then<00:06:10.860> just<00:06:11.070> bend<00:06:11.280> it<00:06:11.400> round<00:06:11.670> again

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
here and then just bend it round again

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.930 
here and then just bend it round again
so<00:06:12.600> this<00:06:12.930> is<00:06:13.140> a<00:06:13.170> little<00:06:13.410> bit<00:06:13.500> time-consuming

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
so this is a little bit time-consuming

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.940 
so this is a little bit time-consuming
so<00:06:14.940> each<00:06:15.240> time<00:06:15.600> I'm<00:06:15.990> just<00:06:16.410> going<00:06:16.620> to<00:06:16.650> cut<00:06:16.920> a

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:16.950 
so each time I'm just going to cut a

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.380 
so each time I'm just going to cut a
whole<00:06:17.190> bunch<00:06:17.370> of<00:06:17.490> these<00:06:17.610> little<00:06:17.850> ones<00:06:18.120> and

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.390 
whole bunch of these little ones and

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.720 
whole bunch of these little ones and
then<00:06:18.900> shape<00:06:19.260> them<00:06:19.560> and<00:06:19.740> I'm<00:06:20.070> going<00:06:20.280> to<00:06:20.310> go<00:06:20.460> all

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:20.730 
then shape them and I'm going to go all

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.680 
then shape them and I'm going to go all
the<00:06:20.940> way<00:06:20.970> around<00:06:21.180> the<00:06:22.340> mask<00:06:23.340> here<00:06:23.850> and<00:06:24.000> then

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
the way around the mask here and then

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.300 
the way around the mask here and then
we'll<00:06:24.810> be<00:06:24.930> back<00:06:24.960> to<00:06:25.320> show<00:06:25.500> you<00:06:25.530> the<00:06:25.680> next<00:06:26.100> step

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
we'll be back to show you the next step

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.410 
we'll be back to show you the next step
so<00:06:27.150> our<00:06:27.240> last<00:06:27.450> step<00:06:27.690> is<00:06:28.080> to<00:06:28.110> add<00:06:28.800> the<00:06:29.430> eyes<00:06:29.760> and

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:30.420 
so our last step is to add the eyes and

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.180 
so our last step is to add the eyes and
what<00:06:30.870> I've<00:06:31.020> got<00:06:31.260> is<00:06:31.410> just<00:06:31.590> a<00:06:31.710> little<00:06:31.950> Halfmoon

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
what I've got is just a little Halfmoon

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.220 
what I've got is just a little Halfmoon
shape<00:06:32.940> here<00:06:33.210> I<00:06:33.240> just<00:06:33.420> wanted<00:06:33.630> to<00:06:33.750> show<00:06:33.930> you<00:06:33.990> the

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.230 
shape here I just wanted to show you the

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.710 
shape here I just wanted to show you the
cutter<00:06:34.470> set<00:06:34.800> that<00:06:34.980> I<00:06:35.010> have<00:06:35.280> it's<00:06:35.850> 12<00:06:36.210> cutters

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 
cutter set that I have it's 12 cutters

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.810 
cutter set that I have it's 12 cutters
from<00:06:36.900> a<00:06:37.050> techo<00:06:37.290> and<00:06:37.680> it<00:06:38.070> just<00:06:38.250> has<00:06:38.430> little

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:38.820 
from a techo and it just has little

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.710 
from a techo and it just has little
teeny<00:06:39.030> tiny<00:06:39.330> mini<00:06:39.630> cutters<00:06:40.050> so<00:06:40.229> I<00:06:40.260> guess

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 
teeny tiny mini cutters so I guess

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.720 
teeny tiny mini cutters so I guess
that<00:06:40.900> up<00:06:41.080> at<00:06:41.260> a<00:06:41.290> cake<00:06:41.590> store<00:06:41.920> so<00:06:42.370> if<00:06:42.460> you<00:06:42.580> can

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:42.730 
that up at a cake store so if you can

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.310 
that up at a cake store so if you can
find<00:06:43.000> one<00:06:43.240> they're<00:06:43.450> kind<00:06:43.630> of<00:06:43.720> handy<00:06:44.020> to<00:06:44.140> have

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:44.320 
find one they're kind of handy to have

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.410 
find one they're kind of handy to have
so<00:06:45.100> you<00:06:45.190> don't<00:06:45.340> have<00:06:45.520> to<00:06:45.730> have<00:06:45.880> one<00:06:46.120> you<00:06:46.270> could

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:46.420 
so you don't have to have one you could

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.450 
so you don't have to have one you could
use<00:06:46.450> a<00:06:46.600> circle<00:06:47.140> cutter<00:06:47.170> and<00:06:47.620> you<00:06:48.070> could<00:06:48.250> just

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:48.460 
use a circle cutter and you could just

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.880 
use a circle cutter and you could just
cut<00:06:48.670> a<00:06:48.700> little<00:06:48.790> bit<00:06:49.030> of<00:06:49.300> a<00:06:49.480> divot<00:06:49.780> out<00:06:49.960> but<00:06:50.800> I've

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:50.890 
cut a little bit of a divot out but I've

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:52.320 
cut a little bit of a divot out but I've
got<00:06:51.100> this<00:06:51.250> one<00:06:51.460> so<00:06:51.670> I'm<00:06:51.760> going<00:06:51.910> to<00:06:51.940> make<00:06:52.090> use<00:06:52.300> of
