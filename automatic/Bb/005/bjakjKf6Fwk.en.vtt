00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.850 
like five and two more we have five red
beads<00:02:12.810> we<00:02:13.140> add<00:02:13.319> two

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
beads we add two

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.750 
beads we add two
to<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.580> number<00:02:14.850> so<00:02:15.270> we're<00:02:15.450> actually

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
to that number so we're actually

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.830 
to that number so we're actually
contextualizing<00:02:17.760> or<00:02:17.970> composing<00:02:18.450> and

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
contextualizing or composing and

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.440 
contextualizing or composing and
decomposing<00:02:18.920> these<00:02:19.920> numbers<00:02:20.400> then<00:02:21.150> if<00:02:21.300> we

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
decomposing these numbers then if we

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.390 
decomposing these numbers then if we
look<00:02:21.480> at<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.930> second<00:02:22.380> example<00:02:22.740> we're<00:02:23.040> looking

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
look at the second example we're looking

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.080 
look at the second example we're looking
at<00:02:24.080> 13-13<00:02:25.080> looks<00:02:25.380> like<00:02:25.620> ten<00:02:26.070> and<00:02:26.430> three<00:02:26.820> more

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
at 13-13 looks like ten and three more

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.990 
at 13-13 looks like ten and three more
so<00:02:27.720> we<00:02:27.900> have<00:02:28.140> ten<00:02:28.470> beads<00:02:28.770> on<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.220> top<00:02:29.250> row<00:02:29.730> and

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
so we have ten beads on the top row and

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.210 
so we have ten beads on the top row and
three<00:02:30.330> on<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.510> bottom<00:02:31.080> row<00:02:31.290> we<00:02:31.860> could<00:02:32.040> also

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
three on the bottom row we could also

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.670 
three on the bottom row we could also
show<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:32.970> with<00:02:33.150> our<00:02:33.330> two<00:02:33.570> rows<00:02:33.870> of<00:02:33.900> red<00:02:34.350> beads

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
show it with our two rows of red beads

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.190 
show it with our two rows of red beads
five<00:02:35.400> red<00:02:35.670> beads<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.180> five<00:02:36.420> red<00:02:36.630> beads<00:02:36.930> would

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
five red beads and five red beads would

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.949 
five red beads and five red beads would
be<00:02:37.380> ten<00:02:38.070> red<00:02:38.370> beads<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.030> then<00:02:39.450> three<00:02:39.780> more

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
be ten red beads and then three more

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.290 
be ten red beads and then three more
white<00:02:40.230> beads<00:02:40.530> would<00:02:40.800> show<00:02:41.100> our<00:02:41.400> five<00:02:41.760> so<00:02:42.150> it's

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
white beads would show our five so it's

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.480 
white beads would show our five so it's
again<00:02:42.660> helping<00:02:43.050> us<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.530> learn<00:02:43.560> how<00:02:43.740> to<00:02:43.950> compose

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
again helping us to learn how to compose

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.170 
again helping us to learn how to compose
and<00:02:44.790> decompose<00:02:44.850> numbers<00:02:46.760> we<00:02:47.760> can<00:02:47.940> actually

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
and decompose numbers we can actually

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.930 
and decompose numbers we can actually
practice<00:02:48.600> using<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.470> number<00:02:49.830> four<00:02:50.190> so<00:02:50.790> we

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
practice using the number four so we

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.880 
practice using the number four so we
have<00:02:51.120> different<00:02:51.330> variations<00:02:52.260> we<00:02:52.500> could<00:02:52.709> ask

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
have different variations we could ask

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.550 
have different variations we could ask
children<00:02:53.489> who<00:02:53.940> had<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.209> Rick<00:02:54.959> and<00:02:55.170> Rick<00:02:55.380> in

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
children who had a Rick and Rick in

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.620 
children who had a Rick and Rick in
their<00:02:55.739> lap<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.280> show<00:02:56.520> us<00:02:56.760> different<00:02:57.030> ways<00:02:57.390> they

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
their lap to show us different ways they

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.090 
their lap to show us different ways they
could<00:02:57.840> make<00:02:58.020> four<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:58.470> they<00:02:58.590> might<00:02:58.800> show<00:02:59.070> it

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
could make four and they might show it

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.520 
could make four and they might show it
with<00:02:59.459> three<00:02:59.850> red<00:03:00.150> beads<00:03:00.450> on<00:03:00.660> top<00:03:01.020> and<00:03:01.350> one<00:03:01.500> on

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
with three red beads on top and one on

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.400 
with three red beads on top and one on
the<00:03:01.830> bottom<00:03:02.250> or<00:03:02.700> one<00:03:03.060> red<00:03:03.360> bead<00:03:03.600> on<00:03:03.780> top<00:03:03.959> and

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
the bottom or one red bead on top and

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.710 
the bottom or one red bead on top and
three<00:03:04.650> on<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:04.860> bottom<00:03:05.160> or<00:03:05.520> a<00:03:05.760> combination<00:03:06.209> of

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
three on the bottom or a combination of

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.229 
three on the bottom or a combination of
two<00:03:06.989> on<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.200> top<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:07.890> two<00:03:07.950> on<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.310> bottom<00:03:08.459> so

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
two on the top and two on the bottom so

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.820 
two on the top and two on the bottom so
you<00:03:09.300> help<00:03:09.600> them<00:03:09.750> think<00:03:10.050> of<00:03:10.170> different<00:03:10.620> ways

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
you help them think of different ways

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.680 
you help them think of different ways
that<00:03:11.130> they<00:03:11.340> can<00:03:11.370> make<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.940> same<00:03:12.209> number

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
that they can make the same number

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.080 
that they can make the same number
here's<00:03:13.410> another<00:03:13.770> example<00:03:14.040> of<00:03:14.580> other<00:03:14.820> ways

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
here's another example of other ways

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.030 
here's another example of other ways
that<00:03:15.300> they<00:03:15.510> might<00:03:15.720> show<00:03:16.080> on<00:03:16.320> their<00:03:16.560> Rick<00:03:16.800> and

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
that they might show on their Rick and

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.830 
that they might show on their Rick and
Rick<00:03:17.250> so<00:03:17.970> if<00:03:18.150> you're<00:03:18.330> doing<00:03:18.480> this<00:03:18.630> with

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
Rick so if you're doing this with

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.840 
Rick so if you're doing this with
children<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:19.650> might<00:03:19.860> ask<00:03:20.070> them<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.580> show<00:03:20.820> you

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
children you might ask them to show you

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.000 
children you might ask them to show you
multiple<00:03:21.420> ways<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.049> they<00:03:22.560> can<00:03:22.769> keep

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
multiple ways and they can keep

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.310 
multiple ways and they can keep
incorporating<00:03:23.910> that<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.390> learning<00:03:24.660> how<00:03:25.260> to

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
incorporating that and learning how to

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.550 
incorporating that and learning how to
make<00:03:26.100> sense<00:03:26.430> of<00:03:26.670> numbers<00:03:27.120> so<00:03:28.019> let's<00:03:28.320> think

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
make sense of numbers so let's think

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.890 
make sense of numbers so let's think
then<00:03:28.860> about<00:03:29.280> how<00:03:29.489> you<00:03:29.549> can<00:03:29.940> use<00:03:30.180> Rick<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:30.690> Rex

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
then about how you can use Rick and Rex

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.010 
then about how you can use Rick and Rex
in<00:03:31.170> your<00:03:31.380> classroom
