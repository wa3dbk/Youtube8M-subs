00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.070 
incredible computing power but if you
import<00:02:43.709> realistic<00:02:44.340> physics<00:02:44.550> into<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.060> game<00:02:45.360> you

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
import realistic physics into a game you

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.330 
import realistic physics into a game you
get<00:02:46.260> something<00:02:46.530> that<00:02:46.769> you<00:02:46.920> didn't<00:02:47.130> expect

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
get something that you didn't expect

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.720 
get something that you didn't expect
it's<00:02:48.180> too<00:02:48.540> realistic<00:02:49.069> the<00:02:50.069> key<00:02:50.280> is<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.459> present

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
it's too realistic the key is to present

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.089 
it's too realistic the key is to present
it<00:02:51.120> so<00:02:51.360> it<00:02:51.480> looks<00:02:51.720> unbelievable<00:02:52.410> mobile<00:02:52.799> but

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
it so it looks unbelievable mobile but

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.309 
it so it looks unbelievable mobile but
it<00:02:53.190> is<00:02:53.310> still<00:02:53.610> exciting<00:02:54.120> game<00:02:54.299> plan<00:02:54.540> of<00:02:54.629> God<00:02:54.810> it

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
it is still exciting game plan of God it

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.930 
it is still exciting game plan of God it
took<00:02:55.440> us<00:02:55.590> a<00:02:55.650> tremendous<00:02:55.860> amount<00:02:56.400> of<00:02:56.489> time<00:02:56.730> to

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
took us a tremendous amount of time to

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:26.410 
took us a tremendous amount of time to
master<00:02:57.299> that<00:02:57.330> balance

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.630 

but<00:03:27.420> with<00:03:27.660> audie<00:03:27.840> we<00:03:28.470> obsessed<00:03:28.950> over<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.430> look

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
but with audie we obsessed over the look

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.360 
but with audie we obsessed over the look
and<00:03:29.850> feel<00:03:30.090> of<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.360> game<00:03:30.390> was<00:03:31.020> there<00:03:31.370> we

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
and feel of the game was there we

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.370 
and feel of the game was there we
animated<00:03:32.850> everything<00:03:33.330> my<00:03:33.480> hand<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:33.990> capture

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
animated everything my hand to capture

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.710 
animated everything my hand to capture
our<00:03:34.410> imagination<00:03:34.910> to<00:03:35.910> bring<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.240> life<00:03:36.420> what

our imagination to bring to life what
was<00:03:36.840> happening<00:03:37.290> inside<00:03:37.680> our<00:03:38.010> heads
