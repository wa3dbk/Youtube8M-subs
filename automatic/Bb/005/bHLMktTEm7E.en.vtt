00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:11.219
 boys 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.960
 race time by time with a new one 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.799
 complete here my channel here as gaming 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.820
 today I have another delicious one 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.650
 game play for you because this game 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.240
 play comes from Friday night 's list 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.320
 Friday evening we had around 4 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.330
 of hours after the other are equal 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.949
 points of contention take 4 slash ascii and 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.630
 last night we also had about 5 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.710
 we have live stream about it 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.449
 generally only black as two 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.039
 man was parents in last night 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.720
 passbook game done and also be 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.399
 once empty and we walked out last night 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.079
 just started with 4 against 4 champ u 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.149
 series I really enjoyed playing 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.710
 today's committee will change that 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.840
 only after that no i was looking for solos 6 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.579
 against 6 10 get me series and that is 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.079
 really just a picker is alone 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.059
 but camper with targets finance indie 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.280
 game places evening with sock charge 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.870
 Betty's claims break everything was just too 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.610
 the starter could the starter and me 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.379
 was just really just a rush in it 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.149
 series the sixpence ended in the 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.350
 platinum division, I found myself right 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.850
 from myself but it comes naturally 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.020
 because everyone there is at the camp 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.149
 everyone 's just a little bit too now 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.949
 cutten in ecoco ran play I have to challenge 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.969
 campers only play stands for kemp okay 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.680
 then I 'll just walk in the corner 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.360
 therefore I recommend it anyway not to 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.710
 to play dees with who was standing here 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.000
 card at the Kemp but we had so 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.080
 again winded and for the wind 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.790
 people who want to know where f-block 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.860
 parties with the livesey's but really still 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.689
 bought one grain for sss and it sits 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.400
 a very good multiplayer future 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.720
 that is he did playing enough 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.580
 study the multiplayer from the 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.990
 player sees it as being social and stable 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.729
 Leveling fans so therefore job plays 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.960
 moment fx no place like two more 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.400
 write then probably comes in 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.759
 back to the list for two weeks or so 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.080
 rings 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.400
 but then it comes one today 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.110
 not because I want to be here today 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.460
 first ever to say about game play 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.600
 I therefore prep this game in list I of 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.310
 picked up on Friday and allowed the 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.600
 Friday have been near then know 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.189
 you that I have made this game without 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.689
 put on glasses and for the people who have it 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.820
 also know i have a cult of it 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.470
 less in the eye and minus 4 in 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.939
 another high so at the moment it's my glasses 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.439
 I just don't see sales 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.729
 more so I was playing then 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.290
 I didn't see anyone getting an epic about it 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.939
 one is what i saw was two green 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.829
 spots on the folder I saw a lot of red ones 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.780
 spots on the folder has keep lookin couple 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.130
 but saw blue spots on the mat 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.240
 so nothing at all anymore and I was used to it 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.710
 playing a little was just one 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.149
 rolling and I thought of me 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.899
 go nice and try it that way 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.159
 repeat now 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.020
 only unfortunately I go after a while 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.610
 so dead because i pass for tempered scope 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.990
 the steps I did not see that I 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.550
 so no glasses pad but is just one 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.050
 nice game play to watch and 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.520
 if you watch this game play then you must 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.360
 So do not consider that I glasses per 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.100
 sometimes I walk past an emmy 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.960
 if i might be someone i am 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.910
 don't shoot at all and then just 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.020
 look away or walk away or so there 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.220
 you should pay attention now, but it is normal 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.810
 still a nice game from to 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.100
 watching it and actually I tried there 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.720
 just that now color language and allow me 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.430
 chose in a livesey of boys or four 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.930
 for now come war too 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.610
 such a hardcore stupid head and so that is 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.930
 really just a shame as my glasses had 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.580
 had I just not fat could have 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.960
 I just need to see my glasses 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.760
 depositing your self, I found it 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.990
 Janice is also nice to do alone 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.430
 which could unfortunately also be number 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.020
 parties involving paste and the sound 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.520
 from the live stream itself because I had one 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.240
 list in just via twiske 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.320
 livestream 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.880
 you can only do that again 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.350
 record on your computer only that I had 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.459
 neesque pro luck plotted 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.110
 So unfortunately I can list 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.340
 no more paste back and upload to 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.870
 own channel but the does not matter or matter 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.220
 may just want to see you again 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.300
 you always go to my twitch page 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.590

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.790
 search all those videos just it 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.010
 takes a long time so I guess 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.000
 Strongly off to do the nickname Quarter 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.070

 communicate and go about team 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.600

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:49.150
 to bring with a lay layman is what 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.800

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.449
 not just on my channel anymore 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:53.770
 black or two 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:55.120
 and no longer just an audience 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.719
 people she has walked out a lot goes empty there 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.860

 I just want to flow as my glasses pad 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:11.440
 I could have seen him tap softly 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.009
 on that also on the gameplay on it 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.300
