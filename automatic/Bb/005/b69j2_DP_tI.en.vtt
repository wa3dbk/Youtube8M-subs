be honest with you there's a part of me

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.000 
be honest with you there's a part of me
that<00:00:39.180> thinks<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.629> kind<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.140> cool<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.739> mean

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
that thinks this is kind of cool I mean

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.940 
that thinks this is kind of cool I mean
you<00:00:41.820> know<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.329> would<00:00:42.510> be<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.719> Neanderthal<00:00:43.559> an

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
you know it would be a Neanderthal an

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.139 
you know it would be a Neanderthal an
ancient<00:00:44.660> human<00:00:45.660> type<00:00:46.260> being<00:00:47.100> living<00:00:47.489> among<00:00:47.940> us

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
ancient human type being living among us

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.850 
ancient human type being living among us
it<00:00:48.420> would<00:00:48.539> be<00:00:48.629> kind<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.899> cool<00:00:48.960> but<00:00:49.649> on<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
it would be kind of cool but on the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.729 
it would be kind of cool but on the
other<00:00:49.890> hand<00:00:50.360> will<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.809> clone<00:00:52.079> animals<00:00:52.590> and

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
other hand will you clone animals and

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.500 
other hand will you clone animals and
you<00:00:52.800> have<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.949> lot<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.160> problems<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.239> think

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
you have a lot of problems and I think

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.209 
you have a lot of problems and I think
you'd<00:00:54.629> be<00:00:54.719> kind<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:55.020> unethical<00:00:55.649> because<00:00:55.860> the

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
you'd be kind of unethical because the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.400 
you'd be kind of unethical because the
Neanderthals<00:00:56.730> basically<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.239> human<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:57.899> will

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
Neanderthals basically a human so will

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.220 
Neanderthals basically a human so will
they<00:00:58.500> be<00:00:58.559> cloning<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.399> human<00:01:00.180> or<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.960> type<00:01:01.199> of

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
they be cloning a human or the type of

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.229 
they be cloning a human or the type of
human<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:01.980> what's<00:01:02.399> next<00:01:02.789> what's<00:01:02.940> going<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.149> be

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
human and what's next what's going to be

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.520 
human and what's next what's going to be
next<00:01:03.270> after<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:03.840> they're<00:01:04.110> going<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.260> clone

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
next after that they're going to clone

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.109 
next after that they're going to clone
in<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.739> end<00:01:04.949> earth<00:01:05.070> all<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.460> then<00:01:05.939> they're

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
in the end earth all and then they're

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.850 
in the end earth all and then they're
going<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.450> say<00:01:06.659> well<00:01:07.200> let's<00:01:07.409> just<00:01:07.619> clone

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
going to say well let's just clone

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.789 
going to say well let's just clone
humans<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.670> maybe<00:01:09.270> we'll<00:01:09.510> just<00:01:09.689> clone<00:01:10.470> humans

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
humans and maybe we'll just clone humans

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.520 
humans and maybe we'll just clone humans
and<00:01:11.250> use<00:01:11.640> their<00:01:11.850> organs<00:01:12.330> or<00:01:12.630> who<00:01:13.020> knows<00:01:13.049> so

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
and use their organs or who knows so

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.499 
and use their organs or who knows so
it's<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.159> bit<00:01:14.340> like<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.700> door<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.240> maybe

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
it's a bit like a door that maybe

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.630 
it's a bit like a door that maybe
shouldn't<00:01:15.840> be<00:01:15.960> open<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.470> as<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.710> Canadian<00:01:17.340> I

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
shouldn't be open so as a Canadian I

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.820 
shouldn't be open so as a Canadian I
would<00:01:17.759> have<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.060> say<00:01:18.409> ixnay<00:01:19.409> on<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
of an adjuvant it's just so dangerous

I'm<00:04:02.790> no<00:04:02.940> scientist<00:04:03.450> but<00:04:03.630> just<00:04:03.959> right<00:04:04.110> off<00:04:04.260> the

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
I'm no scientist but just right off the

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.979 
I'm no scientist but just right off the
bat<00:04:04.620> this<00:04:04.830> doesn't<00:04:05.190> sound<00:04:05.370> good<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:05.970> me<00:04:06.000> they

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
bat this doesn't sound good to me they

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.750 
bat this doesn't sound good to me they
said<00:04:07.200> they<00:04:07.380> have<00:04:07.560> found<00:04:07.769> fragments<00:04:08.190> of<00:04:08.519> the

cauliflower mosaic virus and they're

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.980 
cauliflower mosaic virus and they're
asking<00:04:28.469> you<00:04:28.590> know<00:04:28.680> what<00:04:28.889> could<00:04:29.729> this<00:04:29.990> pose

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
asking you know what could this pose

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.989 
asking you know what could this pose
maybe<00:04:31.379> a<00:04:31.469> threat<00:04:31.830> to<00:04:31.860> people's<00:04:32.340> health<00:04:32.550> or<00:04:32.879> to

00:04:32.989 --> 00:04:32.999 
maybe a threat to people's health or to

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:34.429 
maybe a threat to people's health or to
the<00:04:33.029> environment<00:04:33.150> or<00:04:33.779> to<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.930> plants

00:04:34.429 --> 00:04:34.439 
the environment or to the plants

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:36.769 
the environment or to the plants
themselves<00:04:34.499> I<00:04:35.270> think<00:04:36.270> it's<00:04:36.389> a<00:04:36.479> fair<00:04:36.629> question

00:04:36.769 --> 00:04:36.779 
themselves I think it's a fair question

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:38.269 
themselves I think it's a fair question
to<00:04:37.020> ask<00:04:37.080> and<00:04:37.349> how<00:04:37.499> should<00:04:37.680> this<00:04:37.830> be<00:04:38.009> dealt<00:04:38.219> with

00:04:38.269 --> 00:04:38.279 
to ask and how should this be dealt with

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:39.890 
to ask and how should this be dealt with
should<00:04:38.580> it<00:04:38.669> be<00:04:38.729> dealt<00:04:38.879> with<00:04:38.909> a<00:04:38.999> recall<00:04:39.569> or

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
should it be dealt with a recall or

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.959 
should it be dealt with a recall or
should<00:04:40.499> they<00:04:40.620> just<00:04:40.860> say<00:04:41.159> that<00:04:41.370> well<00:04:41.610> there's

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:41.969 
should they just say that well there's

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:44.540 
should they just say that well there's
no<00:04:42.120> evidence<00:04:42.360> that<00:04:42.689> it's<00:04:43.680> dangerous<00:04:44.009> so<00:04:44.249> let's

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
no evidence that it's dangerous so let's

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.890 
no evidence that it's dangerous so let's
just<00:04:44.669> keep<00:04:44.789> going<00:04:44.849> the<00:04:45.180> way<00:04:45.210> we're<00:04:45.419> going<00:04:45.599> and

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
just keep going the way we're going and

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.839 
just keep going the way we're going and
more<00:04:46.409> research<00:04:46.770> is<00:04:46.949> needed<00:04:46.979> that's<00:04:47.460> probably

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:47.849 
more research is needed that's probably

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:48.980 
more research is needed that's probably
what<00:04:47.999> they're<00:04:48.120> going<00:04:48.210> to<00:04:48.270> do<00:04:48.509> because<00:04:48.719> if<00:04:48.900> they

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
what they're going to do because if they

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.929 
what they're going to do because if they
have<00:04:49.080> to<00:04:49.199> recall<00:04:49.529> everything<00:04:49.830> scallop<00:04:50.550> very

00:04:50.929 --> 00:04:50.939 
have to recall everything scallop very

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:52.909 
have to recall everything scallop very
bad<00:04:51.150> for<00:04:51.389> the<00:04:51.419> GMO<00:04:51.930> industry<00:04:52.439> they're<00:04:52.770> not

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
bad for the GMO industry they're not

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.339 
bad for the GMO industry they're not
going<00:04:53.069> to<00:04:53.159> like<00:04:53.310> that<00:04:53.340> at<00:04:53.610> all<00:04:53.960> the<00:04:54.960> fact<00:04:55.229> that

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
going to like that at all the fact that

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:57.529 
going to like that at all the fact that
it's<00:04:55.560> in<00:04:55.710> so<00:04:56.039> many<00:04:56.340> of<00:04:56.550> these<00:04:56.729> crops<00:04:57.090> really

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
it's in so many of these crops really

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:00.320 
it's in so many of these crops really
makes<00:04:57.750> me<00:04:57.930> wonder<00:04:58.169> you<00:04:58.639> know<00:04:59.639> if<00:04:59.939> I<00:05:00.000> could<00:05:00.150> tell

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
makes me wonder you know if I could tell

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.730 
makes me wonder you know if I could tell
you<00:05:00.449> honestly<00:05:00.629> whether<00:05:01.050> this<00:05:01.259> was<00:05:01.409> put<00:05:01.620> in

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
you honestly whether this was put in

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.619 
you honestly whether this was put in
there<00:05:01.830> on<00:05:02.009> purpose<00:05:02.279> and<00:05:02.789> they<00:05:03.360> talking<00:05:03.569> about

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:03.629 
there on purpose and they talking about

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:06.529 
there on purpose and they talking about
how<00:05:03.840> it<00:05:03.960> could<00:05:04.139> maybe<00:05:04.319> umm<00:05:04.759> alter<00:05:05.759> your<00:05:06.240> immune

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539 
how it could maybe umm alter your immune

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.839 
how it could maybe umm alter your immune
system<00:05:06.750> and<00:05:07.229> that<00:05:07.620> this<00:05:07.979> this<00:05:08.250> type<00:05:08.460> of<00:05:08.490> virus

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:08.849 
system and that this this type of virus

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:12.529 
system and that this this type of virus
can<00:05:09.919> maybe<00:05:10.919> make<00:05:11.189> you<00:05:11.370> more<00:05:11.550> susceptible<00:05:11.729> to

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
can maybe make you more susceptible to

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:15.589 
can maybe make you more susceptible to
bacterial<00:05:13.199> infections<00:05:14.300> you<00:05:15.300> know<00:05:15.389> there<00:05:15.569> are

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:15.599 
bacterial infections you know there are

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:17.059 
bacterial infections you know there are
people<00:05:15.930> out<00:05:16.050> there<00:05:16.080> who<00:05:16.319> would<00:05:16.800> like<00:05:17.039> to

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:17.069 
people out there who would like to

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:21.409 
people out there who would like to
depopulate<00:05:17.580> the<00:05:17.939> world<00:05:18.330> and<00:05:19.400> you<00:05:20.400> know<00:05:20.520> a<00:05:20.759> lot

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
depopulate the world and you know a lot

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:22.969 
depopulate the world and you know a lot
of<00:05:21.659> these<00:05:21.810> people<00:05:22.020> are<00:05:22.319> involved<00:05:22.589> with<00:05:22.830> these

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
of these people are involved with these

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:25.219 
of these people are involved with these
huge<00:05:23.219> biotech<00:05:23.939> companies<00:05:24.449> so<00:05:24.749> I<00:05:24.779> wouldn't<00:05:25.110> put

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
huge biotech companies so I wouldn't put

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:28.640 
huge biotech companies so I wouldn't put
it<00:05:25.259> past<00:05:25.529> them<00:05:25.710> to<00:05:25.979> slip<00:05:26.699> some<00:05:26.939> kind<00:05:27.240> of<00:05:27.650> gene

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
it past them to slip some kind of gene

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.249 
it past them to slip some kind of gene
fragment<00:05:29.250> into<00:05:29.430> the<00:05:29.819> crops<00:05:30.419> and<00:05:30.779> then<00:05:30.900> feed

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:31.259 
fragment into the crops and then feed

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:33.260 
fragment into the crops and then feed
them<00:05:31.469> to<00:05:31.620> everyone<00:05:31.860> and<00:05:32.250> and<00:05:32.430> insist<00:05:33.120> that

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
them to everyone and and insist that

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.700 
them to everyone and and insist that
they<00:05:33.389> not<00:05:33.539> be<00:05:33.599> labeled<00:05:34.169> so<00:05:34.289> you<00:05:34.349> don't<00:05:34.500> even

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
they not be labeled so you don't even

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.950 
they not be labeled so you don't even
know<00:05:34.949> if<00:05:35.069> you're<00:05:35.219> getting<00:05:35.430> it<00:05:35.669> or<00:05:35.789> not<00:05:35.960> but

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
know if you're getting it or not but

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.420 
know if you're getting it or not but
this<00:05:37.740> is<00:05:37.800> just<00:05:37.979> whoops<00:05:38.520> this<00:05:38.939> is<00:05:39.060> just<00:05:39.360> another

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
this is just whoops this is just another

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.639 
this is just whoops this is just another
piece<00:05:41.430> of<00:05:41.669> evidence<00:05:41.819> that<00:05:42.360> the<00:05:43.020> GMOs<00:05:43.500> are

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:43.649 
piece of evidence that the GMOs are

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:45.490 
piece of evidence that the GMOs are
dangerous<00:05:44.129> and<00:05:44.250> not<00:05:44.339> to<00:05:44.550> be<00:05:44.669> trusted<00:05:44.879> so

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
dangerous and not to be trusted so

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.439 
dangerous and not to be trusted so
that's<00:05:46.500> the<00:05:46.680> news<00:05:47.279> the<00:05:47.550> good<00:05:47.789> the<00:05:48.029> bad<00:05:48.060> and<00:05:48.419> the
