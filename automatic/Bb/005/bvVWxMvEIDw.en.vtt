00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 sums short he spoke 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.849
 almost flawlessly try 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.400
 cope with nerves and cope with those 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.929
 estimates that got xenia with 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.440
 bucket here you see this season 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.199
 recruited 138 megan and erica to 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.470
 turn out to be measures him need to recruit 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:26.330
 more than 130 inches 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.330
 at the grand prix finals are very often put 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.940
 how shall we say the behavior of the first part 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.250
 totals if a couple rides well then 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.850
 principle judges do not regret putting 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.710
 to rise and in prison before that 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.510
 it's kind of simple here 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.850
 everything is necessary here did not work as it will 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.859
 any there 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.859
 half point and not enough for I sizes 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.750
 compliments season 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.230
 this sphere 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.570
 dashes and element 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.470
 transition right choice made that on 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.470
 well this is a good covenant 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.600
 I honestly will be interested in the game 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.650
 see how the components again 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.300
 will look at these programs 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.140
 I will repeat that I absolutely disagree with 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.140
 short program 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.040
 5 parallel skating here any 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.950
 difficult transitions 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.950
 how no will appreciate very high and 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.889
 here, too , the guys somehow fought 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:26.889
 did not work for frames xenith 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.270
 and 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.830
 and 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.970
 assistant professor grows so fast 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.220
 the pace that now is not fair where the technique 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:12.220
 then the ill-fated cascade in 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.220
 first of course will be higher second all
