00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
footage they showed my months ago but

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.550 
footage they showed my months ago but
yeah<00:01:50.490> this<00:01:50.759> trailer<00:01:51.509> that's<00:01:51.630> my<00:01:51.899> criticism

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
yeah this trailer that's my criticism

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.340 
yeah this trailer that's my criticism
there<00:01:52.680> wasn't<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.460> even<00:01:53.970> if<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.180> was<00:01:54.329> 11<00:01:54.930> action

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
there wasn't it even if it was 11 action

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.560 
there wasn't it even if it was 11 action
sequence<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.369> know<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.670> they<00:01:56.790> film<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.270> far

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
sequence you know that they film so far

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.270 
sequence you know that they film so far
that<00:01:58.020> would<00:01:58.170> have<00:01:58.259> been<00:01:58.290> awesome<00:01:58.500> just<00:01:58.950> one

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
that would have been awesome just one

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.429 
that would have been awesome just one
action<00:01:59.700> sequence<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.899> just<00:02:01.110> looks<00:02:01.290> like<00:02:01.350> a

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
action sequence and it just looks like a

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.469 
action sequence and it just looks like a
courtroom<00:02:01.860> drama<00:02:02.340> rather<00:02:02.670> than<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.909> James<00:02:03.210> Bond

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
courtroom drama rather than a James Bond

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.830 
courtroom drama rather than a James Bond
movie<00:02:03.509> but<00:02:04.049> anyway<00:02:04.380> um<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:05.299> like<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.479> end<00:02:06.659> I

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
movie but anyway um I like the end I

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.999 
movie but anyway um I like the end I
like<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.170> ending<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.649> way<00:02:07.740> they<00:02:07.920> were

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
like the ending the way they were

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.830 
like the ending the way they were

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
why I thought they could have put at

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.410 
why I thought they could have put at
least<00:02:37.620> one<00:02:37.860> or<00:02:38.130> two<00:02:38.160> action<00:02:38.640> sequences<00:02:39.270> in
