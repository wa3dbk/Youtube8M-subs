00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
look around real quick to get out the

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.920 
look around real quick to get out the
frequency<00:01:49.230> is<00:01:49.350> easy<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.830> spin<00:01:50.070> this<00:01:50.280> knob<00:01:50.460> here

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
frequency is easy to spin this knob here

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.590 
frequency is easy to spin this knob here
you<00:01:51.930> can<00:01:52.050> see<00:01:52.260> eighty-eight<00:01:52.770> point<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.450> so<00:01:54.450> it's

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
you can see eighty-eight point a so it's

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.270 
you can see eighty-eight point a so it's
real<00:01:54.840> easy<00:01:55.080> to<00:01:55.260> find<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.860> right<00:01:56.070> frequency

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
real easy to find the right frequency

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
get to the right frequency I can just

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.820 
get to the right frequency I can just
use<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.360> remote<00:03:51.750> which<00:03:52.290> is<00:03:52.500> pretty

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
use the remote which is pretty

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.060 
use the remote which is pretty
convenient<00:03:53.310> um<00:03:53.940> so<00:03:54.540> that's<00:03:54.780> that<00:03:55.260> it's<00:03:55.800> pretty

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
convenient um so that's that it's pretty

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.120 
convenient um so that's that it's pretty
pretty<00:03:56.550> nice<00:03:56.790> it<00:03:57.060> turns<00:03:57.300> any<00:03:57.630> radio<00:03:58.130> basically

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
pretty nice it turns any radio basically

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.820 
pretty nice it turns any radio basically
