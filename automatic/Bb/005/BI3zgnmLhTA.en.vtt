00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.849
 video and yeste how to evolve by 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.900
 friendship in pokémon and gipsy and nothing what 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.900
 we see now 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.870
 we can equip our pokemon the 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.360
 bell object relief and so during the 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.089
 combat our pokemon will increase its 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.420
 friendship level if you level up with 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:48.210
 this object equipped 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.089
 remember that he liked a pokemon does not end 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.159
 weakened in combat because if not 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:55.640
 what it will do is that it will take away the level of 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.640
 friendship 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.010
 to be able to look at the level you have of 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.440
 friendship our pokemon what we can 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.440
 to do is go to this romantic city 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.080
 two 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.979
 look 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.969
 and just in this house that is here 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.250
 the girl right there on the left 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:42.240
 will tell us the level of friendship that has 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.240
 our pokemon 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.030
 and to continue increasing our level 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.890
 the friendship 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.890
 we will highlight this city 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.750
 and in the house that is right here next 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:16.860
 from the center pokemon there is a girl and this 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:20.220
 Girl will give us a massage once a day 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.980
 our pokemon and with this massage what 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.970
 will do that will also increase us the 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.970
 Friendship level 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.750
 and if we go up to mantis citizen in the 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:38.590
 pokemon center there is a seller that he 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.540
 he sells us some objects that are for 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.630
 increase the statistics of our 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.850
 pokemon that are iron proteins 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.250
 calcium fuel and if we give this to 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.300
 our pokemon will also increase us the 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.300
 Friendship level 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.200
 a very easy way for our 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:23.379
 Pokémon increase your level of friendship and 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.110
 evolve faster what do 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:29.290
 I 'm using super training 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.989
 pokemon on this site what they give us are 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.349
 pink bags that are called the sack relax 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.659
 and with these bags if we use it with 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.620
 our pokemon will increase the level 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:42.200
 of friendship 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.989
 and if we increase the statistics of 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.690
 our pokemon to where I have 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.510
 climbed more or less will evolve by 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:54.250
 friendship because I have used this 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:57.330
 method in ibi has evolved in espn 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.120
 having more or less 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:03.360
 super training statistics 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.070
 and when the girl says this phrase to you 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.460
 you see people have so much attachment that you 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:10.680
 accompanies everywhere if he tells you this 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.280
 is that your pokemon is ready to 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.280
 evolve 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.520
 all right 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.759
 there are many people who think that if 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.620
 we use poker I think we 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:30.870
 will increase the friendship level of our 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.840
 Pokemon is totally false because 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.660
 although I fill him with affection of the five 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.700
 hearts will not help 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.590
 and good I hope that it has served you 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.400
 help and see you in the next video 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.400
 goodbye
