what<00:00:22.190> we<00:00:22.370> do<00:00:22.580> is<00:00:22.880> build<00:00:23.090> robots<00:00:23.660> for<00:00:24.140> people

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
what we do is build robots for people

ever<00:00:37.160> seen

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.790 

we<00:00:42.239> have<00:00:42.359> all<00:00:42.570> these<00:00:42.660> different<00:00:42.870> parts<00:00:43.320> which

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
we have all these different parts which

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.279 
we have all these different parts which
clip<00:00:44.160> together<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:45.030> make<00:00:45.179> robots<00:00:45.629> like<00:00:46.109> a

at<00:01:26.340> home<00:01:26.520> right<00:01:26.940> it<00:01:27.390> wasn't<00:01:27.659> made<00:01:27.780> for<00:01:27.810> robots

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
at home right it wasn't made for robots

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.560 
at home right it wasn't made for robots
but<00:01:28.920> now<00:01:29.100> it's<00:01:29.340> used<00:01:29.549> for<00:01:29.610> robots<00:01:30.030> raise<00:01:30.540> your

the accelerometer inside of these allow

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.100 
the accelerometer inside of these allow
you<00:01:36.729> to<00:01:37.000> be<00:01:37.090> able<00:01:37.119> to<00:01:37.330> tilt<00:01:37.570> your<00:01:37.690> head<00:01:37.840> around

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
you to be able to tilt your head around

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.320 
you to be able to tilt your head around
and<00:01:39.010> when<00:01:39.130> you<00:01:39.220> tilt<00:01:39.369> your<00:01:39.430> head<00:01:39.549> around<00:01:39.880> the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
and when you tilt your head around the

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.450 
and when you tilt your head around the
robots<00:01:40.720> head<00:01:40.930> will<00:01:41.080> move<00:01:41.110> to<00:01:41.409> so<00:01:42.220> if<00:01:42.280> you<00:01:42.340> can

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
robots head will move to so if you can

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.890 
robots head will move to so if you can
manage<00:01:42.580> yourself<00:01:42.729> at<00:01:43.180> home<00:01:43.360> or<00:01:43.690> you<00:01:43.720> mad

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
manage yourself at home or you mad

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.330 
manage yourself at home or you mad
yourself<00:01:44.229> in<00:01:44.350> a<00:01:44.409> fire<00:01:44.619> truck<00:01:44.950> and<00:01:45.159> there's<00:01:45.250> a

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
yourself in a fire truck and there's a

yourself in a fire truck and there's a
house<00:01:45.759> or<00:01:45.970> a<00:01:46.000> factory<00:01:46.330> on<00:01:46.420> fire<00:01:46.690> need<00:01:46.930> to

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
house or a factory on fire need to

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:48.420 
house or a factory on fire need to
control<00:01:47.380> it<00:01:47.590> you're<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:48.009> robot<00:01:48.310> you're

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
control it you're the robot you're

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.920 
control it you're the robot you're
walking<00:01:48.850> through<00:01:48.880> you<00:01:49.450> be<00:01:49.540> able<00:01:49.630> to<00:01:49.720> wear<00:01:49.900> a

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
walking through you be able to wear a

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.170 
walking through you be able to wear a
set<00:01:50.170> of<00:01:50.259> glasses<00:01:50.409> like<00:01:50.740> this<00:01:50.979> you<00:01:51.399> augmented

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
set of glasses like this you augmented

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.660 
set of glasses like this you augmented
reality<00:01:52.659> you<00:01:53.110> become<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.649> robot<00:01:53.979> isn't<00:01:54.490> that

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
reality you become the robot isn't that

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.730 
reality you become the robot isn't that
I<00:01:54.700> need<00:01:54.880> go<00:01:55.270> and<00:01:55.420> look<00:01:55.479> at<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:55.659> robot<00:01:55.990> don't

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
I need go and look at the robot don't

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.970 
I need go and look at the robot don't
look<00:01:56.860> at<00:01:56.979> the<00:01:57.040> robot<00:01:57.369> look<00:01:57.490> at<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:57.640> screen
