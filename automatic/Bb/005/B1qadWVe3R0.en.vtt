00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.659
 i 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.010
 hello very good everyone here roche gÃ³mez 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.810
 and today the truth is that I bring you a mod 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.329
 that the truth has been enough for me 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.039
 they are very good is pretty funny and the 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:31.130
 truth is that it is very useful especially 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:34.400
 for decoration and it's just based 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:38.360
 in making statues because the amount 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.339
 I have it open, it's not worth it here 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.019
 we should leave the link as always and the 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:44.930
 truth is that it is very well you can 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.400
 we can do here already in the 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.110
 structure there is the structure of the 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.690
 statue but good as I am pretty 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.719
 without square and all that, I'm going to take 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.579
 two blocks of land itself can be 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.590
 make any material now you 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.310
 I will teach more there were here we have the 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.050
 hammers that 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.140
 this is the hammer with which he 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.950
 sculpts that his kraft eo is this two 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:11.010
 sticks and iron bars so this 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.180
 way and then we also have a 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.280
 thing that has escaped me that has 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.960
 disappeared that is this that is the 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.670
 palette that now I will show you why 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.050
 serves we give you right click and as 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.480
 you can see I already have my nick name and 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.520
 that I did not want him to appear well here and 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.700
 now I will explain it here how to move 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.520
 hands and I do not know that the hand and the foot and 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.830
 the head and the other foot and if we put 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.200
 random and this randomized will move as 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.760
 you get the same one and here we put 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.760
 the link of any player minecraft 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:42.360
 technically your skin will come out 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.390
 example the fear me 35 m 35 and I leave 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.710
 this is me let's check it 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.630
 this is me and instead I have tried 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.909
 for example because maybe it vegetates or 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.100
 willy you want this mod because it is 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.140
 true the truth quite handsome to 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.820
 have it at home in diamond after 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.150
 you will see that you can colors but the 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.240
 truth is that 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.310
 it does not go out its corner it looks like it goes and it comes out 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.660
 others that I impose time and leave another 15 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:15.190
 but when I put old age is there 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.600
 vegeta 777 does not leave its vegeta corner I've 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.000
 thought that maybe he will subscribe old man 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.800
 gamer or something like that but neither comes out and 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.420
 well I tried a thousand ways the truth 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.310
 is that it has not come out and now it comes out 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.530
 Well, I just got out of 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.310
 vegeta I just left the vegeta 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.740
 we give school 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.650
 if we now shift 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.200
 it is colored and this really have it 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.390
 at home he is very cool very handsome me 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.130
 The skin of vegeta and good has just come out 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.350
 Well look is the truth is that it is a 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.000
 solid piece can not be traversed is not 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.730
 there is minecraft book the truth that 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.090
 can go over and is in the sea 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.720
 of pimp and the truth is that yes 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.000
 I like it a lot and apart from this 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.540
 as you can see also if we click 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.080
 right to what this is called pallet 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.080
 what is done 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.639
 it was made without green trulli dye pencil and 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.709
 pink tint because if we give the click 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.120
 right without the shift this is going to come out 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.159
 which is to put you look I put a 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.620
 tool and have a tool 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.879
 team is this and that if we want the 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.230
 tool to bach the one who has it 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:21.689
 below then take up here with a 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.920
 cabaret type cane now no old age is 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:27.629
 doing cabaret if we do not care and good 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.639
 after this with left click 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.129
 I guess it's removed anywhere 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:33.030
 It can be made of all materials 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:35.819
 truly if we want to make it from 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.400
 you can make sand 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.989
 I'm going to find a place where I arrived 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.540
 here I think there are two we do it from 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.470
 arena mira es vegeta again 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:49.250
 let's put another pose is 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.780
 and as you can see it is like that and there are all 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.140
 possible materials the truth is that 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.040
 this one is very cool the mod then to me 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.349
 I really like it 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.780
 today I do not know why I have removed it now 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:06.150
 It's a shame I'm a fan of vegeta and for 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:07.769
 I do that, nothing else does not appear to me 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.510
 interesting vote and what is and vegeta of 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.480
 this video, maybe you might be interested 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.920
 Well guys that's not all is not all 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.359
 because apart from this mode I think it has 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.459
 the least interesting I leave it for the 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:19.799
 end that for I'm going to catch a sword 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.829
 a diamond sword itself that will remain 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.829
 all right 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.240
 I'm going to take this we put it here and if 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.690
 you take the father diamond right click and 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:33.120
 you put it here and it's saved here as if 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.570
 technically this has been saved 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:40.390
 technically so it looks like it was like a 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.650
 pp to this is as loose or not 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.800
 technically you would have to see 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.460
 perfectly thing I do not know why 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.460
 now I do not know but 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.700
 good as you can see I do not know if you have 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.080
 seen at some point now you see a 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.480
 little but technically it has to be 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.090
 here exposed very well should be a little 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.500
 what's wrong with my computer 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.330
 well guys, the truth is that this 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.040
 yes that's all you can do so many 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.960
 statues as you want of materials is 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.360
 say let's go to blocks and all of these 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.680
 blocks I think it can be done we're going to 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.070
 make one of gold that is one that is going to 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.070
 look good 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:20.229
