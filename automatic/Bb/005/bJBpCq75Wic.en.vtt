00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
that just continues to improve and can

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.160

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
score a lot of different ways I think

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.569 
score a lot of different ways I think

and we've got to go in and we've got to

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.170 
and we've got to go in and we've got to
make<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.290> game<00:02:19.470> go<00:02:19.650> our<00:02:19.769> way<00:02:19.950> as<00:02:20.700> far<00:02:20.909> as<00:02:20.939> pace

make the game go our way as far as pace

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:32.270 
make the game go our way as far as pace
goes<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:21.959> go<00:02:22.110> ahead<00:02:22.170> oh<00:02:30.980> I<00:02:31.980> think<00:02:32.159> it's

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
goes so go ahead oh I think it's

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.800 
goes so go ahead oh I think it's
important<00:02:32.730> I<00:02:32.849> think<00:02:33.060> it's<00:02:33.180> very<00:02:33.209> important<00:02:33.720> I

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
important I think it's very important I

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.979 
important I think it's very important I
think<00:02:33.870> it's<00:02:34.620> crucial<00:02:35.069> that<00:02:35.629> they<00:02:36.629> have<00:02:36.810> that

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
think it's crucial that they have that

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.210 
think it's crucial that they have that
because<00:02:37.140> of<00:02:37.349> the<00:02:37.379> way<00:02:37.530> that<00:02:37.680> we<00:02:37.799> want<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:38.129> mean

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
because of the way that we want I mean

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.130 
because of the way that we want I mean
this<00:02:38.340> team<00:02:38.579> needs<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.939> be<00:02:39.030> in<00:02:39.269> some<00:02:39.450> fights<00:02:39.689> we

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
this team needs to be in some fights we

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.770 
this team needs to be in some fights we
said<00:02:40.319> that<00:02:40.439> after<00:02:40.769> the<00:02:40.950> after<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.430> game<00:02:41.780> to

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
said that after the after the game to

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.780 
said that after the after the game to
them<00:02:42.959> we've<00:02:43.349> been<00:02:43.470> in<00:02:43.620> some<00:02:43.769> fights<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:44.609> in

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
them we've been in some fights and it in

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.289 
them we've been in some fights and it in
the<00:02:45.060> only<00:02:45.299> way<00:02:45.389> you<00:02:45.450> can<00:02:45.690> really<00:02:45.750> learn<00:02:46.139> to<00:02:46.440> win

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
the only way you can really learn to win

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.629 
the only way you can really learn to win
consistently<00:02:48.299> in<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.810> league<00:02:48.989> like<00:02:49.170> this<00:02:49.440> is<00:02:49.650> to

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.639 
consistently in a league like this is to

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.930 
consistently in a league like this is to
find<00:02:50.909> your<00:02:51.359> way<00:02:51.510> through<00:02:51.690> it<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.769> I<00:02:53.129> think

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
find your way through it and and I think

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.250 
find your way through it and and I think
it<00:02:54.209> was<00:02:54.299> really<00:02:54.450> important<00:02:54.840> I<00:02:54.900> think<00:02:54.959> it<00:02:55.109> gave

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
it was really important I think it gave

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:06.890 
it was really important I think it gave
him<00:02:55.379> confidence<00:03:03.530> i<00:03:04.530> think<00:03:05.010> i<00:03:05.159> think<00:03:05.900> biggest

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
him confidence i think i think biggest

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.410 
him confidence i think i think biggest
things<00:03:07.109> are<00:03:07.409> you<00:03:08.280> know<00:03:08.370> when<00:03:08.879> can<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.150> put<00:03:09.299> the

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
things are you know when can you put the

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.210 
things are you know when can you put the
game<00:03:09.569> away<00:03:09.599> I<00:03:10.049> think<00:03:10.650> it's<00:03:10.799> something<00:03:11.010> that

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
game away I think it's something that

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.240 
game away I think it's something that
we've<00:03:11.370> really<00:03:11.639> tried<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.879> focus<00:03:12.060> on<00:03:13.250> when

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
we've really tried to focus on when

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.339 
we've really tried to focus on when
could<00:03:14.430> we<00:03:14.459> have<00:03:14.639> done<00:03:14.760> something<00:03:15.209> better<00:03:15.419> in

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
could we have done something better in

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.309 
could we have done something better in
this<00:03:16.680> possession<00:03:17.069> or<00:03:17.370> that<00:03:17.489> possession<00:03:18.319> when

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
this possession or that possession when

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.860 
this possession or that possession when
did<00:03:19.410> we<00:03:19.560> settle<00:03:19.829> when<00:03:20.160> did<00:03:20.310> we<00:03:20.430> attack<00:03:20.790> I<00:03:21.150> think

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
did we settle when did we attack I think

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.449 
did we settle when did we attack I think
those<00:03:22.079> are<00:03:22.109> really<00:03:22.500> important<00:03:23.040> things<00:03:23.250> I

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
those are really important things I

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.000 
those are really important things I
think<00:03:23.699> learning<00:03:23.910> from<00:03:24.419> the<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:25.349> situation's

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
think learning from the the situation's

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.649 
think learning from the the situation's
of<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.340> game<00:03:26.519> you<00:03:26.790> know<00:03:26.879> the<00:03:26.970> game<00:03:27.150> is<00:03:27.180> so<00:03:27.480> many

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659 
of the game you know the game is so many

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.539 
of the game you know the game is so many
different<00:03:27.870> situations<00:03:28.199> in<00:03:28.799> it<00:03:28.919> and<00:03:29.099> a<00:03:29.129> little

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
different situations in it and a little

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.420 
different situations in it and a little
bit<00:03:29.669> at<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.790> end<00:03:29.909> with<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.239> press<00:03:30.510> offense<00:03:30.989> in

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
bit at the end with the press offense in

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.550 
bit at the end with the press offense in
what<00:03:32.430> who<00:03:32.699> do<00:03:32.819> we<00:03:32.909> want<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.209> hit<00:03:33.389> and<00:03:33.599> and<00:03:34.290> what

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
what who do we want to hit and and what

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.050 
what who do we want to hit and and what
do<00:03:34.680> we<00:03:34.769> want<00:03:34.949> to<00:03:35.040> get<00:03:35.129> out<00:03:35.280> of<00:03:35.310> it<00:03:35.489> and<00:03:35.699> we'd

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
do we want to get out of it and we'd

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.720 
do we want to get out of it and we'd
worked<00:03:36.299> hard<00:03:36.629> going<00:03:37.560> into<00:03:37.980> that<00:03:38.129> and<00:03:38.370> I<00:03:38.519> think

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
worked hard going into that and I think

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:39.979 
worked hard going into that and I think
that's<00:03:38.879> something<00:03:39.060> that<00:03:39.180> we<00:03:39.299> can<00:03:39.480> continue<00:03:39.870> to

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
that's something that we can continue to

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.899 
that's something that we can continue to
work<00:03:40.169> very<00:03:40.409> hard<00:03:40.739> on<00:03:41.069> you<00:03:41.400> know<00:03:41.579> for<00:03:41.760> each

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:41.909 
work very hard on you know for each

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:43.819 
work very hard on you know for each
individual<00:03:42.419> game<00:03:42.659> but<00:03:42.900> just<00:03:43.109> helps<00:03:43.500> make<00:03:43.709> you

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
individual game but just helps make you

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:50.240 
individual game but just helps make you
better<00:03:44.780> over<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:45.870> long<00:03:46.019> haul<00:03:46.079> i<00:03:46.379> think<00:03:49.099> we<00:03:50.099> can

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
better over the long haul i think we can

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.729 
better over the long haul i think we can
always<00:03:50.519> get<00:03:50.699> the<00:03:50.819> ball<00:03:51.199> reverse<00:03:52.199> better<00:03:52.500> i

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
always get the ball reverse better i

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.469 
always get the ball reverse better i
think<00:03:53.099> that's<00:03:53.250> something<00:03:53.459> that<00:03:53.639> we've<00:03:54.150> that

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:54.479 
think that's something that we've that

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:57.860 
think that's something that we've that
we've<00:03:54.540> worked<00:03:54.659> hard<00:03:54.959> on<00:03:55.199> and<00:03:55.470> and<00:03:56.159> and<00:03:56.870> we're

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
we've worked hard on and and and we're

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.509 
we've worked hard on and and and we're
certainly<00:03:58.199> not<00:03:58.260> I<00:03:58.620> mean<00:03:58.799> we<00:03:58.919> want<00:03:59.099> our<00:03:59.220> we<00:03:59.370> want

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
certainly not I mean we want our we want

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.250 
certainly not I mean we want our we want
to<00:03:59.609> score<00:03:59.879> we<00:04:00.239> want<00:04:00.419> to<00:04:00.540> we<00:04:00.690> want<00:04:00.720> to<00:04:00.959> score

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
to score we want to we want to score

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.809 
to score we want to we want to score
we're<00:04:01.530> not<00:04:01.650> trying<00:04:01.889> to<00:04:02.040> get<00:04:02.190> it<00:04:02.280> down<00:04:02.400> into<00:04:02.699> the

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
we're not trying to get it down into the

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.670 
we're not trying to get it down into the
shot<00:04:03.000> clock<00:04:03.269> I<00:04:03.540> think<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.349> more<00:04:04.470> that<00:04:04.530> we

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
shot clock I think the more that we

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.589 
shot clock I think the more that we
trust<00:04:04.949> the<00:04:05.069> reversals<00:04:05.519> the<00:04:05.669> better<00:04:05.849> we<00:04:06.030> are<00:04:06.209> so

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
trust the reversals the better we are so

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.769 
trust the reversals the better we are so
that's<00:04:06.780> something<00:04:06.989> that<00:04:07.079> we<00:04:07.260> learn<00:04:07.409> from<00:04:07.620> it
