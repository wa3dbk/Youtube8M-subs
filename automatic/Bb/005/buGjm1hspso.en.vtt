that bit you pull down that's their part

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.440 
that bit you pull down that's their part
of<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.130> nail<00:02:24.280> there<00:02:24.610> was<00:02:24.730> it<00:02:24.910> that<00:02:25.209> was<00:02:25.299> the

copper the nail bed pulling here that's

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.410 
copper the nail bed pulling here that's
the<00:02:29.739> factory<00:02:30.160> which<00:02:30.340> make<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.940> nail<00:02:31.090> on<00:02:31.120> this

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
the factory which make the nail on this

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.009 
the factory which make the nail on this
side<00:02:31.630> so<00:02:31.900> we<00:02:32.230> take<00:02:32.440> it<00:02:32.560> off<00:02:32.799> is<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:34.570> germinal

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
side so we take it off is the germinal

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.949 
side so we take it off is the germinal
matrix<00:02:35.100> let's<00:02:36.100> go<00:02:36.370> so<00:02:37.239> that<00:02:37.420> we<00:02:37.600> won't<00:02:37.720> have

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
matrix let's go so that we won't have

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.270 
matrix let's go so that we won't have
antenna<00:02:38.320> so<00:02:38.670> if<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:39.820> do<00:02:39.940> times<00:02:40.239> tables<00:02:41.280> you

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
antenna so if you do times tables you

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.069 
antenna so if you do times tables you
have<00:02:42.430> three<00:02:42.549> times<00:02:42.760> tables<00:02:43.180> so<00:02:43.780> you<00:02:43.870> can't

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
have three times tables so you can't

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:52.410 
have three times tables so you can't
tell<00:02:44.260> me<00:02:44.290> what<00:02:44.470> three<00:02:44.680> times<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:45.160> us<00:02:51.420> cowering

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
tell me what three times to us cowering

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:00.299 
tell me what three times to us cowering
in<00:02:52.600> are<00:02:53.320> you<00:02:53.470> good<00:02:53.620> at<00:02:53.650> it<00:02:57.060> here's<00:02:58.060> I'm
