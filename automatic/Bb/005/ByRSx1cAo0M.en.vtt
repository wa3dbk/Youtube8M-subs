00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:51.030 

this<00:00:46.489> is<00:00:46.640> how<00:00:47.350> you<00:00:48.350> never<00:00:48.590> get<00:00:48.860> it<00:00:49.010> to<00:00:49.329> a<00:00:50.329> proper

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
this is how you never get it to a proper

00:00:51.040 --> 00:01:38.670 
this is how you never get it to a proper
treatment

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:02:57.440 

not<00:01:39.680> much<00:01:39.830> fun

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.970 

that<00:02:58.450> could<00:02:58.690> if<00:02:58.810> you<00:02:58.900> don't<00:02:59.050> have<00:02:59.230> it<00:02:59.350> set<00:02:59.560> and

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
that could if you don't have it set and

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.410 
that could if you don't have it set and
the<00:03:00.220> reason<00:03:00.490> I<00:03:00.550> didn't<00:03:00.730> do<00:03:00.819> too<00:03:01.030> much<00:03:01.060> else

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
the reason I didn't do too much else

the reason I didn't do too much else
with<00:03:01.540> this<00:03:01.720> is<00:03:01.870> it's<00:03:02.319> very<00:03:02.380> hard<00:03:02.709> switch<00:03:03.190> to

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
with this is it's very hard switch to

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
with this is it's very hard switch to
getting<00:03:03.610> a<00:03:03.700> deal<00:03:03.910> to<00:03:04.090> be<00:03:04.209> made
