00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.540
 the term derogation pharma giulio dolphin 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.799
 2 to 0 for the Giallorossi first goal then 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.799
 of lamela or not 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.670
 apart from the fact that I had seen that he was a 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.960
 divert 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.510
 real but then 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.440
 I saw his race 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.310
 also to macerated 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.480
 in conclusion 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.480
 it seems to me that it is on montoya 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.680
 when the speaker said 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.950
 organized from the wrong one 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.420
 fix it done 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.090
 you also told me live 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.130
 students to help in some ways more 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.260
 written by reporters from baptize 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.970
 immediately, indeed, of the way in which Anna arrived 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.950
 the two players because florenzi I don't have 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.860
 seen a lot 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.329
 load I left 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.070
 I applaud her 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.900
 it was clear he had not adopted 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.600
 no doubt instead on the second goal of 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.489
 totti that has reached 226 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.150
 we saw a sort of standing 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.150
 ovation 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.059
 su totti is certain 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.840
 an extraordinary player 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.880
 he deserved 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.270
 crazy condition that struck 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.000
 the crossing of the poles 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.550
 the inner part will have 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.900
 however unlucky 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.090
 beyond that he made a run 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.429
 a very gender match 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.770
 of run-up to the adversaries as well as 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:23.509
 perrotta if you think it is 37 years old 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.350
 perrotta 35 I think in the end 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.360
 statistically 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.380
 along with provenzano course of more than 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.689
 this game then 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.000
 down the hat to the professionalism of 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:36.230
 totti beyond goals and goals 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.150
 numbers is the commitment of the 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.390
 I put myself in the field 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.310
 and that precisely serves as an example a 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.650
 I don't know who follows this player 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.390
 the best material teammates 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.090
 in the field of the parma we can say that it is 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.220
 goal keeper was caught two goals 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.890
 but however in the life of at least others 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.900
 four then helped by a pinch of 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.240
 luck also on the traverses hit by 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.890
 perrotta and totti however done that aiming 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.810
 it was 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.310
 in the field shows that the Rome has 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.110
 deserved the victory yet despite 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.090
 all year but you risk decided of 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.229
 draw that when not more than the 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.310
 games 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.770
 and the opponent does not sleep standing up 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.150
 parma risked at least 2 3 times of di 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.970
 reach a draw but above all 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.090
 I'm 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.330
 clamorous stekelenburg duck 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.370
 however, we invite you in the evening and then a wood 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.230
 where the bar also took this thing 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.349
 of the course of the evenings however to the 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.459
 end grade result is both right 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.459
 impression on donadoni's team 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.960
 let's say it was 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.400
 so a green star san siro attacked by 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.140
 some start from Rome 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.300
 they managed to do little but then they are 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.790
 were good at 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.680
 in believing in the possibility of being able to 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.409
 make the coup by equalizing why 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.909
 after that risk of suffering three goals and 4 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:55.459
 goal in the first half you find yourself in 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:55.459
 game and you have the ability to believe it 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.370
 let's say that 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.140
 with the draw he would have no tale 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.130
 then deserved though 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.510
 he tried and this shows 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.690
 the part is also very clever 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.690
