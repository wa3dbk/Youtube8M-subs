00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
didn't know he was a Celtic by the way

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.390 
didn't know he was a Celtic by the way
until<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.400> told<00:00:23.609> me<00:00:24.439> and<00:00:25.439> sort<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.279> the

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
until you told me and sort of the

until you told me and sort of the
history<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:26.820> Arizona's<00:00:27.330> early<00:00:27.599> entries<00:00:28.019> as<00:00:28.380> we

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
history of Arizona's early entries as we

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.939 
history of Arizona's early entries as we
stare<00:00:29.010> down<00:00:29.279> at<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.910> 2014<00:00:30.630> NBA<00:00:31.199> Draft<00:00:31.650> where

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
stare down at the 2014 NBA Draft where

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.360 
stare down at the 2014 NBA Draft where
do<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.669> see<00:00:33.210> Nick<00:00:33.420> Johnson<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.649> Aaron

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
do you see Nick Johnson and and Aaron

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.910 
do you see Nick Johnson and and Aaron
Gordon<00:00:35.550> fitting<00:00:36.000> in<00:00:36.120> there<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.739> think<00:00:37.739> like

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
Gordon fitting in there I think like

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.290 
Gordon fitting in there I think like
most<00:00:38.100> people<00:00:38.460> Nick<00:00:38.640> Johnson's<00:00:39.000> going<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.180> be<00:00:39.270> a

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
most people Nick Johnson's going to be a

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.750 
most people Nick Johnson's going to be a
second-round<00:00:39.780> pick<00:00:39.960> late<00:00:40.200> second-round

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
second-round pick late second-round

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.740 
second-round pick late second-round
probably<00:00:41.760> wind<00:00:41.910> up<00:00:42.030> playing<00:00:42.180> at<00:00:42.360> Europe<00:00:42.600> next

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
probably wind up playing at Europe next

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.020 
probably wind up playing at Europe next
year<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:44.190> think<00:00:44.399> Aaron<00:00:44.640> Gordon<00:00:44.760> will<00:00:45.000> go

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
year and I think Aaron Gordon will go

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.060 
year and I think Aaron Gordon will go
tan<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.510> go<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.809> 14th<00:00:46.440> or<00:00:46.559> somewhere<00:00:46.890> like<00:00:46.920> that

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
tan to go to 14th or somewhere like that

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.770 
tan to go to 14th or somewhere like that
maybe<00:00:47.789> when<00:00:47.969> they<00:00:48.059> get<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.239> look<00:00:48.390> at<00:00:48.570> him<00:00:48.690> and

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
maybe when they get a look at him and

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.299 
maybe when they get a look at him and
see<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.170> he<00:00:49.260> doesn't<00:00:49.469> have<00:00:49.590> any<00:00:49.800> offensive

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
see that he doesn't have any offensive

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.889 
see that he doesn't have any offensive
game<00:00:50.489> he'll<00:00:50.700> even<00:00:50.850> drop<00:00:51.120> more<00:00:51.329> out<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
game he'll even drop more out of the

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.660 
game he'll even drop more out of the
lottery<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.710> wouldn't<00:00:53.100> be<00:00:53.160> surprised<00:00:53.520> at<00:00:53.640> that

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
lottery I wouldn't be surprised at that

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.069 
lottery I wouldn't be surprised at that
would<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:53.969> know<00:00:54.420> but<00:00:54.629> if<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.809> look<00:00:54.960> at<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
would you know but if you look at the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.529 
would you know but if you look at the
tools<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.500> he<00:00:55.649> has<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:56.190> my<00:00:56.670> guesses<00:00:56.879> most<00:00:57.210> NBA

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
tools that he has to my guesses most NBA

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.590 
tools that he has to my guesses most NBA
franchises<00:00:58.109> are<00:00:58.469> perhaps<00:00:59.600> egotistical

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
franchises are perhaps egotistical

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.049 
franchises are perhaps egotistical
enough<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.170> say<00:01:01.800> hey<00:01:02.010> we<00:01:02.219> can<00:01:02.370> build<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:02.910> guy

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
enough to say hey we can build this guy

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.939 
enough to say hey we can build this guy
to<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.239> superstar<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:04.019> mean<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.530> comparison

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
to a superstar I mean the comparison

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.530 
to a superstar I mean the comparison
I've<00:01:05.129> always<00:01:05.489> heard<00:01:05.790> what<00:01:05.970> they're<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.210> Gordon

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
I've always heard what they're in Gordon

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.420 
I've always heard what they're in Gordon
and<00:01:06.689> maybe<00:01:06.840> it's<00:01:07.020> apt<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.740> know<00:01:07.860> he<00:01:08.189> is

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
and maybe it's apt is you know he is

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.050 
and maybe it's apt is you know he is
Blake<00:01:08.729> Griffin<00:01:09.229> but<00:01:10.229> he's<00:01:10.350> not<00:01:10.880> he's<00:01:11.880> not<00:01:11.909> a

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
Blake Griffin but he's not he's not a

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.300 
Blake Griffin but he's not he's not a
power<00:01:12.299> player<00:01:12.689> he<00:01:12.869> never<00:01:13.049> will<00:01:13.290> be<00:01:13.470> yeah<00:01:13.650> he's

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
power player he never will be yeah he's

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.090 
power player he never will be yeah he's
a<00:01:14.340> kangaroo<00:01:15.000> yeah<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:16.049> think<00:01:16.409> he's<00:01:16.710> he's<00:01:17.070> a

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
a kangaroo yeah and I think he's he's a

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.370 
a kangaroo yeah and I think he's he's a
hybrid<00:01:17.549> player<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.360> somebody's<00:01:19.200> going<00:01:19.320> to

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
hybrid player and somebody's going to

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.350 
hybrid player and somebody's going to
get<00:01:19.500> seduced<00:01:19.860> by<00:01:20.070> him<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.880> they'll<00:01:21.119> take<00:01:21.330> him

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
get seduced by him and they'll take him

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.320 
get seduced by him and they'll take him
I<00:01:21.780> still<00:01:22.740> think<00:01:22.950> will<00:01:23.070> be<00:01:23.159> 10<00:01:23.460> or<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:23.790> well<00:01:24.270> the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
I still think will be 10 or so well the

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.550 
I still think will be 10 or so well the
names<00:01:24.540> he<00:01:24.689> mentioned<00:01:25.049> when<00:01:25.170> he<00:01:25.259> went<00:01:25.439> back

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
names he mentioned when he went back

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.170 
names he mentioned when he went back
through<00:01:25.950> kind<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.640> history<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.030> early

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
through kind of the history of early

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.020 
through kind of the history of early
entries<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.810> pac<00:01:27.990> 10<00:01:28.259> /<00:01:28.680> pac-12<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.700> really

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
entries in the pac 10 / pac-12 is really

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.969 
entries in the pac 10 / pac-12 is really
only<00:01:30.150> two<00:01:30.450> guys<00:01:30.630> could<00:01:30.930> be<00:01:31.049> called<00:01:31.290> busts

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
only two guys could be called busts

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.819 
only two guys could be called busts
probably<00:01:32.939> tell<00:01:33.689> me<00:01:33.780> about<00:01:33.869> those<00:01:34.049> guys<00:01:34.290> from

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
probably tell me about those guys from

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.819 
probably tell me about those guys from
Arizona<00:01:35.310> yeah<00:01:35.909> well<00:01:36.869> jerryd<00:01:37.229> bayless<00:01:37.259> I

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
Arizona yeah well jerryd bayless I

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.490 
Arizona yeah well jerryd bayless I
thought<00:01:38.430> he<00:01:38.640> had<00:01:38.670> lottery<00:01:39.210> potential<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.229> NBA

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
thought he had lottery potential and NBA

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.830 
thought he had lottery potential and NBA
all-star<00:01:41.009> game<00:01:41.189> potential<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.820> did<00:01:42.060> yeah<00:01:42.329> but

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
all-star game potential I did yeah but

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.450 
all-star game potential I did yeah but
apparently<00:01:43.259> he's<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.409> man<00:01:43.649> without<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.979> position

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
apparently he's a man without a position

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.440 
apparently he's a man without a position

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
and so that's hurt him he's five teams

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.389 
and so that's hurt him he's five teams
in<00:01:48.570> six<00:01:48.840> years<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.170> kidding<00:01:49.470> me<00:01:49.500> he's<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.100> free

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
in six years you kidding me he's a free

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.740 
in six years you kidding me he's a free
agent<00:01:50.430> but<00:01:51.030> I'm<00:01:51.090> not<00:01:51.270> going<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.450> get<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> lot<00:01:51.720> of

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
agent but I'm not going to get a lot of

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.469 
agent but I'm not going to get a lot of
money<00:01:51.990> in<00:01:52.439> relative<00:01:53.280> terms<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.939> mva<00:01:54.180> I

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
money in relative terms to the mva I

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.080 
money in relative terms to the mva I
thought<00:01:55.140> he<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.590> wouldn't<00:01:56.549> call<00:01:56.640> him<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.880> bus

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
thought he I wouldn't call him a bus

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.240 
thought he I wouldn't call him a bus
though<00:01:57.299> yeah<00:01:57.630> if<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.380> look<00:01:58.560> at<00:01:58.680> Nick<00:01:58.860> Johnson

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
though yeah if you look at Nick Johnson

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.429 
though yeah if you look at Nick Johnson
and<00:01:59.430> Jerryd<00:01:59.759> Bayless<00:01:59.790> to<00:02:00.719> me<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:00.990> seems<00:02:01.200> as<00:02:01.320> if

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
and Jerryd Bayless to me it seems as if

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.569 
and Jerryd Bayless to me it seems as if
jerryd<00:02:01.740> bayless<00:02:01.770> was<00:02:02.189> probably<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.490> better

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
jerryd bayless was probably a better

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.910 
jerryd bayless was probably a better
college<00:02:02.969> player<00:02:03.180> right<00:02:03.719> but<00:02:04.350> Nick<00:02:04.530> Johnson

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
college player right but Nick Johnson

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.499 
college player right but Nick Johnson
has<00:02:05.130> maybe<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.700> leaping<00:02:06.030> ability<00:02:06.240> that

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
has maybe the leaping ability that

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.300 
has maybe the leaping ability that
Bayless<00:02:06.869> lacked<00:02:07.170> how<00:02:07.920> would<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.160> compare

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
Bayless lacked how would you compare

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.219 
Bayless lacked how would you compare
those<00:02:08.610> two<00:02:08.879> when<00:02:09.450> you're<00:02:09.569> sizing<00:02:09.810> up<00:02:10.020> kind<00:02:10.200> of

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
those two when you're sizing up kind of

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.350 
those two when you're sizing up kind of
their<00:02:10.349> NBA<00:02:10.500> potential<00:02:11.160> Bayless<00:02:11.819> was<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.000> score

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360
