00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:08.860 
time for spring honey harvest it's early

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.910 
time for spring honey harvest it's early
July<00:00:09.190> nice<00:00:09.670> cool<00:00:09.940> day<00:00:10.150> today<00:00:10.360> so<00:00:10.800> this<00:00:11.800> would

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:11.920 
July nice cool day today so this would

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.369 
July nice cool day today so this would
be<00:00:12.040> a<00:00:12.070> great<00:00:12.370> day<00:00:12.550> to<00:00:12.629> take<00:00:13.629> the<00:00:13.809> supers<00:00:14.200> off

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:14.379 
be a great day to take the supers off

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:17.640 
be a great day to take the supers off
and<00:00:16.020> see<00:00:17.020> what<00:00:17.170> we<00:00:17.260> get

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
and see what we get

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.560 
and see what we get
I<00:00:17.680> think<00:00:18.310> it's<00:00:18.430> going<00:00:18.580> to<00:00:18.610> be<00:00:18.789> a<00:00:18.820> good<00:00:19.090> season

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
I think it's going to be a good season

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.880 
I think it's going to be a good season
because<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:21.070> field<00:00:21.520> here<00:00:21.790> has<00:00:22.000> not<00:00:22.210> been<00:00:22.270> cut

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
because the field here has not been cut

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.770 
because the field here has not been cut
so<00:00:23.890> the<00:00:24.010> bees<00:00:24.190> have<00:00:24.520> had<00:00:24.700> lots<00:00:25.000> of<00:00:26.190> foraging

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:27.780 
so the bees have had lots of foraging

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:35.229 
so the bees have had lots of foraging
opportunities

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.299 

all<00:00:35.989> right<00:00:36.110> let's<00:00:36.320> see<00:00:36.470> what's<00:00:36.680> going<00:00:36.980> on<00:00:37.070> here

these together these are tight I'm going
to<00:01:58.909> use<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.240> honey<00:01:59.539> refractometer<00:02:00.170> to<00:02:00.619> check

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
to use the honey refractometer to check

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.670 
to use the honey refractometer to check
the<00:02:00.979> moisture<00:02:01.399> content<00:02:01.549> of<00:02:02.090> this<00:02:02.330> harvest<00:02:02.720> I'm

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
the moisture content of this harvest I'm

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.490 
the moisture content of this harvest I'm
only<00:02:03.890> doing<00:02:04.189> it<00:02:04.250> out<00:02:04.399> of<00:02:04.520> curiosity<00:02:04.700> I<00:02:05.500> trust

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
only doing it out of curiosity I trust

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.979 
only doing it out of curiosity I trust
the<00:02:06.649> bees<00:02:06.830> that<00:02:07.420> once<00:02:08.420> they've<00:02:08.600> capped<00:02:08.840> the

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
the bees that once they've capped the

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.330 
the bees that once they've capped the
honey<00:02:09.170> it's<00:02:09.560> at<00:02:09.739> the<00:02:09.860> proper<00:02:10.190> moisture

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
honey it's at the proper moisture

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.420 
honey it's at the proper moisture
content<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.330> moisture<00:02:11.720> content<00:02:12.200> of<00:02:12.500> the

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
content the moisture content of the

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.479 
content the moisture content of the
honey<00:02:13.580> can<00:02:13.790> vary<00:02:14.090> from<00:02:15.069> from<00:02:16.069> cell<00:02:16.310> to<00:02:16.340> cell

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
honey can vary from from cell to cell

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.940 
honey can vary from from cell to cell
from<00:02:17.180> frame<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:17.569> frame<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:18.319> certainly<00:02:18.830> from

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
from frame to frame and certainly from

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.850 
from frame to frame and certainly from
high<00:02:19.160> to<00:02:19.220> high<00:02:19.489> only<00:02:19.730> takes<00:02:20.209> several<00:02:20.860> samples

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
high to high only takes several samples

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.970 
high to high only takes several samples
and<00:02:22.190> get<00:02:22.880> a<00:02:22.970> virgin<00:02:23.470> so<00:02:24.470> I'll<00:02:24.620> just<00:02:24.799> go<00:02:24.950> ahead

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
and get a virgin so I'll just go ahead

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.940 
and get a virgin so I'll just go ahead
and<00:02:25.370> see<00:02:25.580> what<00:02:25.940> this<00:02:26.090> one<00:02:26.360> frame<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:27.590> moisture

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
and see what this one frame the moisture

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.559 
and see what this one frame the moisture
content<00:02:28.100> this<00:02:28.430> one<00:02:28.610> frame<00:02:28.880> is<00:02:29.090> so<00:02:29.269> I'll<00:02:29.390> go

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
content this one frame is so I'll go

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.890 
content this one frame is so I'll go
ahead<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:29.870> take<00:02:30.400> I'll<00:02:31.400> take<00:02:31.459> some<00:02:32.000> take<00:02:32.870> a

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
ahead and take I'll take some take a

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.530 
ahead and take I'll take some take a
sample<00:02:33.200> off<00:02:33.500> of<00:02:33.650> this<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:37.850> first<00:02:38.120> thing<00:02:38.209> is<00:02:38.510> to

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
sample off of this the first thing is to

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.770 
sample off of this the first thing is to
put<00:02:39.140> a<00:02:39.170> sample<00:02:39.650> put<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.489> sample<00:02:40.910> on<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.239> prism

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.900 

you<00:02:44.780> don't<00:02:44.959> need<00:02:45.079> a<00:02:45.109> lot<00:02:45.290> just<00:02:45.620> got<00:02:46.489> to<00:02:46.609> make

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
you don't need a lot just got to make

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.180 
you don't need a lot just got to make
sure<00:02:47.060> that<00:02:47.239> you<00:02:47.480> cover<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:48.019> entire<00:02:48.190> sample

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
sure that you cover the entire sample

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.530 
sure that you cover the entire sample
plate<00:02:52.060> then<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:53.329> close<00:02:53.989> this<00:02:54.200> trap<00:02:54.530> door<00:02:54.739> and

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
plate then you close this trap door and

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.590 
plate then you close this trap door and
flatten<00:02:56.950> the<00:02:57.950> sample<00:02:58.430> so<00:02:59.090> you<00:02:59.120> get<00:02:59.329> all<00:02:59.480> the

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
flatten the sample so you get all the

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.240 
flatten the sample so you get all the
air<00:02:59.720> bubbles<00:02:59.750> out<00:03:02.170> then<00:03:03.170> basically<00:03:03.530> you<00:03:03.859> hold

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
air bubbles out then basically you hold

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.770 
air bubbles out then basically you hold
this<00:03:04.400> up<00:03:04.609> to<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.760> sunlight<00:03:05.209> focus<00:03:05.660> the

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
this up to the sunlight focus the

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.729 
this up to the sunlight focus the
eyepiece<00:03:06.200> and<00:03:06.560> read<00:03:06.920> off<00:03:07.070> the<00:03:07.250> scale<00:03:08.590> well<00:03:09.590> one

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
eyepiece and read off the scale well one

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.170 
eyepiece and read off the scale well one
thing<00:03:09.980> that's<00:03:10.220> important<00:03:10.700> is<00:03:10.820> to<00:03:11.030> make<00:03:11.150> sure

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
thing that's important is to make sure

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.330 
thing that's important is to make sure
that<00:03:11.510> this<00:03:11.690> Honey<00:03:11.900> refractometer<00:03:12.590> is<00:03:12.950> at

great<00:03:27.260> harvest<00:03:27.620> looks<00:03:28.220> like<00:03:28.430> about<00:03:28.550> 120

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
great harvest looks like about 120

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.880 
great harvest looks like about 120
pounds<00:03:29.690> I<00:03:29.780> filled<00:03:30.020> up<00:03:30.110> this<00:03:30.230> five-gallon

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
pounds I filled up this five-gallon

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.030 
pounds I filled up this five-gallon
bucket<00:03:31.280> but<00:03:31.580> 2/3<00:03:32.060> of<00:03:32.210> this<00:03:32.410> 5-gallon<00:03:33.410> bucket

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
bucket but 2/3 of this 5-gallon bucket

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.850 
bucket but 2/3 of this 5-gallon bucket
and<00:03:34.910> I've<00:03:35.380> used<00:03:36.380> up<00:03:36.560> all<00:03:36.710> the<00:03:36.830> bottles<00:03:37.160> idea<00:03:37.520> to

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
and I've used up all the bottles idea to

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.280 
and I've used up all the bottles idea to
the<00:03:39.860> bottle<00:03:40.190> a<00:03:40.370> little<00:03:40.430> bit<00:03:40.700> of<00:03:40.880> honey<00:03:41.140> so<00:03:42.140> I'd

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
the bottle a little bit of honey so I'd

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.490 
the bottle a little bit of honey so I'd
say<00:03:42.500> this<00:03:42.590> is<00:03:42.680> about<00:03:42.740> 120<00:03:43.640> pounds<00:03:44.230> so<00:03:45.230> now<00:03:45.380> I'd

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
say this is about 120 pounds so now I'd

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.580 
say this is about 120 pounds so now I'd
like<00:03:45.530> to<00:03:45.680> get<00:03:46.190> the<00:03:46.510> average<00:03:47.510> moisture<00:03:47.870> content

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
like to get the average moisture content

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.690 
like to get the average moisture content
of<00:03:48.800> this<00:03:49.280> honey

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
of this honey

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.570 
of this honey
so<00:03:50.540> I'll<00:03:50.690> take<00:03:51.020> I'll<00:03:51.740> take<00:03:52.040> a<00:03:52.070> sample<00:03:52.400> from

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
so I'll take I'll take a sample from

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.610 
so I'll take I'll take a sample from
from<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.240> five-gallon<00:03:53.810> bucket<00:03:54.140> put<00:03:54.350> it<00:03:54.410> on<00:03:54.590> a

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
from the five-gallon bucket put it on a

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.190

over twenty we would cause the honey to

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.000 
over twenty we would cause the honey to
ferment<00:04:11.390> and<00:04:11.660> spoil<00:04:14.050> so<00:04:15.050> it<00:04:15.380> looks<00:04:15.620> like<00:04:15.710> the
