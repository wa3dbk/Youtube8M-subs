00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
 ee 2 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.800
 Damn 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:16.840
 Yes it is this time is yes Hello Green was purchased here 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:23.480
 It's a Bluetooth headset, in fact 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:26.150
 I make a phone call like this with iphone , but at that time 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.170
 When I call on iphone 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.560
 It is difficult to talk 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:37.830
 So if you think you want a headset at that time 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:39.810
 1000 yen I had sold at home centers Nde was selling a little in this No, and 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:44.840
 I thought and bought 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:49.810
 It is very looks good, but it's roughly in the iphone 4 s corresponding 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.810
 Then we will immediately open the opening 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.870
 No 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.090
 Ha 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.090
 This is the main body 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.970
 It marks of bluetooth you will see 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.080
 there were 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:14.950
 It seems to attach this to the ear 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.950
 Yes yes it's good family 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.520
 Let's read this first 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:25.070
 This Oh this is a good stand-in multi-point two simultaneous not tired even lightweight long period of time 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.930
 Ne 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:32.210
 The comfortable fit ear with fit ear hook that I also this 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:37.710
 I think it will be difficult to fall 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:42.740
 Because it is a usb charging cable Tsukki PC, it is still ac 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.740
 I think I can charge the adapter 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:53.450
 I'd like guide which was entered is the look of the adapter 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:59.149
 Nmaa like this now 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:02.259
 Have not generally seen little it this terminal is that it comes with a charging cable 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.259
 It is a type 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:10.520
 Yes, I completely different than the one bsp 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.520
 The contents are above 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.140
 Let's say we will look at the department 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.140
 Tore 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.260
 This is 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.769
 Well it was this look 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:36.770
 Even the transparent part is a lamp 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:40.420
 There is a microphone here where the color changes when the power is turned on, etc. 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.140
 Oh there is a microphone is here 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.770
 at 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.770
 This is 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:54.340
 That is attached to here to here of the connection surface 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:57.590
 a Sound volume button and redial button 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.090
 at here for the charging terminal 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:05.400
 There is a habit 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:10.250
 And here seems to be a burden of power Cherry blossoms in here are beautiful 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:15.370
 I don't think it's been done june 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:19.380
 The red lamp blinks I think that the power is turned on 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:22.560
 Here it is the earphone Toko later in 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.860
 A hook here and there 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.860
 is not it 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.650
 I feel like this 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.480
 It looks like bluetooth 3 version 3.0 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:38.720
 Wireless method 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:40.730
 Pretty it looks wide in the distance of choking is like within 10m 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.970
 There is a lot of 10m 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:48.970
 It is a lithium polymer after the power supply 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.970
 Charge time seems to be full in about 2 hours 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:59.470
 Continuous talk time to a maximum of 6 hours 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:04:02.040
 The standby time is up to 180 hours at approximately 208 hours 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.040
 About 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:12.819
 I have a lot, but I have such a charge though it is so small 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:17.620
 Well it seems to be a power-saving 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:22.680

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.680
