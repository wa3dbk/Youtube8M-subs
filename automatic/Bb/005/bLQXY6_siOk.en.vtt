00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
did come with this compound but I quite

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.699 
did come with this compound but I quite
like<00:02:52.830> it<00:02:52.910> it's<00:02:53.910> quite<00:02:54.150> memory<00:02:54.630> like<00:02:54.959> it's<00:02:55.650> a

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
like it it's quite memory like it's a

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.780 
like it it's quite memory like it's a
bit<00:02:55.980> in<00:02:56.550> sight<00:02:56.850> Christmasy<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.989> north<00:02:58.790> it's
