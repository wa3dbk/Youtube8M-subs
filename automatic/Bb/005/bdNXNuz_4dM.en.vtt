00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.289
 what are the indispensable elements in healthy eating 

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:17.009
 I need healthy food, we have an excellent education. 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:18.369
 food pyramid 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.160
 it is made up of food groups and facilitates the consumer 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.640
 to identify which 60 are present at each meal 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.289
 if we observe she has a formula 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:30.929
 a triangular shape 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.630
 and it rises from the group of carbohydrates that involve the Spanish masses 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:38.929
 flour noodles and sobe refuses the potato 

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:41.609
 my nephew of the group 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:45.620
 that compose the vegetables that are the vegetables and the fruits 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.580
 What we wanted 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.340
 also bear in mind that most of the meals of the day above we have 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.409
 a group of proteins where we have the grains each month 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:56.120
 no group of six 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.570
 formerly we had a bit of a definite in terms of quantity or 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.660
 people know that the top that is made up of fats and sugars 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.580
 is the group that should be consumed in less quantity or less 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.920
 the best 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.990
 difficult to remember all these rules but the important thing not to 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.590
 exaggerate in any of these groups 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:16.540
 How beautiful is it? 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.690
 turned up 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.690
 all the food the leaves are 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.260
 charming and the flavors 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.510
 it's impossible 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.510
 the variety of food out there 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.130
 the temptations but calm 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.130
 and it is possible to eat well and unpunished 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.230
 start finding the way 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.020
 that lack of it 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.440
 and now let's learn how to put together a balanced dish looking like lunch and 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.170
 at dinner 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.060
 from teacher dr you have arrived for the dispute of this season 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.270
 I think the first thing is, baby. 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.330
 the options we have 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.930
 can start to dissipate and the spoken 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.550
 Let's launch an alert. 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.230
 so we always know it's an option 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.230
 without pushing the federal senate 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.810
 and from there we do 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.929
 talking about the food pyramid of the milk and milk derivatives groups I will 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.189
 take a 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:16.009
 the small artifact to talk about papuda 

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:17.399
 photo after company 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:18.579
 the delicious 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:20.659
 and now it's the hardest part 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:24.960
 is to try to treat the hottest things to michael 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.070
 so here we've done 73 kinds of trees by 

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:40.229
 It just happens but we also have something that the potato 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.169
 I have to, that's okay. 

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:44.319
 export billing 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.279
 is the forte of the full test check here 

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:49.819
 who enters 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.359
 training benefits 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:52.779
 our health 

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:53.730
 In this ocasion 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.810
 fear is open - as is the forest 

00:02:57.529 --> 00:03:01.010
 according to the weight of a bit of luck after also 

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:02.740
 Who is the behavior? 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.069
 the constant evolution here 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.159
 until the present 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.289
 and it's over, I can do it 

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:13.239
 it's wrong 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.059
 the agreement unleashed from the water 

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:16.739
 - for the final 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.569
 is that like me who has that thing part of the base to the end point to 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:22.719
 potato 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:24.329
 It's so hard to stop. 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.610
 many people 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.609
 That's why this is when you 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:29.990
 in total the government 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.720
