00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.219
 about essential oils 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:17.039
 I have separated some information 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.119
 chemical properties of oils 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.970

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:29.789
 after Grandpa essential eyes only 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:33.540

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:37.320
 volatile or is it to forum 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.170
 quickly ready to speak only 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.219
 unlike the greasy eyes and has the 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.640
 consistency but wakes the eyes 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.879
 not have the same consistency 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:55.940
 of vegetable eyes its composition 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:01:00.980
 chemistry is complex or I know the quantity 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:03.300
 of nutrients my essential eyes are 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.140
 quite complex 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:15.920
 there are many different essential oils 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:15.920
 can be found in leaves roots 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:26.670

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.710
 aromatic 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:35.939
 that is why the essential oil is 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:41.030
 called essential oil what is it 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:44.460
 consists in it's fragrance smell 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.329
 essential oils are different from those 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.810
 eyes carriers as shippers 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:53.430

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.790
 essential eyes 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.940
 a very 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.970
 very strong of the essential oils are the 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:05.870
 their fragrances and in the sounds dances 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:09.500
 are natural fragrances for 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.390
 if using the essential oil can not leave 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.260
 he is pure since he is quite 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:19.700
 Consistent then you have to go the ilo 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:22.970
 in vegetable oil for each spoon 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:28.700
 vegetable oil which is also called 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:31.790
 Cafe du in aromatherapy oil is placed 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.360
 five drops of essential oil 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:39.560
 There you talk about election and then you do 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:43.160
 apply the hair to the skin 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.410
 my capillary limitations and also the 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.320
 my hair bulb 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.880
 I usually put 2 tablespoons of oil 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.930
 vegetable 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:57.830
 I put ten drops of essential oil 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:01.160
 and then the beast of it and him and then I 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.640
 I apply and two tablespoons of oil 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.130
 together with the oil drops 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:11.330
 essential is enough for this 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:15.769
 applying in my head all and certain 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:19.120
 times still left a little bit because I 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:22.850
 Start this way I'll wait on the hand after 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:26.870
 5 apply within the hair at the root of all 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.860
 anger and then what's left over 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.739
 on the wires 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.470
 So you can go normal and still 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:37.190
 A little bit and then I step on my skin 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.810
 arms in the pen that must pass another 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.200
 Also, I want to talk to 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:45.769
 It is about the Arequipa oil and 6 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:51.290
 make oil and rosemary dogs make me do 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:55.730
 is not the eye 100% is essential of santo 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:58.880
 that together with olive oil the 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.580
 Olive oil will serve as only 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.030
 then surely that's a bit of 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:09.030
 natural essence of rosemary 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:11.160
 but there is not the 100% essential oil 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.920
 At no point in the video did I say that 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.980
 I was making the essential oil but the 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.060
 law is every moment that I was doing 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.000
 oil and rosemary 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.820
 you will have many mec properties 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.260
 still contains on the sheets that will be 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:30.780
 loose in the eye but even so is not the 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.240
 100% essential gold if you want 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:37.139
 have a full benefit of the eye every time 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:40.770
 been essential only buying oil it is 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:44.930
 essential because essential oils are 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:49.620
 sold in small packs of 10 ml 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:52.890
 and they are also expensive because to do it 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.100
 essential oil needs a lot of 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:58.680
 very much vegetable 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.600
 there are some essential oils that 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.770
 if you make a letter 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:10.380
 more than one tonne of 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:14.460
 Vegetable seeds or leaves in pray 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:16.800
 wrong that fire has a chip that 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.450
 need to imagine all the time then 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.840
 medium high price 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.669
 the rarer and the more exotic 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.550
 it was lethal 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:29.940
 but expensive will the essential oil want 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:33.479
 to see an extremely expensive and essential work 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:36.090
 Essential oil of jasmine is very expensive o 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:39.240
 that in order to do it needs a 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:42.030
 large amount of garden flory 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:45.120
 already these eyes as for example the 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:48.870
 better it is who is cheaper 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:52.380

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:57.140

00:05:52.380 --> 00:06:00.300
 My father and twenty reais already in the oil 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:04.410
 I'm already okay 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:07.050
 I paid 25 reais in promotion because the 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:09.210
 their price on promotion is a bit more 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:12.740

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:15.660

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:52.659
 example where one thinks of a 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:56.680
 comment so it was not so 10 only 

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:59.380
 the compliment but they told me so 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:02.080
