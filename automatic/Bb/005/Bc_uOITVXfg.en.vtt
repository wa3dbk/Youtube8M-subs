00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.190 
throwing them away and killing them
that's<00:01:51.820> cool<00:01:52.119> and<00:01:52.329> all<00:01:52.450> but<00:01:52.479> they're<00:01:53.020> going<00:01:53.140> to

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
that's cool and all but they're going to

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.319 
that's cool and all but they're going to
keep<00:01:53.470> reproducing<00:01:53.950> this<00:01:54.579> way<00:01:54.850> you're

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
keep reproducing this way you're

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.480 
keep reproducing this way you're
lowering<00:01:55.900> the<00:01:56.170> chances<00:01:56.740> you<00:01:57.009> have<00:01:57.130> a<00:01:57.220> hundred

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
lowering the chances you have a hundred

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.999 
lowering the chances you have a hundred
male<00:01:57.909> sterile<00:01:58.750> lampreys<00:01:59.290> and<00:01:59.320> then<00:01:59.740> you<00:01:59.860> have

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
male sterile lampreys and then you have

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.090 
male sterile lampreys and then you have
a<00:02:00.040> hundred<00:02:00.369> male<00:02:00.820> non<00:02:01.479> sterile<00:02:01.960> lampreys<00:02:02.500> the

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
a hundred male non sterile lampreys the

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.510 
a hundred male non sterile lampreys the
percentage<00:02:04.090> of<00:02:04.329> the<00:02:04.720> female<00:02:05.200> lamprey<00:02:05.979> getting

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
percentage of the female lamprey getting

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.960 
percentage of the female lamprey getting
pregnant<00:02:06.729> is<00:02:07.060> 50%<00:02:07.799> but

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
pregnant is 50% but

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.880 
pregnant is 50% but
yeah<00:02:09.180> now<00:02:09.869> did<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.170> mention<00:02:10.350> that<00:02:10.530> when<00:02:10.770> these

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
yeah now did I mention that when these

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.740 
yeah now did I mention that when these
guys<00:02:11.070> are<00:02:11.130> born<00:02:11.520> they're<00:02:11.760> born<00:02:12.000> blind<00:02:12.360> and

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
guys are born they're born blind and

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.560 
guys are born they're born blind and
without<00:02:13.080> teeth<00:02:13.410> so<00:02:14.070> for<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.700> first<00:02:14.940> around

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
without teeth so for the first around

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.390 
without teeth so for the first around
seven<00:02:16.110> years<00:02:16.350> of<00:02:16.500> their<00:02:16.620> life<00:02:16.830> they<00:02:17.070> have<00:02:17.220> to

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
seven years of their life they have to

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.520 
seven years of their life they have to
stay<00:02:17.580> buried<00:02:17.940> underneath<00:02:18.420> sand<00:02:18.780> then<00:02:19.320> when

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
stay buried underneath sand then when

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.560 
stay buried underneath sand then when
they<00:02:19.620> emerge<00:02:20.070> everybody<00:02:20.760> wants<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.090> kill<00:02:21.390> them

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
they emerge everybody wants to kill them

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.970 
they emerge everybody wants to kill them
so<00:02:21.840> I'm<00:02:22.020> guessing<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:22.560> they're<00:02:22.710> probably

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
so I'm guessing that they're probably

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.370 
so I'm guessing that they're probably
pretty<00:02:23.580> pissed<00:02:23.760> which<00:02:24.630> is<00:02:24.810> another<00:02:25.110> reason

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
pretty pissed which is another reason

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.220 
pretty pissed which is another reason
why<00:02:25.560> this<00:02:25.800> movie<00:02:26.520> is<00:02:26.700> going<00:02:27.240> to<00:02:27.390> be<00:02:27.510> awesome

why this movie is going to be awesome

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.130 
why this movie is going to be awesome
