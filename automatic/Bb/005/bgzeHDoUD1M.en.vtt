00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 how 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.880
 and what services did your new 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.920
 motor grader the lÃ­an gong m 14 and the 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.719
 We were there to test what will be 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.360
 without a doubt it is a very competitive product 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:20.280
 in 2015 in the equipment range by 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.850
 above 15 thousand kilos again 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.410
 for forbes games we are here because 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.940
 I have a new product to introduce you 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.940
 in the line of motor graders 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.330
 [Music] 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:39.270
 it is a new product it is a very product 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:43.970
 revolutionary in motorcycle bulldozers is a 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:47.280
 model that was changing in details 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.739
 very important constructs has a 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.400
 cooling system totally 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.260
 different 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.950
 the fan is driven by an engine 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.320
 hydraulic which allows you to have 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.960
 independence between the diesel engine and the 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:07.440
 movement of the fan has a 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:10.780
 security system that electrically 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.390
 operates a hydraulic pump that 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.280
 operate what is the address those that 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.050
 they are the brakes that is to say all those that 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.940
 one needs in case it breaks down the 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.330
 engine so that an accident does not happen 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.940
 then the hydraulic system have improved 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.950
 much everything are the valves of 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.860
 the movements of the cylinders not only 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.930
 check valves but all the 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.210
 cylinders have their own reliefs is 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.540
 say it breaks down the machine and we have 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.060
 that removing a cylinder manually 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.160
 releases the pressure of that cylinder this 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.369
 without throwing a drop of oil on the floor 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.590
 this one we can manipulate the cylinder is 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.970
 say really many very many 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.009
 improvements 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.250
 We are recontra sure that it will be 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.840
 a success this product in the market 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.340
 we are with a liana mg 14 and 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.229
 we comment a little now yes 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.600
 as well as it is configured that 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.119
 weight transmission engine we are 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.429
 talking about what keeps coming is with 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.340
 Cummins engine in this case comes with a 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:11.739
 ie tier 3 is like lightning but 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.220
 still using fuel 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:19.540
 normal after this if we continue with the 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.980
 ZF transmission of this in this case 6 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.120
 marches to the front and is and three 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.890
 marches back this as I said before 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.720
 we continue with the gear pumps in 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.910
 hydraulic pumps gears 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.070
 all the layout of the cabin the 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.800
 column keeps coming in a system 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.720
 scissors that allows you to both the 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.380
 commands the drive levers 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.870
 hydraulic are always very comfortable 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.640
 for the operator and then another change 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.310
 important that there was in this new design 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.010
 is in the joint the joint 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.410
 of the equipment state in the back is 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.420
 say the cabin accompanies the party 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.460
 front the machine does not accompany the 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.440
 back this really gives a 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.420
 lots of benefits this in the 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.459
 attraction and the availability of 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.690
 vertebra in front of the worker at 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:10.490
 articulate and in the 13 13-foot vertebra 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.850
 with universal universal blades 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.140
 universal you talked about the cabin 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.160
 we were really surprised what the 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.440
 visibility of the size of the 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.140
 construction tilted forward the 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.390
 Exact recoil camera is a team 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.000
 with all the accessories as you said the 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:29.270
 recoil camera recoil horns 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.610
 of this 11 of cibeles that is to say they are 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:34.250
 process horn that you hear or the 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.090
 eavesdropping in the case of the cabin is a 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.239
 robb cabin 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.459
 It is already a cabin system with all the 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.709
 outer studs this allows you 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.590
 disassemble the cabin and assemble the cabin 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.959
 with a lot more ease is this a 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.129
 very very innovative product talking about 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.959
 remove the cabin from the action of 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.370
 maintenance we also saw what is the 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.410
 bonnet how it gets up 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.280
 electronically much easier as 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.330
 to access what is a 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.349
 maintenance of the part of 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.590
 refrigeration that is so important 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:04.200
 fully mentioned even the access 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.200
 although it's electric if you 're touching it 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.000
 a knob too if you will be left without 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.470
 current if you run out of power 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.989
 electric 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.599
 has a lock that emerges 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:18.260
 it locks up and very easily you pick it up this 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:22.290
 manually say everything we were 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:25.500
 trying to solve or help in the 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.870
 resolution from the simple side from 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.850
 the simplicity in German work to close 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.400
 they always ask me something about the subject 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.840
 commercial if you want to talk comment a 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.210
 how is it positioned in 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.680
 percentage and if you want in price like 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.729
 are accessing the market with this 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.800
 product 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.300
 excellent the time exactly 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.719
 Percentages do not know but we will be easy 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:49.879
 25 to 30 percent less than in moto 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:54.210
 leveler of equal equal benefit 

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:56.099
 of the same configuration we really know 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.490
 that we have a very good price but in 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:02.370
 this opportunity is a combination 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:04.800
 super super super successful that is a very 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.379
 good cheese with a team that is without 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.469
 sound is a device that does not vibrate if 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:11.909
 you start to get to some 

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:13.800
 equipment configurations some 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:16.939
 impressive equipment features 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:20.219
 that's why it really is a combination 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:21.960
 very successful price quality product and 

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:24.089
 as we always say that what 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.919
 represents biscayne because just 

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:27.479
 when we saw with the 1044 there 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:30.059
 we talk about yang gon brand behind 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:32.159
 It is obviously Biscaine all 

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:33.749
 good and the configuration that you already 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:35.009
 it's not a product that comes as well as what 

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:36.389
 receive if you chose what 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:39.029
 they configured and this what we have today 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:41.300
 here exactly today I smell it good 

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:44.190
 we are playing and we have it here for 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.810
 to market good but they go grace 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.490
 We will continue to see the bike and good 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.920
 poly citations because new products 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.440
 back many thanks to you this for
