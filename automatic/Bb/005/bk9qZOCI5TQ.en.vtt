out<00:00:26.220> we've<00:00:26.369> been<00:00:26.490> looking<00:00:26.789> for<00:00:31.130> good<00:00:32.130> our<00:00:32.640> text

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
out we've been looking for good our text

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.670 
out we've been looking for good our text
will<00:00:33.059> start<00:00:33.239> analyzing<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.870> data<00:00:34.020> right<00:00:34.410> away

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
will start analyzing the data right away

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.040 
will start analyzing the data right away
that<00:00:35.100> data<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.489> encrypted<00:00:35.940> you'll<00:00:36.719> need<00:00:36.899> to

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
that data is encrypted you'll need to

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.660 
that data is encrypted you'll need to
stand<00:00:37.260> by<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.500> for<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.829> moment<00:00:37.950> until<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.460> can

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
stand by it for a moment until I can

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.869 
stand by it for a moment until I can
access<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.739> okay<00:00:40.739> decrypting<00:00:41.489> now<00:00:42.079> done<00:00:43.879> all

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
access it okay decrypting now done all

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.670 
access it okay decrypting now done all
right<00:00:45.120> I'll<00:00:45.450> me<00:00:45.690> more<00:00:45.930> data<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.260> find<00:00:46.559> our

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
right I'll me more data to find our

00:00:46.680 --> 00:01:35.610 
right I'll me more data to find our
operative

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.930 

there<00:01:36.620> he<00:01:36.740> is<00:01:36.770> you<00:01:37.190> have<00:01:37.400> to<00:01:37.550> get<00:01:37.700> it<00:01:37.790> out<00:01:37.850> of

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
there he is you have to get it out of

00:01:37.940 --> 00:02:03.810 
there he is you have to get it out of
there

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.480 

three<00:02:04.820> well<00:02:05.330> that<00:02:06.040> you're<00:02:07.040> running<00:02:07.340> out<00:02:07.430> of

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
three well that you're running out of

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.760 
three well that you're running out of
time<00:02:07.660> try<00:02:08.660> to<00:02:08.720> recover<00:02:08.990> as<00:02:09.229> much<00:02:09.259> data<00:02:09.649> as

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
time try to recover as much data as

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:33.300 
time try to recover as much data as
possible<00:02:10.009> before<00:02:10.729> you<00:02:10.819> leave

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.880 

this<00:02:34.209> area<00:02:34.599> is<00:02:34.750> becoming<00:02:35.170> unstable<00:02:35.410> the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
this area is becoming unstable the

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:56.980 
this area is becoming unstable the
simulation<00:02:36.489> is<00:02:36.640> collapsing<00:02:37.239> get<00:02:37.690> out<00:02:37.870> now

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.530 

very<00:02:57.650> good<00:02:57.950> so<00:02:58.520> there's<00:02:58.700> more<00:02:58.910> assassin<00:02:59.420> to

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
very good so there's more assassin to

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.860 
very good so there's more assassin to
save<00:02:59.780> and<00:03:00.020> more<00:03:00.320> data<00:03:00.500> defined
