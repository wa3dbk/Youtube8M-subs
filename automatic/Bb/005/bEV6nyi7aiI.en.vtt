00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 They just want to make renewable energies in their own 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.310
 Office complex consistent with the latest climate protection and energy efficiency 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.719
 Findings and they have received the German Climate Protection Award 2008 for this 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:19.539
 Gunda percent not half measures 5 Mathieus Hilgefort category youth 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.319
 award-winning entrepreneurs in the field of renewable energies 

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:27.779
 from the Rheinhessian on the way to the Infinity Ward umzukrempeln 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.649
 Away from Avila Gas and Atom 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.940
 they have a vision 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.380
 and they go all the way 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.770
 we have to act patient care controversial theses 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.080
 safe electricity 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.080
 live percent at stable electricity supply 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.990
 even without percent and socially acceptable electricity that 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.740
 Valuations singing of the Museum of Bavaria 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.479
 discussed in the long term 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:01:00.870
 no full-fledged scientist 100% renewable energy is over 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.310
 how that is going to show the two energy threatens us with their company juwi 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.510
 in Wörrstadt produced 5 percent for twelve years the company lays 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.710
 big success 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.860
 and meanwhile also internationally 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.840
 clean electricity 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.210
 Everything started with wind power 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.110
 and that's no coincidence 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.700
 both grew up on a farm and signature and on 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.690
 familiar 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.100
 the beautiful is easy in the weather is the Ticino for free 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.550
 disposal 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.010
 and that was just that 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.860
 awesome entry to say 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.960
 anyway you use the winter for free over the field red 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.030
 and who tries to convert the cheaper in clean power 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.860
 that's exactly what I should do too 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.000
 Likewise 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.110
 do on your own farm 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.900
 I really wanted 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.420
 to put a sign 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.440
 for renewable energy 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.510
 a sign that you have the morning hours 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.619
 the two cats together as their savings and banks investors and that 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.900
 to build first windmill for then a million d-mark 

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:13.909
 soon larger equipment was added 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:16.429
 Wind power is now profitable 

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:19.309
 but not always available 

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:22.059
 It quickly became clear that a mix had to come 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:25.059
 a mix of wind sun and much more 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:28.639
 in the Hunsrück in the energy landscape Morbach 

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:33.119
 combine the JuLis wind turbines with solar systems in endless rows 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.469
 Biogas plant also uses the products and waste products of the 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:40.539
 surrounding farmers 

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:43.539
 directly connected is a 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:48.879
 With this mixture, the Morbachers generate more energy than they do themselves 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.319
 consume 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.319
 the venture has paid off for the community 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:56.929
 so worth it 

00:02:56.929 --> 00:03:00.709
 Of course we have to think about Strüber today how can we do that 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.249
 Provide energy for the future for our citizens 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:09.299
 Put the decentralized units on the basis of regenerative energies of the 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.899
 right way and we are working on this energy landscape here 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:17.339
 Of course we also play in that we achieve lease payments here 

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:21.179
 from Intel the plants are thus last of the terrain for the 

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:24.519
 Wind turbines and also for the photovoltaic systems 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.729
 the jewel concept has worked out 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:29.199
 a mix of renewable energy 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:30.139
 summarized 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:31.899
 in small units 

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:35.039
 The electricity is produced where it is consumed 

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:37.849
 so does the money in the region 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.889
 But one hundred percent of renewable energy should also meet the demand for greater energy 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:43.249
 Cover units 

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:46.959
 In the near future, even a seizure could be completely taken care of 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:51.969
 and so vision looks like we are leading over percent 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:55.149
 deliberate economic opportunities 

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:59.699
 We are working to make sure that these underdogs are already around 200% fulfilled 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:02.579
 we can not have time to lose 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.449
 because climate change is going to change 

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:09.619
 we have no time to lose because the energy demand is getting bigger and bigger 

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:10.669
 and that will happen 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:12.909
 lead to skyrocketing prices 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:14.229
 for all 

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:15.900
 than are 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.709
 The waiting times are the energy specialists are currently laying 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.370
 neat pace before July is growing rapidly not only to capture market share 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.830
 it's about the renewable energy mission 100 percent 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:34.580
 the relocation of fossil energy independence as well as no coke 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.560
 no gas and 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.990
 also no nuclear power as they stand to this vision their opinion 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.270
 We are interested in discussing with you in our internet forum 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.800
 find about www environment ZDF de and there is now also the possibility 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.689
 to vote 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:55.699
 How Customers Impact Power Plants on the Co2 Balance Sheet of a Country 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:00.629
 can currently show the example from Poland they remember Poland
