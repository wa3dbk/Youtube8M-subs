this<00:02:44.370> format<00:02:44.850> is<00:02:45.000> that<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.270> four<00:02:45.510> outs

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
this format is that the four outs

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.840 
this format is that the four outs
comprised<00:02:46.140> of<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.380> lot<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.560> small<00:02:46.890> monsters<00:02:47.580> I

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
comprised of a lot of small monsters I

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.580 
comprised of a lot of small monsters I
mean<00:02:48.270> look<00:02:48.450> at<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.690> SHA<00:02:48.870> dolls<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.410> the

mean look at the SHA dolls and the

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.840 
mean look at the SHA dolls and the
burning<00:02:49.800> of<00:02:49.980> this<00:02:50.100> monsters<00:02:50.550> they're<00:02:50.700> all

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
burning of this monsters they're all

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.640 
burning of this monsters they're all
relatively<00:02:51.390> weak<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:51.900> as<00:02:52.080> well<00:02:52.260> as<00:02:52.350> this<00:02:52.470> at

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
relatively weak and as well as this at

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.009 
relatively weak and as well as this at
our<00:02:52.800> Knights<00:02:53.130> then<00:02:53.730> they're<00:02:54.060> not<00:02:54.300> that<00:02:54.510> strong

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
our Knights then they're not that strong

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.350 
our Knights then they're not that strong
and<00:02:55.080> that's<00:02:55.470> how<00:02:55.800> this<00:02:55.920> format<00:02:56.340> is<00:02:56.430> going<00:02:56.489> so

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
and that's how this format is going so

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.050 
and that's how this format is going so
by<00:02:57.510> having<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:58.019> Caius<00:02:58.500> out<00:02:58.739> on<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.040> field<00:02:59.370> he

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
by having a Caius out on the field he

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.360 
by having a Caius out on the field he
can<00:03:00.269> get<00:03:00.390> over<00:03:00.660> a<00:03:01.080> lot<00:03:01.470> of<00:03:01.739> cards<00:03:02.190> of<00:03:02.280> this

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
can get over a lot of cards of this

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.830 
can get over a lot of cards of this
format<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:02.970> it<00:03:03.090> just<00:03:03.330> makes<00:03:03.600> it<00:03:03.780> really

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
format and it just makes it really

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.810 
format and it just makes it really
difficult<00:03:04.380> for<00:03:04.680> your<00:03:04.920> opponent<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.430> make<00:03:05.459> any

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
difficult for your opponent to make any

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.699 
difficult for your opponent to make any
plays<00:03:06.150> since<00:03:06.810> they<00:03:06.900> know<00:03:07.050> Caius<00:03:07.500> can

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
plays since they know Caius can

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.770 
plays since they know Caius can
essentially<00:03:08.100> run<00:03:08.370> over<00:03:08.820> everything<00:03:09.480> in<00:03:09.630> their
