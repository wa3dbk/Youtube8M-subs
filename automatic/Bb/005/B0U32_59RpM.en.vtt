00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 in this chapter we are going to see how 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:10.440
 we can save and open a project 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:14.070
 lumen and we're even going to know the 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.139
 functions of exporting and importing that the 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.380
 lumen have a different meaning 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.660
 perhaps to which we are accustomed 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.939
 take into account as a summary that 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.830
 they will be able to save whenever they want 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.430
 the scenes and even different 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.780
 versions of the same scene 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.630
 to open it in lumen is called loading 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:37.450
 whereas if what they want is 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.850
 export the scene to another computer to 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.430
 another pc have to use the option 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.720
 export for then they see that other team 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.240
 use the import function 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.480
 but we're going to see all that in this 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.250
 tutorial we have the scenario created and 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.530
 what we do is come to this button 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.810
 here below 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.330
 we click 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.330
 and now we assign a name value 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.850
 and a description 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.650
 we touch save 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.330
 and has been saved 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.940
 in fact 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.610
 if now we would like we could go to 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.990
 create a new project let's go here to 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.790
 new 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.550
 we choose some of the templates 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.130
 we can create a new scenario or 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.200
 we can simply decide to load a 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.450
 existing the one that we just saved by 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.870
 example then we go to this button another 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.930
 time and now we do not want to save but 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:49.650
 we want to load that would be the term that 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.840
 use union to refer to open 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.780
 here we have the version that you recorded of 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.390
 automatic way and here the version that 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.600
 we have recorded manually we make a 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.600
 click 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.020
 and we count on that scene again 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.880
 if we want to save again because 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.770
 We have made a change let this button 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.800
 again 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.680
 observe that you have the same data and 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.020
 we give overwrite and it appears as 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.510
 version 2 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.960
 so with this button we are going to load 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.220
 scenes that would be the equivalent of opening 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.840
 and in this other one we are simply going to 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.000
 save the scene that we have open 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.620
 these other buttons allow us 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.989
 import scenes and export scenes on 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.629
 fact is that these scenarios that 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.420
 we are creating the union belong to 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.880
 program in some way 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.770
 if we want to take this scenario to 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.290
 open in another alluvium in another computer 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.500
 in another computer we have to do 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.380
 previously an export for that 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.050
 we use this icon this button from 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.000
 here we are going to click on the button 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.910
 export scene 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.920
 we give a name and here the 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:07.660
 file format of the union that in this 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:11.650
 case is the ls 4 once we have saved 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:14.560
 that file we will be able to import it 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.629
 in another student in that case we're going to 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.150
 use this other button that serves to 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:21.810
 import scenes we would use this 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.069
 button that does the opposite effect 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.859
 search files in lumen format 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:30.379
 this other button serves to load the 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:35.019
 meshes of the scenarios but beware that the 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:35.019
 format is also lumen ls
