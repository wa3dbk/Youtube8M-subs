00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:11.429
 look here a very cool toy I 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:16.049
 I just received is not doing a good 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.580
 I play a good time since I only get 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.230
 How did I buy it directly from China? 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.750
 took time to arrive 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.699
 I want to show you here what 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:32.279
 that's what this toy is all about 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:35.309
 here it is an inverter it catches 12 volts 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:40.350
 is in 12-volt continuous battery 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:44.550
 continuous detail and transforms into 220 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.070
 and this is cool because 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.350
 may be using inside the car 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.460
 has another socket is very simple to 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.670
 connection has more signaling and 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.510
 less red and black then any 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.920
 can do this installation 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.670
 this inverter can be used inside the 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.659
 car has the neighbor socket to plug in 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.060
 taking 12 volt day is automotive outlet 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.040
 that the same the same cigarette lighter 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.049
 more common nor the older cars 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.159
 have not taken but have the 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.310
 cigarette people because it's too much show 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.170
 cool even imagining taking a trip 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.530
 and has a plug 220 inside the car 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.110
 to charge your notebook 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.590
 Finally, your phone can even 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.119
 normal television in the car there and 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.220
 look at all that you will 220 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.650
 continue to use and other 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.670
 important thing is to know that it creates a 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:48.229
 magnetic field that is needed 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.829
 pape give the start up machine type one 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.479
 engine of a drill similar thing 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:55.460
 What I did I got a drill 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.909
 to show you 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.280
 he has usb input, you can see him 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.899
 Quiet as here is a hill where 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.869
 I'm calling the headlights here for 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.030
 to facilitate people have no miracles 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.069
 really needs a strong battery and 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.019
 another car connected to him 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.420
 work a long time, right? 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:24.049
 A drill here, I already left it. 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:28.010
 ready'll put here to see this 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:31.129
 drill fuck a superb drill 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.349
 I say superb because it's not anyone. 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.269
 How has she worked with me? 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.319
 alarm equipment 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.849
 I ended up getting her because she 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:45.410
 electro-pneumatic, you can do it 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:48.019
 the movement of the hammer 100 on which it 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.840
 Rotate is cool 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.780
 so its consumption is a high consumption 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.260
 I do not know if you'll see. 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.630
 but so the 680 watts is if you 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.440
 want to check on the internet or 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:06.500
 beer her model here in the middle case 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.950
 here today bh 2 24 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.780
 you can confirm at 680 watts 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.459
 this toy that winter is for 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.709
 1,000 watts only so it has 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:21.819
 protection if it goes over it will shut down 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.819
 How does he play then? 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:31.750
 I put a stone here because a 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:34.650
 thing without weight, right? 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.859
 but 680 is using as weight it 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.859
 confirms the connection 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.450
 that is, does not have 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.760
 does not have middle ground is really stupid 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.760
 it works 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.160
 It's very cool, I put it there. 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:17.060
 igniter but could break the fuse 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:20.650
 What are 1,000 watts, right? 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.970
 and I would be using the 680 more 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.920
 could blow the fuse so I 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:29.150
 I chose to put with the claws of thorns 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:32.090
 here on the battery and touch plug works and 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.080
 I recommend it and it is not expensive it is cheap 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.980
 if you want to buy in the market 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.410
 will pay around $ 150 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.590
 real 1 if it's a thousand watts so you do not have 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:45.830
 some that more - advantage that is more 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:49.270
 cheap 1000 watts I guess I do not 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.860
 I can confirm but at around $ 150're 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.720
 that I will have to see in one and not really 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.630
 Are you sure because like I said I 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.520
 I bought from China some people, one thing. 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.310
 fantastic, very cool 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:05.510
 It's good to have or imagine a corner and you 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:07.730
 to use is an inverte ira ban 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.760
 to get a thousand watt idea if you 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:13.100
 get a 20 watt bulb from these 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.169
 economical while the bulbs you 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.030
 can connect using a 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.740
 toy this one to me vate 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.280
 details people did not heat up 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.810
 okay it comes with a ventiladorzinho not 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:28.040
 You can hear his noise. 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:30.080
 not too low is a high line but 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.350
 it's not what you can not stand either 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:36.410
 can not see because of the engine here 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:38.390
 but it is a point to be taken into account 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.300
 not even because the thousand watts it has a 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:45.610
 Fan of his work is fo is always 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:48.080
 connected within the car environment 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.370
 if you are using it it gives 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.850
 really gives a fuss 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:55.520
 now the least advantage I believe 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:57.320
 that is not always linked to beauty 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.790
 so in another one 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.040
 a curiosity but the experience 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.200
 personal sharing with you 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:07.130
 and this is the idea of ​​the channel always 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:09.950
 sharing an experience is not always 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.849
 will be automotive related're 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.159
 some people questioned 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:18.209
 and what I did on the channel was only 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:20.729
 automotive related had no idea 

00:06:18.209 --> 00:06:22.229
 channel is really to pass the 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:24.419
 experiences that we have 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:27.569
 personal experiences finally sharing 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:29.759
 something tasty, even good, I hope. 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:34.649
 You liked it if you liked it. 

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:41.490
 Of course a jewel for us, you got a john. 

00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:43.349
 is good and if you choose you can 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:47.039
 subscribe to the channel I recommend 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:49.019
 even what I'm going to like very much and will 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:49.860
 be able to accompany and our new 

00:06:49.019 --> 00:06:52.649
 videos 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.800
 It's good, we hug. 

00:06:52.649 --> 00:06:54.800
 God
