with the remote turn on cable and you

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.480 
with the remote turn on cable and you
need<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.290> run<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.830> opposite<00:01:17.220> side<00:01:17.460> of

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
the power to the power cable so I've run

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.660 
the power to the power cable so I've run
yeah<00:01:21.030> blue<00:01:21.720> cable<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.770> remote<00:01:23.100> turn<00:01:23.310> on<00:01:23.490> and

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.420 
the RCA cable for release corner here
and<00:01:29.690> over<00:01:30.690> here<00:01:30.750> thing<00:01:31.530> goes<00:01:31.710> under<00:01:32.160> the<00:01:32.250> cab

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
and over here thing goes under the cab

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.000 
and over here thing goes under the cab
here<00:01:32.610> if<00:01:32.940> you<00:01:33.120> lift<00:01:33.360> this<00:01:33.450> out<00:01:33.660> quite<00:01:33.930> easily

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
here if you lift this out quite easily

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.050 
here if you lift this out quite easily
and<00:01:35.540> there<00:01:37.100> you<00:01:38.100> might<00:01:38.250> need<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.580> just<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.880> see

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
and there you might need to just to see

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.580 
and there you might need to just to see
up<00:01:39.210> what<00:01:39.390> I've<00:01:39.570> done<00:01:40.490> then<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.030> piece

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
up what I've done then this is the piece

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.490 
up what I've done then this is the piece
which<00:01:43.850> people<00:01:44.850> look<00:01:44.970> at<00:01:45.150> some<00:01:45.690> underneath<00:01:46.050> is

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
which people look at some underneath is

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.370 
which people look at some underneath is
really<00:01:46.890> easy<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.310> get<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.610> wire<00:01:47.820> under<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:49.290> it

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
really easy to get the wire under and it

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.880 
really easy to get the wire under and it
moves<00:01:49.590> along<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.670> then<00:01:51.090> quite<00:01:51.300> easily<00:01:51.890> this

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
moves along and then quite easily this

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.830 
moves along and then quite easily this
bit<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.190> plastic<00:01:53.490> in<00:01:53.610> there<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.420> just<00:01:54.600> push

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
bit of plastic in there and just push

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.750 
bit of plastic in there and just push
the<00:01:54.990> cable<00:01:55.170> underneath<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:56.250> run<00:01:56.400> it<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.550> this

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
the cable underneath and run it to this

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:04.250 
the cable underneath and run it to this
piece<00:01:56.970> a<00:02:00.830> little<00:02:01.830> more<00:02:02.130> difficult<00:02:02.820> why<00:02:03.780> did<00:02:04.110> is

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
piece a little more difficult why did is

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:12.900 
piece a little more difficult why did is
this<00:02:04.680> page

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.390

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
when you think you've run the cable

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.600 
when you think you've run the cable
you'll<00:02:20.990> see<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.440> remote<00:02:21.830> turn<00:02:22.040> on<00:02:22.250> and<00:02:22.459> the

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:29.509 
through drill through to get the cable

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:33.620 
through drill through to get the cable
power<00:04:30.509> cable<00:04:30.570> then<00:04:31.169> goes<00:04:31.380> through<00:04:31.680> and<00:04:32.630> come

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
power cable then goes through and come

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.170 
power cable then goes through and come
out<00:04:33.660> in<00:04:35.270> mine<00:04:36.270> is<00:04:36.630> an<00:04:37.370> see<00:04:38.370> there's<00:04:38.699> a<00:04:38.759> grommet

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
out in mine is an see there's a grommet

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.480 
out in mine is an see there's a grommet
I<00:04:39.440> couldn't<00:04:40.440> get<00:04:40.560> one<00:04:40.710> through<00:04:40.979> that<00:04:41.130> grommet

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
I couldn't get one through that grommet

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.230 
I couldn't get one through that grommet
so<00:04:41.789> I<00:04:42.060> made<00:04:42.449> my<00:04:42.660> own<00:04:42.690> hole<00:04:44.090> drilled<00:04:45.090> straight

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
so I made my own hole drilled straight

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.060 
so I made my own hole drilled straight
