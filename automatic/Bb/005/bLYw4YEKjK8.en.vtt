00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
to be honest it's pretty forgettable

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.069 
to be honest it's pretty forgettable
watch<00:00:44.489> put<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.789> visor<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.360> pretty<00:00:45.960> much

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
much down but uh so yeah it's going to

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.490 
much down but uh so yeah it's going to
be<00:01:12.450> like<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.840> little<00:01:13.049> part<00:01:13.290> right<00:01:13.350> there

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
be like a little part right there

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.499 
be like a little part right there
doesn't<00:01:14.189> really<00:01:14.340> move<00:01:14.580> too<00:01:14.970> much<00:01:15.000> though<00:01:15.479> a

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
doesn't really move too much though a

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.920 
doesn't really move too much though a
little<00:01:15.810> bit<00:01:15.900> up<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.049> down<00:01:17.420> you<00:01:18.420> know<00:01:18.509> rotates

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
little bit up and down you know rotates

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.990 
little bit up and down you know rotates
right<00:01:19.229> below<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.590> shoulder<00:01:19.920> which<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.400> really

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
right below the shoulder which is really

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.840 
right below the shoulder which is really
nice<00:01:21.150> but<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.320> problem<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:23.460> just<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:23.759> the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
nice but the problem is just like the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.670 
nice but the problem is just like the
general<00:01:24.119> ways<00:01:24.299> pretty<00:01:24.869> much<00:01:25.049> that's<00:01:25.439> all<00:01:25.650> I

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
general ways pretty much that's all I

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
general ways pretty much that's all I
can<00:01:25.890> do<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.280> 90<00:01:26.909> degree<00:01:27.030> angle<00:01:28.070> so<00:01:29.070> that's

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
can do is a 90 degree angle so that's

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.160 
can do is a 90 degree angle so that's
what<00:01:29.939> ever<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.360> then<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.780> get<00:01:30.900> this<00:01:30.990> little

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
what ever you then you get this little

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.350 
what ever you then you get this little
thruster<00:01:31.710> part<00:01:31.979> right<00:01:32.159> here<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:33.060> doesn't

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
thruster part right here that doesn't

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.960 
thruster part right here that doesn't
really<00:01:33.390> move<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.960> just<00:01:34.110> stays<00:01:34.320> right<00:01:34.350> there

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
really move it just stays right there

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.770 
really move it just stays right there
sometimes<00:01:35.970> they<00:01:36.119> can<00:01:36.180> get<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.540> way<00:01:36.720> but

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
sometimes they can get in the way but

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.649 
sometimes they can get in the way but
for<00:01:37.290> most<00:01:37.409> part<00:01:37.619> really<00:01:37.890> not<00:01:38.040> too<00:01:38.220> bad<00:01:38.659> the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
for most part really not too bad the

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.469 
for most part really not too bad the
chest<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.020> pretty<00:01:40.380> nice<00:01:40.700> he<00:01:41.700> can<00:01:41.880> bend<00:01:42.150> right

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
there and bend a little bit to the back

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.490 
there and bend a little bit to the back
about<00:01:46.229> there<00:01:46.820> that's<00:01:47.820> really<00:01:48.000> cool<00:01:48.380> you<00:01:49.380> got

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
to get this part right here which is a

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.440 
to get this part right here which is a
holder<00:01:51.960> for<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.890> shield<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:54.090> could<00:01:54.240> put

right on top or you could put the gun
right<00:01:57.119> underneath<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:58.280> so<00:01:59.280> that's<00:01:59.759> pretty

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
right underneath it so that's pretty

though whoopsie it just fell off
completely<00:02:44.740> but<00:02:45.520> do<00:02:46.240> a<00:02:46.300> full<00:02:46.600> 360<00:02:47.140> rotation

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
completely but do a full 360 rotation

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.050 
completely but do a full 360 rotation
let<00:02:47.920> me<00:02:47.980> try<00:02:48.190> and<00:02:48.220> put<00:02:48.370> this<00:02:48.460> right<00:02:48.670> back<00:02:48.850> in

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
let me try and put this right back in

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.680 
let me try and put this right back in
there<00:02:49.300> I<00:02:51.150> don't<00:02:52.150> think<00:02:52.270> it's<00:02:52.360> going<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:52.510> go<00:02:52.570> on

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
there I don't think it's going to go on

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.430 
there I don't think it's going to go on
to<00:02:53.620> be<00:02:53.740> honest<00:02:54.510> it's<00:02:55.510> pretty<00:02:55.840> tricky<00:02:56.050> to<00:02:56.350> be

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
to be honest it's pretty tricky to be

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.700 
to be honest it's pretty tricky to be
honest<00:02:56.770> art<00:02:57.570> it<00:02:58.570> can't<00:02:58.900> go<00:02:59.170> all<00:02:59.320> the<00:02:59.440> way<00:02:59.470> up

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
honest art it can't go all the way up

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.220 
honest art it can't go all the way up
like<00:03:00.270> well<00:03:01.270> you<00:03:01.450> have<00:03:01.570> like<00:03:01.750> move<00:03:01.900> it<00:03:02.020> to<00:03:02.140> the

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
like well you have like move it to the

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.170 
like well you have like move it to the
side<00:03:02.410> in<00:03:02.680> order<00:03:02.740> for<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:02.980> to<00:03:03.040> go<00:03:03.220> up<00:03:03.370> if<00:03:03.790> you<00:03:03.910> try

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
side in order for it to go up if you try

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.610 
side in order for it to go up if you try
to<00:03:04.210> do<00:03:04.330> it<00:03:04.450> straight<00:03:04.810> it's<00:03:05.080> going<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.320> get

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
to do it straight it's going to get

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.450 
to do it straight it's going to get
blocked<00:03:05.950> right<00:03:06.430> there<00:03:06.670> on<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.120> waist<00:03:08.050> part<00:03:08.460> so

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
blocked right there on the waist part so

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.610 
blocked right there on the waist part so
you<00:03:09.700> got<00:03:09.820> to<00:03:09.940> bend<00:03:10.180> this<00:03:10.390> back<00:03:10.690> and<00:03:11.170> then<00:03:11.380> you

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
you got to bend this back and then you

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.400 
you got to bend this back and then you
can<00:03:11.740> bring<00:03:11.920> it<00:03:12.070> back<00:03:12.280> right<00:03:12.700> there<00:03:12.940> and<00:03:13.410> you

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
can bring it back right there and you

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.440 
can bring it back right there and you
get<00:03:14.920> a<00:03:14.950> little<00:03:15.610> splits<00:03:16.830> that's<00:03:17.830> pretty<00:03:18.040> cool

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
get a little splits that's pretty cool

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.060 
get a little splits that's pretty cool
and<00:03:19.450> then<00:03:19.840> it<00:03:20.290> has<00:03:20.470> two<00:03:20.710> points<00:03:21.040> of

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
and then it has two points of

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.460 
and then it has two points of
articulation<00:03:21.180> right<00:03:22.180> inside<00:03:22.420> here<00:03:22.450> here<00:03:22.870> but

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
articulation right inside here here but

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.350 
articulation right inside here here but
the<00:03:23.710> problem<00:03:24.010> with<00:03:24.070> this<00:03:24.250> is<00:03:24.520> it<00:03:24.910> can<00:03:25.090> only<00:03:25.180> go

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
the problem with this is it can only go

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.980 
the problem with this is it can only go
about<00:03:25.450> that<00:03:25.930> much<00:03:26.460> like<00:03:27.460> right<00:03:27.760> there<00:03:27.990> you

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
about that much like right there you

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.720 
about that much like right there you
have<00:03:29.170> to<00:03:29.230> like<00:03:29.350> cut<00:03:29.590> bend<00:03:29.890> it<00:03:30.070> in<00:03:30.220> order<00:03:30.370> for<00:03:30.490> it

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
have to like cut bend it in order for it

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.150 
have to like cut bend it in order for it
to<00:03:30.790> go<00:03:30.970> like<00:03:31.290> that<00:03:32.290> but<00:03:32.620> that's<00:03:32.830> really<00:03:33.010> not

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
to go like that but that's really not

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.500 
to go like that but that's really not
too<00:03:33.610> much<00:03:33.910> movement<00:03:34.750> for<00:03:35.230> legs<00:03:35.440> and<00:03:36.280> this<00:03:36.880> is<00:03:37.090> a

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
too much movement for legs and this is a

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.650 
too much movement for legs and this is a
little<00:03:37.870> upsetting<00:03:38.170> to<00:03:38.380> be<00:03:38.470> honest<00:03:38.800> and<00:03:39.660> of

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
little upsetting to be honest and of

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.290 
little upsetting to be honest and of
course<00:03:40.690> well<00:03:41.530> actually<00:03:41.830> really<00:03:42.280> can't<00:03:42.640> no

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
course well actually really can't no

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.560 
course well actually really can't no
can't<00:03:44.020> do<00:03:44.170> a<00:03:44.200> full<00:03:44.440> 360<00:03:45.250> rotation<00:03:45.610> right<00:03:46.300> below

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
can't do a full 360 rotation right below

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.460 
can't do a full 360 rotation right below
the<00:03:46.810> hip<00:03:47.740> joint<00:03:48.390> it's<00:03:49.390> blocked<00:03:49.780> by<00:03:49.900> this<00:03:49.990> giant

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
the hip joint it's blocked by this giant

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.660 
the hip joint it's blocked by this giant
part<00:03:51.250> right<00:03:51.430> here<00:03:51.990> these<00:03:52.990> little<00:03:53.980> side<00:03:54.250> skirts

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
part right here these little side skirts

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.860 
part right here these little side skirts
can<00:03:54.850> come<00:03:54.970> up<00:03:55.120> and<00:03:56.130> that's<00:03:57.130> okay<00:03:57.820> i<00:03:57.850> guess<00:03:58.150> and

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
can come up and that's okay i guess and

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.360 
can come up and that's okay i guess and
then<00:03:59.170> the<00:03:59.380> foot<00:03:59.620> can<00:04:00.250> move<00:04:01.150> it<00:04:01.300> it<00:04:01.390> out<00:04:02.370> like

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
then the foot can move it it out like

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.580
