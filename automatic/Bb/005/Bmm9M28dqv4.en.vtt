closely to look a circular oh there you

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.120 
closely to look a circular oh there you
go<00:03:55.870> at<00:03:56.870> each<00:03:57.020> side<00:03:57.320> right<00:03:57.530> here<00:03:57.770> there's<00:03:57.980> one

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
go at each side right here there's one

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.340 
go at each side right here there's one
here<00:03:58.190> at<00:03:58.640> the<00:03:58.850> edge<00:03:59.000> it's<00:03:59.690> like<00:03:59.810> little<00:04:00.020> pins

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
here at the edge it's like little pins

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.800 
here at the edge it's like little pins
those<00:04:00.770> pins<00:04:01.130> when<00:04:01.940> you<00:04:02.030> put<00:04:02.240> it<00:04:02.360> back<00:04:02.480> make

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
those pins when you put it back make

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.370 
those pins when you put it back make
sure<00:04:02.840> that<00:04:03.230> they<00:04:03.410> go<00:04:04.300> inside<00:04:05.300> that<00:04:05.660> circle

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
sure that they go inside that circle

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.650 
sure that they go inside that circle
right<00:04:06.709> there<00:04:06.880> okay<00:04:07.880> just<00:04:08.150> go<00:04:08.300> ahead<00:04:08.420> and

you'll<00:07:11.350> see<00:07:11.590> the<00:07:11.740> wire<00:07:11.920> harness<00:07:12.400> right<00:07:12.550> there

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:12.820 
you'll see the wire harness right there

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.940 
you'll see the wire harness right there
it's<00:07:13.510> the<00:07:13.630> same<00:07:13.840> wire<00:07:14.050> harness<00:07:14.530> that<00:07:14.560> comes

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:14.950 
it's the same wire harness that comes

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:19.080 
it's the same wire harness that comes
out<00:07:15.220> here<00:07:16.150> and<00:07:16.510> it<00:07:17.170> is<00:07:17.320> welded<00:07:17.620> in<00:07:17.980> there<00:07:18.700> so
