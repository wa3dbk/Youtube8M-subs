00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
because I think in three lessons I've

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.670 
because I think in three lessons I've
done<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.480> know<00:03:15.510> reasonably<00:03:16.050> well<00:03:16.290> because<00:03:16.590> it

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
done you know reasonably well because it

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.140 
done you know reasonably well because it

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
has been a learning curve which has gone

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.790 
has been a learning curve which has gone
straight<00:03:18.390> up<00:03:18.750> I'd<00:03:18.900> love<00:03:19.050> to<00:03:19.110> carry<00:03:19.410> on<00:03:19.620> I
