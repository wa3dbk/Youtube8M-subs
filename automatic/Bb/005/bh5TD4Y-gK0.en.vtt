wish I had a good comparison to show you
but<00:01:18.540> just<00:01:18.900> take<00:01:19.140> my<00:01:19.350> word<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.490> size<00:01:20.850> 12

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
but just take my word this is a size 12

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.320 
but just take my word this is a size 12
if<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.920> were<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.100> compare<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.850> normal

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
if you were to compare this to a normal

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.380 
if you were to compare this to a normal
sized<00:01:24.570> boot<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.650> would<00:01:25.860> probably<00:01:26.520> be<00:01:26.700> around<00:01:26.850> a

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
sized boot it would probably be around a

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.300 
sized boot it would probably be around a
size<00:01:27.689> 14<00:01:29.240> yeah<00:01:30.320> but<00:01:31.320> there's<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.530> reason<00:01:32.009> why

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
size 14 yeah but there's a reason why

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.429 
size 14 yeah but there's a reason why

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
around 70 degrees imagine in the winter

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.730 
around 70 degrees imagine in the winter

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.990 
idea what the hell it's for maybe one of
you<00:05:14.860> guys<00:05:14.920> do<00:05:15.340> like<00:05:16.270> you<00:05:16.420> go<00:05:16.600> inside<00:05:17.110> the<00:05:17.290> boot

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
you guys do like you go inside the boot

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.250 
you guys do like you go inside the boot
another<00:05:19.000> weird<00:05:19.330> thing<00:05:19.420> that<00:05:19.840> don't<00:05:20.110> like

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
another weird thing that don't like

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.560 
another weird thing that don't like
about<00:05:20.500> these<00:05:20.710> boots<00:05:20.980> is<00:05:21.220> that<00:05:21.400> the<00:05:21.580> laces

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
about these boots is that the laces

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.650 
about these boots is that the laces
aren't<00:05:23.050> exactly<00:05:23.470> long<00:05:23.800> enough<00:05:24.220> to<00:05:24.660> fit

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
aren't exactly long enough to fit

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.960 
aren't exactly long enough to fit
through<00:05:26.200> all<00:05:26.440> the<00:05:26.800> loops<00:05:27.070> and<00:05:27.520> still<00:05:27.760> have

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
through all the loops and still have

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:33.090 
through all the loops and still have
enough<00:05:28.000> to<00:05:28.390> tie<00:05:29.490> but<00:05:30.490> um<00:05:30.670> I<00:05:31.770> would<00:05:32.770> suggest

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
enough to tie but um I would suggest

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.760 
enough to tie but um I would suggest
these<00:05:33.580> if<00:05:33.940> you're<00:05:34.330> going<00:05:34.660> to<00:05:35.260> some<00:05:35.560> place

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
these if you're going to some place

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.820 
these if you're going to some place
that's<00:05:36.190> so<00:05:36.720> ridiculously<00:05:37.720> cold<00:05:38.230> that<00:05:38.470> you<00:05:38.500> may

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
that's so ridiculously cold that you may

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.330 
that's so ridiculously cold that you may
literally<00:05:39.460> freeze<00:05:39.880> your<00:05:40.180> balls<00:05:40.480> off<00:05:41.340> get

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
literally freeze your balls off get

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.700 
literally freeze your balls off get
these<00:05:43.320> yeah<00:05:44.320> they're<00:05:44.800> big<00:05:45.040> they're<00:05:45.940> heavy<00:05:46.710> put

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
these yeah they're big they're heavy put

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.340 
these yeah they're big they're heavy put
on<00:05:47.800> the<00:05:47.860> bright<00:05:48.040> side<00:05:48.070> they're<00:05:48.550> waterproof

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
on the bright side they're waterproof

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.840 
on the bright side they're waterproof
and<00:05:50.350> if<00:05:50.530> you're<00:05:50.650> not<00:05:50.770> in<00:05:51.070> the<00:05:51.190> extreme<00:05:51.580> cold

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850 
and if you're not in the extreme cold

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.500 
and if you're not in the extreme cold
well<00:05:52.240> your<00:05:52.510> feet<00:05:52.750> might<00:05:52.990> melt<00:05:53.260> from<00:05:53.590> under<00:05:53.830> you

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
so it'll be something interesting but
