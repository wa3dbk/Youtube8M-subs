00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:19.240
 Hello everyone and welcome to this new one 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.609
 video dedicated to minecraft today we will go 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.689
 to see the novelties of the snap shots 15 v 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:27.429
 32 to 32 b and 32 c 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.199
 the novelties of these snap shots are not 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:31.419
 many since they are served 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.040
 especially to fix bugs 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.870
 I still wanted to make this video 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.610
 since in the coming weeks I will go 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.440
 on vacation so I won't be able to 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.500
 prepare others 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.090
 let's see what was added 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.890
 one of the most important innovations of 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.690
 this snap shot concerns the menu of 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.390
 uploading saves 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.730
 let's go and see then first of all it is 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.530
 for each save is indicated 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.580
 which version was used for 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.210
 create the world 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:01.690
 in the first case the 15 v 32 c in the second 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.280
 the 15 v 32 a in the third case the game does not 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.409
 was able to recognize with 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.749
 which version the world was created 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:11.320
 the interesting thing though is that the 

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:13.899
 written 15 v 32 c is in red because the 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.579
 the game we want to experience something I 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:19.210
 right now I'm using the 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:22.509
 snap shot 15.32 b then in fact one 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.280
 lower version than c in fact if we 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.679
 let's put the mouse pointer 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.359
 a dot appears on this save 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:30.969
 exclamation going to the point 

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:33.369
 an exclamation sign appears which 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:36.219
 basically it is warning us that 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.960
 upload this save that was 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:41.049
 made with a higher version 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.939
 compared to the current one could 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.409
 create problems and therefore we must 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.359
 be careful 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.639
 in the second case instead the rescue is 

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:52.450
 was made with a lower version 

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:55.299
 the 15 v 32 a and therefore the game does not give us 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.909
 particular warnings in the third case 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.889
 instead the warning is different this 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.749
 rescue was not done with the 

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:04.090
 snap shot but now we are trying to 

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:07.090
 load it with a snap shot and then 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.759
 game is warning us to do first 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.710
 a copy of the rescue for non 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.750
 run into 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.730
 basically problems is the same 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.060
 warning I gave you last 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.490
 video so guys be very careful 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.380
 the second novelty is evident of this 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.660
 minus one are the icons 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:29.160
 in the first case the game used 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:31.080
 a screenshot of the world actually 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.420
 the game should automatically create 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.220
 this icon I did not succeed and I have 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.020
 had to create a screenshot by hand 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.930
 there are probably some things that 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.510
 must still be placed in 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.270
 second case instead as you see this 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.830
 black and white icon this because the 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.860
 game was not able to create one 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.080
 screenshot and then replaced it with 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.900
 a generic icon in the third case instead 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.720
 I was the one who customized the icon 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.940
 how to do it is very simple you have to create 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:06.690
 an image in png format of dimensions 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:09.570
 64 by 64 pixels call the file icon 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.860
 punto png and copy it inside the 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.140
 save folder 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.090
 at this point the game will recognize 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.340
 automatically the icon will go to 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.310
 put in this menu and as you can see here 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.640
 I could customize the icon with the 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.410
 My channel's logo in this slapshot is 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.230
 was added to the statistics lo 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.540
 sneak time and that is the time in which the 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:34.650
 player has lowered using the 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.960
 uppercase key in land structures 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.850
 on the ship as I had anticipated in the 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.090
 b video was removed last 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.800
 block replaced with pumpkin 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:48.620
 also now on the bow of this ship 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.620
 we will find a dragon's head 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.090
 in this snap shot it has been modified 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.240
 the difficulty in fighting against 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.740
 dragon lander in the following way 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.470
 increasing the effect of nok back when 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.690
 we are struck by increasing the radius of the 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.790
 acid chest spitted by the dragon e 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.920
 making the player now can 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.650
 be hit in a three hundred radius 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.600
 sixty degrees during the attack with 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.820
 acid if the player moves away 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.549
 too much the dragon immediately stops arguing 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.620
 acid and continues the battle when the 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.440
 dragon will eventually dispute acid will try 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.140
 immediately to attack the player 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:30.250
 finally last change the dragon before 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:32.170
 die flying near the portal we pass 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.900
 now for some minor new features 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:37.210
 snap shot first particle effects 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.730
 have been improved in terms of 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.800
 performance and memory usage e 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.390
 moreover, both the radius has been increased 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.300
 action that the maximum number of 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.190
 particles that can be created second 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.080
 there have been changes to the 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.710
 shooter that can now be 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.960
 teleport using the types command 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.000
 third ichri for the skeletons excluded 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.740
 those with her and the zombies now must 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.840
 be closer to the player for 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.490
 notice that they are wearing one 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.830
 of their heads 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.930
 fourth the scoreboard command now 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.300
 allows you to add or remove a 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.360
 tag to each entity based on the tags 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.130
 nbt of the entity itself for example yes 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.950
 can add a tag to all 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.440
 players in the fifth air 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.950
 from the menu in creative mode has been 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.280
 removed the arrow called splashing 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.260
 well 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.030
 the news has ended here, but be assured 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.280
 that in the next snap shots and ne 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.660
 more will come if you want 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.330
 deepen as always as you can 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.520
 see the linked minecraft wiki 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.410
 in the description of this video a 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.350
 I can only greet you at this point 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:44.760
 and give you an appointment at the next video 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.760
 Hi everyone
