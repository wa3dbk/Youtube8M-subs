00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.800
 Everything ends 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.500
 Even the brightest bonfire fades 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.380
 We've all seen it before 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.840
 Hot coals holding a faint flame 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.140
 Before that you had a life 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.420
 Woman, home, child 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.960
 Curse 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.180
 Your wife, home, baby, right? 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.900
 What happened to them? 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.740
 You don't remember 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.240
 The only thing you remember is a curse 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.660
 You're fighting it but it's killing you 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.260
 And you'll experience death 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.960
 And you die in death 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.520
 You dream of a lost kingdom 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.460
 Dark forgotten land 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.660
 A place where souls manage your sick mind 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.880
 Then you live again 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.660
 Who were you before you died? 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.560
 When did you get into this forest? 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.280
 It does not matter. Hurry 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.480
 But you're tired. So tired 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.160
 All you remember now is that your memory fades. 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.020
 But wasn't there anything else? 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.700
 You had important memories that were everything for you 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.660
 Now they have vanished 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.580
 And you're desperate about their loss 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.500
 You're betrayed by this curse 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.720
 So you have to throw away everything you were used to 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.620
 And get a new way 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.040
 Discover the origin of that curse 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.500
 And use the legendary soul of Drangleic to maintain common sense 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.600
 But you'll soon realize 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.660
 That you are not the only one to travel to Drangleica with this goal 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.740
 Drangleic ... \ t 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.500
 Once was the Drangleic powerful kingdom 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.280
 Led by a wise king and a powerful queen 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.820
 But giants from a far country waged war with the kingdom 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.360
 To get something stolen 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.140
 The giants were repulsed 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.200
 But the weak kingdom soon became a victim of the undead curse 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.580
 Empty soldiers overcame the earth 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.680
 And the king who once had so much power to lead his people 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.140
 He also found strength to fight them 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.180
 But something went wrong 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.380
 The king locked himself 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.440
 And nobody saw the queen 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.560
 The Kingdom of Drangleic is in decay 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.280
 Everything falls apart and loses sight so that something new can be born 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.500
 Drangleic 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.420
 It takes the form of a place we knew 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.280
 A world of struggle between light and darkness 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.380
 A kingdom with a sinner, a king, a condemned traitor, and a pile of dead 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.300
 A country where the curse of a man is reflected in the curse of the world 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.980
 Every fire turns to ashes 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.720
 The kingdoms rise and fall 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.360
 Some bright, some dark 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.660
 All fighting for new beginnings with a faint flame trying to survive among the hot coals 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.700
 But perhaps he is struggling with the fires of an ordinary state 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.260
 The curse of life is a curse of lust 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.180
 So you look in the fog 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.260
