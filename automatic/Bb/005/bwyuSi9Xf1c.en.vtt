part<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.189> efficient<00:01:23.640> chips<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.630> the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
part of efficient chips is that the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.450 
part of efficient chips is that the
batter<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.830> not<00:01:26.570> it's<00:01:27.570> it's<00:01:27.960> airy<00:01:28.259> it's<00:01:29.009> light

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
batter is not it's it's airy it's light

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.740 
batter is not it's it's airy it's light
but<00:01:30.060> crispy<00:01:30.689> right<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.970> that's<00:01:32.970> for<00:01:33.420> me<00:01:33.540> that's

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
but crispy right so that's for me that's

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.330 
but crispy right so that's for me that's
very<00:01:33.840> very<00:01:34.200> important<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.860> what<00:01:35.159> makes

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
very very important and what makes

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.359 
very very important and what makes
awesome<00:01:35.610> chips<00:01:36.360> with<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.369> fish

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
awesome chips with it is that the fish

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.190 
awesome chips with it is that the fish
is<00:01:38.670> not<00:01:39.240> on<00:01:39.509> top<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.799> fries<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:42.420> next<00:01:43.049> to
