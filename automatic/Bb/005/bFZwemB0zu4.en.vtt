 cards deposed on fuck-fans 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.340
 I think there are a few coming 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.369
 more about this tomorrow's umpire 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.110
 encounter is florian mayer 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.750
 FIFA referee the past game 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.939
 last game with fck participation was 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.070
 Past game in Bochum was created 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.340
 then zero to zero 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.280
 then we come to the part tomorrow markus 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.159
 you have announced a goal of the fck 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.650
 to promote the such a young player to 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.090
 To promote and to develop belongs to such 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.880
 a development sometimes a 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.380
 defeat and dealing with it is 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.119
 also what you have to learn that the 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.640
 team now had to learn and 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.659
 could be together on monday 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.420
 I do not necessarily belong 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.450
 defeated but you are at 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.790
 Sport also everyday and us 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.550
 but they do not necessarily need 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.680
 generally known 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:04.430
 learn from defeats but more than 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.940
 from positive results then one is 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.060
 always in a good mood and happy and and 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.560
 come quickly to the next topic and 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:18.650
 just defeated after such a the 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:21.460
 We now on the weekend and fed 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.210
 or we have fed ourselves 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.470
 that hurts a lot 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.880
 we have really good ones 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.170
 played away at a very far away 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.390
 home strong or home strongest 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:35.450
 Team currently have us very well 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.950
 sold and therefore in many areas 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.060
 we have a lot of ball possession 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.410
 we have demonstrated more powerful 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.350
 great game setup we have had 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.620
 chances really played out 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.020
 had great combinations in the game and 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.710
 also many chances were played out 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:58.970
 Of course we do not know that 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:01.580
 very last consequence then with this 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.910
 go then used but that belongs to 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.920
 Me too that we with these 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.709
 moments are not quite ripe yet 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:15.170
 we know that a little bit more 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:18.440
 time needed yes i would have liked 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:24.580
 I also costs to the da 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:27.220
 to have our balance in the game 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.190
 with our our experienced speak 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.760
 they are even more influential 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:36.970
 take on such a game on such a 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.620
 course of the game with her with 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.320
 their presence on the field came 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.460
 Now take it further here and 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.890
 I have just about it with him 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:47.470
 also said yes that will now 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.420
 from our youth players not always 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.950
 can demand and that the older ones 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:58.260
 vicars like tobi yes like markus k like 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:02.920
 lucky to take more influence 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:06.730
 Chris must also be against goals 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.920
 that we are getting are absolutely 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.540
 avoidable and there we have the 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:15.580
 We made ourselves how to do that 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:17.290
 videoband this adversity again 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.970
 I think that will happen to some 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.730
 last for years if any more is 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.980
 out of this adversity very fast 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:27.640
 at the moment, however , she has to learn 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.290
 but he made the wrong decision 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.650
 until then a very good game 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:36.139
 made and and rather make 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:40.249
 we create the second gate as that 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:43.060
 how much time will pass before we die 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:46.219
 player pledl struck the flame 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.789
 or how much time passes before us 

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:51.770
 could have prevented this flank 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:55.490
 Opportunities have been felt minute 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.870
 and we have missed that and and 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.349
 then, at the end of the game, you lose a game like that and 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.819
 ask 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:03.909
 BedrÃ¶ppelt home that hurts a lot 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:03.909
 nevertheless I differentiate under 

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:09.409
 between results and also the 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.800
 athletic development of each one 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:15.319
 and the willingness to perform was that 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.909
 Again a step after most 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:21.830
 ahead 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:23.240
 and in our line, faithfully good game 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.750
 The guys are very made 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.909
 confidently occurred and and the 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.139
 coach has the game very well 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:31.699
 also analyzes with the team 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:32.960
 Yesterday and we will be our conclusions 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:36.349
 pull from it and tomorrow with the 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.270
 team ready again to 100 percent 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:39.669
 and we are all looking forward to this 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.500
 game 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.849
 thank you markus schupp costa markus 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.259
 said the right conclusions 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:45.860
 now there was the first hijacked 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:48.020
 defeat 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.789
 what can you play out of it anyway 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:54.860
 take with you in view of tomorrow 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:56.120
 partie against union berlin first that 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.039
 we showed a really good game 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.009
 we have abroad 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:03.020
 continuous in the last few weeks in 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:05.659
 have developed the game system that 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.800
 We continue the idea that we pursue 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:11.689
 also in the square all together 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.389
 and it was very disappointing this 

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:17.270
 defeat because she was absolutely unnecessary 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:18.469
 and the gate of individual errors 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.659
 have arisen 

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:22.550
 You can only train that conditionally 

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:25.009
 But we always talk about that 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.419
 we visualize we show we 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:29.539
 discuss this at the blackboard 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:31.490
 we are certainly mine too 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:36.229
 Person also in the cabin very directly 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:39.330
 and I believe that that this process 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:42.280
 just keep going 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:44.710
 must be driven forward and as well 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:48.820
 have to be patient and also those 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:50.650
 Errors also not agree with 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.940
 but include such errors too 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.490
 then finally have to accept 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.360
 it does not help 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.500
 great thinking about it now 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.910
 we have many good scenes 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:02.140
 looked at from the game against leads and 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:05.370
 So a good feeling and me 

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:08.130
 certainly a good aggressiveness and 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:10.300
 with with the appropriate setting 

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:13.120
 try to go into the game tomorrow 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.920
 to confirm our home strength and here 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.660
 to leave the points 

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:20.080
 I think our environment has that too 

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:22.870
 also accepted and seen the fans the 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.930
 in the stadium was that we stretch far 

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:27.520
 the better team were and the 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:31.600
 Boys have appropriate feedback 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:33.190
 we got there costa maric for a long time 

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.270
 enough to look back on the game 

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.950
 let's look forward 

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:38.080
 we forget times the games lead 

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:39.490
 tomorrow home game and in berlin have something 

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.560
 you as a team for the party 

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.570
 Tomorrow we wanted the game 

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.790
 go 

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:48.040
 quite simply we would like her 

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:50.920
 get points which he does not introduce 

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:53.290
 and a fiber winner like that 

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:56.380
 well presented and our beising 

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:58.360
 and we know that if we are like that 

00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:00.880
 play well afterwards the results will be 

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.860
 coming by itself and that's why 

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:06.370
 We have long analyzed this game 

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:08.760
 kidnapped and yes we want to go back 

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.760
 points
