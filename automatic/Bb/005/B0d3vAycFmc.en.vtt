mechanism<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:17.240> a<00:00:18.240> very<00:00:18.539> nice<00:00:18.779> little<00:00:19.109> puzzle

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
mechanism and a very nice little puzzle

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.019 
mechanism and a very nice little puzzle
and<00:00:21.499> if<00:00:22.499> I<00:00:22.650> can<00:00:22.859> remember<00:00:23.099> how<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.400> open<00:00:23.849> it

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
and if I can remember how to open it

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.429 
and if I can remember how to open it
I'll<00:00:24.419> show<00:00:24.749> you<00:00:24.810> how<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.109> works<00:00:27.230> starts<00:00:28.230> by

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
I'll show you how it works starts by

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.169 
I'll show you how it works starts by
pulling<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.829> two<00:00:29.099> sides<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.579> heart<00:00:29.789> apart

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
pulling the two sides of heart apart

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:37.240 
pulling the two sides of heart apart
like<00:00:30.419> that

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:49.410 

and<00:00:37.790> that<00:00:37.910> would<00:00:38.120> slide<00:00:38.480> closed<00:00:39.410> it<00:00:39.650> up<00:00:39.740> again

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.910 

spisz<00:00:50.420> slides<00:00:50.780> up

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:06.310 

then<00:00:55.789> slides<00:00:56.500> into<00:00:57.500> the<00:00:57.859> notch

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:23.970 

there

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:23.980 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.820 

then<00:01:24.580> again<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:25.240> two<00:01:25.450> halves<00:01:25.750> slide<00:01:26.440> past

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
then again the two halves slide past

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.960 
then again the two halves slide past
each<00:01:27.010> other<00:01:27.220> the<00:01:27.490> left-hand<00:01:27.910> half<00:01:28.090> goes<00:01:28.540> down

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
each other the left-hand half goes down

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:39.190 
each other the left-hand half goes down
right<00:01:30.970> back<00:01:31.270> half<00:01:31.570> goes<00:01:31.870> up

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:51.110 

that<00:01:40.200> piece<00:01:40.469> slides<00:01:40.829> out

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.240 

which<00:01:51.660> allows<00:01:54.260> this<00:01:55.260> piece<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.920> come

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
which allows this piece to come

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:14.070 
which allows this piece to come
backwards

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.020 

and<00:02:14.650> there

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
and there

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:44.490 
and there
and<00:02:16.510> then<00:02:17.790> two<00:02:18.790> halves<00:02:21.690> slide<00:02:22.690> apart

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.050 

not

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:03:11.470 

let's<00:02:49.060> show<00:02:49.299> you<00:02:49.359> that<00:02:50.189> move<00:02:51.189> again

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.099 

I<00:03:11.569> was<00:03:12.170> apart<00:03:12.500> like<00:03:12.739> that

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:20.080 

so<00:03:16.109> these<00:03:16.349> three<00:03:16.650> pieces<00:03:17.930> sit<00:03:18.930> in<00:03:19.109> a<00:03:19.200> slightly

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
so these three pieces sit in a slightly

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.069 
so these three pieces sit in a slightly
unnatural<00:03:22.069> configuration<00:03:23.599> the<00:03:24.599> end<00:03:24.719> of<00:03:24.930> that

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
unnatural configuration the end of that

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:31.720 
unnatural configuration the end of that
piece<00:03:25.519> looks<00:03:26.519> like<00:03:26.790> a<00:03:26.819> letter<00:03:27.060> P<00:03:29.599> just<00:03:30.599> sits<00:03:31.109> in

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
piece looks like a letter P just sits in

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.539 
piece looks like a letter P just sits in
that<00:03:32.730> little<00:03:33.180> look<00:03:34.019> there<00:03:34.409> so<00:03:35.280> I<00:03:35.340> put<00:03:35.519> that

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
that little look there so I put that

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:41.179 
that little look there so I put that
down<00:03:35.819> for<00:03:35.879> a<00:03:36.090> minute<00:03:38.030> this<00:03:39.030> one<00:03:39.299> is<00:03:40.189> hooked

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:41.189 
down for a minute this one is hooked

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:49.129 
down for a minute this one is hooked
around<00:03:41.959> little<00:03:42.959> hook<00:03:43.260> there<00:03:46.129> so<00:03:47.659> we<00:03:48.659> can<00:03:48.870> take

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
around little hook there so we can take

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:54.890 
around little hook there so we can take
those<00:03:49.290> apart<00:03:49.530> like<00:03:49.919> that<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:54.510> other<00:03:54.659> half

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
those apart like that the other half

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:03.440 
those apart like that the other half
slightly<00:03:55.590> trickier<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.129> move<00:04:02.180> this<00:04:03.180> back

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
slightly trickier to move this back

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:13.240 
slightly trickier to move this back
piece<00:04:04.909> slides<00:04:05.909> across<00:04:06.269> and<00:04:07.159> then<00:04:08.159> down

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.670 

and<00:04:13.460> then<00:04:13.970> the<00:04:14.210> right<00:04:14.420> hand<00:04:14.450> beasts<00:04:14.870> comes

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
and then the right hand beasts comes

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:23.170 
and then the right hand beasts comes
down<00:04:16.040> other<00:04:16.670> way<00:04:21.640> so<00:04:22.640> to<00:04:22.670> put<00:04:22.970> it<00:04:23.030> back

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
down other way so to put it back

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:35.550 
down other way so to put it back
together

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:42.580 

starting<00:04:36.520> from<00:04:36.550> that<00:04:36.940> position

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:05:03.630 

helps<00:04:43.280> we<00:04:43.430> go<00:04:43.520> to<00:04:43.610> the<00:04:43.700> right<00:04:43.820> way<00:04:43.970> up

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.780 

you<00:05:04.640> can<00:05:05.090> see<00:05:05.300> the<00:05:05.480> little<00:05:06.130> hell<00:05:07.130> shaped<00:05:07.520> hole

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
you can see the little hell shaped hole

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.290 
you can see the little hell shaped hole
it<00:05:08.390> can<00:05:08.570> go<00:05:08.690> cross<00:05:09.170> or<00:05:09.500> up<00:05:09.770> this<00:05:10.730> is<00:05:10.940> the<00:05:10.970> bar

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
it can go cross or up this is the bar

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.570 
it can go cross or up this is the bar
that<00:05:11.630> has<00:05:12.110> to<00:05:12.260> go<00:05:12.380> into<00:05:12.410> that<00:05:13.210> position<00:05:15.580> so

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
that has to go into that position so

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:32.090 
that has to go into that position so
first<00:05:17.180> of<00:05:17.330> all<00:05:18.610> it<00:05:19.610> slides<00:05:20.090> in<00:05:24.310> cross

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.920 

that's<00:05:32.730> what<00:05:32.970> it<00:05:33.000> will<00:05:33.210> look<00:05:33.240> like<00:05:33.390> as<00:05:33.780> the

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
that's what it will look like as the

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.860 
that's what it will look like as the
finished<00:05:34.260> cube<00:05:35.030> but<00:05:36.030> if<00:05:36.120> you<00:05:36.240> take<00:05:36.450> it<00:05:36.600> across

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
finished cube but if you take it across

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.530 
finished cube but if you take it across
and<00:05:37.260> then<00:05:38.040> up<00:05:40.520> the<00:05:41.520> middle<00:05:41.700> piece<00:05:42.000> then<00:05:42.300> goes

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
and then up the middle piece then goes

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:49.670 
and then up the middle piece then goes
across<00:05:42.960> and<00:05:43.440> right

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.350 

those<00:05:50.310> three<00:05:50.669> pieces<00:05:51.680> are<00:05:52.680> then<00:05:53.000> quite<00:05:54.000> locked

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
those three pieces are then quite locked

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:08.100 
those three pieces are then quite locked
in<00:05:54.630> position<00:05:54.780> and<00:05:55.259> ready<00:05:56.449> to<00:05:57.449> go<00:05:57.600> together

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.850 

this<00:06:08.740> piece<00:06:09.010> has<00:06:09.220> the<00:06:09.430> vertical<00:06:09.910> bar<00:06:10.860> this

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
this piece has the vertical bar this

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.670 
this piece has the vertical bar this
piece<00:06:12.160> has<00:06:12.400> the<00:06:12.580> hook<00:06:12.790> hook<00:06:13.660> goes<00:06:14.080> around<00:06:14.470> the

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
piece has the hook hook goes around the

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:22.559 
piece has the hook hook goes around the
bar

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:22.569 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:25.370 

that

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 
that

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:33.260 

so<00:06:26.010> little<00:06:26.280> niche<00:06:26.520> in<00:06:26.940> there<00:06:28.490> and<00:06:29.540> the<00:06:30.540> P<00:06:32.270> sits

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
so little niche in there and the P sits

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:38.559 
so little niche in there and the P sits
