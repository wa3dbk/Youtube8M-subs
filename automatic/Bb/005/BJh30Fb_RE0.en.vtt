story in mid-february I started
loosening<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.510> soil<00:00:24.779> where<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.260> would<00:00:25.590> plant

my six by six foot watermelon patch
there<00:00:29.550> was<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.699> lot<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.150> digging<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.720> planting

there was a lot of digging and planting

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.770 
there was a lot of digging and planting
to<00:00:31.380> do<00:00:31.529> elsewhere<00:00:32.160> so<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:32.850> didn't<00:00:33.210> get<00:00:33.329> back<00:00:33.540> to

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
to do elsewhere so I didn't get back to

seedlings one foot by four to six feet
which<00:00:46.860> tells<00:00:47.250> me<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.550> they<00:00:48.030> grow<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.989> vine

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
which tells me that they grow in a vine

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.080 
which tells me that they grow in a vine
and<00:00:50.930> with<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.050> kind<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.410> rectangular<00:00:53.399> spacing

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.660 
and with the kind of rectangular spacing
I<00:00:54.270> have<00:00:55.050> here<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.379> think<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.890> best<00:00:56.129> thing<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.399> do

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
I have here I think the best thing to do

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.060 
I have here I think the best thing to do
is<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.539> lay<00:00:57.690> them<00:00:57.899> out<00:00:58.730> like<00:00:59.730> this<00:01:00.120> now<00:01:01.070> came

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
is to lay them out like this now came

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.260 
is to lay them out like this now came
the<00:01:02.100> alfalfa<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:03.270> layer<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.080> dirt<00:01:04.489> more<00:01:05.489> alfalfa

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
the alfalfa a layer of dirt more alfalfa

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.940 
the alfalfa a layer of dirt more alfalfa
more<00:01:07.080> dirt<00:01:08.420> alfalfa<00:01:09.450> not<00:01:09.869> only<00:01:10.080> creates<00:01:10.590> air

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
more dirt alfalfa not only creates air

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.380 
more dirt alfalfa not only creates air
in<00:01:11.340> your<00:01:11.610> soil<00:01:11.939> but<00:01:12.650> nutrients<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:15.150> smells

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
in your soil but nutrients and it smells

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.719 
in your soil but nutrients and it smells
great<00:01:15.920> reminds<00:01:16.920> me<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.159> my<00:01:17.250> grandmother's

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729

barn in Tennessee you know it just

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.649 
barn in Tennessee you know it just
occurred<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:22.049> me<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.380> if<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.850> only<00:01:24.150> have<00:01:24.509> to

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
occurred to me that if you only have to

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.719 
occurred to me that if you only have to
plant<00:01:24.960> them<00:01:25.200> one<00:01:25.650> foot<00:01:25.920> apart

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
plant them one foot apart

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.200 
plant them one foot apart
you<00:01:27.659> just<00:01:27.900> have<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.170> allow<00:01:28.799> for<00:01:29.369> four<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.970> six

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
you just have to allow for four to six

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.450 
you just have to allow for four to six
feet<00:01:30.329> for<00:01:30.869> them<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.229> trail<00:01:31.530> along<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.950> ground

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
feet for them to trail along the ground

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.850 
feet for them to trail along the ground
I<00:01:33.380> did<00:01:34.380> not<00:01:34.590> have<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.130> dig<00:01:35.369> up<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:36.740> 6<00:01:37.740> by<00:01:38.310> 8<00:01:38.579> foot

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860

plot I go to just dug six little holes
for<00:01:50.100> those<00:01:50.610> roots<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:52.970> scooped<00:01:53.970> out<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.210> crater

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
for those roots I scooped out a crater

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.450 
for those roots I scooped out a crater
for<00:01:54.990> each<00:01:55.170> seedling<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:55.770> filled<00:01:56.250> them<00:01:56.430> with

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
patch looked like this Larry and Haley

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.410 
patch looked like this Larry and Haley
passed<00:02:13.040> by<00:02:13.340> and<00:02:13.610> checked<00:02:13.880> on<00:02:14.090> my<00:02:14.209> progress<00:02:16.420> two

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
passed by and checked on my progress two

passed by and checked on my progress two
days<00:02:17.660> later<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:18.530> rain<00:02:18.739> came<00:02:22.480> in<00:02:23.480> May<00:02:23.750> I<00:02:24.080> weeded

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
days later the rain came in May I weeded

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.500 
days later the rain came in May I weeded
and<00:02:24.830> enlarged<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.550> craters<00:02:25.940> around<00:02:25.970> my

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
and enlarged the craters around my

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.380 
and enlarged the craters around my
watermelon<00:02:27.200> seedlings<00:02:27.709> if<00:02:28.640> you<00:02:28.819> have<00:02:29.000> a<00:02:29.030> small

watermelon seedlings if you have a small

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.720 
watermelon seedlings if you have a small
yard<00:02:29.660> like<00:02:29.930> I<00:02:30.140> do<00:02:30.200> it's<00:02:30.830> a<00:02:31.010> great<00:02:31.250> idea<00:02:31.430> to

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
yard like I do it's a great idea to

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.750 
yard like I do it's a great idea to
create<00:02:32.120> a<00:02:32.360> crater<00:02:32.810> around<00:02:33.440> your<00:02:33.620> seedlings<00:02:34.130> to

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
create a crater around your seedlings to

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.970 
create a crater around your seedlings to
capture<00:02:35.239> the<00:02:35.360> water<00:02:35.630> because<00:02:36.200> water<00:02:36.709> is

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
capture the water because water is

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.860 
capture the water because water is
scarce<00:02:37.250> in<00:02:37.580> Southern<00:02:37.940> California<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:38.810> you

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
scarce in Southern California and you

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.080 
scarce in Southern California and you
want<00:02:39.350> to<00:02:39.440> put<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.709> water<00:02:39.890> right<00:02:40.670> where<00:02:40.910> the

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
want to put the water right where the

to but I learned a lot I think my

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.699 
to but I learned a lot I think my
biggest<00:04:13.760> problem<00:04:13.940> is<00:04:14.420> melons<00:04:15.050> need<00:04:15.260> six<00:04:15.560> to

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
biggest problem is melons need six to

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.830 
biggest problem is melons need six to
eight<00:04:15.860> hours<00:04:16.100> of<00:04:16.370> direct<00:04:16.820> Sun<00:04:17.060> every<00:04:17.389> day<00:04:17.419> and

eight hours of direct Sun every day and

eight hours of direct Sun every day and

morning and my pine tree shading in the
afternoon<00:04:23.120> I<00:04:23.360> think<00:04:23.540> my<00:04:23.840> production<00:04:24.140> was<00:04:24.500> more

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
afternoon I think my production was more

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.950 
afternoon I think my production was more
like<00:04:24.860> three<00:04:25.460> hours<00:04:25.790> of<00:04:25.820> direct<00:04:26.270> Sun<00:04:26.510> every<00:04:26.780> day

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
like three hours of direct Sun every day

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.590 
like three hours of direct Sun every day
