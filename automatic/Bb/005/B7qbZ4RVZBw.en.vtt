00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
and this last image i think it's one of

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.770 
and this last image i think it's one of
the<00:01:14.340> best<00:01:14.580> because<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.030> shows<00:01:15.240> how<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.570> all

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
the best because it shows how it all

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.690 
the best because it shows how it all
opens<00:01:16.229> up<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.650> can<00:01:16.799> be<00:01:16.830> played<00:01:17.189> well<00:01:17.490> with

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
opens up and it can be played well with

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.700 
opens up and it can be played well with
inside<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.960> they've<00:01:19.049> done<00:01:19.259> similar<00:01:19.680> things

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
inside and they've done similar things

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.830 
inside and they've done similar things
with<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.159> Simpsons<00:01:20.549> house<00:01:20.700> as<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.479> can<00:01:21.630> see

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
in the Simpsons house and the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.359 
in the Simpsons house and the
kwik-e-mart<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.700> can<00:01:23.880> both<00:01:24.060> open<00:01:24.509> them<00:01:24.659> up

overall<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.610> really<00:01:27.420> really<00:01:27.810> strong<00:01:27.960> set

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
overall a really really strong set

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.249 
overall a really really strong set
coming<00:01:28.979> with<00:01:29.280> all<00:01:30.180> right<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.600> minifigures<00:01:31.110> a

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
coming with all right so minifigures a

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.020 
coming with all right so minifigures a
lot<00:01:31.470> people<00:01:31.650> are<00:01:31.950> disappointed<00:01:32.340> but<00:01:32.909> I'm

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
lot people are disappointed but I'm

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.460 
lot people are disappointed but I'm
actually<00:01:33.180> quite<00:01:33.420> satisfied<00:01:34.140> we're<00:01:34.290> getting

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
actually quite satisfied we're getting

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.289 
actually quite satisfied we're getting
to<00:01:34.650> exclusive<00:01:35.159> minifigures<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.700> think<00:01:36.119> that's

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
to exclusive minifigures I think that's

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.240 
to exclusive minifigures I think that's
enough<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.810> probably<00:01:37.470> going<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.680> be<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.799> load<00:01:38.070> of

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
enough is probably going to be a load of

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.249 
enough is probably going to be a load of
new<00:01:38.369> pieces<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.509> only<00:01:39.720> thing<00:01:39.869> I'm<00:01:39.990> worried

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
new pieces the only thing I'm worried

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.350 
new pieces the only thing I'm worried
about<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.710> price<00:01:41.130> now<00:01:41.729> two<00:01:41.790> hundred

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
about is the price now two hundred

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.569 
about is the price now two hundred
dollars<00:01:42.720> not<00:01:43.200> familiar<00:01:43.649> with<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.920> dollar<00:01:44.100> but

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
dollars not familiar with the dollar but

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.280 
dollars not familiar with the dollar but
I<00:01:44.640> know<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:45.180> will<00:01:45.299> still<00:01:45.630> be<00:01:45.659> quite<00:01:46.049> high<00:01:46.259> in

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
I know it will still be quite high in

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.230 
I know it will still be quite high in
the<00:01:46.530> UK<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.220> if<00:01:47.670> we're<00:01:47.850> going<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.060> pay<00:01:48.210> a

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
the UK and if we're going to pay a

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.569 
the UK and if we're going to pay a
hundred<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.720> forty<00:01:49.079> or<00:01:49.229> even<00:01:49.470> 160<00:01:50.220> pounds<00:01:50.520> in

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
hundred and forty or even 160 pounds in

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.130 
hundred and forty or even 160 pounds in
the<00:01:50.670> UK<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:52.170> an<00:01:52.670> absolute<00:01:53.670> ripoff<00:01:54.479> no<00:01:54.899> one

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
the UK that is an absolute ripoff no one

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.410 
the UK that is an absolute ripoff no one
to<00:01:55.350> pay<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:56.280> much<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.119> not<00:01:57.299> an

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
to pay that much that is not an

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.389 
to pay that much that is not an
acceptable<00:01:57.659> price<00:01:58.020> for<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.740> set<00:01:58.979> like<00:01:59.130> this

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
acceptable price for a set like this

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.499 
acceptable price for a set like this
it's<00:01:59.850> not<00:01:59.909> worth<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:01.100> it's<00:02:02.100> too<00:02:02.430> small<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:03.329> pay

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
it's not worth it it's too small to pay

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.560 
it's not worth it it's too small to pay
that<00:02:03.689> much<00:02:04.670> looking<00:02:05.670> at<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.909> set<00:02:06.149> though<00:02:06.329> I

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
that much looking at the set though I

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.080 
that much looking at the set though I
can<00:02:06.990> see<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.530> small<00:02:08.220> so<00:02:08.610> it's<00:02:08.970> not

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
can see that it is small so it's not

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.029 
can see that it is small so it's not
just<00:02:09.149> looking<00:02:09.599> from<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.020> images<00:02:10.470> if<00:02:10.739> you

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
just looking from the images if you

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.790 
just looking from the images if you
count<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.430> plate<00:02:11.670> it's<00:02:12.090> actually<00:02:12.450> quite

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
count the plate it's actually quite

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.590 
count the plate it's actually quite
all<00:02:12.950> set<00:02:13.250> I<00:02:13.490> don't<00:02:14.090> know<00:02:14.150> what<00:02:14.300> they're<00:02:14.330> using

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
all set I don't know what they're using

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.520 
all set I don't know what they're using
for<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:14.930> base<00:02:15.110> but<00:02:15.650> um<00:02:15.860> of<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.460> set<00:02:16.700> um<00:02:17.260> but<00:02:18.260> I

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
for the base but um of the set um but I

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.470 
for the base but um of the set um but I
hope<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:19.400> it's<00:02:19.580> a<00:02:19.670> base<00:02:19.850> plate<00:02:20.120> even<00:02:20.390> though

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
hope that it's a base plate even though

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.820 
hope that it's a base plate even though
it'd<00:02:20.540> probably<00:02:20.750> be<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:21.020> mixture<00:02:21.440> of<00:02:21.590> some

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
it'd probably be a mixture of some

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.130 
it'd probably be a mixture of some
assortment<00:02:22.580> of<00:02:22.670> some<00:02:23.210> lime<00:02:23.480> green<00:02:23.870> base

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
assortment of some lime green base

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
plates that's what they always do some

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.360 
plates that's what they always do some
