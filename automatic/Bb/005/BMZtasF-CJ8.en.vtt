00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
know if that's completely true in the

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.310 
know if that's completely true in the
dynamics<00:01:19.130> of<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:19.460> gun<00:01:19.670> but<00:01:20.450> it<00:01:20.690> did<00:01:20.960> feel<00:01:21.260> like

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
dynamics of the gun but it did feel like

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.650 
dynamics of the gun but it did feel like
I<00:01:21.680> was<00:01:21.710> getting<00:01:22.010> more<00:01:22.490> kills<00:01:22.850> from<00:01:23.300> a<00:01:23.450> long

yes the reason i said that like that was

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.979 
yes the reason i said that like that was
because<00:02:50.100> i<00:02:50.280> don't<00:02:50.670> want<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:51.000> screw<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:51.900> up

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
because i don't want to screw it up

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.170 
because i don't want to screw it up
because<00:02:52.350> i<00:02:52.470> remember<00:02:52.620> in<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.040> video<00:02:53.340> i<00:02:53.370> put<00:02:53.640> HK

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
because i remember in the video i put HK

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.470 
because i remember in the video i put HK
but<00:02:55.050> it<00:02:55.140> yes<00:02:55.290> HS<00:02:55.739> tense<00:02:55.980> with<00:02:56.730> no<00:02:56.910> attachment

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
but it yes HS tense with no attachment

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.510 
but it yes HS tense with no attachment
the<00:02:57.540> only<00:02:57.750> attachment<00:02:58.200> or<00:02:58.320> is<00:02:58.500> is<00:02:58.830> to<00:02:59.160> do<00:02:59.310> weel

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
the only attachment or is is to do weel

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.300 
the only attachment or is is to do weel
done<00:02:59.760> i<00:03:00.150> did<00:03:00.870> find<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.470> HS<00:03:01.800> tens<00:03:02.070> had

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
done i did find that the HS tens had

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.020 
done i did find that the HS tens had
little<00:03:02.970> recoil<00:03:03.780> when<00:03:04.020> you<00:03:04.080> fire<00:03:04.200> them<00:03:05.030> alone

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
little recoil when you fire them alone

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.699 
little recoil when you fire them alone
when<00:03:06.299> he<00:03:06.330> didn't<00:03:07.290> have<00:03:07.500> them<00:03:08.010> jewelry<00:03:08.640> over

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
when he didn't have them jewelry over

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.949 
when he didn't have them jewelry over
that<00:03:10.709> actually<00:03:11.370> was<00:03:11.580> really<00:03:12.360> fun<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:12.630> use<00:03:12.810> i

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
that actually was really fun to use i

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.600 
that actually was really fun to use i
had<00:03:13.320> a<00:03:13.350> lot<00:03:13.530> of<00:03:13.560> fun<00:03:13.769> the<00:03:13.890> only<00:03:14.130> problem<00:03:14.459> here

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
had a lot of fun the only problem here

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.360 
had a lot of fun the only problem here
is<00:03:14.820> i<00:03:15.170> didn't<00:03:16.170> have<00:03:16.320> a<00:03:16.350> lot<00:03:16.530> of<00:03:16.590> footage<00:03:16.920> that

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
is i didn't have a lot of footage that

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.150 
is i didn't have a lot of footage that
was<00:03:18.180> good<00:03:18.480> because<00:03:18.989> i<00:03:19.080> couldn't<00:03:19.290> find<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.739> so<00:03:20.010> a

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
was good because i couldn't find it so a

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.580 
was good because i couldn't find it so a
lot<00:03:20.459> of<00:03:20.489> me<00:03:20.700> running

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
lot of me running

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.610 
lot of me running
so<00:03:22.590> here<00:03:22.739> we<00:03:22.830> go<00:03:22.940> from<00:03:23.940> dual<00:03:24.239> wield<00:03:24.480> so<00:03:24.780> before

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
so here we go from dual wield so before

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.199 
so here we go from dual wield so before
I<00:03:25.650> get<00:03:25.860> into<00:03:26.010> these<00:03:26.250> I'm<00:03:26.580> just<00:03:26.849> keep<00:03:27.060> in<00:03:27.180> mind

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
I get into these I'm just keep in mind

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.190 
I get into these I'm just keep in mind
too<00:03:27.739> if<00:03:28.739> you're<00:03:28.890> going<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.040> use<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.340> HS<00:03:29.670> 10s

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
too if you're going to use the HS 10s

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.930 
too if you're going to use the HS 10s
your<00:03:31.200> you're<00:03:31.769> going<00:03:31.890> to<00:03:31.950> be<00:03:32.069> looking<00:03:32.340> at<00:03:32.519> what

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
your you're going to be looking at what

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.580 
your you're going to be looking at what
do<00:03:33.030> you<00:03:33.090> want<00:03:33.299> more<00:03:33.510> you<00:03:33.810> want<00:03:33.989> more<00:03:34.140> ammo

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
do you want more you want more ammo

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.390 
do you want more you want more ammo
because<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.489> HS<00:03:35.879> tens<00:03:36.180> only<00:03:36.780> have<00:03:37.400> the

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
because the HS tens only have the

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:46.070 
because the HS tens only have the
failing<00:03:39.299> up<00:03:39.390> for<00:03:40.220> four<00:03:41.220> shots<00:03:41.750> yeah<00:03:42.750> each<00:03:45.080> and

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
failing up for four shots yeah each and

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.720 
failing up for four shots yeah each and
it's<00:03:46.830> not<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.160> strongest<00:03:47.519> of<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.299> shotguns<00:03:48.780> I

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
it's not the strongest of the shotguns I

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.610 
it's not the strongest of the shotguns I
think<00:03:50.730> once<00:03:51.569> again<00:03:51.840> I<00:03:51.989> don't<00:03:52.260> know<00:03:52.349> game

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
think once again I don't know game

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.430 
think once again I don't know game
mechanics<00:03:53.069> of<00:03:53.280> this<00:03:53.459> what<00:03:54.150> besides<00:03:54.420> to<00:03:55.319> be

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
mechanics of this what besides to be

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.490 
mechanics of this what besides to be
stronger<00:03:55.739> what<00:03:56.010> doesn't<00:03:56.510> but<00:03:57.510> anyways<00:03:57.810> so<00:03:58.349> if

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
stronger what doesn't but anyways so if

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.130 
stronger what doesn't but anyways so if
you<00:03:58.650> want<00:03:58.829> accuracy<00:03:59.220> go<00:03:59.579> with<00:03:59.790> the<00:04:00.890> HSN<00:04:01.890> out

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
you want accuracy go with the HSN out

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.670 
you want accuracy go with the HSN out
the<00:04:04.140> attachment<00:04:05.269> so<00:04:06.440> speaking<00:04:07.440> about

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
the attachment so speaking about

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.900 
the attachment so speaking about
attachments<00:04:08.340> here<00:04:08.609> we<00:04:08.700> go<00:04:08.879> with<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:10.670> do<00:04:11.670> wield

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
attachments here we go with the do wield

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.490 
attachments here we go with the do wield
it<00:04:12.329> just<00:04:12.569> doesn't<00:04:12.840> see<00:04:13.140> what<00:04:13.260> i<00:04:13.319> did<00:04:13.349> there

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
it just doesn't see what i did there

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.520 
it just doesn't see what i did there

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
wield you get a lot more punch for your

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.930 
wield you get a lot more punch for your
board<00:04:24.150> packet

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
board packet

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.190

punch<00:04:26.620> some<00:04:27.620> sort<00:04:27.950> of<00:04:28.010> analogy<00:04:28.550> like<00:04:28.700> that<00:04:29.200> it

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
punch some sort of analogy like that it

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.050 
punch some sort of analogy like that it
honestly<00:04:30.410> wasn't<00:04:30.890> too<00:04:31.130> bad<00:04:31.340> I'm<00:04:31.580> not<00:04:31.640> a<00:04:31.850> big

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
honestly wasn't too bad I'm not a big
