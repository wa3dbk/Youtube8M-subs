squirrels<00:01:06.720> are<00:01:06.990> not<00:01:08.360> normally<00:01:09.920> kept<00:01:10.920> as<00:01:11.100> pets

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:24.520 

but<00:01:17.090> yeah<00:01:18.090> they<00:01:19.080> are<00:01:20.090> they<00:01:21.090> are<00:01:21.150> nowadays<00:01:21.390> and

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.830 

they<00:01:25.530> sometimes<00:01:25.860> would<00:01:26.310> make<00:01:26.630> sometimes<00:01:27.630> make

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
they sometimes would make sometimes make

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.249

better<00:01:28.049> pets<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.590> hamsters<00:01:29.540> I<00:01:30.540> wouldn't

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
better pets and hamsters I wouldn't

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.219 
better pets and hamsters I wouldn't
necessarily<00:01:32.040> recommend<00:01:33.000> them<00:01:33.600> as<00:01:33.750> children's

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
necessarily recommend them as children's

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.120 
necessarily recommend them as children's
pets<00:01:34.500> because<00:01:34.860> they<00:01:35.340> can<00:01:35.549> be<00:01:35.700> kind<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.060> wild

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
pets because they can be kind of wild

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.390 
pets because they can be kind of wild
but<00:01:38.479> that<00:01:39.479> it's<00:01:39.840> usually<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.950> females

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
but that it's usually just the females

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.260 
but that it's usually just the females
that<00:01:41.579> are<00:01:41.670> more<00:01:42.420> wild<00:01:42.960> than<00:01:43.049> males<00:01:43.409> and

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
that are more wild than males and

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.120 
that are more wild than males and
Ariel's<00:01:45.270> demonstrating<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.140> right<00:01:46.530> now<00:01:47.210> and

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
Ariel's demonstrating that right now and

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.859 
Ariel's demonstrating that right now and
I'll<00:01:50.130> fenwick<00:01:50.880> he's<00:01:51.240> going<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.540> be<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> lot

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
I'll fenwick he's going to be a lot

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.490 
I'll fenwick he's going to be a lot
easier<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.470> film<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:54.049> he'll<00:01:55.049> probably<00:01:55.320> be

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
easier to film so he'll probably be

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.209 
easier to film so he'll probably be
looking<00:01:55.649> forward<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.130> him<00:01:58.009> because<00:01:59.009> he's<00:01:59.189> a

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
looking forward to him because he's a

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.720 
looking forward to him because he's a
lot<00:01:59.490> more<00:01:59.520> tame<00:02:02.000> so

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
lot more tame so

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.670 
lot more tame so
yeah<00:02:04.730> you<00:02:04.850> might<00:02:05.180> object<00:02:05.360> to<00:02:05.810> having<00:02:06.140> a<00:02:06.440> wild

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680
