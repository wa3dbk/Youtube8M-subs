00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
shock or not but I'm not even unplugging

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.390 
shock or not but I'm not even unplugging
this<00:01:06.960> okay<00:01:07.729> so<00:01:08.729> here<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.090> actually<00:01:10.070> my<00:01:11.070> stick

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
this okay so here is actually my stick

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.969 
this okay so here is actually my stick
as<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.820> can<00:01:11.970> see<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.479> look<00:01:13.110> up<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.470> down<00:01:13.680> it's<00:01:13.890> a

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
as you can see I look up and down it's a

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.570 
as you can see I look up and down it's a
lot<00:01:14.310> quicker<00:01:15.080> so<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.530> may<00:01:16.799> actually<00:01:17.009> need

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
lot quicker so this may actually need

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.580 
lot quicker so this may actually need
your<00:01:18.030> sensitivity<00:01:18.750> adjustment<00:01:18.840> I'm<00:01:19.380> not<00:01:19.530> sure

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
your sensitivity adjustment I'm not sure

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.649 
your sensitivity adjustment I'm not sure
actually<00:01:20.009> this<00:01:20.880> feels<00:01:21.119> like<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.299> brand<00:01:21.630> new

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
actually this feels like a brand new

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.380 
actually this feels like a brand new
controller<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.320> me<00:01:22.549> so<00:01:24.680> yeah<00:01:25.680> and

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390

controller to me so yeah and
it's<00:01:27.900> pretty<00:01:28.050> much<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.650> I'll<00:01:28.740> do<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.010> real

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
it's pretty much it and I'll do a real

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
it's pretty much it and I'll do a real
quick<00:01:29.250> up<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.120> down<00:01:30.300> look<00:01:30.570> for<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.840> guys<00:01:35.240> and

quick up and down look for you guys and

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.880 
quick up and down look for you guys and
he<00:01:36.360> knows<00:01:36.540> how<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.780> didn't<00:01:37.080> unplug<00:01:37.440> it<00:01:37.710> right

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
he knows how I didn't unplug it right

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.880 
he knows how I didn't unplug it right
guys<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.369> most<00:01:38.580> how<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.850> did<00:01:39.000> not<00:01:39.119> plug<00:01:39.360> it

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
guys the most how it did not plug it

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.950 
guys the most how it did not plug it
that's<00:01:40.890> because<00:01:41.330> i'm<00:01:42.330> using<00:01:42.690> the<00:01:42.780> same

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
that's because i'm using the same

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.170 
that's because i'm using the same
controller<00:01:43.410> I<00:01:43.710> mean<00:01:44.490> there's<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.729> possibility

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
controller I mean there's a possibility

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.170 
controller I mean there's a possibility
I<00:01:45.360> could<00:01:45.540> just<00:01:45.869> like<00:01:46.050> leave<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.950> case<00:01:47.280> on<00:01:47.610> done

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
I could just like leave the case on done

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.820 
I could just like leave the case on done
and<00:01:48.479> it'll<00:01:48.930> work<00:01:49.200> just<00:01:49.229> fine<00:01:49.530> without<00:01:49.650> it

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
and it'll work just fine without it

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.430 
and it'll work just fine without it
which<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.400> does<00:01:50.640> but<00:01:51.090> after<00:01:51.900> getting<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.229> same

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
which it does but after getting the same

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.520 
which it does but after getting the same
result<00:01:52.590> now<00:01:52.950> with<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.250> case<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.200> it<00:01:55.200> works

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
result now with the case on and it works

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.560 
result now with the case on and it works
perfectly<00:01:57.290> so<00:01:59.000> go<00:02:00.000> ahead<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.240> use<00:02:00.390> my
