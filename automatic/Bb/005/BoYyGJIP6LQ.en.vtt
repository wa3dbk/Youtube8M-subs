00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.170
 hello that as they are today we are going to 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.460
 Learn how to make these gift boxes 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.759
 designs inspired by children 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.610
 You can also use it for confectioners 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.490
 at a children's party I hope that you 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.980
 like it is very easy to do you need 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.350
 these yellow cardboard materials 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.750
 black construction paper some cardboard 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.490
 white scissors an object to mark 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.010
 Folds the size of the cardboard 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.710
 yellow should come 20 centimeters more 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.360
 1 centimeter for the tab x 26 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.370
 centimeters long 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.410
 we are going to make some marks at 10 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.600
 centimeters of the side where it measures 20 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.879
 centimeters and we're going to join those points 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.920
 we mark the fold well do not use 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.379
 pencil only the object to mark the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.300
 fold we can help with the scissors 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.880
 to press much better and the same 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.250
 let's do with the little eyelash 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.740
 with the cardboard in this position and a 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.340
 round object we are going to round the 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.470
 sides of the rectangle in this way and 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.690
 also placing the round object in the 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.970
 start and end point of the first 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.580
 curve let's draw another curve in 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.350
 otherwise we mark the 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.350
 fold and erase the pencil line 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.580
 in such a way that it looks like this should be 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.580
 perfectly mark the curve so that 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.800
 we do not fight in folding it after 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.020
 we cut the surplus and we erase 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.939
 all lines of the pencil 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.729
 as for the piece of cardboard 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.310
 white let's cut it in such a way 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.110
 that fits the children's glasses 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.090
 has to be so perfect me by 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.729
 example to draw the lenses I used 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.469
 a circular object that is a cover and 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.149
 was looking for smaller objects to 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:44.459
 go forming circles to the center to 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.979
 form the lenses and to take advantage of everything 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:49.200
 the cardboard plastic inside the 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.850
 Drawing of the lenses draw some 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.950
 circles that will form the eyes of 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.719
 Children can also cut out the glasses 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.030
 of a gray cardboard but as not 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:59.880
 I had her, I decided to paint them with a 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.619
 we cut it out and if necessary 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.299
 we take a color retouch 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.549
 also the circles of the center that are going 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.709
 to form the eyes we arrange them in the 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.479
 position that we want to have the lenses and 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:11.160
 let's cut out two more circles 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.989
 small that will end up forming the 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.350
 little eyes you can help with a 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.240
 drill 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.190
 and we're also going to cut some two 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.470
 strips of black cardboard that 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.470
 will finish forming the lenses this is 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.550
 of the thickness that you want I left them 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.170
 approximately 1 centimeter of 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.840
 thick when I 'm well accommodated 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.290
 we only add glue and the 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.290
 we stick 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.520
 to finish we will close the box 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.670
 putting white glue on the 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.590
 little eyelash and we will be necessary 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.600
 that we mark the fold on the cardboard 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.610
 black that will form the lenses and the other 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.500
 side the half circle so that it does not 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.720
 have no problem in doubling when 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.550
 we are going to open it from this 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.120
 way and very carefully let's go 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.120
 bending 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.850
 This is our box of gifts 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.310
 closed on one side we can put 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.040
 glue we add the gift and 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.350
 we finished folding the other side and so 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.150
 our box is already there you can also 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.220
 make smaller boxes for the 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.130
 Children who have only one eye 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.350
 yellow cardboard instead of measuring 26 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.650
 centimeters we're going to cut it to the 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.670
 half and follows the same procedure 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.140
