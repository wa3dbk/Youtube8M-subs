hi I'm John Wilson
I'm<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.360> certified<00:00:12.540> casting<00:00:13.170> instructor<00:00:13.650> and

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
I'm a certified casting instructor and

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.860 
I'm a certified casting instructor and
guide<00:00:13.799> in<00:00:14.040> Arkansas<00:00:14.480> today<00:00:15.480> we're<00:00:15.690> going<00:00:15.780> to

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
guide in Arkansas today we're going to

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.790 
guide in Arkansas today we're going to
talk<00:00:16.080> about<00:00:16.230> role<00:00:16.890> casting<00:00:17.720> role<00:00:18.720> cast<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.320> one

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
talk about role casting role cast is one

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.500 
talk about role casting role cast is one
of<00:00:19.920> those<00:00:20.010> casts<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:20.580> we<00:00:20.699> need<00:00:20.880> almost<00:00:21.210> every

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
of those casts that we need almost every

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.800 
of those casts that we need almost every
day<00:00:21.689> but<00:00:22.529> relatively<00:00:23.400> few<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:23.730> us<00:00:23.910> understand

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
day but relatively few of us understand

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.400 
day but relatively few of us understand
exactly<00:00:24.930> how<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.500> thing<00:00:25.769> needs<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.070> work<00:00:27.410> -

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
exactly how the thing needs to work -

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.529 
exactly how the thing needs to work -
the<00:00:28.529> most<00:00:28.710> important<00:00:29.189> factors<00:00:29.640> in<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:30.269> roll

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
the most important factors in a roll

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.799 
the most important factors in a roll
cast<00:00:30.810> are<00:00:31.170> first<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.070> all<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:33.000> D<00:00:33.239> loop<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.660> D

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
cast are first of all the D loop the D

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.209 
cast are first of all the D loop the D
loops<00:00:34.050> where<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.320> get<00:00:34.440> your<00:00:34.469> power<00:00:34.620> from<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.160> a

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
loops where you get your power from in a

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.370 
loops where you get your power from in a
role<00:00:35.370> cast<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:36.270> that's<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:36.870> basically

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
role cast and that's this is basically

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.190 
role cast and that's this is basically
your<00:00:37.559> back<00:00:37.800> cast<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.570> the<00:00:39.570> D<00:00:39.780> loop<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
your back cast and the D loop is the

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.400 
your back cast and the D loop is the
line<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.770> forms<00:00:40.980> behind<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.960> the<00:00:42.960> larger

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
line that forms behind you the larger

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.380 
line that forms behind you the larger
the<00:00:43.530> D<00:00:43.710> loop<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.520> more<00:00:44.700> power<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.270> have

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
the D loop the more power that you have

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.750 
the D loop the more power that you have
available<00:00:45.510> for<00:00:46.079> your<00:00:46.140> forward<00:00:46.500> roll<00:00:46.680> cast<00:00:46.950> if

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
available for your forward roll cast if

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.330 
available for your forward roll cast if
you<00:00:47.969> have<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.120> small<00:00:48.480> D<00:00:48.750> loop<00:00:49.039> or<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.160> just

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
you have a small D loop or it just

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.560 
you have a small D loop or it just
barely<00:00:50.520> gets<00:00:50.789> behind<00:00:51.180> you

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
barely gets behind you

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.060 
barely gets behind you
then<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.050> have<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.199> limited<00:00:52.559> amount<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.860> power

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
then you have a limited amount of power

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.729 
then you have a limited amount of power
for<00:00:53.640> your<00:00:53.760> role<00:00:53.910> cast<00:00:54.180> forward<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:55.379> second

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
for your role cast forward the second

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.779 
for your role cast forward the second
thing<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.239> what<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.480> plane<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:58.020> your<00:00:58.170> cast

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
thing is what is the plane of your cast

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.270 
thing is what is the plane of your cast
if<00:00:59.789> your<00:01:00.059> standard<00:01:00.449> overhead<00:01:00.840> casting<00:01:01.440> your

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
if your standard overhead casting your

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.230 
if your standard overhead casting your
line<00:01:02.489> comes<00:01:02.879> up<00:01:03.690> high<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.290> then<00:01:04.890> down<00:01:05.100> low<00:01:05.369> and

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
line comes up high and then down low and

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.240 
line comes up high and then down low and
basically<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.720> line<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.439> opposition<00:01:07.830> to

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
basically that line is in opposition to

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.910 
basically that line is in opposition to
your<00:01:08.369> forward<00:01:08.640> cast<00:01:09.530> it's<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.619> little<00:01:10.799> more

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
your forward cast it's a little more

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.969 
your forward cast it's a little more
difficult<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.790> role<00:01:12.000> cast<00:01:12.409> because<00:01:13.409> as<00:01:13.830> you

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
difficult in a role cast because as you

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.520 
difficult in a role cast because as you
can<00:01:14.130> see<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:15.000> line<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.450> low<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.049> you're

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
can see the line is low and you're

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.350 
can see the line is low and you're
trying<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.009> throw<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.340> line<00:01:17.490> up<00:01:17.759> high<00:01:18.000> and

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
trying to throw the line up high and

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.200 
trying to throw the line up high and
then<00:01:18.900> back<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.259> down<00:01:19.439> low<00:01:19.650> again<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.060> has<00:01:21.180> a

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
then back to down low again so it has a

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.510 
then back to down low again so it has a
tendency<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.840> want<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.170> pull<00:01:22.439> up<00:01:22.619> into<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.369> air

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
tendency to want to pull up into the air

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.230 
tendency to want to pull up into the air
and<00:01:23.850> land<00:01:24.840> in<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.049> pile<00:01:25.229> down<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.680> front<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.979> you

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
and land in a pile down in front of you

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.760 
and land in a pile down in front of you
so<00:01:27.240> there's<00:01:27.450> there's<00:01:27.930> one<00:01:28.140> quick<00:01:28.350> maneuver

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
so there's there's one quick maneuver

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.530 
so there's there's one quick maneuver
that<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.009> can<00:01:29.159> do<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.939> kind<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.150> help<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.420> get

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
that you can do to kind of help you get

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.880 
that you can do to kind of help you get
to<00:01:31.110> help<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.380> get<00:01:31.560> rid<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:32.930> if<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.590> start

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
to help you get rid of that if you start

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.289 
to help you get rid of that if you start
with<00:01:35.070> your<00:01:35.159> D<00:01:35.340> loop<00:01:35.549> back<00:01:35.759> here

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
with your D loop back here

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.780 
with your D loop back here
start<00:01:36.900> with<00:01:37.020> your<00:01:37.140> hand<00:01:37.350> high<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.009> as<00:01:38.610> you

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
start with your hand high and as you

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.359 
start with your hand high and as you
come<00:01:39.030> forward<00:01:39.470> down<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.500> delay<00:01:41.159> your

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
come forward down and delay your

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.639 
come forward down and delay your
reaction<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.090> what<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.110> does<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.590> allows

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
reaction and what that does is it allows

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.120 
reaction and what that does is it allows
the<00:01:43.829> D<00:01:44.159> loop<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.970> kick<00:01:45.270> up<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.689> form<00:01:46.470> higher<00:01:46.799> in

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
the D loop to kick up and form higher in

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.969 
the D loop to kick up and form higher in
your<00:01:47.220> back<00:01:47.430> cast<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.149> throw<00:01:49.049> lower<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.649> that

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
your back cast and throw lower and that

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.889 
your back cast and throw lower and that
will<00:01:50.070> give<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.340> nice<00:01:50.640> tight<00:01:51.210> roll<00:01:51.630> cast

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
will give you a nice tight roll cast

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:58.020 
will give you a nice tight roll cast
loop<00:01:52.229> okay<00:01:52.740> let's<00:01:52.920> try<00:01:53.009> one

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.330 

I'll<00:01:58.930> tip<00:01:59.170> up<00:01:59.380> we're<00:01:59.770> going<00:01:59.860> to<00:01:59.950> develop<00:02:00.160> a

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
I'll tip up we're going to develop a

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.950 
I'll tip up we're going to develop a
loop<00:02:00.520> and<00:02:01.890> pal<00:02:02.940> line<00:02:03.940> rolled<00:02:04.210> totally<00:02:04.810> out

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
loop and pal line rolled totally out

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.200 
loop and pal line rolled totally out
nice<00:02:05.320> and<00:02:05.350> straight<00:02:05.700> if<00:02:06.700> you<00:02:06.790> do<00:02:06.910> that<00:02:07.090> I<00:02:07.120> think

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
nice and straight if you do that I think
