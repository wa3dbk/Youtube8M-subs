00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
so this is our Black Mamba to system

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.390 
so this is our Black Mamba to system
anyone<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.819> a<00:00:06.290> complete<00:00:07.290> system<00:00:07.589> in<00:00:07.859> one<00:00:08.069> which

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
anyone to a complete system in one which

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.400 
anyone to a complete system in one which
is<00:00:08.429> we<00:00:08.700> have<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.120> panel<00:00:09.480> on<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.630> top<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:10.170> power

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
is we have the panel on the top to power

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.370 
is we have the panel on the top to power
button<00:00:10.769> on<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:12.000> top<00:00:12.210> when<00:00:12.870> they<00:00:12.990> have<00:00:13.170> is<00:00:13.349> a

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
and the zotac I ITF port z68 is also

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.910 
and the zotac I ITF port z68 is also
overclockable<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.840> at<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.350> bottom<00:00:25.500> we<00:00:25.830> have

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
overclockable and at the bottom we have

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.859 
overclockable and at the bottom we have
on<00:00:26.400> x79<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.180> full<00:00:27.570> house<00:00:27.779> system<00:00:28.230> which<00:00:28.920> is

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
on x79 a full house system which is

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:31.460 
on x79 a full house system which is
five-thousand-dollar<00:00:30.869> just<00:00:31.260> for<00:00:31.380> the

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
five-thousand-dollar just for the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.330 
five-thousand-dollar just for the
success<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.309> second<00:00:33.090> half<00:00:33.350> so<00:00:34.350> what<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.130> mean

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
success the second half so what it mean

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.639 
success the second half so what it mean
having<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.910> server<00:00:36.239> on<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.450> top<00:00:36.750> which<00:00:37.469> is

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
having a server on the top which is

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.350 
having a server on the top which is
basically<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.129> lot<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.640> people<00:00:38.940> stop<00:00:39.090> doing

from<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.219> on<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.670> top<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:50.940> know<00:00:51.149> top<00:00:51.629> server

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
from the on the top you know top server

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.900 
from the on the top you know top server
to<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.350> bottom<00:00:52.680> basically<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.250> was<00:00:53.640> always

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
to the bottom basically that was always

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.600 
to the bottom basically that was always
in<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.270> very<00:00:54.510> simple<00:00:55.050> network<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.860> network

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
in a very simple network of network

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.310 
in a very simple network of network
cable<00:00:59.399> loop<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.570> from<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.989> back<00:01:01.170> to

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
cable loop it from the back to

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.860 
cable loop it from the back to
back<00:01:01.530> which<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.579> give<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.969> let<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.570> allowed

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
back which is give you let you allowed

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.920 
back which is give you let you allowed
you<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.290> access<00:01:04.920> putting<00:01:05.610> data<00:01:05.820> from<00:01:06.119> bottom

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
you to access putting data from bottom

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.740 
you to access putting data from bottom
part<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.500> server<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.390> from<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.510> server

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
part to the server and from the server

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.170 
part to the server and from the server
we<00:01:10.049> have<00:01:10.229> an<00:01:10.380> orgy<00:01:10.560> connect<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.670> bottom<00:01:12.030> we

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
we have an orgy connect to the bottom we

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.940 
we have an orgy connect to the bottom we
can<00:01:12.360> basically<00:01:12.570> overclocking<00:01:13.500> dynamically

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
can basically overclocking dynamically

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.580 
can basically overclocking dynamically
from<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.400> top<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.970> bottom<00:01:15.170> why<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.229> gave

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
from the top to the bottom why you gave

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.050 
from the top to the bottom why you gave
me<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.890> want<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.130> push<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> little<00:01:17.400> more<00:01:17.670> you

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
me you want to push a little more you

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.560 
me you want to push a little more you
can<00:01:18.210> do<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.590> and<00:01:19.590> at<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.369> bottom<00:01:20.549> sir<00:01:21.119> am<00:01:21.390> I

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
can do that and at the bottom sir am I

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.120 
can do that and at the bottom sir am I
on<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.840> bottom<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> machine<00:01:22.530> can<00:01:22.979> do<00:01:23.100> a

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
on the bottom of the machine can do a

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.660 
on the bottom of the machine can do a
lot<00:01:23.369> more
