00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
3GS or something and other thing I want

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.060 
3GS or something and other thing I want
to<00:00:42.629> mention<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:43.110> in<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.559> background<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:44.040> see

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
to mention is in the background you see

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.340 
to mention is in the background you see
those<00:00:44.730> black<00:00:45.000> bars<00:00:45.300> on<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.629> side<00:00:45.840> we<00:00:46.079> can't

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
those black bars on the side we can't

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.830 
those black bars on the side we can't
change<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.980> because<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:48.360> original

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
change that because the original

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.389 
change that because the original
resolution<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.620> 4<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.129> 3

windows explorer so you can rename the
data<00:02:20.670> now<00:02:21.670> let's<00:02:22.000> just<00:02:22.180> rename<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.870> file<00:02:23.470> to

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
data now let's just rename the file to

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.010 
data now let's just rename the file to
dot<00:02:24.130> R<00:02:24.160> R<00:02:24.459> so<00:02:24.880> we<00:02:25.000> can<00:02:25.030> access<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.780> files

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
dot R R so we can access the files

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.060 
dot R R so we can access the files
inside<00:02:26.440> of<00:02:26.500> it<00:02:28.170> once<00:02:29.170> you've<00:02:29.290> done<00:02:29.440> that<00:02:29.500> we're

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
inside of it once you've done that we're

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.380 
inside of it once you've done that we're
gonna<00:02:30.130> go<00:02:30.370> inside<00:02:30.640> of<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:32.040> file<00:02:33.040> and<00:02:33.430> then

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
gonna go inside of the file and then

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.350 
gonna go inside of the file and then
we're<00:02:34.480> gonna<00:02:34.570> go<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.810> payload<00:02:35.530> not<00:02:36.310> made<00:02:36.670> and

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
we're gonna go to payload not made and

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.880 
we're gonna go to payload not made and
then<00:02:38.110> just<00:02:39.040> extract<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.840> info.plist<00:02:40.840> out<00:02:41.500> of
