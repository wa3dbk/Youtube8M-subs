00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 Lead almost did not change but first 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:08.280
 only 30 years ago nobody could 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.210
 tell you what it is without saying 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.009
 already about what miracles he can do 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.660
 times have changed and today is difficult 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.490
 imagine a modern home or 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.250
 an office in which there is at least 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.250
 one such revolutionary invention 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.670
 to assemble a computer is required 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.460
 about 90 minutes 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.350
 first in line the hard disk 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.530
 read head reads information 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.510
 this is a very accurate device distance 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.980
 between it and the disk does not exceed the thickness 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.140
 human hair hard drive 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.640
 installed on intended for 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.690
 him in the computer storage space 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.390
 the information is intended two more 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.129
 component removable disk storage 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.469
 device and reader 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.579
 CDs allow you to read and 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.589
 execute programs 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:07.490
 recorded on CD-ROM, the two 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.420
 devices are installed in place 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.100
 computer motherboard can 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.990
 compare with the spine because 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.990
 everyone joins her 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.670
 other components 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.000
 this fan cools the heat she is 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.650
 a chip some sound cards 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.040
 set right on the mother 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.320
 fee these nests in sequence 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.140
 are sound input sound 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.850
 outlet and socket 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.619
 the microphone is a fixing ring 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.600
 secures the video card when 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.759
 transport and this heat sensor 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.750
 measures the temperature between the processor and 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.750
 motherboard 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.799
 the processor is the brain of the system 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.570
 it decrypts counts and 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.570
 carry out the instructions received 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.810
 the processor is installed in a special 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.810
 nest 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.320
 the processor fan cools it when 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.869
 strong heating its effectiveness 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.150
 It depends on the material used and 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.580
 conductive material provides better 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.150
 cooling 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.489
 RAM saves 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.489
 brief information and erases it 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.140
 when you turn off the power is memory 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.959
 has less access time by 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.989
 comparing hard drive or 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:29.599
 CD is now all the components 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.250
 installed in the case it protects 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.470
 internal components from external 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.329
 impacts at this stage in the hull 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.329
 electronic components are installed 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.880
 several housing connectors from different 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.750
 light indicators connects to 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.750
 motherboard 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.270
 this is the output and the video card through which 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.130
 the monitor connects to the computer and this 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.000
 video chip creating two-dimensional and 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.000
 three-dimensional image 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.230
 this is video memory 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:10.100
 the greater its volume the better 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.040
 image on the monitor video card 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.570
 is set in place 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.310
 modem makes interaction possible 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.140
 between two computers generating 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.340
 clear signal transmitted by 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.320
 phone line fees in the modem 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:29.530
 control the exchange of information between 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:31.210
 two computers then a fax modem 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.980
 set in place 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.210
 power supply convert electrical 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.070
 voltage according to 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.070
 needs of various components 

00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:46.920
 then internal wiring is connected 

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:48.480
 it makes it possible 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.609
 information circulate between 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.530
 various devices and maternal 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:54.420
 fees 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.870
 cd joins ip 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.870
 cable 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.870
 the remaining wiring is connected to 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.870
 various components computers 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.610
 Now build 30 computer components 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:41.110
 completed before closing the case 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.110
 every computer is testing
