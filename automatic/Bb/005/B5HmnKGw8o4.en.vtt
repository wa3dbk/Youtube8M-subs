exploiting<00:01:21.619> that<00:01:21.649> to<00:01:22.610> a<00:01:22.640> more<00:01:23.619> responsive

exploiting that to a more responsive
facade<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:26.210> brickwork<00:01:26.600> should<00:01:26.780> be<00:01:26.899> dynamic

facade the brickwork should be dynamic

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.440 
facade the brickwork should be dynamic
because<00:01:27.680> you<00:01:28.490> know<00:01:28.580> again<00:01:28.759> because<00:01:29.090> it<00:01:29.270> was

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
because you know again because it was

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.440 
because you know again because it was
the<00:01:29.660> moving<00:01:29.920> Street<00:01:30.920> so<00:01:31.550> how<00:01:31.970> do<00:01:32.030> you<00:01:32.179> react<00:01:32.420> to

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
the moving Street so how do you react to

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.800 
the moving Street so how do you react to
that

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
that

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.389 
that
you<00:01:33.110> know<00:01:33.200> the<00:01:33.349> sunlight<00:01:33.740> is<00:01:33.950> moving<00:01:34.250> how<00:01:34.340> do

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
you know the sunlight is moving how do

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.339 
you know the sunlight is moving how do
you<00:01:34.520> react<00:01:34.729> to<00:01:34.759> that<00:01:34.940> so<00:01:35.630> all<00:01:35.869> these<00:01:36.080> things

00:01:36.339 --> 00:01:36.349 
you react to that so all these things

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:39.130 
you react to that so all these things
sort<00:01:36.890> of<00:01:37.009> sort<00:01:37.700> of<00:01:37.759> made<00:01:38.209> us<00:01:38.420> work<00:01:38.899> out

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
sort of sort of made us work out

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.690 
sort of sort of made us work out
something<00:01:39.500> more<00:01:39.800> dynamic<00:01:40.310> than<00:01:40.459> something

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
something more dynamic than something

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.370 
something more dynamic than something
more<00:01:41.000> static<00:01:43.810> rhythmically<00:01:44.810> thrown<00:01:45.170> together

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.669 
more static rhythmically thrown together
the<00:01:46.160> dynamic<00:01:46.700> effect<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:47.479> bricks<00:01:47.899> create<00:01:48.380> is

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
the dynamic effect the bricks create is

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:51.730 
the dynamic effect the bricks create is
not<00:01:48.950> just<00:01:49.340> visually<00:01:50.030> evident<00:01:50.569> the<00:01:51.229> openings

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
not just visually evident the openings

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.339 
not just visually evident the openings
also<00:01:52.250> ensure<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:53.240> rooms<00:01:53.539> directly<00:01:53.959> behind

00:01:54.339 --> 00:01:54.349 
also ensure the rooms directly behind

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:57.130 
also ensure the rooms directly behind
the<00:01:54.800> facade<00:01:55.160> are<00:01:55.459> well<00:01:55.970> ventilated<00:01:56.450> and

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
the facade are well ventilated and

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:11.420 
the facade are well ventilated and
remain<00:01:57.739> shaded

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.880 

there<00:02:12.430> are<00:02:12.549> some<00:02:12.670> very<00:02:12.849> basic<00:02:13.060> principles<00:02:13.890> of

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
there are some very basic principles of

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.489 
there are some very basic principles of
brick<00:02:15.129> as<00:02:15.340> a<00:02:15.400> material<00:02:16.109> the<00:02:17.109> brick<00:02:17.319> is<00:02:17.469> a

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:17.499 
brick as a material the brick is a

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:19.289 
brick as a material the brick is a
module<00:02:17.859> and<00:02:18.159> it<00:02:18.400> repeats<00:02:18.730> itself

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
module and it repeats itself

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.679 
module and it repeats itself
if<00:02:19.569> you<00:02:19.889> complicate<00:02:20.889> issues<00:02:21.269> you<00:02:22.269> you

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:22.689 
if you complicate issues you you

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:25.140 
if you complicate issues you you
actually<00:02:23.109> create<00:02:23.889> an<00:02:24.010> unfeasible<00:02:24.579> design<00:02:24.879> and

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
actually create an unfeasible design and

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.259 
actually create an unfeasible design and
it's<00:02:25.689> actually<00:02:26.139> the<00:02:26.319> repetitiveness<00:02:27.010> of<00:02:27.969> a

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
it's actually the repetitiveness of a

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.890 
it's actually the repetitiveness of a
module<00:02:28.930> that<00:02:29.200> what<00:02:29.769> is<00:02:30.069> what<00:02:30.579> makes<00:02:30.879> a<00:02:31.209> brick

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
module that what is what makes a brick

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:44.699 
module that what is what makes a brick
masonry<00:02:42.389> so<00:02:43.389> basically<00:02:44.109> if<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:44.319> really<00:02:44.560> look

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
masonry so basically if you really look

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.289 
masonry so basically if you really look
at<00:02:44.829> it<00:02:44.889> and<00:02:45.129> that<00:02:45.280> is<00:02:45.430> I<00:02:45.609> feel<00:02:45.969> this<00:02:46.180> is<00:02:46.269> the

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
at it and that is I feel this is the

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.390 
at it and that is I feel this is the
beauty<00:02:46.689> of<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.200> wall<00:02:47.349> is<00:02:47.560> that<00:02:47.739> the<00:02:47.919> basic

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
beauty of the wall is that the basic

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.899 
beauty of the wall is that the basic
structure<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:49.419> the<00:02:49.659> basic<00:02:50.519> bonding<00:02:51.519> is<00:02:51.639> very

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:51.909 
structure and the basic bonding is very

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.300 
structure and the basic bonding is very
very<00:02:52.060> simple<00:02:52.269> how<00:02:52.959> it<00:02:53.019> comes<00:02:53.349> together<00:02:53.650> makes

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
very simple how it comes together makes

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.970 
very simple how it comes together makes
it<00:02:54.579> look<00:02:54.849> very<00:02:55.150> complicated<00:02:55.739> but<00:02:56.739> it<00:02:56.859> is

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
it look very complicated but it is

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.879 
it look very complicated but it is
actually<00:02:57.250> absolutely<00:02:57.939> simple<00:02:58.829> why<00:02:59.829> this

00:02:59.879 --> 00:02:59.889 
actually absolutely simple why this

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:01.890 
actually absolutely simple why this
bonding<00:03:00.699> is<00:03:00.849> very<00:03:01.030> difficult<00:03:01.329> it's<00:03:01.599> just

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
bonding is very difficult it's just

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
that space it's something perhaps people

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.150 
that space it's something perhaps people
would<00:04:26.960> give<00:04:27.139> it<00:04:27.229> a<00:04:27.320> second<00:04:27.620> look<00:04:27.740> or<00:04:28.009> they

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
would give it a second look or they

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.439 
would give it a second look or they
would<00:04:28.280> linger<00:04:28.490> on<00:04:28.759> it<00:04:28.880> a<00:04:28.910> little<00:04:29.120> bit<00:04:29.300> longer

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:29.449 
would linger on it a little bit longer

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.290 
would linger on it a little bit longer
so<00:04:30.169> from<00:04:30.500> being<00:04:30.710> an<00:04:30.889> anonymous<00:04:31.130> street<00:04:31.849> corner

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
so from being an anonymous street corner

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.270 
so from being an anonymous street corner
it<00:04:32.419> it<00:04:32.690> gains<00:04:33.110> something<00:04:33.650> with<00:04:33.949> that<00:04:34.099> wall

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
it it gains something with that wall

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.700 
it it gains something with that wall
being<00:04:34.550> there<00:04:34.759> and<00:04:34.970> I<00:04:35.389> think<00:04:35.479> that<00:04:35.870> going

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
being there and I think that going

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.830 
being there and I think that going
through<00:04:37.009> it<00:04:37.190> without<00:04:37.509> complicating<00:04:38.509> issues<00:04:38.810> I

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
through it without complicating issues I

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.040 
through it without complicating issues I
actually<00:04:40.060> deliberately<00:04:41.060> simplifying

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
actually deliberately simplifying

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.010 
actually deliberately simplifying
breaking<00:04:42.560> it<00:04:42.650> down<00:04:42.800> to<00:04:42.979> very<00:04:43.160> basics<00:04:43.699> and

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
breaking it down to very basics and

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.870 
breaking it down to very basics and
pursuing<00:04:45.020> it<00:04:45.110> on-site<00:04:45.500> and<00:04:45.770> not<00:04:46.039> just<00:04:46.280> working

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
pursuing it on-site and not just working

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.020 
pursuing it on-site and not just working
on<00:04:47.180> it<00:04:47.330> in<00:04:48.229> studio<00:04:48.710> and<00:04:48.919> then<00:04:49.039> up<00:04:49.160> executing

on it in studio and then up executing
on-site<00:04:50.360> is<00:04:51.259> something<00:04:51.740> that<00:04:51.949> is<00:04:52.520> I<00:04:53.000> think

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
on-site is something that is I think

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.360 
on-site is something that is I think
what<00:04:53.630> makes<00:04:53.930> me<00:04:54.169> feel<00:04:54.470> really<00:04:54.949> happy<00:04:55.099> about

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
what makes me feel really happy about

what makes me feel really happy about
