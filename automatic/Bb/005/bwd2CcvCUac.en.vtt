00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 next situation in the litter is that we 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.420
 not with the front pitt in the litter 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.710
 go now but want us 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.139
 deal with a reverse split 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.980
 backward star step in the litter goes 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.210
 So only in the footwork in the throw 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.890
 we will have different exercises 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.430
 different variations from the reverse 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.340
 private start with the first 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.630
 footwork in reverse split that means 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:30.929
 as soon as I get the ball outside foot 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.730
 outside hand pass comes and now turn 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.320
 I walked around the backward star 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:40.140
 basket and have feet look attack me 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.210
 the basket out of this movement 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.730
 we will go in leaps and litter are 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.710
 we go to dribble situations 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.620
 middle to baseline and try there 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.000
 different options and to create 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.829
 as exercise forms 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.010
 since we always have it on both 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.370
 wanting to train equivalent 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.370
 malik 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.359
 we just do not do it now 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.030
 simple shorter we will take ten bullet 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.240
 or six hits always alternating 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.590
 right side left side when we are in 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.750
 We are more into training 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.150
 Variation that we say 20 shot and 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.090
 then depending on the player on 12 or 14 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.970
 hit first situation is expected 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.830
 malik worth it 2 dribblings to the middle 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.759
 jump shot ten or six 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.759
 hit now believes 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.350
 scare 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:02:16.069
 class 5 253 6 4 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.310
 just stay that straight fast 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.700
 move clean to the end lead talents 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.840
 debatable 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.840
 from 65 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.400
 95 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.870
 OK 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:03:00.220
 next situation is that we say 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.519
 we go straight out of the dribbling 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.530
 reverse pitt in the three points throw 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.750
 here is especially on the page on the 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.670
 on the right side the right-handed people on the right 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.250
 left side to pay attention when you are with the 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.069
 come right foot out and the left 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.489
 many people tend to agree with that 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.370
 right again to correct 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:23.109
 We pay attention to the step error there 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.239
 leg the first set foot has to 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:29.940
 stand backward star step from here 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.940
 breathing through mali kasse 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:42.000
 10.6.3 we want to have it all going on 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.000
 stretch 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:29.030
 quite stretch already from the legs very much 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:30.440
 Well , we would never be sloppy 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:35.470
 tired will let that evening look 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.470
 stretched 6652 euros 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.230
 three hits in a row 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.600
 he was good at the other side now 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.930
 just as clean just come out of 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.930
 above 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.100
 Respect is a very important move 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.650
 for the outside players to throw a throw too 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.210
 create two in the Bundesliga 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.280
 excellent examples of this are 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.500
 julius jenkins and casey jacobsen the 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.940
 very much like reverse split at the 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.520
 triple line after a throw option 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.930
 looking or just then a targeted 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.220
 Connection movement have connection 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.870
 We had just had some movement 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.340
 the penetration to the middle 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.680
 Now we take two others 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.720
 options on the one hand from the penetration 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.780
 in the middle we are stopped 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.940
 answer with a spin move around 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.730
 to go throw and then we have 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.640
 another solution where we go to the baseline 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:46.570
 attack from the hospital league we 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:48.400
 start first situation room spirit two 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:51.570
 trainings to using spin move to 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.570
 baseline jump shot 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.730
 a little bit higher 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.430
 be soft at the top 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:26.890
 nevertheless stretch exactly 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:50.039
 pay attention to reverse split the 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:53.160
 deception stood while staying on the ground until 

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:55.680
 Do not release the leg to start running 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:59.940
 marica just done very well frequently 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:01.759
 seen fault last situation the 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:05.160
 we have 

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:08.870
 I get outside the ball see mine 

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.870
 opponent drowns me
