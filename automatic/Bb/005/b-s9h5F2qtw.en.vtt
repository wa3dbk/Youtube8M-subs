00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.989
 something of this important 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:37.960
 bordas that's it logically 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:47.250
 the phone so well packaged in 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:47.250
 the fire that burns you go 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:01:01.030
 here is the packaging so comarch on 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:05.820
 finds very excited about a pill at 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.820
 flat so first thing that is offered 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.990
 a covered thing that is offered 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:24.670
 so small adapter here is the box 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:28.869
 so here I go only at midnight so 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:34.149
 so what do we see so already 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:36.700
 our grade 4g good after his 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.509
 characteristics and that for now we 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.509
 do not care a bit 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:51.960
 so there's putting your hands here so 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:56.520
 so that's how she is present and 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:59.440
 always with a movie I can take it 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.080
 so it's really impressive the 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.110
 size frankly the size is 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.929
 very very very big it 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.899
 doing big for now so the 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:16.569
 phone protect with caches and 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:22.120
 everything and everything then we raise here 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:23.750
 first little book qd we will say then 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:32.280
 for this live 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:35.670
 note 6 o'clock here a charger then 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:40.280
 to have started it's cool that of 2 in 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:51.570
 make a dish 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:56.280
 two years ago then loses a usb cable 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:03:00.360
 classic that looks good and 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:06.180
 booster so that's all for for 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:10.200
 packaging packaging all that so I 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.900
 will already start by opening it so 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.290
 so we see here that protected by 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.180
 a movie 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.550
 so that's always like that it's 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.400
 for texas loads during the 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:24.450
 transport 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:29.180
 So here is the phone without the battery 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:32.160
 it seems really flat obvious 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:36.390
 so I have my battery so if not a 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:41.510
 little cache we had now I 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.510
 do not support him already m cash 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:52.110
 so here's the lights up so below 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:59.530
 backlit keys menu home tray 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:04:04.540
 so there power volume in volume en route 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:09.310
 sheikh bamba micro sd so the mid points 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:11.620
 as it looks rather robust air as 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:17.070
 telephone for now so there it 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:20.829
 already already possible to use it 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:24.340
 so here I am going to see there the great 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:27.010
 that they put basic when in fact 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:34.270
 protecting so it's my first dog 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:46.240
 mid 2008 6 I am told that I am sure 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:49.570
 00h06 so ran giga then reminded 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:54.810
 two gigabytes cpu quad hearts 1008 6 4 head 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.810
 of So here there is already the 102 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.450
 the screen are rather nice people but 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.950
 this protection is back and yeah 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.349
 yeah frankly that's good 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.930
 good quality on the screen frankly 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:12.729
 ugly used to a full hd 5000 of 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.779
 inch is still not bad 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:25.659
 so I do not know if it's true 

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:26.189
 caliber and so the grip it is 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:29.740
 really big 

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:36.099
 it is rather huge 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:38.020
 so what's the screen and all the bottom 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:42.099
 that's a bit of what we can say about it 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.900
 screen it's pretty good it's rather 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:48.099
 simple as designer at least 110 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:50.129
 men who like and then that's all so 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:54.059
 here for this unpacking show friends 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:54.059
 let me 4g
