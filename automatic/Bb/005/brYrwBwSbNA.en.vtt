00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hey analyzes and welcome to the helper 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.569
 torri in origins and in this video 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.469
 Show you the spot here enough 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.870
 and yes good camera is the first disadvantage 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.299
 of course the courses tank should then 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.220
 here this of course right here 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.340
 the beginning must be very annoying they are immediately 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.560
 curious because I and that he me because 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.439
 I was just down in crazy place 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.730
 you get the first fast and it from 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.420
 the scanner comes I show the same 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.740
 switzerland its so i believe and 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.360
 sportswear for example its here but 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.130
 one may as too much close as 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.079
 if you shoot too much to come 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.579
 example from the back and so almost 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.329
 went wrong so I would 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.250
 In any case, shoot something very briefly 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.590
 I have two three pages in it 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.379
 otherwise the track is like me now 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.950
 Another disadvantage is here 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.010
 mud 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.760
 that's why it's actually a must-have 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.739
 Of course enough is enough and so 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.210
 you just get through it quickly 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.260
 put mud 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.489
 and yes further advantage would be enough then 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
 we do not have an app to still the 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.729
 The wall is good in very high rounds 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.479
 bring that he is no longer in the wall 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.360
 week at the most for points but it is 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.470
 to make a wonderful points 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.900
 you just want to make it round 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.450
 a very very very very big one 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.590
 advantage is there of course 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.479
 giant robot running long in the middle 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.310
 Of course you need but for the 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.619
 golden helmet so you bring what 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.150
 the big robots if that on the 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.780
 then zombies are on it too 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.970
 last 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.619
 build the spawn not new, of course, 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.780
 the new wave but not the zombies 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.250
 the power has been kicked 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.670
 they're just not totally sport yet 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.780
 times new as with many other maps 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.280
 so dying before anything that is here 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.689
 Definitely a very old frame 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.159
 for heinz since you stop even after 150 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.140
 very quickly kill the zombies 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.360
 being very fast also relatively 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.630
 because the robots have to come to see 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.460
 yes not always so you have to 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.049
 somehow differently different remedy 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.759
 So create for the weapons 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.660
 you can just in front of the five 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.160
 points here the burka or the region 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.270
 so 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.400
 you can actually choose everything 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.890
 and here is the advantage again 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.220
 contrary to crazy place that one here 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.630
 then it would be possible to build the bars 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.090
 tutorial has seen for the crazy race 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.760
 know that I am not a 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.790
 only partially cancel order below the 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.960
 do not turn down come good had 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.630
 I'm running to the left here so it 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.950
 will be enough if from the beginning 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.270
 too many I've come sometimes 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.040
 trying to run the other way around 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.780
 So all the time around but now 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.100
 I did not like that and there 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.200
 can one take the shot position of my 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.060
 do not think so good because 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.680
 we have much more space here than if 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.920
 you want to run out the front or front 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.480
 Always likes to be active 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.170
 and yes you can also do that again 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.170
 live off zombies long 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.450
 yes I can be nice too 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.060
 long drag and then sometime already in 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:06.530
 has and then just somehow 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:09.530
 Japan can be so new again 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.000
 So build the finished places are 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.530
 actually here in the mud drilling degree 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.270
 not much wood is out of here 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:19.250
 so slowly here in front because of the right 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.350
 In any case, from the left, I think 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.120
 also in aspen this time mostly down the 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.290
 middle so maybe you just like that 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.280
 You can walk past here 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.420
 also do not shoot too much 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.730
 you can stay here for so long 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:38.240
 tug and oh that was already from the 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:42.140
 round then as I said disadvantages 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.580
 are just the mud and that the 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.120
 armor soldiers are beneficial to the 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:49.670
 checklist if you are perfect 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.610
 possibly box spot giant robot 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:57.220
 Of course if you have the golden helmet 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:04:00.230
 and is actually off and hopefully 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:03.410
 I can only recommend it to anyone but at the beginning 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.350
 stop the crisis place whether that should be from 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:09.459
 have been this tutorial 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.459
 in the next video
