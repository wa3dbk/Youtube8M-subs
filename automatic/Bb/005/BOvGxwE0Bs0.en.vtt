00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.810
 happy for having passed the semifinals 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.510
 for the third consecutive year, he explained 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.220
 jose mourinho is happiness I think 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.360
 what is 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.360
 if we are 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.950
 and eliminated in quarters in eighths of 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:27.410
 final 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:29.420
 by teams in any kind of dispersion 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.210
 and without being eliminated in the round of 16 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.879
 it's a routine 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.520
 in the turn to madrid because I think that 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.970
 there is 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.670
 the reasons to be 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.429
 to be tough 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.720
 we rate them again for 

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:51.540
 semifinals I know it's not the goal 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.490
 negotiated madrid win quarterfinals 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.080
 reach semifinals 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:01:00.150
 but the truth is that we have done it 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:01.329
 three consecutive seasons and that's why 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.269
 that's it 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.320
 his happy with the players from the 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.570
 tranquility of seeing in semifinals 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.320
 mourinho also explained what was 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.180
 happened in the match 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.320
 if your opinion is mine that the 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.570
 second time we could have done 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.290
 best 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.420
 and the second time 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.619
 we have not defended 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:26.650
 as a team we have already left some 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.780
 spaces and some imbalances do 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:33.590
 that ship is comfortable 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:38.340
 quiet serene and it's all this from 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.590
 agreement until because later when 31 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.020
 they have felt 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.659
 in the sense of danger 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.750
 I understand that closing some doors 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.420
 that were open 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.570
 I had to open Maria in band 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.280
 left I had to put audio 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.780
 because he did not have another center player 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.780
 pure field to put 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.329
 playing ahead of the defenders and 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:09.149
 after last ten minutes you know 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:11.519
 He was expected ten minutes 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.430
 dangerous have been ten minutes 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.240
 calm then when we have lost 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.490
 control 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.900
 we have regained control and that 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.740
 means that 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.810
 that is fine 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.210
 about Christian who managed the two goals 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.260
 team and has established itself as top scorer 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:33.640
 the competition without comments 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:37.420
 the numbers are there the numbers speak 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.420
 Don himself 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:46.670
 It's what we all do not think 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:50.480
 someone is perfect 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:54.110
 in its perfect psychological state think 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.480
 different that's why it does not have 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.710
 it has no history and the environment that this 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.710
 he lived in ali sami stadium yen 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.880
 hello I would like to play in this field 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.410
 each party 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.060
 I think everyone will be left 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.170
 the place in environments like 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:16.000
 like this is the perfect environment for 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.230
 to play football and I do not think that 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.230
 Real Madrid players have 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.910
 felt the environment who has felt the 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.990
 environment have been the players of the 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:29.780
 galatasaray that they have felt in the 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:34.050
 environment and in the second time 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.450
 fantastic of heart of pride of 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.180
 of everything the fires have 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.450
 Good 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.370
 and that's why I despite obviously 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.700
 we could have done better in the 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.210
 second time of what we have done 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.270
 instead of being 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.220
 less happy with my players what 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.420
 this is 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.490
 happy for the players and coach of 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:04.090
 galatasaray coming out of the competition 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:06.470
 in a way that everyone wants to leave if 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.470
 you must go out 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:14.030
 the best possible scenario is to leave as 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:18.079
 they have left for that 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.480
 congratulations to them for this match that 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.290
 it has been 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.290
 fantastic
