 am really sorry I was very 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.849
 taken with my many associations 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.380
 and with the courts what because the 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.929
 runners started that here we go down 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.340

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.050
 or less well done but hey not 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.140

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.119
 tutorial video as you can see I 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.140

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.279
 ecot with whaou 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.870
 that's none of it's really 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.469
 already to tell you by merry christmas to 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.180
 all 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.890
 I could see one of my subscribers because 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.110
 that there now I am in Paris for 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.399
 a first holiday season and I 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.559
 a small mission of four days at 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.300
 marionnaud where I was representative 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.399
 yves saint laurent so I had to sell 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.899
 all products damart kg rather well 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.670
 sold by the way I showed happy to 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.360
 far this is the first experience in 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.920
 sale 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.480
 and here I am not too long in 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.739
 the more I like the brand 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.649
 am even buying their perfumes for 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.329
 take Christmas so that's saying so 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.190
 here is this video it would be more for 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.339
 to entrust you with something ie 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.619
 that I decided to make me do a 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.350
 peeling that's really the theme of the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.659
 video that's it they know my 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.310
 chain know that I really like the 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.479
 make time because for me to have 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.549
 an impeccable heap 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.770
 it's really the basis of the make-up but 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.600
 so much before I had so much acne 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.840
 now I come the most or so 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.549
 little I always have little buttons and 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.430
 who come back here and there depending 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.259
 from home not my mood too much 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.060
 cold or I changed my foundation or 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.530
 I always have stupid little buttons 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.939
 who come back while a wind of 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.610
 to install in France I did not have a 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.189
 single button on the face and frankly 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.540
 it annoys me a lot 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.890
 I wish I could choose to 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.990
 to make up or not to make up the 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.640
 morning is really a pity 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.810
 I had no button at all 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.240
 I had a push of buttons so much 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.340
 monstrous but really so much of 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.200
 buttons that people are hesitant to make me 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.119
 the kiss when I saw myself frankly 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.520
 even with a make up so it's for 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.000
 to say it was really not an eruption 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.320
 possible there it goes much better as 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.570
 you can see I have more buttons 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.000
 but he comes back from time to time and the 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.850
 buttons come he has tasks the 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.380
 tasks take four weeks from 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.120
 after buttons come back during 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.980
 four weeks is hostage we hid the 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.930
 scrambled face as they say it's to 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.820
 to say he's not uniform he's not 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.730
 bright as it is supposed to be and 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.560
 I'm tired of having the mask is in 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.940
 always 20 meters from the bottom 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.710
 dyed all the time sorry for my voice 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.670
 but I fell a little sick 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.960
 right here 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.880
 why I decided to 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.310
 peeling is a peeling 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.320
 dermatological with a solution 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.690
 of glycolic citric acid where I know 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.880
 what does he remove the first layers 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.440
 of the epidermis 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.910
 so here is the first layer is not 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.890
 all the ones I put on 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.530
 bottom of your i had buttons and everything 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.470
 what you want and by completely 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.540
 they will they put a cream what the 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.200
 protector on the men's polo will leave 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:00.080
 and all is the time precisely that my 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.240
 epidermis is reforming from the blow played a 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.220
 new skin it's really really 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.930
 to make a new skin is not a scrub or 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.030
 what because yes I have scrubs 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.580
 very good pharmaceutical 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.020
 I really tried everything and there I think 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.420
 really have him more than fed up with 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.520
 avesnes products and all against they are 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.380
 very well but they are fine if you 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.770
 as jane a good for a skin in good 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.570
 health 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.670
 so that's what I decided 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.410
 to do other certain people 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.730
 I talked about it around me finds that 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.040
 it's a solution too drastic 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.890
 others say it's the best that 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.630
 that would be very good to consider that the 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.050
 dermatological peeling on black skin 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.670
 and to serra and to his complicated say to 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.770
 do my measurement where note for with the 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.660
 melamine that below the bling is 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.920
 too strong it can have the opposite effect 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.020
 that is to say that the skin reacts suddenly 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.220
 she secretes full full of melanin and 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.020
 So you have lots of tasks in 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.770
 do you have black plates on the 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.330
 face 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.180
 why I'm still hesitating 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.400
 little bit so I do not know so I 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.540
 ask the opinion of my subscribers because 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.120
 I still have almost 300 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.100
 now thanks here are those who have 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.660
 already made a case tell me she 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.360
 advises a doctor those who have not 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.190
 never done or who would like to do it 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.870
 bankrupt that she tell me go so 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.180
 you want me to do it before video 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.740
 afterwards and that's what I 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.240
 wanted to do because I think that 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.920
 even the americans they make them 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.900
 many agents are not bad and oise have 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.669
 always a nickel skin and or at the states 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.970
 united has developed in France no I 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.010
 since there was Dr. Isabel 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.330
 orchard that he was doing in paris and suddenly 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.030
 I thought it might be 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.710
 a good idea to do it but there is 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.580
 no ratonnades at all 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.020
 at this time of the year 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.030
 I was really stupid I would have 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.900
 really had to think about it earlier but but 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.150
 I completely forgot 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.940
 that's sorry I'm filming in the bedroom 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:42.180
 my little nephew from where the small 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.130
 So here was scene was ranks of advice 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.730
 on my behalf for me I wait for them with 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.500
 impatience 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.200
 I will wait for the return of my little niece 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.940
 to make for her the film and make 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.010
 a little style video there for example 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.870
 I have a pretty little dress 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.670
 now she could have you 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.950
 show but good unfortunately for 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.600
 I should go to the movie and myself 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.740

 say hello to my subscribers that 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.440
 I saw at marionnaud while I 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.090
 did my mission here I was not 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.400
 all my palézieux kg does as his 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.230
 mountain and frightful emile amplify a 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.940
 push of buttons here frankly there 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.990
 I was awful but I am 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.580
 not like that every day I tell you 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.280
 promise but really not but I have not 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.050
 slept and I was just tired that's right 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.460
 listening has passed very good holidays if 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.320
 I never do a video between 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.090
 time but I think I 'll do it and 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.440
 I await your comments concerning 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.900
 my feeling because it's downright 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.840
 an obsession for me now 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:48.050
 this is a happy holiday to you and to the 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.050
 next
