besides<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.299> value<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.630> just<00:01:30.900> really

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
besides that the value is just really

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.050 
besides that the value is just really
not<00:01:31.350> all<00:01:31.560> there<00:01:31.770> now<00:01:32.009> if<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.340> do<00:01:32.490> get<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.670> combo

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
not all there now if you do get a combo

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.399 
not all there now if you do get a combo
I<00:01:33.180> would<00:01:33.360> say<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.659> makes<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.900> lot<00:01:34.020> more<00:01:34.049> sense

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
I would say it makes a lot more sense

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.080 
I would say it makes a lot more sense
but<00:01:34.590> getting<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.920> by<00:01:35.040> itself<00:01:35.340> only<00:01:35.670> going<00:01:36.030> to

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
but getting it by itself only going to

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.850 
but getting it by itself only going to
be<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.210> 4<00:01:36.570> out<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.780> 10<00:01:37.049> for<00:01:37.110> baby<00:01:37.439> for<00:01:37.560> your<00:01:37.619> book
