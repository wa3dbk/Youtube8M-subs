they were gonna do I actually think the

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.970

show<00:05:02.640> improved<00:05:02.970> later<00:05:03.420> this<00:05:04.320> is<00:05:04.440> just<00:05:04.560> a<00:05:04.740> taste

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980 
show improved later this is just a taste

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.410 
show improved later this is just a taste
of<00:05:05.160> kind<00:05:05.370> of<00:05:05.460> the<00:05:05.550> beginning<00:05:05.970> of<00:05:06.090> it<00:05:06.240> but<00:05:06.390> I

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420 
of kind of the beginning of it but I

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.940 
of kind of the beginning of it but I
still<00:05:06.660> think<00:05:06.900> they're<00:05:07.050> really<00:05:07.380> good<00:05:07.560> episodes
