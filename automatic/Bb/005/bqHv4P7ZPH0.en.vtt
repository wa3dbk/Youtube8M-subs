00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:15.970
 yesterday christmas tv hello friends 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.560
 how are you in today I will be 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:22.740
 teaching how 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.120
 clean your radiator or purge the radiator 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.850
 as they say 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.280
 good first thing that I wanted 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.610
 signs with a radiator here loose for 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.220
 explain them well because since when the 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.230
 radiator is inside the engine is well 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.350
 difficult to show you 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.010
 this is very easy to show you this 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.840
 way then I'm going to show you that 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.129
 to clean the radiator what 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.280
 first, what are we going to do then? 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.329
 obviously, remove the plug from the 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.379
 radiator 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.399
 and we're going to come down here 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:04.690
 regularly the carlos here below 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:08.950
 have this stopper cited that is removed 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:11.800
 so we are going to remove it then all 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.940
 water or antifreeze they have going to 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.940
 start going out for him 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.530
 through the hole you have here because 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.290
 we have removed the plug he cited 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.630
 let's save the plug he cited and then 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.830
 let's wait for all the 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.850
 antifreeze or water as I say 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.850
 and we are going to 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.890
 the only thing we are going to do is wait 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.620
 that everything comes out true and on this side of 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.320
 here also has hoses and a 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:46.430
 hose on this side and run another 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.880
 hose on this side then yes 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.130
 you want to clean the whole system 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.730
 they are going to have to follow the hose 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.790
 this hose here can be removed and 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.670
 then remove the thermostat remove the 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.100
 thermostat 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.520
 and then they put the hose back in 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.520
 its place 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.110
 and in that way then they will clean 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:13.110
 up to the engine but in this 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.630
 I want to show you how to clean 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.600
 the radiator that is what most 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.790
 they ask how a radiator is cleaned 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.650
 then to these hoses 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.510
 If you are only going to clean the radiator, 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.359
 They need to remove it just remove the plug 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.840
 He mentioned that I showed them and the only thing that 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:33.360
 do since it has come out all that is something 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.310
 ok, right now, I explain 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.520
 that 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.610
 with a hose with water they will put it 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.569
 here and they will start to water 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.400
 radiator for a while they give you pressure and 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.680
 then the water will start to come out 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.590
 here I'm going to make a 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.090
 shows for you to have an idea 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.600
 good as you can see here I already put 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.120
 water and if they realize 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.770
 there the water is coming out and that's how 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.350
 it is cleaned and all the 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.930
 radiator that way and that's what 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.180
 they call it purging the radiator 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.019
 If you like, you can buy some 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.340
 liquid in your auto parts store 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:16.310
 they sell liquids manufactures the radiator it 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.109
 they put it and then they put water on it 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.140
 what it is called purging the radiator 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:23.389
 It is something very easy for yourself 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.760
 they can do and they can save a lot 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:27.560
 money doing it men is coming out water 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.870
 over here because obviously he does not have the 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.659
 hose but the hose have all 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.780
 the water will come out here we clean it 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:38.269
 well for some what I know depending on 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.569
 they're dirty around 35 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:43.220
 minutes we let enough water run and 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.790
 that way you will clean the 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:51.319
 radiator in your house and that's basically 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:53.560
 what is to purge the radiator this let's 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.560
 to 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:00.620
 after that we are going to close the water 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:03.889
 after that we closed the water and 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.499
 we wait for it to come out 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:11.990
 the water make this dry and then 

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:15.090
 we put the plug back here 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.190
 important that since we've done that 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.910
 fill the radiator with antifreeze 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:23.820
 let's not put water on it because the water 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:26.520
 ruin vital parts of the engine as it is 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.280
 the water pump the thermostat also 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:32.730
 it oxidizes it then it is not advisable 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:36.060
 Put water on it if a mechanic says no 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.800
 put water because this one with water 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:42.110
 It works very well 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:44.669
 this is a mechanic who is not 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:49.110
 advising correctly and the only thing 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:52.229
 is doing is you doing something 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:55.110
 wrong in your in your car be good 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:57.270
 that 's what it is to clean the radiator or 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.120
 purge the radiator I hope it serves them 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.099
