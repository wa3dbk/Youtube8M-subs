one<00:03:11.670> of<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.820> coolest<00:03:12.030> things<00:03:12.360> about<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.720> 20

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
one of the coolest things about the 20

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.080 
one of the coolest things about the 20
though<00:03:13.110> is<00:03:13.290> as<00:03:13.650> you<00:03:13.830> kind<00:03:14.070> of<00:03:14.160> grow<00:03:14.459> up<00:03:14.490> into

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
though is as you kind of grow up into

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.820 
though is as you kind of grow up into
your<00:03:15.300> kreega<00:03:15.870> configuration<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.709> make<00:03:16.800> a

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
your kreega configuration and make a

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.009 
your kreega configuration and make a
further<00:03:17.100> investment<00:03:17.700> what<00:03:18.269> you<00:03:18.390> can<00:03:18.540> do<00:03:18.780> is

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
further investment what you can do is

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.990 
further investment what you can do is
you<00:03:19.170> can<00:03:19.260> actually<00:03:19.650> attach<00:03:20.250> a<00:03:20.400> 10<00:03:20.610> on<00:03:20.640> top

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
you can actually attach a 10 on top

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.509 
you can actually attach a 10 on top
which<00:03:21.900> will<00:03:22.080> seamlessly<00:03:22.410> attach<00:03:22.920> via<00:03:23.310> these

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
which will seamlessly attach via these

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.370 
which will seamlessly attach via these
straps<00:03:23.880> right<00:03:24.060> here<00:03:24.120> so<00:03:24.780> now<00:03:24.810> you<00:03:24.989> can<00:03:25.140> start

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
straps right here so now you can start

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.660 
straps right here so now you can start
to<00:03:25.470> layer<00:03:25.680> depending<00:03:26.130> on<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.250> length<00:03:26.400> of<00:03:26.519> your

long-distance<00:03:28.800> touring<00:03:28.980> or<00:03:29.310> commuting<00:03:29.790> you

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
long-distance touring or commuting you

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.600 
long-distance touring or commuting you
can<00:03:30.269> also<00:03:30.480> attach<00:03:30.930> these<00:03:31.170> tens<00:03:31.470> on<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:32.370> side

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
can also attach these tens on the side

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.250 
can also attach these tens on the side
so<00:03:32.790> you<00:03:32.820> can<00:03:32.940> do<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.060> 10<00:03:33.269> on<00:03:33.420> top<00:03:33.540> tens<00:03:33.930> on<00:03:34.110> both

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
so you can do a 10 on top tens on both

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.930 
so you can do a 10 on top tens on both
sides<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:34.800> now<00:03:35.160> you<00:03:35.310> have<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.519> ability<00:03:35.760> to<00:03:35.820> go

well now moving on we've talked about

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.130 
well now moving on we've talked about
the<00:04:02.760> exterior<00:04:03.060> materials<00:04:03.630> we've<00:04:03.930> talked

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
the exterior materials we've talked

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.300 
the exterior materials we've talked
about<00:04:04.260> how<00:04:04.470> it<00:04:04.590> connects<00:04:04.830> to<00:04:04.860> the<00:04:04.980> bike<00:04:05.130> which

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
about how it connects to the bike which

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.400 
about how it connects to the bike which
is<00:04:05.340> actually<00:04:05.730> very<00:04:05.760> simple<00:04:06.209> once<00:04:06.480> you<00:04:06.540> set<00:04:06.840> set

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
is actually very simple once you set set

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.080 
is actually very simple once you set set
the<00:04:07.500> subframe<00:04:07.860> straps<00:04:08.280> up<00:04:08.489> and<00:04:08.670> then<00:04:08.970> you're

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
the subframe straps up and then you're

the subframe straps up and then you're
going<00:04:09.180> to<00:04:09.239> be<00:04:09.360> very<00:04:09.570> quickly<00:04:09.870> on<00:04:10.140> and<00:04:10.410> off<00:04:10.500> and

again there's the backpack mount feature
and<00:04:12.540> kriegie<00:04:12.870> does<00:04:12.989> a<00:04:13.019> whole<00:04:13.230> line<00:04:13.410> of<00:04:13.590> full<00:04:13.860> on

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
riding backpacks but once we move past

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.240 
riding backpacks but once we move past
that<00:04:16.080> let's<00:04:16.290> look<00:04:16.470> let's<00:04:16.739> talk<00:04:16.919> about<00:04:17.040> the

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
that let's look let's talk about the

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.080 
that let's look let's talk about the
inside<00:04:17.370> so<00:04:18.209> here<00:04:18.419> I<00:04:18.450> have<00:04:18.570> a<00:04:18.720> completely<00:04:19.320> a

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
inside so here I have a completely a

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.560 
inside so here I have a completely a
completely<00:04:21.090> empty

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
completely empty

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.600 
completely empty
kreega<00:04:22.140> u.s.<00:04:22.410> 20<00:04:22.770> and<00:04:23.130> what<00:04:23.250> I'm<00:04:23.340> going<00:04:23.460> to<00:04:23.520> do

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
kreega u.s. 20 and what I'm going to do

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:24.590 
kreega u.s. 20 and what I'm going to do
is<00:04:23.700> I'm<00:04:23.760> going<00:04:23.789> to<00:04:23.940> show<00:04:24.030> you<00:04:24.090> how<00:04:24.270> the

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
is I'm going to show you how the

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.909 
is I'm going to show you how the
waterproofing<00:04:25.110> would<00:04:25.260> work<00:04:25.410> so<00:04:25.770> it's

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
waterproofing would work so it's

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.410 
waterproofing would work so it's
typically<00:04:26.220> two<00:04:26.310> rolls<00:04:26.760> it's

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
typically two rolls it's

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.210 
typically two rolls it's
it's<00:04:27.570> what<00:04:28.170> you<00:04:28.290> would<00:04:28.350> expect<00:04:28.650> from<00:04:28.830> a<00:04:28.980> dry

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
it's what you would expect from a dry

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.310 
it's what you would expect from a dry
pack<00:04:29.550> configuration<00:04:30.270> so<00:04:30.660> the<00:04:30.780> roll<00:04:30.960> is<00:04:31.140> what

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
pack configuration so the roll is what

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.290 
pack configuration so the roll is what
makes<00:04:31.470> it<00:04:31.590> fully<00:04:31.800> waterproof<00:04:32.160> it's<00:04:32.970> going<00:04:33.210> to

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
makes it fully waterproof it's going to

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.770 
makes it fully waterproof it's going to
be<00:04:33.420> 2<00:04:33.690> alloy<00:04:33.990> tech<00:04:34.850> straps<00:04:35.850> on<00:04:36.060> both<00:04:36.090> sides<00:04:36.480> and

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
be 2 alloy tech straps on both sides and

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.450 
be 2 alloy tech straps on both sides and
then<00:04:37.440> we're<00:04:37.560> going<00:04:37.650> to<00:04:37.740> come<00:04:37.860> up<00:04:37.920> two<00:04:38.190> rolls

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
then we're going to come up two rolls

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.310 
then we're going to come up two rolls
and<00:04:38.700> as<00:04:38.970> I<00:04:39.090> open<00:04:39.450> it<00:04:39.570> now<00:04:39.720> you're<00:04:40.140> going<00:04:40.260> to

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
and as I open it now you're going to

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.810 
and as I open it now you're going to
notice<00:04:40.500> one<00:04:40.800> of<00:04:40.830> the<00:04:40.950> key<00:04:41.070> features<00:04:41.460> and<00:04:41.670> this

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
notice one of the key features and this

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.820 
notice one of the key features and this
is<00:04:41.970> the<00:04:42.090> key<00:04:42.300> waterproofing<00:04:43.080> feature<00:04:43.320> here<00:04:43.620> on
