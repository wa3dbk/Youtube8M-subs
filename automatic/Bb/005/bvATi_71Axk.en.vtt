00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:16.040
 couple the question could be obvious 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.750
 the answer more however a 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.640
 survey revealed that for many couples 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.619
 stability is more important 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.779
 financial that feelings and I 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.090
 I also think it kills ticket face but 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.590
 our partner antonio hernÃ¡ndez 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.360
 investigated how true that is 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.399
 tell us antonio of subject attacks dictates 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.290
 well let's see if it's true very 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.149
 good afternoon to both, an old man 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.550
 saying that when poverty comes in 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.350
 through the door love comes out 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.230
 window and according to experts there is a 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.740
 relationship between money and the success of 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.740
 partner 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.900
 love can everything is another phrase 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.670
 popular but nowadays a survey 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.070
 reveals that among the three main 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.980
 most important attributes for a 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.590
 spouse has to see the money some 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.760
 third of the respondents put 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.949
 as the financial compatibility between 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.980
 the priorities of running it the couple does not 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.230
 the money issue when choosing a couple 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.350
 is a sensitive issue among Hispanics 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.120
 according to experts I think our culture 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.210
 There are times when it is taboo to talk about 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.040
 money then on many occasions the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.410
 that is fixed in the money then not 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.440
 we want to be very elbows or be very fixed 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.450
 and good then come to explode 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.820
 financial pump later because no 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.650
 we do not even know where the money goes in the 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.540
 study reveals that attributes such as 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.150
 personality and beauty are 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.110
 important but also the solvency 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.720
 economic 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.150
 if we continue to have importance in the 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.470
 other factors such as personality and 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.380
 physical but 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.610
 we found that there is an importance that 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.260
 is being given to compatibility 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.380
 financial at the time of choosing this the 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.840
 couple many of the problems between a 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.390
 couple have a root in money or in 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.610
 lack of money I think it's a 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.910
 of the main reasons why 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:06.180
 couples fight I think the number 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.940
 one would be about nothing is that they are allegations 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.250
 common but also for us to be up there 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.440
 the fights over money to avoid 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.330
 fights of this kind you have to be what 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.430
 as honest as possible with the couple over 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.130
 how the money is spent and how much 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.060
 have to save for future plans not 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.069
 hide the expenses 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.410
 and that both feel part of the 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.660
 financial decisions that are being 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.280
 doing at home 50 percent of 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.310
 men are more likely than 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.200
 women with only 30% to evaluate the 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.230
 physical attraction in its three main 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.770
 important attributes to choose your 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.480
 partner 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.830
 but the survey was carried out by 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.660
 telephone in the month of March and 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.370
 results were presented on the day of 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.460
 today and here we have our survey and 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.110
 exactly the result came out that it 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.970
 I have fought for money quarrels that 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.980
 throw the first stone of what all 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.460
 we are going to include suite is good with 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.460
 naturalness
