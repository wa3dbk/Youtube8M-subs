00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
a judgment we found that out it's really

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.030 
a judgment we found that out it's really
it's<00:05:48.630> really<00:05:48.720> easy<00:05:49.080> to<00:05:49.200> be<00:05:49.440> a<00:05:49.620> cruel<00:05:49.950> ultimatum

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.040 
it's really easy to be a cruel ultimatum

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.620 
it's really easy to be a cruel ultimatum
but<00:05:50.580> it's<00:05:50.700> really<00:05:50.940> hard<00:05:51.120> to<00:05:51.180> be<00:05:51.270> that<00:05:51.300> day<00:05:51.510> of

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
but it's really hard to be that day of

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.700 
you had a breakout performance approach
our<00:06:53.250> Honolulu<00:06:53.700> you<00:06:54.300> had<00:06:54.420> to<00:06:54.630> GP<00:06:54.960> top<00:06:55.200> aides<00:06:55.440> and

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:55.710 
our Honolulu you had to GP top aides and

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.220 
our Honolulu you had to GP top aides and
then<00:06:56.400> you<00:06:56.550> you<00:06:56.730> want<00:06:56.910> a<00:06:56.940> legacy<00:06:57.390> 5k<00:06:57.750> recently

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:58.230 
then you you want a legacy 5k recently

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.470 
then you you want a legacy 5k recently
so<00:06:58.800> you<00:06:59.220> do<00:06:59.790> it<00:06:59.880> you<00:06:59.970> playing<00:07:00.180> some<00:07:00.300> really

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:00.480 
so you do it you playing some really

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.170 
so you do it you playing some really
good<00:07:00.570> magic<00:07:00.830> what's<00:07:01.830> your<00:07:01.980> goal<00:07:02.130> for<00:07:02.160> 2010<00:07:02.790> I

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.180 
good magic what's your goal for 2010 I

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.240 
good magic what's your goal for 2010 I
guess<00:07:03.600> the<00:07:03.810> reach<00:07:03.960> level<00:07:04.260> six<00:07:04.500> probably<00:07:04.800> have

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:05.250 
guess the reach level six probably have

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.850 
guess the reach level six probably have
a<00:07:05.280> top<00:07:05.460> aide<00:07:05.610> another<00:07:05.820> Pro<00:07:05.970> Tour<00:07:06.740> Abby<00:07:07.740> the

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:07.860 
a top aide another Pro Tour Abby the

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.800 
a top aide another Pro Tour Abby the
realistic<00:07:08.250> goals<00:07:08.430> a<00:07:08.580> thing<00:07:08.760> you<00:07:09.180> know<00:07:09.390> I<00:07:09.540> want

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:09.810 
realistic goals a thing you know I want

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.690 
realistic goals a thing you know I want
to<00:07:09.870> win<00:07:09.960> them<00:07:10.050> all<00:07:10.140> of<00:07:10.320> course<00:07:10.350> but<00:07:10.830> then

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:11.700 
to win them all of course but then

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:22.910
