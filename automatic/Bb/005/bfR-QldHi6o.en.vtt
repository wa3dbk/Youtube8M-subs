giving birth to magsafe 2 in 2012 it's
worked<00:02:00.450> well<00:02:00.750> ever<00:02:01.079> since<00:02:01.170> but<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.189> hasn't

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
worked well ever since but that hasn't

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.160 
worked well ever since but that hasn't
stopped<00:02:02.820> us<00:02:03.119> from<00:02:03.180> yearning<00:02:03.689> for<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.930> more

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
stopped us from yearning for a more

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.810 
stopped us from yearning for a more
innovative<00:02:04.439> charging<00:02:05.159> method<00:02:05.399> such<00:02:05.790> as

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
innovative charging method such as

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.960 
innovative charging method such as
inductive<00:02:06.420> or<00:02:06.570> wireless<00:02:07.290> charging<00:02:07.710> a

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
inductive or wireless charging a

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.190 
inductive or wireless charging a
technology<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.090> has<00:02:09.479> brought<00:02:09.720> added

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
technology that has brought added

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.790 
technology that has brought added
flexibility<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:11.069> arable<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.610> smartphones<00:02:12.470> ok

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
flexibility to arable and smartphones ok

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.500 
flexibility to arable and smartphones ok
so<00:02:14.130> this<00:02:14.340> one<00:02:14.580> may<00:02:14.760> be<00:02:14.820> something<00:02:15.180> of<00:02:15.420> an

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
so this one may be something of an

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.710 
so this one may be something of an
optimistic<00:02:15.960> request<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.800> put<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.130> mildly<00:02:17.720> but

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
optimistic request to put it mildly but
