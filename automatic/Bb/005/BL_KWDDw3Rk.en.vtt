limb and at this stage of the game being
a<00:01:52.890> pioneer<00:01:53.280> involves<00:01:53.880> risk<00:01:54.439> but<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.470> knew<00:01:55.710> that

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
a pioneer involves risk but I knew that

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.499 
a pioneer involves risk but I knew that
the<00:01:56.009> reaction<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.579> state<00:01:56.790> was<00:01:56.969> going<00:01:57.420> to

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
the reaction of the state was going to

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.100 
the reaction of the state was going to
have<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.659> major<00:01:57.869> impact<00:01:58.170> on<00:01:58.619> our<00:01:58.860> success<00:01:59.390> and<00:02:00.390> I

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
have a major impact on our success and I

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.719 
have a major impact on our success and I
knew<00:02:01.290> there<00:02:01.500> wasn't<00:02:01.680> much<00:02:02.100> precedent<00:02:02.610> for

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
knew there wasn't much precedent for

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.069 
knew there wasn't much precedent for
what<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.909> was<00:02:03.149> going<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.360> show<00:02:03.450> Pat<00:02:03.810> may<00:02:03.990> have

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
what I was going to show Pat may have

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.039 
what I was going to show Pat may have
been<00:02:04.200> in<00:02:04.320> our<00:02:04.439> state<00:02:04.710> at<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:04.979> time<00:02:05.899> anyway<00:02:06.899> we

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
been in our state at that time anyway we

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.559 
been in our state at that time anyway we
rolled<00:02:07.290> out<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.619> plans<00:02:07.890> told<00:02:08.879> our<00:02:09.000> story<00:02:09.090> and

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
rolled out the plans told our story and

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.190 
rolled out the plans told our story and
Pat<00:02:10.560> just<00:02:10.800> SAT<00:02:11.069> there<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:11.750> listened

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
Pat just SAT there and listened

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.400 
Pat just SAT there and listened
and<00:02:14.120> she<00:02:15.120> has<00:02:15.209> a<00:02:15.270> poker<00:02:15.540> face<00:02:15.780> sometime<00:02:16.200> so<00:02:16.379> I

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
and she has a poker face sometime so I

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.559 
and she has a poker face sometime so I
wasn't<00:02:16.770> sure<00:02:16.920> how<00:02:17.069> we<00:02:17.129> were<00:02:17.310> doing<00:02:17.510> when<00:02:18.510> we

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
wasn't sure how we were doing when we

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.020 
wasn't sure how we were doing when we
got<00:02:18.840> done<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.739> I'll<00:02:20.160> never<00:02:20.489> forget<00:02:20.879> the<00:02:21.000> look

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
got done and I'll never forget the look

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.509 
got done and I'll never forget the look
on<00:02:21.239> her<00:02:21.360> face<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.810> was<00:02:21.840> like<00:02:21.959> it's<00:02:22.950> about<00:02:23.250> damn

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
on her face it was like it's about damn

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.940 
on her face it was like it's about damn
time<00:02:23.550> somebody<00:02:24.239> got<00:02:24.360> with<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.599> program<00:02:24.950> from

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
time somebody got with the program from

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.559 
time somebody got with the program from
that<00:02:26.040> point<00:02:26.280> on<00:02:26.430> she<00:02:26.459> jumped<00:02:26.970> in<00:02:27.090> like<00:02:27.120> she'd

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
that point on she jumped in like she'd

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.390 
that point on she jumped in like she'd
been<00:02:27.720> waiting<00:02:27.870> for<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.920> opportunity<00:02:28.950> for

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
been waiting for the opportunity for

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.790 
been waiting for the opportunity for
years<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:30.000> became<00:02:30.300> an<00:02:30.800> absolutely

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
years and became an absolutely

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.320 
years and became an absolutely
invaluable<00:02:32.280> partner<00:02:32.849> in<00:02:33.030> our<00:02:33.150> design

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
invaluable partner in our design

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.720 
invaluable partner in our design
programming<00:02:33.989> in<00:02:34.590> terms<00:02:34.769> of<00:02:34.920> its<00:02:35.069> relationship
