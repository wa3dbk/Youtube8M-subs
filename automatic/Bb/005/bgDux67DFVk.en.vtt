the<00:00:05.370> beauty<00:00:05.670> of<00:00:05.700> living<00:00:06.060> in<00:00:06.149> San<00:00:06.330> Diego<00:00:06.720> in

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
the beauty of living in San Diego in

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.750 
the beauty of living in San Diego in
Southern<00:00:07.170> California<00:00:07.319> is<00:00:07.890> that<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.280> climate

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
Southern California is that the climate

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.480 
Southern California is that the climate
differential<00:00:09.510> between<00:00:09.660> high<00:00:10.049> and<00:00:10.080> low<00:00:10.230> is<00:00:10.740> the

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
differential between high and low is the

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.190 
differential between high and low is the
lowest<00:00:12.030> that<00:00:12.180> exists<00:00:12.540> in<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.690> United<00:00:12.839> States

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
lowest that exists in the United States

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.369 
lowest that exists in the United States
so<00:00:13.589> that<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:14.219> fact<00:00:14.580> that<00:00:14.730> we<00:00:14.940> have<00:00:15.150> solar<00:00:16.080> gain

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
so that the fact that we have solar gain

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.380 
so that the fact that we have solar gain
that<00:00:16.560> happens<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.070> warm<00:00:17.310> up<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.550> room<00:00:17.790> the

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
that happens to warm up a room the

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.150 
that happens to warm up a room the
concrete<00:00:18.869> floors<00:00:19.169> that<00:00:19.349> capture<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.830> heat

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
concrete floors that capture the heat

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.009 
concrete floors that capture the heat
gain<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.609> radiate<00:00:21.449> that<00:00:21.630> through<00:00:21.900> the

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:22.019 
gain and radiate that through the

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:24.740 
gain and radiate that through the
evening<00:00:22.340> enables<00:00:23.340> us<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.550> basically<00:00:24.119> live

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
evening enables us to basically live

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.099 
evening enables us to basically live
outside<00:00:26.029> the<00:00:27.029> outdoor<00:00:27.510> rooms<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.900> most

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
outside the outdoor rooms the most

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.140 
outside the outdoor rooms the most
important<00:00:28.679> so<00:00:28.830> if<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.340> had<00:00:29.490> an<00:00:29.609> outdoor<00:00:30.000> room

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
important so if I had an outdoor room

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.179 
important so if I had an outdoor room
that<00:00:30.300> had<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.449> huge<00:00:30.689> wall<00:00:31.170> that<00:00:31.590> was<00:00:31.710> stuck<00:00:32.009> out

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
that had a huge wall that was stuck out

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.549 
that had a huge wall that was stuck out
next<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.759> or<00:00:32.910> small<00:00:33.420> windows<00:00:33.839> it<00:00:34.350> would<00:00:34.470> be

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
next to it or small windows it would be

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.440 
next to it or small windows it would be
completely<00:00:34.980> different<00:00:35.220> than<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:36.089> would<00:00:36.269> be<00:00:36.300> to

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
completely different than it would be to

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.560 
completely different than it would be to
have<00:00:36.780> these<00:00:37.260> moveable<00:00:37.860> walls<00:00:38.040> here<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:39.090> open

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
have these moveable walls here that open

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.940 
have these moveable walls here that open
up<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.719> space<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.320> inside<00:00:40.739> on<00:00:40.770> the

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
up the space to the inside on the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.790 
up the space to the inside on the
outside<00:00:41.899> this<00:00:42.899> home<00:00:43.110> was<00:00:43.289> built<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.620> nine

on grade and above grade what was really

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.920 
on grade and above grade what was really
important<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.579> us<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.090> deal<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.600> ability

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
correct and our long-term we found so

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.029

many<00:01:24.420> products<00:01:24.959> and<00:01:25.080> windows<00:01:25.380> specifically

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
many products and windows specifically

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.609 
many products and windows specifically
where<00:01:26.490> glass<00:01:26.819> fails<00:01:27.179> where<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.990> pieces<00:01:28.410> start

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
where glass fails where the pieces start

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.740 
where glass fails where the pieces start
to<00:01:28.709> delaminate<00:01:29.039> where<00:01:29.580> the<00:01:30.030> coatings<00:01:30.509> start

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
to delaminate where the coatings start

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.460 
to delaminate where the coatings start
to<00:01:30.869> dissolve<00:01:32.179> where<00:01:33.179> keys<00:01:33.630> don't<00:01:33.989> work<00:01:34.110> where

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
to dissolve where keys don't work where

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.290 
to dissolve where keys don't work where
locks<00:01:34.709> don't<00:01:34.920> work<00:01:35.039> or<00:01:35.369> rollers<00:01:35.940> don't<00:01:36.090> work

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
locks don't work or rollers don't work

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.529 
locks don't work or rollers don't work
and<00:01:36.539> I<00:01:36.989> think<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.470> important<00:01:38.220> part<00:01:38.399> of<00:01:38.670> all<00:01:39.479> of

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
and I think the important part of all of

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.449 
and I think the important part of all of
our<00:01:39.869> buildings<00:01:40.289> that<00:01:40.410> we<00:01:40.560> do<00:01:40.709> when<00:01:40.890> we<00:01:40.979> use<00:01:41.220> a

00:01:41.449 --> 00:01:41.459 
our buildings that we do when we use a

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:43.350 
our buildings that we do when we use a
sliding<00:01:41.789> door<00:01:42.119> systems<00:01:42.660> the<00:01:42.840> fact

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
sliding door systems the fact

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.600 
sliding door systems the fact
we<00:01:43.450> need<00:01:43.630> all<00:01:43.870> those<00:01:44.140> things<00:01:44.200> to<00:01:44.620> work<00:01:44.860> in<00:01:45.520> a

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
we need all those things to work in a

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.690 
we need all those things to work in a
timely<00:01:46.000> manner<00:01:46.180> and<00:01:46.770> work<00:01:47.770> well<00:01:48.100> and<00:01:48.550> I<00:01:48.640> think

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
timely manner and work well and I think

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.490 
timely manner and work well and I think
the<00:01:49.000> most<00:01:49.150> important<00:01:49.780> thing<00:01:49.930> we've<00:01:50.110> had<00:01:50.320> in

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
the most important thing we've had in

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.660 
the most important thing we've had in
any<00:01:50.710> of<00:01:50.830> the<00:01:50.890> products<00:01:51.250> here

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
any of the products here

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.790 
any of the products here
is<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.210> Western<00:01:52.390> window<00:01:52.930> system<00:01:53.290> the<00:01:53.560> fact

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
is the Western window system the fact

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.520 
is the Western window system the fact
they<00:01:53.950> to<00:01:54.010> help<00:01:54.280> us<00:01:54.490> be<00:01:55.030> an<00:01:55.360> aggressive
