00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.080
 the conclusion 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.000
 could convince us at the first 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.070
 mirrorless system camera from canon das 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.600
 high quality housing the compact 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.720
 dimensions and the very good 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.429
 Image quality of the aps c sensor 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.939
 this is at the level of a 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:32.290
 SLR camera up to 1600 iso 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.170
 it almost did not complain 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.500
 even an iso value of 3200 can turn out 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.930
 Let's see 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.850
 30 inch large display triggers with over 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.930
 one million subpixels up and up 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.060
 owns a very good one 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.130
 touchscreen surface at the 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.340
 There is speed 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.280
 potential for improvement 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.270
 the canon eos m can indeed 43 pictures per 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.309
 save second 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.350
 in the simultaneous recording of jpeg 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.090
 and raw images breaks the frame rate though 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.910
 already after three pictures in a row 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.920
 under a picture per second one 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.449
 the autofocus of the canon eos m is for 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.880
 hardly any moving objects 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.130
 Use to focus with 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.220
 Objectively long the lens 0.81 seconds 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.960
 needed because there is no lightning in the 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.119
 Camera has integrated when needed 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.160
 an external lightning device attached 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.649
 Canon is thought of 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.750
 Objective adapter with the EF objective 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.580
 adapter can all ef and ef s 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.149
 lenses used on the canon eos m 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.820
 become 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:29.009
 unfortunately, with adapted objective the 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.490
 size advantage of esm almost completely 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.680
 lost 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.149
 The autofocus is also only for 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.149
 static objects suitable 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.830
 the canon eos m is primarily for 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.479
 all those interesting ones 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.430
 the best possible image quality in one 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.350
 as compact as possible housing search and 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.430
 Neither a quick autofocus nor 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.049
 need a finder 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.909
 who completely from his canon 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.130
 SLR camera on the ESM 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.750
 wants to change seems currently still on 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.070
 the limited possibilities of the 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.070
 canon eos systems 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.350
 that the camera punkt.de test judgment to the 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.350
 camera
