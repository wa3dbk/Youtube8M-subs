00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.060
 material me personally I like

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.050
 little 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.750
 and then also a little freedom 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.510
 of financial autonomy compared to my 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.110

 alexandre is stuntman 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.880
 it allows to live throughout 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.310
 the year because six months have made 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.510
 intense puy-du-fou and after the rest of 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.100
 the year is harder to find 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.990
 work 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.410
 the crisis is felt in both 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.480
 parks 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.370
 applications are increasing 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.230
 besides among the seasonal 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.700
 hired this year some are 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.920
 graduates but can not find a job 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.440
 in their sector like cassandre 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.440
 formoso laboratory technician 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.330
 I would have preferred to be in my field 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.910
 but after that it's very hard to find 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.440
 a fixed job 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.810
 so we know very rare now 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.140
 that they offer cds like that so 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.490
 so here we have to take what has 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.660
 waiting to find something 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.700
 fixed alongside the seasonal ones about

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.870
