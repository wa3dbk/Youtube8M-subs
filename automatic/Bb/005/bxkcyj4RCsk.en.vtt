00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.600
 Inspiration is everywhere

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.950
 from the conventional the simple tests 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.030
 I will apply some base 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.470
 co-govern in secret line on top of my 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.340
 eyelids so that the shadows are 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:45.580
 adhere and the colors intensify 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.890
 the eyeliner the software soft pencil 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.110

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.180
 for the color that I will apply more 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.250
 go ahead so I 'm going to put it in the 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.190
 lacrimal area and then with a 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:01.150
 Somni eyeliner but now in soft sky 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:04.059
 is to say more an intense good I'm going to do 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.280
 the same to put it as proof is in 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.940
 the eyelid mobile and also under the 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.940
 lower lashes 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.570
 all the colors that I will use to 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.670
 continuation are from the twelve palette 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.270
 o'clock on a divan I will also take 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.649

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.220

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.560
 green pencil than previous 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.290
 it will be a moment now I am going to apply a 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.770
 blue shade a pretty intense color 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.500
 electric over the blue pencil so 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.650
 this combination of textures makes the 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.770
 color look much more intense 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.770
 i 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.230
 here 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.550
 with a clean brush I will make a 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.640
 combination of these two tones that are 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:57.820
 the warm tones and I'm going to border 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:02.070
 the blue color so I'll try to 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:05.820
 keep the shape that the plumage gives us 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:09.880

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.310

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.970

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.970

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.250
 one end to the other I'm using the 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.100

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:22.500

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:25.060

 eyelashes so it looks super cute and 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.780

 we finished with the makeup and now what 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:28.479
 what I did in my hair was very easy 

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:31.620
 roll all my hair action side and 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:35.409

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.499
 look I'm going to put these agents that are 

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:47.439

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:49.990

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.180
 special at night a that of a dress 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:06.509
 a single tone because if you put a 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.830
 stamping may be too much 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:10.569
 extravagant but with a little 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.460
 Extravagance from time to time does not 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:14.469

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.569
