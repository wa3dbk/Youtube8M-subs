00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
to work harder I know the team all the

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.230 
to work harder I know the team all the
teams<00:03:11.700> are<00:03:11.820> working<00:03:11.970> very<00:03:12.900> much<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:14.210> so<00:03:15.210> I

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
teams are working very much and so I

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.540 
teams are working very much and so I
just<00:03:15.630> have<00:03:16.050> to<00:03:16.170> stay<00:03:16.350> focused<00:03:16.380> and<00:03:16.920> my

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
just have to stay focused and my

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.320 
just have to stay focused and my
motivation<00:03:18.090> is<00:03:18.150> hundred<00:03:18.540> ten<00:03:18.720> percent

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
motivation is hundred ten percent

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.880 
motivation is hundred ten percent
completely<00:03:21.330> different<00:03:21.630> strategy<00:03:22.080> for<00:03:22.740> this

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
completely different strategy for this

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.830 
completely different strategy for this
year<00:03:23.100> compared<00:03:23.430> with<00:03:23.520> last<00:03:23.580> year<00:03:23.910> and<00:03:24.830> so<00:03:25.830> I

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
year compared with last year and so I

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.530 
year compared with last year and so I
really<00:03:27.840> think<00:03:27.990> we<00:03:28.110> have<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.880> best<00:03:29.880> mechanics
