00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.640 
in January like I said something always
always<00:01:39.760> happen<00:01:40.180> for<00:01:40.420> this<00:01:40.570> year<00:01:40.840> however<00:01:41.050> we

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
always happen for this year however we

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.050 
always happen for this year however we
would<00:01:41.710> add<00:01:41.860> secret<00:01:42.130> santa<00:01:42.460> and<00:01:42.610> I<00:01:42.820> was<00:01:42.940> the

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
would add secret santa and I was the

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.760 
would add secret santa and I was the
only<00:01:43.180> person<00:01:43.270> to<00:01:43.660> turn<00:01:43.840> up<00:01:44.050> and<00:01:44.350> give<00:01:44.620> my

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
only person to turn up and give my

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.300 
only person to turn up and give my
present<00:01:45.160> to<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.430> person<00:01:45.790> I<00:01:45.850> was<00:01:45.970> supposed<00:01:46.300> to

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
present to the person I was supposed to

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.710 
present to the person I was supposed to
this<00:01:48.310> is<00:01:48.430> what<00:01:48.640> secret<00:01:48.970> santa<00:01:49.240> never<00:01:49.450> works

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
this is what secret santa never works

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.270 
this is what secret santa never works
because<00:01:49.930> people<00:01:50.650> don't<00:01:50.800> make<00:01:50.980> the<00:01:51.130> effort

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
because people don't make the effort

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.250 
because people don't make the effort
you're<00:01:51.730> doing<00:01:51.940> one<00:01:52.180> present<00:01:52.630> for<00:01:52.810> one<00:01:52.990> person

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
you're doing one present for one person

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.320 
you're doing one present for one person
instead<00:01:53.710> of<00:01:53.860> doing<00:01:54.159> a<00:01:54.340> present<00:01:54.730> for<00:01:54.880> everyone

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
instead of doing a present for everyone

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.030 
instead of doing a present for everyone
and<00:01:55.570> that<00:01:55.960> means<00:01:56.200> you<00:01:56.350> can<00:01:56.530> put<00:01:56.680> a<00:01:56.710> lot<00:01:57.010> of

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
and that means you can put a lot of

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.430 
and that means you can put a lot of
effort<00:01:57.460> into<00:01:57.610> one<00:01:57.880> present<00:01:58.330> but<00:01:58.600> people<00:01:59.260> just

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
effort into one present but people just

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.410 
effort into one present but people just
don't<00:01:59.860> think<00:01:59.980> about<00:02:00.340> that<00:02:00.729> and<00:02:00.970> they<00:02:01.150> just

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
don't think about that and they just

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.990 
don't think about that and they just
think<00:02:01.659> I'll<00:02:02.320> just<00:02:02.500> get<00:02:02.590> them<00:02:02.740> a<00:02:02.800> sock<00:02:03.040> not<00:02:03.970> a

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
think I'll just get them a sock not a

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.060 
think I'll just get them a sock not a
pair<00:02:04.180> just<00:02:04.450> a<00:02:04.600> sock<00:02:04.840> I<00:02:05.110> like<00:02:05.470> secrets<00:02:05.830> and<00:02:05.979> I

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
pair just a sock I like secrets and I

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.890 
pair just a sock I like secrets and I
think<00:02:06.250> it's<00:02:06.370> a<00:02:06.430> good<00:02:06.550> idea<00:02:06.729> if<00:02:07.300> it<00:02:07.570> always

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
think it's a good idea if it always

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.749 
think it's a good idea if it always
worked<00:02:08.200> I<00:02:08.470> think<00:02:08.739> it's<00:02:08.860> fantastic<00:02:09.099> and<00:02:09.670> I

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
worked I think it's fantastic and I

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.040 
worked I think it's fantastic and I
definitely<00:02:09.940> wouldn't<00:02:10.300> put<00:02:10.450> it<00:02:10.479> in<00:02:10.599> room<00:02:10.780> 101

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
and that will just obliviate to

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.860 
and that will just obliviate to
because<00:02:44.610> people<00:02:45.120> just<00:02:45.300> feel<00:02:45.510> like<00:02:45.660> they<00:02:45.840> have

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870

because people just feel like they have
to<00:02:46.440> lose<00:02:46.620> all<00:02:46.800> their<00:02:46.980> money<00:02:47.040> because<00:02:47.550> it's

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
to lose all their money because it's

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.180 
to lose all their money because it's
Christmas<00:02:48.300> there's<00:02:48.780> no<00:02:48.900> reason<00:02:49.320> because<00:02:50.010> it's

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
Christmas there's no reason because it's

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.030 
Christmas there's no reason because it's
Christmas<00:02:50.460> and<00:02:50.910> that's<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.870> thought<00:02:52.380> process

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
Christmas and that's the thought process

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.590 
Christmas and that's the thought process
that<00:02:53.280> goes<00:02:53.400> on<00:02:53.640> in<00:02:53.700> everyone's<00:02:54.210> head<00:02:54.420> at

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600

that goes on in everyone's head at
Christmas<00:02:55.050> and<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.650> is<00:02:55.800> probably<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.460> worst

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
Christmas and that is probably the worst

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.630 
Christmas and that is probably the worst
thing<00:02:57.240> I<00:02:57.510> can<00:02:57.720> say<00:02:57.930> about<00:02:57.960> Christmas<00:02:58.710> the<00:02:59.610> way
