00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 and the damn nerds need to be 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.890
 informed by that now max and brings you 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.100
 all the news from the world of 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.770
 technology and the damn video games 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.110
 joystick with heart an engineer the 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.970
 American University of Stanford 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.010
 created the prototype of a joystick that 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.660
 It has a fascinating purpose to detect 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.760
 what happens to us in the body when we are 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.590
 playing a video game the peripheral is 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.440
 a modified version of the joystick of 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.000
 xbox 360 that includes metal plates and 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.190
 sensors with which measures the rhythm 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.080
 cardiac blood flow and until the 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.850
 respiration of the user according to 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.620
 developer of this peripheral the 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.660
 different emotions that we feel when 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.610
 we play pitching like boredom 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.960
 or fun manifest in the body 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.300
 through changes in the pace of 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.309
 our heart breathing temperature 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.870
 or sweating that this one can detect 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.460
 all these changes apply a 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.409
 device like this for the mass audience 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.089
 could develop for example a 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:56.650
 video game that alters its behavior 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:58.059
 depending on the signals that the 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.830
 fiction industry control nerd ha 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.780
 tried several times to make products 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.879
 with similar features like the wii 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.890
 vitality sensor from nintendo presented 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.690
 in 2009 that unfortunately never came out 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.190
 on sale for him on his part too 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.140
 has experimented with the use of 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.000
 biometrics for the creation of games 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.979
 as portal and hard drive 2 but decided 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.340
 remove that possible provision in your 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.920
 own joystick 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.960
 4 here is already here is surprising the 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.359
 4k resolution advance speed 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.670
 about consumer technology 4k is 

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:27.950
 the successor of the full hd that we see today in 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.719
 Our led and lcd TVs and offers 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.939
 Four times more image quality 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:34.069
 detailed almost impossible to differentiate 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.959
 from the detail of real life the first 

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:38.240
 4k televisions they saw a couple of 

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:39.859
 years and the general interest was so much that 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.929
 in the recent exhibition cesc de 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:44.750
 technology for the home we already saw several 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:47.299
 that will come out during 2014 at prices 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.009
 relatively accessible but clear with 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.079
 the television we do not do anything is needed 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.880
 contained in the same we are the 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.739
 first cable transmissions in 4k 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.329
 but as it has been happening for a while 

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:58.219
 streaming video services are 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.049
 overtake the technology of the past 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.879
 since this week netflix started 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.979
 distribute the content in 4k format 

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:05.840
 for everyone starting with the 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.640
 second season of the series house of 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.679
 cards and some documentaries about 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.209
 nature even if you do not have a TV 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.920
 four drawers enjoy this 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.530
 increased definition by streaming 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.420
 through p 0 care or you try 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.750
 if you do not have at least 10 megabytes of 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.580
 your connection speed is thinking 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.560
 can from the announcement of x 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.660
 one is talking about the possibility 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.460
 that in the future Microsoft will launch the 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.440
 sale a version of your console that does not 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.090
 include by default the control with 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.410
 motion sensor has here this 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.840
 week an important voice of the 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.490
 industry rose up in favor of it is about 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.740
 peter molyneux game creator 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.480
 exclusive xbox like the football series 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.430
 and many more classics who said in a 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.380
 interview with the magazine is that it would be 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.370
 unthinkable that microsoft does not take out the 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.560
 sale a version of its most recent 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.570
 console who pointed out that by doing so 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.310
 would reduce production costs and so 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.780
 both of sale but also hit him a 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.400
 little stick to the cinema to say that what 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.530
 consider unnecessary addition 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.150
 he also commented with a certain irony that his 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.010
 son and he sit in front of the 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.420
 television and they dictate random commands 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.520
 at kinect several devices do not 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.380
 it works it sounds weird that mill criticize 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.150
 so much to this peripheral since he was 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.770
 one of the developers or maybe because 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.709
 That kept it a little more data corner 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.050
 on www.twitter.com and Monday through Friday 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.790
 at 19 o'clock by fucking net by vorterix 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.220
 loc where what you hear is what you see 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:23.410
 the misfits will stay on earth 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:28.120
 and for that they need to be informed 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.120
