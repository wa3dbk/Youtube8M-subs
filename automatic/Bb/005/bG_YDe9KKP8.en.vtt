00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.849
 protectors and equipment

 that the glasses on it is that the helmet 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.990
 realize that the bike is okay and then 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.759
 first we release the track and have 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.759
 all we wish you good luck 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.300
 the bikepark was finally opened 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.880

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.850
 why a long job but you have to 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.800
 elizabeth was great from the red group 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.690
 professionally done so i have 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.850
 seldom such a professionalism 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.070

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.230
 So it's very professional 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.150
 there it can finally start the slow forward 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.920
 yes that was a huge act we have 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.990
 insane amount of time plugged in two 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.580
 years, that really does not happen 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.840
 so long before you pass it 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.310
 that was crazy 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.700
 and we are just glad that now 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.700
 and go 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.659
 the track is 3.9 kilometers long and 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.810
 has a height difference of 400 meters 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.610
 over 40 obstacles from table to 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.869
 wall rides to the step up is everything 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.549
 so that's a lot of fun 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.929
 Year you look like I have 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.860

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:47.630

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:59.479
 I'm more like murder from absolutely 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:02:02.390
 are safe when you fly 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.700
 the fly in the nose had frightened 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.090
 you could ever happen something else 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.090
 happen 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.700
 very good so you really have to 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.930
 Farmers are really praising what to talk about 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.079
 now on your legs here in time 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.939

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:41.590
 if this is already for the broad 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:43.689
 So what's not for the experts 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.690

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:50.790
 canceled is quite funny is okay yes 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:56.200
 but the track is really cool 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:03:01.390

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:03.879
