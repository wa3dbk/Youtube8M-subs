00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.600 
alright so I met the Poteau River at
Panama<00:02:00.800> so<00:02:01.800> the<00:02:01.920> river<00:02:02.130> normally<00:02:02.700> runs

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
Panama so the river normally runs

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.889 
Panama so the river normally runs
underneath<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.850> bridge<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.390> course

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.559 

and<00:02:09.349> the<00:02:09.530> James<00:02:09.799> for<00:02:10.220> creek<00:02:10.640> meets<00:02:11.000> up<00:02:11.209> with<00:02:11.239> it

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
and the James for creek meets up with it

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.350 
and the James for creek meets up with it
over<00:02:11.780> here<00:02:12.019> I<00:02:12.340> feel<00:02:13.340> bad<00:02:13.579> because<00:02:13.610> they're<00:02:14.329> the

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
over here I feel bad because they're the

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.679 
over here I feel bad because they're the
force<00:02:14.780> over<00:02:15.290> here<00:02:15.879> it<00:02:16.879> doesn't<00:02:17.269> really<00:02:17.390> have

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:17.689 
force over here it doesn't really have

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:19.750 
force over here it doesn't really have
very<00:02:17.989> much<00:02:18.470> high<00:02:18.739> ground<00:02:19.099> I<00:02:19.250> mean<00:02:19.400> I<00:02:19.549> guess

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
very much high ground I mean I guess

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.869 
very much high ground I mean I guess
he's<00:02:19.970> got<00:02:20.090> a<00:02:20.150> little<00:02:20.329> bit<00:02:20.510> of<00:02:20.540> high<00:02:20.659> ground<00:02:20.989> so

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
he's got a little bit of high ground so

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.119 
he's got a little bit of high ground so
he'll<00:02:22.879> be<00:02:22.909> okay<00:02:23.360> as<00:02:24.319> long<00:02:24.379> as<00:02:24.680> this<00:02:25.069> doesn't

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
he'll be okay as long as this doesn't

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.059 
he'll be okay as long as this doesn't
rise<00:02:25.670> in<00:02:25.849> the<00:02:25.939> tire<00:02:26.180> which<00:02:26.480> it<00:02:26.659> shouldn't<00:02:27.069> dang

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
rise in the tire which it shouldn't dang

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:48.680 
rise in the tire which it shouldn't dang
you<00:02:28.670> got<00:02:28.819> tadpoles<00:02:29.480> galore

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:03:23.590
