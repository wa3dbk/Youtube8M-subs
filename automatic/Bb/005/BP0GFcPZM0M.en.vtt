00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.459 
on a raw food diet and so they want to
be<00:01:16.429> very<00:01:16.640> pure<00:01:16.909> istic<00:01:17.329> and<00:01:17.569> use<00:01:17.990> this<00:01:18.200> very

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:18.469 
be very pure istic and use this very

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:22.090 
be very pure istic and use this very
much<00:01:18.710> as<00:01:18.859> a<00:01:18.890> healing<00:01:19.369> tool<00:01:19.609> and<00:01:20.049> if<00:01:21.049> you<00:01:21.590> really

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
much as a healing tool and if you really

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.449 
much as a healing tool and if you really
aim<00:01:22.369> for<00:01:22.929> pure<00:01:23.929> healing<00:01:24.350> and<00:01:24.709> doing<00:01:24.979> kind<00:01:25.250> of<00:01:25.340> a

00:01:25.449 --> 00:01:25.459 
aim for pure healing and doing kind of a

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:29.679 
aim for pure healing and doing kind of a
cleanse<00:01:25.990> then<00:01:26.990> I<00:01:27.350> think<00:01:28.209> dehydrator<00:01:29.209> is<00:01:29.299> not

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
cleanse then I think dehydrator is not

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:31.870 
cleanse then I think dehydrator is not
really<00:01:30.170> 100%<00:01:30.289> necessary<00:01:30.829> because<00:01:31.399> then<00:01:31.789> you

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
really 100% necessary because then you

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.319 
really 100% necessary because then you
could<00:01:32.060> really<00:01:32.299> just<00:01:32.420> go<00:01:32.780> for<00:01:33.079> mono<00:01:33.679> eating

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
could really just go for mono eating

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:39.580 
could really just go for mono eating
eating<00:01:35.329> a<00:01:35.659> simple<00:01:36.469> not<00:01:37.299> processed<00:01:38.299> food<00:01:39.229> again
