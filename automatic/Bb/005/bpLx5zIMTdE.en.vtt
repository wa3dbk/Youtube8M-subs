00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.070
 hours 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.169
 today I have but any amount 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.169
 sewing work 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.029
 let's learn to stick the sleeve 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.070
 finish the tajito of the sleeve from 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.949
 Also teach sewing on cooked 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.929
 How do industrial usage 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:36.040
 so that really to sew a shirt 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:38.530
 be something pleasant good we start 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.770
 first because we are also seeing a 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:46.330
 little the sewing sequence saw that 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:48.820
 and paste bagged the yokes success 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.700
 from the back we already did the completion 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.340
 and optionally also the carteritas 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.170
 I can have the collar but good 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.450
 first let's go before pasting the sleeves 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.540
 to finish the opening cut that I 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.089
 I have it here as a finished model 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:07.240
 Then look at the little guy we had 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.040
 said that goes in the middle of the ass 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.840
 is from the back of the hand 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.610
 and a little bit of about 10 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.560
 centimeters so that it can be rolled up 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.930
 the sleeve if I do this on a shirt 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.240
 of lady with 18 68 centimeters is 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.850
 enough and let's start with a 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.160
 hem look fine finite well the most 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.820
 finite we can of the most part 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.650
 narrow of the sleeve then after 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.890
 cutting a strip that may have 67 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.450
 centimeters wide is to say it stuck 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.909
 on the wrong side I'm going to put it 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:42.090
 with pins look what hit and here 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.969
 the first secret of this when I come 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.240
 putting here close I will sew well 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:50.429
 almost taking just a trickle of it from 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.289
 down because I take half a centimeter 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.729
 we will be after a 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:55.649
 untidiness will remain a part 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.459
 like it is without sewing then 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:02.340
 close the strip well and sew there is 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:05.720
 Once I got it sewn well this 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:10.009
 I turn it over for the right side 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.770
 notice that with this strip I finish and 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.320
 finished and I do the other part appointment the 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.200
 part of the crossing of the garment if 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.970
 I want in this part of the top I can 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.630
 bag turning around from behind 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.270
 know him inside take it out and then 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.480
 directly come sewing then 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.610
 things and notice how sewing comes 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.100
 I come sewing I give the little back the 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.650
 here and finished here with a 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.160
 transit is to say that I have been sewing 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:44.630
 Here I follow the vueltita so and I finish 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:48.080
 docking once I have finished 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.210
 the two sleeves what I'm going to do is 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.880
 hit the sleeves and you learn to 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.560
 paste it with the seam on cooked no 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.780
 I'll have to go see them or the 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.460
 sheath to the zig zag or change 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.400
 machine now I can do everything with the 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:04.220
 straight machine look how it is here 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.710
 the sleeve finished with double stitching 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.890
 and if I'm going to teach you in this way 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:11.570
 the dressmakers the old dressmakers do not 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:16.360
 dressmakers because the old ones are old 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:21.340
 dressmakers then as they did they cooked and 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.340
 moving one of the fabrics boiled 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:28.640
 with the two fabrics of the right and then 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.830
 they overturned like this and this leftover doubles it 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.980
 they go and they did the second stitching quoted 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.450
 that's the fashion of the dressmakers in 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.820
 industrial seam would already be a 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.820
 little secret that they will not forget anymore and 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:43.280
 they will remember me always look 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:46.760
 we make a small displacement and 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.590
 we have been bagging the fabric and we sew 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.860
 here eye that has to be fine 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.740
 I cook well on the edge cited is even 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.650
 more if at some point they do not grab it or they 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:00.980
 them is the scam that seam they have like 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.510
 bagging with the cloth and if in some 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.280
 point they do the fabric a little bit 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:08.720
 nothing happens because it is inside the 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.910
 sewing if the secret is to sew well to 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.680
 see if you can see well on the edge 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.990
 quoted from the web because if I put it over 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.290
 inside when double I will be very 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.260
 gross 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:22.590
 then look at me thing like that I come as 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:27.060
 pocketing when I open I already have the double 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:29.730
 done notice when I open and overturn and 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.710
 I do the second stitching quoted I have the 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.050
 fold I've already done that one that gives so much 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.970
 I work when the dressmaker makes her 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.890
 we have it solved of 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.810
 beforehand in industrial sewing passes 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.980
 much that you will see in the class that 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.890
 I'm going to show you how to paste the 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.290
 fist like that last seam that is the 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.540
 harder we do it first then 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:52.170
 we avoid this work at the end 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:56.630
 then once you have this look 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.630
 how can they fuck the sleeve 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.380
 we put like this this is the butt of the 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.350
 manga note that the manga has a 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.990
 Rounded part is very difficult to bag 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.660
 the sleeve over the armhole is preferable 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.910
 come this way this type of sleeves also not 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.050
 they have embeds are sewn right with the 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.790
 fair measure 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:20.300
 then look at me I come sewing 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:20.300
 directly matched I come poking 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:26.290
 doing this seam I come poking 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.170
 pocketing as I always taught 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:31.600
 pocketing the body on the sleeve 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.460
 because as the sleeve is rounded 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.830
 it is very difficult to handle it instead the 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:39.460
 Sisa note that it has a whole stretch that 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:41.650
 it's straight and then they come pocketing and 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.950
 later when they finished giving the 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:48.580
 turn open both and on the side of the 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:50.500
 right and they overturn and they do the second 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:54.430
 pespunte cent notice that of that 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:58.240
 way as we have this manga already 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:00.190
 finished and then we close them and the 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.900
 shirt with the French stitching as the 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.600
 French culture is stitched right 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:07.540
 well close to the edge and on the side 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:10.930
 The bag is bagged and ends with 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:13.650
 another constructed that is that until here not 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:16.650
 we went to the side see the levels have 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.650
 finished 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:25.050
 that nobody fixes is perfect 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.050
 right and it looks perfect 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:32.640
 we finish today is a kind of 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.640
 Norm culture that is to finish the fist 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.410
 we finished with the shirt 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:50.970
 this sequence of man because because 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.970
 women with many chubby 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:57.790
 thank you we are not going to a cut and then 

00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:02.610
 we continue with patricia of the bdr that is going 

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:02.610
 to be a beautiful macrame bracelet
