 a home 

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:14.739

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.810
 Endzeitstimmung 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.810

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.840
 scarce 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.970
 no opponents 2 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.259
 the limited quarter 1 birthday 2 will be 7 percent

 St-Jakob-park clear 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:25.879
 but of course, after all, a few percent 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.480
 but it was there 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.559
 agree with Dirk Schrade Hochdorf wrong 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:35.179
 unfortunately no for Vocational strong hopefully even more exercise time 

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:38.179
 mystery

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:13.969
 if he wants can also be stopped on Wednesday night 

00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:18.249
 in order not to be heard 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:19.549
