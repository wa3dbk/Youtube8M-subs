00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
face because I was just really

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.740

concentrated also the bleach was

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.580 
concentrated also the bleach was
actually<00:01:45.260> pretty<00:01:45.979> strong<00:01:47.020> so<00:01:48.020> that's<00:01:48.290> why<00:01:48.530> it

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
actually pretty strong so that's why it

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.340 
actually pretty strong so that's why it
was<00:01:49.180> suffocating<00:01:50.180> me<00:01:50.330> a<00:01:50.360> little<00:01:50.660> bit<00:01:50.899> at<00:01:51.050> first

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
was suffocating me a little bit at first

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.940 
was suffocating me a little bit at first
but<00:01:52.160> it<00:01:52.430> was<00:01:52.610> fine<00:01:52.910> afterwards<00:01:56.649> so<00:01:57.649> I'm<00:01:57.770> just

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
but it was fine afterwards so I'm just

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:09.669 
but it was fine afterwards so I'm just
going<00:01:58.130> to<00:01:58.220> wrap<00:01:58.460> it<00:01:58.490> in<00:01:58.759> foil

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.280 

and<00:02:10.099> just<00:02:10.549> keep<00:02:10.759> on<00:02:10.939> doing<00:02:11.209> this<00:02:11.450> and<00:02:11.810> also<00:02:12.079> to

and just keep on doing this and also to
the<00:02:12.590> other<00:02:12.739> side<00:02:13.659> and<00:02:14.659> here<00:02:14.959> I'm<00:02:15.230> using<00:02:15.640> toner

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
the other side and here I'm using toner

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.160 
the other side and here I'm using toner
and<00:02:17.799> 30<00:02:18.799> volume<00:02:19.280> developer<00:02:19.970> but<00:02:20.299> I<00:02:20.599> recommend

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
and 30 volume developer but I recommend

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.309 
and 30 volume developer but I recommend
you<00:02:21.439> not<00:02:21.709> use<00:02:22.010> that<00:02:22.280> 30<00:02:23.269> volume<00:02:23.780> developer

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
you not use that 30 volume developer

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.210 
you not use that 30 volume developer
because<00:02:24.470> it<00:02:24.860> is<00:02:25.129> really<00:02:25.700> strong<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:26.890> it<00:02:27.890> can

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
because it is really strong and it can

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.599 
because it is really strong and it can
ruin<00:02:28.640> your<00:02:28.970> hair<00:02:29.209> and<00:02:29.540> also<00:02:30.409> lighten<00:02:30.920> it<00:02:31.040> up<00:02:31.250> a

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:31.609 
ruin your hair and also lighten it up a

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:36.869 
ruin your hair and also lighten it up a
bit<00:02:31.849> too<00:02:32.090> much<00:02:34.629> to<00:02:35.629> that<00:02:35.870> you<00:02:36.079> won't<00:02:36.319> like<00:02:36.530> it

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
bit too much to that you won't like it

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.369 
bit too much to that you won't like it

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
so I hope it will turn out better next

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.209 
so I hope it will turn out better next
time<00:03:57.519> I<00:03:57.579> think<00:03:57.969> it's<00:03:58.090> okay<00:03:58.930> right<00:03:59.319> now<00:03:59.500> you

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:00.219 
time I think it's okay right now you

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:01.830 
time I think it's okay right now you
can't<00:04:00.519> really<00:04:00.760> tell<00:04:01.000> the<00:04:01.030> difference<00:04:01.180> on

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
can't really tell the difference on

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.469 
can't really tell the difference on
camera<00:04:02.290> but<00:04:02.950> I<00:04:02.980> think<00:04:03.430> it's<00:04:04.319> like<00:04:05.760> they'd<00:04:06.760> be

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:07.479 
camera but I think it's like they'd be

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:10.890 
camera but I think it's like they'd be
lightened<00:04:07.810> up<00:04:08.400> it<00:04:09.400> looks<00:04:09.729> lightened<00:04:10.239> up<00:04:10.329> for

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
lightened up it looks lightened up for

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.030 
lightened up it looks lightened up for
me<00:04:11.049> so<00:04:11.639> it<00:04:12.639> definitely<00:04:12.959> lifted<00:04:13.959> because<00:04:14.709> I<00:04:14.739> use

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040
