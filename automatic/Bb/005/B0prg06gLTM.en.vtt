the original Xbox or at least just as

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.570 
the original Xbox or at least just as
ugly<00:02:16.050> so<00:02:16.560> it's<00:02:16.860> unappealing<00:02:17.490> it's<00:02:17.910> large<00:02:18.420> and

ugly so it's unappealing it's large and

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.860 
ugly so it's unappealing it's large and

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
just how it is I don't know I don't

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.690 
just how it is I don't know I don't
really<00:02:31.110> know<00:02:31.320> at<00:02:31.500> this<00:02:31.650> point<00:02:31.890> if<00:02:32.190> they<00:02:32.520> could

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
really know at this point if they could

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.090

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
with the Xbox brand in Japan I think

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.440 
with the Xbox brand in Japan I think
it's<00:02:37.890> too<00:02:38.070> little<00:02:38.280> too<00:02:38.460> late<00:02:38.670> you're<00:02:38.910> there

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
could this is Microsoft's third console

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.750 
could this is Microsoft's third console
and<00:02:42.360> they<00:02:42.420> still<00:02:42.840> have<00:02:43.170> not<00:02:43.470> penetrated<00:02:43.800> the

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
and they still have not penetrated the

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.400 
and they still have not penetrated the
Japanese<00:02:45.300> market<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.810> way<00:02:45.900> they've<00:02:46.080> wanted

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
Japanese market the way they've wanted

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.290
