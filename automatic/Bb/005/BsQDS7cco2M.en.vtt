00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
debris out from anything we've got under

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.320 
debris out from anything we've got under
the<00:01:29.380> trailer<00:01:29.620> it<00:01:30.100> also<00:01:30.310> helps<00:01:30.790> with<00:01:30.880> rodents

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
the trailer it also helps with rodents

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.060 
the trailer it also helps with rodents
when<00:01:31.600> we're<00:01:31.780> not<00:01:32.140> using<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:32.650> camper<00:01:32.920> we're

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
when we're not using the camper we're

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.560 
when we're not using the camper we're
sitting<00:01:33.369> behind<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:33.729> garage<00:01:34.000> there<00:01:34.330> on<00:01:34.479> those

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
sitting behind the garage there on those

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.060 
sitting behind the garage there on those
months<00:01:34.900> that<00:01:34.930> were<00:01:35.110> not<00:01:35.290> out<00:01:35.470> using<00:01:35.680> the<00:01:35.890> guy

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
months that were not out using the guy

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.490 
months that were not out using the guy
it<00:01:36.850> just<00:01:36.880> keeps<00:01:37.270> everything<00:01:37.450> protected<00:01:37.900> under

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
it just keeps everything protected under

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.350 
it just keeps everything protected under
there<00:01:38.710> and<00:01:38.890> it<00:01:39.190> also<00:01:39.340> helps<00:01:39.880> out<00:01:40.060> with<00:01:40.330> a

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
there and it also helps out with a

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.880 
there and it also helps out with a
little<00:01:40.690> bit<00:01:40.810> colder<00:01:41.140> weather<00:01:41.320> in<00:01:41.500> these<00:01:41.650> guys

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
little bit colder weather in these guys

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:42.840 
little bit colder weather in these guys
so<00:01:42.100> it<00:01:42.159> gives<00:01:42.310> us<00:01:42.369> a<00:01:42.460> little<00:01:42.549> bit<00:01:42.670> better

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
so it gives us a little bit better

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.399 
so it gives us a little bit better
r-value<00:01:43.390> having<00:01:43.570> that<00:01:43.690> dead<00:01:43.869> air<00:01:43.990> space<00:01:44.020> in

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
see it from the video but it's actually

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.560
