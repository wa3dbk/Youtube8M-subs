00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.530
 hi everyone knows smiles have 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.180
 especially today for the video 17 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.699
 laps I did against goultard for 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.289
 the test speed of goultarminator a 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:19.710
 room elio a potting servers have been 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.510
 this tower in background pictures I just 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.680
 put the rankings that is not even the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.850
 ranking of the last day it's just 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.970
 for you and something to look at we got 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.369
 offered the guy or anything 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.690
 so here in the video what are we going 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.460
 see it's only the attempt that 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.870
 I succeeded but we must say well 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.309
 that behind there are a lot of 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.559
 attempts I had to make just for 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.090
 find the right placement find how 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.070
 play that terminator taste that united a 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.930
 completely random and unbearable 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.820
 all the trials abandoned just because 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.500
 that the golfer did not do the same thing 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.700
 that fight just before until 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.800
 what is going on perfectly well 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.840
 like that the fingers I hope you 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.250
 will appreciate 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.899
 so he misses the roof but look 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.489
 well placement and pee wee milky 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.280
 look there he was he was important 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.110
 had not many playable I 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.119
 there was perfect 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.729
 so we just put our two portals 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.979
 we typed goultard we ended up next to 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.479
 our portal then we saw the bags 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.360
 vault had passed through the portal 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.580
 and pushed us all to the left 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.290
 the only thing here was it was really the 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.790
 balance and philippe dutruc it was power 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.490
 to grow the farthest the most 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.720
 quickly possible so towers troyes one is 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.280
 all the time of the map at the other end 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.380
 happens to be able to tap through 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.229
 a portal with a huge a huge 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.100
 way of portals anyway and it goes 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.470
 really continue the IUD benefited 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.409
 the most of a huge loop of 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.030
 portals I play have seen but this 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.820
 was not necessarily necessary 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.400
 turn 4 was the turn of rocks the 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.780
 bigger turns of rocks and have seen is 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.930
 nor less is not more forgets 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.390
 30% and turns 4 we were boiling 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.829
 that we lose some rock I had done 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.549
 a nebulous meaning attempt I was scared 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.229
 I left it at 190 points becomes 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.369
 something like that 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.290
 another time he was just missing a shot 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.060
 critical to kill but I was 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.019
 auditions this turn 4 I was putting out 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.939
 parasites to more than 5500 tr standards and 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.560
 so that's all we do is we 

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:15.989
 take one takes advantage of 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.880
 the big loop Porteils we 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.110
 place for them to push us to 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.540
 pass three portals and pushes us 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:26.849
 in the direction we want the most 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:28.050
 far possible in general and that's it 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.569
 what he did there and I just got to 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.269
 replace in general only one portal for 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.970
 can you type is like that in addition 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.019
 we do not move too much the portals have 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.250
 not reduce the distance 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:46.799
 we do not say too much the distance between 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:48.420
 the portals and there were three laps 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:52.130
 it seems to me there really could 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:56.760
 make the most of different trips 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:59.239
 the round two rounds 5th toque set it was 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.880
 tourists can give up 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.590
 it was really excessive, but there I 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.190
 had the judge frankly I was lucky 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:11.489
 on this one, but it's a bit of 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.840
 luck on on all over 50 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:18.540
 attempts I made before that 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:20.880
 past it's really great and suddenly the 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.730
 loses more clini points of life i took 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:27.470
 my time on the train rankings 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.470
 for not deceiving me too much regret 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.540
 Here there was not not too 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.870
 complicated had to find the right 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.870
 technical
