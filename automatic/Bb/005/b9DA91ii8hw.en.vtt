00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
second magnet is very interesting as you

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.080 
second magnet is very interesting as you
know<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.869> magnet<00:01:49.380> they<00:01:49.500> attract<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:50.189> reverse

that<00:01:54.720> attracts<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.259> little<00:01:55.500> bit<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:56.040> we<00:01:56.220> pull

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
that attracts a little bit so we pull

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.010 
that attracts a little bit so we pull
the<00:01:56.520> aluminum<00:01:57.030> out<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.329> waste<00:01:57.540> stream<00:01:57.630> as
