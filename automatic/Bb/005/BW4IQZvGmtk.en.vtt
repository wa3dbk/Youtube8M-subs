00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.370
 via miami dot com 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.970
 I'm here to answer the question of 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:22.470
 You do not answer today's question . 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:26.040
 collection opened and he wanted to know which 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:30.169
 budget hotels that I indicate what I 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:33.300
 i would stay here in miami on miami beach good 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:35.399
 hotels in miami is a somewhat a thing 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.340
 complicated because miami a city with 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.450
 very old hotels 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.100
 so you have to have a little bit of 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.190
 be careful when choosing the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:53.370
 hotels sometimes have musty smell has 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:58.800
 most poorly maintained rooms are some 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.760
 electrical installations are not of the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.300
 best 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.189
 but I can not live here for a long time 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.149
 Since I 've been here almost eight years 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.640
 united states 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:10.770
 I do not go to hotels, it 's the number 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.090
 excels in hotel here in miami but me 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.010
 I have a lot of clients who are 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.409
 always staying and every time a 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.290
 customer staying at the hotel that one did not 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.990
 know what the customer has not had 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.470
 we stayed before I always 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.630
 I ask if a feedback for the person 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.540

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.490
