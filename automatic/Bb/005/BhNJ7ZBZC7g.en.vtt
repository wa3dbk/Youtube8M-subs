them<00:01:32.890> for<00:01:33.070> the<00:01:33.159> time<00:01:33.310> being<00:01:33.610> so<00:01:33.880> they<00:01:34.000> can<00:01:34.119> take

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
them for the time being so they can take

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.870 
them for the time being so they can take
over<00:01:34.810> Central<00:01:35.350> City<00:01:35.560> see<00:01:36.310> it<00:01:36.430> makes<00:01:36.609> sense

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
over Central City see it makes sense

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.490 
over Central City see it makes sense
because<00:01:37.329> the<00:01:37.570> Rogues<00:01:37.810> are<00:01:38.049> probably<00:01:38.350> one<00:01:38.469> of

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
because the Rogues are probably one of

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.410 
because the Rogues are probably one of
the<00:01:38.619> most<00:01:38.799> known<00:01:39.130> things<00:01:39.460> whether<00:01:40.000> wizard

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
the most known things whether wizard

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.849 
the most known things whether wizard
probably<00:01:40.719> just<00:01:40.869> strikes<00:01:41.109> out<00:01:41.289> lightning<00:01:41.530> and

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:41.859 
probably just strikes out lightning and

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:43.889 
probably just strikes out lightning and
stuff<00:01:42.009> and<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.820> first<00:01:43.030> boss<00:01:43.359> battle<00:01:43.390> would<00:01:43.840> be

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
stuff and the first boss battle would be

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:45.690

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
combat and making things better you know

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.349 
combat and making things better you know
just<00:01:50.799> making<00:01:51.039> making<00:01:51.729> you<00:01:51.850> feel<00:01:52.060> like<00:01:52.240> you

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:52.359 
just making making you feel like you

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:54.899 
just making making you feel like you
know<00:01:52.509> what<00:01:52.630> to<00:01:52.750> do<00:01:52.990> and<00:01:53.619> you<00:01:54.340> know<00:01:54.460> maybe<00:01:54.700> you

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
know what to do and you know maybe you

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.819 
know what to do and you know maybe you
could<00:01:55.030> slow<00:01:55.210> down<00:01:55.479> time<00:01:55.780> for<00:01:56.469> a<00:01:56.500> certain

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
could slow down time for a certain

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:58.380 
could slow down time for a certain
period<00:01:57.039> of<00:01:57.159> time<00:01:57.250> maybe<00:01:57.520> like<00:01:57.700> three<00:01:57.969> seconds

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
period of time maybe like three seconds

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.490 
period of time maybe like three seconds
so<00:01:58.509> you<00:01:58.600> could<00:01:58.750> actually<00:01:58.899> go<00:01:59.109> to<00:01:59.140> a<00:01:59.289> certain

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
so you could actually go to a certain

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.560 
so you could actually go to a certain
point<00:01:59.770> at<00:02:00.399> somewhere<00:02:00.939> else<00:02:01.119> and<00:02:01.210> it<00:02:01.299> has<00:02:01.450> to

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
point at somewhere else and it has to

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.840 
point at somewhere else and it has to
recharge<00:02:01.960> like<00:02:02.259> at<00:02:02.740> least<00:02:02.920> 20<00:02:03.280> seconds<00:02:03.759> and

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
recharge like at least 20 seconds and

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.609 
recharge like at least 20 seconds and
then<00:02:03.909> you<00:02:04.060> get<00:02:04.149> slowed<00:02:04.479> down<00:02:04.630> again<00:02:04.990> it<00:02:05.469> could

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
then you get slowed down again it could

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.139 
then you get slowed down again it could
be<00:02:05.710> a<00:02:05.740> lot<00:02:06.039> like<00:02:06.249> the<00:02:06.399> Arkham<00:02:06.729> Knight<00:02:06.909> or

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
be a lot like the Arkham Knight or

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.690 
be a lot like the Arkham Knight or
Arkham<00:02:07.860> Arkham<00:02:08.860> games<00:02:09.100> you<00:02:09.369> know<00:02:09.460> type<00:02:09.670> of

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
Arkham Arkham games you know type of

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.370 
Arkham Arkham games you know type of
combat<00:02:10.119> because<00:02:10.570> who<00:02:10.720> doesn't<00:02:10.960> love<00:02:11.200> that

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
combat because who doesn't love that

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.470

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
fast so you know it would make sense for

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.550 
fast so you know it would make sense for
you<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.760> punch<00:02:16.360> somebody<00:02:16.569> and<00:02:16.930> then<00:02:17.319> turn

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
hurry up and punch that guy instead of

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.840 
hurry up and punch that guy instead of
Batman<00:02:21.260> you<00:02:21.470> know<00:02:21.590> just<00:02:21.860> kicking<00:02:22.190> one<00:02:22.370> guy<00:02:22.580> and

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.900 
then like teleporting to the other guy
punching<00:02:24.740> him<00:02:24.860> it<00:02:25.190> would<00:02:25.310> make<00:02:25.460> sense<00:02:25.670> for<00:02:25.820> a

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
punching him it would make sense for a

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.090 
punching him it would make sense for a
flash<00:02:26.120> to<00:02:26.300> be<00:02:26.390> that<00:02:26.570> fast<00:02:26.870> and<00:02:27.200> everybody

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
flash to be that fast and everybody

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.840

would<00:02:28.250> love<00:02:28.520> it

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
would love it

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.370 
would love it
the<00:02:29.090> combat<00:02:29.510> were<00:02:29.600> probably<00:02:29.810> even<00:02:30.140> more

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
the combat were probably even more

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.890 
the combat were probably even more

City has crappy combat it doesn't but
the<00:02:38.660> flash<00:02:38.900> would<00:02:39.110> have<00:02:39.290> more<00:02:39.910> sensible<00:02:40.910> type

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300

enjoy now once that happens I believe my

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.630 
enjoy now once that happens I believe my
second<00:02:47.720> part<00:02:47.960> of<00:02:48.110> this<00:02:48.290> should<00:02:48.590> be<00:02:48.770> the<00:02:49.220> Speed

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
second part of this should be the Speed

I believe the Speed Force should be type

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.150 
I believe the Speed Force should be type
of<00:02:52.360> clock<00:02:53.360> tower<00:02:53.690> force<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.650> flash<00:02:54.860> you<00:02:55.070> know
