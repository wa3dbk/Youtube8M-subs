00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
were second best physically you know we

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:19.719 
were second best physically you know we
didn't<00:01:18.139> work<00:01:18.289> hard<00:01:18.530> enough<00:01:18.649> we<00:01:19.490> didn't

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
didn't work hard enough we didn't

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.569 
didn't work hard enough we didn't
compete<00:01:20.060> a<00:01:21.049> home<00:01:21.709> game<00:01:21.950> prior<00:01:22.249> to<00:01:22.429> that

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:22.579 
compete a home game prior to that

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:24.129 
compete a home game prior to that
towards<00:01:22.939> the<00:01:22.969> end<00:01:23.030> of<00:01:23.149> last<00:01:23.209> season<00:01:23.479> I<00:01:23.749> thought

00:01:24.129 --> 00:01:24.139 
towards the end of last season I thought

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:25.859 
towards the end of last season I thought
we<00:01:24.259> played<00:01:24.469> well<00:01:24.740> well<00:01:24.979> right<00:01:25.249> in<00:01:25.399> the<00:01:25.490> game

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
we played well well right in the game

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.239 
we played well well right in the game
and<00:01:26.869> then<00:01:27.109> we've<00:01:27.200> got<00:01:27.229> a<00:01:27.350> contentious<00:01:27.920> penalty

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:28.249 
and then we've got a contentious penalty

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:30.940 
and then we've got a contentious penalty
decision<00:01:28.429> against<00:01:29.060> us<00:01:29.209> on<00:01:30.079> the<00:01:30.289> 82nd<00:01:30.920> minute

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
decision against us on the 82nd minute

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.800 
decision against us on the 82nd minute
and<00:01:31.369> then<00:01:31.639> obviously<00:01:31.759> throwing<00:01:32.149> John<00:01:32.479> up<00:01:32.630> for

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
and then obviously throwing John up for

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.749 
and then obviously throwing John up for
the<00:01:32.869> corner<00:01:33.229> which<00:01:33.409> cost<00:01:33.679> as<00:01:33.829> the<00:01:34.039> second<00:01:34.609> goal

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
the corner which cost as the second goal
