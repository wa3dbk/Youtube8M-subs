are so expensive and hard to find that

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.490 
are so expensive and hard to find that
it<00:01:23.670> would<00:01:23.759> be<00:01:23.939> really<00:01:24.299> costly<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:25.140> complete

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
it would be really costly to complete

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.850 
it would be really costly to complete
this<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.860> got<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.220> one<00:01:26.430> for<00:01:27.000> like<00:01:27.210> $2<00:01:27.860> that's
