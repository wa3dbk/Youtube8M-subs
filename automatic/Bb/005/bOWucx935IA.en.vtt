00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.880
 Hello friends, how I want to show you 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.529
 this screw from the manufacturer firefox is 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.170
 another innovation of the manufacturer 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:12.560
 Americans this the quick stop stove 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:15.590
 It is made of steel has a weight 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.670
 approximately 340 grams if the 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.710
 discs inside 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.880
 inside we're going to find two 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.769
 0 fuel discs 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.390
 totally good american we can 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:27.970
 use this pill not whole or by 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.380
 the unit depends on the use that we go to 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.330
 need 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.040
 we will not find it in him 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.250
 good packaging is a stove like 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.000
 you can see it is already fully assembled 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.129
 We can do it from different 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.449
 configurations but I'm going to increase 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:41.980
 main characteristics since 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.739
 We can use any time of 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.050
 fuel from branch fuel 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:50.050
 pineapples we can use fuel from 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.790
 Gel with alcohol burning tablet 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.100
 solid fuel 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.420
 etc. everything we can find 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.290
 nature can serve us as 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.290
 gas 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.680
 Take this little girl 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.810
 as you can see for totally 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.030
 bored and holes this would be the base 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.830
 from here so that like all fuel 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.860
 you need a component that is oxygen 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.360
 to make it to work then 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.550
 Well, here would be the different 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.870
 good air intakes let's see if what 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.920
 let's use for example with a 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.420
 rock with branches 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.790
 Well, we can perfectly 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.680
 put here we will use our tinder and 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.510
 well we can use it with this 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.230
 open what then if we do not go to 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.750
 use directly here our 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:39.710
 lunch box in our bowl our skillet 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.290
 to heat them directly now by 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.040
 example we are going to use 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.470
 gel fuel 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.060
 for example the can we have we have 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.750
 this base that if it is advisable to put 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:54.200
 down then we will put the can 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.490
 reaper and we'll leave here we can 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.500
 use it perfectly too 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.490
 with our child of alcohol and 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.680
 perfectly we can also 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.480
 perform now 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.010
 if we are going to use a time to do it 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.510
 we can use an integer or cut it 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.020
 in half with the hand is always 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.680
 advisable to use the theme of the base 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.689
 now 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.000
 let's see I'm going to use pills 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:18.700
 of dry fuel if I do not put that go 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.989
 to stay down then the cover as 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.579
 you can see here it takes the four of 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.989
 spots then the cover is there 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:25.840
 let her rest on the four 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.609
 do not manches, so here we would take 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.829
 and we will put our pill 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:31.989
 dry fuel if we're going to use the 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:34.450
 gel fuel directly here 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.069
 then we will throw it here directly 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.069
 Fuel configurations are 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.709
 very wide now as we discussed we can 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.269
 use with this fever gives since these 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.040
 several for one or two 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.439
 people from a big family so that 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.409
 you see it as it supports perfectly now 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:52.419
 but we are going to use it because 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:55.420
 we are a person and because of the weight issue 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:58.690
 well, the theme of pop 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.730
 we close the lid and well I left the 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.520
 top cover but good in this case the 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.870
 we will remove to use flame as 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.190
 fuel of any other kind of 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.250
 things that we would put in the part 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.410
 lower as you can see us 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.360
 closing this that also serves to 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.830
 remove the cover 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.570
 for example we will use here the 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.500
 alcohol stove we would have the 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.940
 cover as it is altered by holes 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.860
 that we do not use anything that we from 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.860
 meat we can use directly 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.510
 this as a mobile or as ironing is 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.460
 tiny but not for a person we 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.320
 it's perfectly ok I hope this 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.620
 information that is already serves Help A 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.620
 greeting
