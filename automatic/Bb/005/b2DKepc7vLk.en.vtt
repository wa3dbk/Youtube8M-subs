00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.580
 offers you our latest DIY 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.969
 around the theme of Christmas we made 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.769
 a pop up card with a 6 year old 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.790
 and tonic 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.859
 here is the list of necessary materials 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.570
 you just have to be there once 4 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.189
 of color a white A4 sheet of 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.720

 stickers and glitter to decorate 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.789
 lagoon started by recalling the whole 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.740
 of two leaves 1,2 like these 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.780
 then remove the blank sheet and 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:40.079
 ask the child to draw in 2000 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:44.030
 fir tree like this afterwards you 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:47.640
 can draw horizontal lines 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.030
 on the surface of the drawing of the fir tree as 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.030
 this 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.520
 ask the child to cut the 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.690

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.690
 outline of the fir tree 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.760
 then and the child to replicate the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.930
 edges of the cut fir tree like these 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.930
 towards the inside 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.939
 when all bands are folded 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.570
 fold the sheet in the other direction 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:44.380
 to form a fir tree in 3d do you 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:48.869
 a payback card like this after 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.869

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.960

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.690

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.000

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.440
