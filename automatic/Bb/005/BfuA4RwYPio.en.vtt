00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
a couple of things you'll need you'll

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.090 
a couple of things you'll need you'll
need<00:00:20.430> an<00:00:20.520> add<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.699> circuit<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.330> power<00:00:21.510> supply

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
need an add a circuit and a power supply

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.529 
need an add a circuit and a power supply
let's<00:00:23.100> add<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.279> circuit<00:00:23.699> down<00:00:23.820> here<00:00:24.180> let's<00:00:24.449> see

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
let's add a circuit down here let's see

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.170 
let's add a circuit down here let's see
some<00:00:24.689> get<00:00:24.840> this<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.140> focus<00:00:25.350> better<00:00:25.619> for<00:00:25.920> you

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
some get this to focus better for you

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.339 
some get this to focus better for you
this<00:00:27.180> add<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.420> circuit<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.900> pull<00:00:28.109> out<00:00:28.140> the

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
this add a circuit you pull out the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.490 
this add a circuit you pull out the
original<00:00:28.590> fuse<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.910> get<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.179> add

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
original fuse and you get to add

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.139 
original fuse and you get to add
additional<00:00:31.500> fuse<00:00:32.160> with<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.369> power<00:00:32.579> line<00:00:32.820> coming

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
additional fuse with a power line coming

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.459 
additional fuse with a power line coming
off<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.270> there<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:33.570> it's<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.840> good<00:00:33.989> way<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.200> get

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
off of there so it's a good way to get

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.780 
off of there so it's a good way to get
yourself<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:35.010> power<00:00:35.219> tap<00:00:35.719> and<00:00:36.719> then<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:37.050> wire

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
yourself a power tap and then this wire

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.319 
yourself a power tap and then this wire
runs<00:00:38.790> up<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:40.350> switch<00:00:40.590> up<00:00:40.829> here<00:00:41.329> mainly

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
runs up to the switch up here mainly

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.389 
runs up to the switch up here mainly
wanted<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.780> add<00:00:42.899> this<00:00:43.110> switch<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.160> was

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
wanted to add this switch so that I was

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.240 
wanted to add this switch so that I was
able<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.840> keep<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.989> GPS<00:00:46.140> on<00:00:46.620> when<00:00:47.129> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
able to keep the GPS on when the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.010 
able to keep the GPS on when the
snowmobile<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.879> off<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.420> when<00:00:48.539> we<00:00:48.600> stopped<00:00:48.809> on

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
snowmobile is off so when we stopped on

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.290 
snowmobile is off so when we stopped on
the<00:00:49.110> trail<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.590> don't<00:00:50.129> have<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.340> reset<00:00:50.730> my<00:00:50.850> GPS

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
the trail I don't have to reset my GPS

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.450 
the trail I don't have to reset my GPS
every<00:00:51.690> single<00:00:52.020> time<00:00:52.230> it's<00:00:53.070> got<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.219> little

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
every single time it's got a little

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.939 
every single time it's got a little
light<00:00:53.610> on<00:00:53.640> there<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.719> you'll<00:00:54.870> be<00:00:54.960> able<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.350> see

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
light on there so you'll be able to see

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.860 
light on there so you'll be able to see
and<00:00:56.250> remember<00:00:56.489> if<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.210> have<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.480> on<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:57.840> you

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
and remember if you have it on so you

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.869 
and remember if you have it on so you
can<00:00:58.020> shut<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.199> off<00:00:58.410> each<00:00:58.649> night<00:00:58.920> or<00:00:59.430> when<00:00:59.820> you

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
can shut it off each night or when you

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.810 
can shut it off each night or when you
go<00:01:00.000> into<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.270> bar<00:01:00.920> this<00:01:01.920> power<00:01:02.219> supply<00:01:02.399> again

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
go into the bar this power supply again

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.969 
go into the bar this power supply again
here<00:01:03.090> just<00:01:03.780> gives<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.170> hot<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.739> ground

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
here just gives you a hot in the ground

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.960 
here just gives you a hot in the ground
and<00:01:05.220> then<00:01:05.489> gives<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.869> USB<00:01:07.799> port<00:01:08.189> or<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> micro

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
and then gives you a USB port or a micro

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.000 
and then gives you a USB port or a micro
USB<00:01:09.180> port<00:01:09.810> up<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:11.280> GPS<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.360> all<00:01:12.540> ran

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
USB port up to the GPS this is all ran

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.499 
USB port up to the GPS this is all ran
through<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.130> chassis<00:01:14.400> does<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.760> switch<00:01:15.090> and

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
through the chassis does a switch and

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.230 
through the chassis does a switch and
then<00:01:16.049> again<00:01:16.259> we<00:01:16.409> ran<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.770> up<00:01:16.950> through<00:01:17.250> this

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
then again we ran it up through this

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.350 
then again we ran it up through this
steering<00:01:18.930> column<00:01:19.320> area<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:20.060> into<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.180> case

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
steering column area and into the case

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.679 
steering column area and into the case
now<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.750> particular<00:01:22.340> case<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.700> was<00:01:24.420> able<00:01:24.659> to

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
now this particular case I was able to

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.780 
now this particular case I was able to
purchase<00:01:25.140> online<00:01:25.439> at<00:01:25.920> Amazon<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.400> believe<00:01:26.670> is

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
purchase online at Amazon I believe is

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.140 
purchase online at Amazon I believe is
ten<00:01:27.000> dollars<00:01:27.619> there's<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.680> spot<00:01:29.009> on<00:01:29.220> here<00:01:29.520> where

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
ten dollars there's a spot on here where

ten dollars there's a spot on here where
the<00:01:30.329> actual<00:01:30.479> cord<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:31.049> supposed<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.409> go

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
the actual cord is supposed to go

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.100 
the actual cord is supposed to go
through<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:32.490> did<00:01:32.759> not<00:01:32.909> work<00:01:33.150> very<00:01:33.180> well<00:01:33.479> let

me show you why this particular cord
comes<00:01:39.450> out<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.750> here<00:01:39.869> at<00:01:39.960> an<00:01:40.079> angle<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:41.130> what<00:01:41.250> I

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
comes out of here at an angle so what I

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.050 
comes out of here at an angle so what I
chose<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.880> do<00:01:42.110> was<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.380> modify<00:01:44.040> this<00:01:44.460> guy<00:01:44.640> see

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
chose to do was to modify this guy see

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.690 
chose to do was to modify this guy see
sorry<00:01:45.329> about<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.590> was<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.829> modify<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.549> guy

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700
