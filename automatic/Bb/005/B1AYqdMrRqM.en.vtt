00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
old captain crunch trick in the phone so

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.790 
old captain crunch trick in the phone so
we<00:00:09.269> could<00:00:09.450> actually<00:00:09.480> connect<00:00:10.050> trunk<00:00:10.559> lines

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
we could actually connect trunk lines

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.220 
we could actually connect trunk lines
back<00:00:11.070> in<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.309> day<00:00:11.460> uh<00:00:12.179> you<00:00:12.540> know<00:00:12.719> it<00:00:13.049> was<00:00:13.200> a

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.659 
favorite presentations do is it's you
know<00:00:31.109> whatever<00:00:31.320> year<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.430> case

2013 how am I still breaking into your
network<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.820> be<00:00:36.300> honest<00:00:36.570> with<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:36.899> you

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
network and to be honest with you you

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.600 
network and to be honest with you you
know<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.739> some<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.010> biggest<00:00:38.190> vectors

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
know that some of the biggest vectors

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.209 
know that some of the biggest vectors
out<00:00:38.760> there<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.149> see<00:00:39.559> have<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.770> deal<00:00:40.950> with

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
out there that I see have to deal with

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.400 
out there that I see have to deal with
stuff<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.489> it's<00:00:42.059> very<00:00:42.329> difficult<00:00:42.750> for<00:00:43.140> us<00:00:43.320> to

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
stuff that it's very difficult for us to

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.600 
stuff that it's very difficult for us to
control<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.860> mean<00:00:44.100> we<00:00:44.219> can<00:00:44.370> be<00:00:44.489> doing

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
control I mean we can be doing

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.060 
control I mean we can be doing
everything<00:00:45.030> correct<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.050> somebody<00:00:46.770> still

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
everything correct and somebody still

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.000 
everything correct and somebody still
exploit<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.969> program<00:00:48.690> another<00:00:49.469> vector<00:00:49.800> out

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
exploit a program another vector out

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.770 
exploit a program another vector out
there<00:00:50.219> out<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.550> hundreds<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.300> thousands

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
there out of the hundreds of thousands

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.020 
there out of the hundreds of thousands
we<00:00:51.899> have<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.230> defend<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.860> get<00:00:53.730> into<00:00:53.850> our

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
know that folks like us are not going to

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.509 
know that folks like us are not going to
be<00:01:03.660> going<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:04.049> stores<00:01:04.320> as<00:01:04.470> much<00:01:04.680> as<00:01:04.979> it'll<00:01:05.430> be

the walking here especially on Cyber

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.130 
the walking here especially on Cyber
Monday<00:01:10.860> then<00:01:11.850> when<00:01:12.000> Shelby<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.600> get<00:01:12.689> paid<00:01:12.869> for

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
we're talking about me and it's good

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.960 
we're talking about me and it's good
stuff<00:01:14.939> but<00:01:15.780> here's<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.049> trick<00:01:16.290> okay<00:01:16.759> be<00:01:17.759> aware

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
stuff but here's a trick okay be aware

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.550 
stuff but here's a trick okay be aware
of<00:01:18.030> some<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.390> job<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.780> security<00:01:19.170> holes<00:01:19.320> out

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
of some of the job of security holes out

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.950 
of some of the job of security holes out
there<00:01:19.710> right<00:01:19.890> now<00:01:20.119> once<00:01:21.119> again<00:01:21.240> it's<00:01:21.720> one<00:01:21.869> of

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
there right now once again it's one of

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.230 
there right now once again it's one of
the<00:01:22.020> top<00:01:22.229> hacks<00:01:22.530> out<00:01:23.430> there<00:01:23.759> seems<00:01:24.030> like<00:01:24.119> it

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
the top hacks out there seems like it

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.350 
the top hacks out there seems like it
makes<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.479> every<00:01:24.689> year<00:01:25.880> it's<00:01:26.880> tough<00:01:27.119> because

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
makes it every year it's tough because

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.560 
makes it every year it's tough because
the<00:01:27.930> folks<00:01:28.500> at<00:01:28.799> i<00:01:29.520> want<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.759> say<00:01:29.880> son<00:01:30.150> because<00:01:30.479> i

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
the folks at i want to say son because i

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.899 
the folks at i want to say son because i
just<00:01:31.530> remember<00:01:31.770> from<00:01:31.890> back<00:01:32.009> then<00:01:32.189> but<00:01:32.340> or<00:01:32.520> go

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
just remember from back then but or go

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.340 
just remember from back then but or go
they<00:01:33.030> do<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.180> good<00:01:33.420> job<00:01:33.479> at<00:01:33.930> keeping<00:01:33.960> it

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
they do a good job at keeping it

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.890 
they do a good job at keeping it
up-to-date<00:01:34.729> but<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.820> problem<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.390> like

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
up-to-date but the problem is that like

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.120 
up-to-date but the problem is that like
when<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.170> upload<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.500> says<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:37.890> runs<00:01:37.979> on

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
when you upload it says it runs on

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.010 
when you upload it says it runs on
billions<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.729> devices<00:01:38.820> i<00:01:39.299> think<00:01:39.479> 3<00:01:39.689> billions

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
billions of devices i think 3 billions

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.780 
billions of devices i think 3 billions
with<00:01:40.140> their<00:01:40.259> ad<00:01:40.350> says<00:01:40.650> that's<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.670> lot<00:01:41.759> of

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
with their ad says that's a lot of

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.819 
with their ad says that's a lot of
