00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 hello how are you come to your best channel 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.319
 of technology friendship and friends my name 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.569
 it's Mario life and we're going to see a 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.280
 application that is called program this 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.559
 application is linked 100% with 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.690
 instagram and only what it does is take out 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.820
 apps for you to try and see 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.710
 if they work mandalas directly with 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.270
 what is your application but this 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.520
 application I like because it's the new 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.810
 fashion now the photographs nothing more 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.550
 comes with a filter but also 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.500
 you have to add a text to explain 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.580
 what do you mean by that photograph 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.160
 then I think it 's a very good 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.109
 option and the version is free can 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.739
 download and use 8 fonts or 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.420
 go down by break what are most of 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.670
 they are like 15 or 20 other letters 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.200
 then it really is already a decision of 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.850
 each user but you can load the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.770
 free and link directly we're going to 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.720
 enter the application 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.310
 the application as such shows you that you 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.740
 you take a picture at the moment and you go 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.810
 creating what your photos are with a 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.840
 text you can take a picture that already 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.180

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.590
