00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
about a year now and it's become my

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.380 
about a year now and it's become my
number<00:00:16.529> one<00:00:16.710> pick<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:17.250> really<00:00:17.789> like<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.150> for<00:00:18.300> a

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
number one pick I really like it for a

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.599 
number one pick I really like it for a
few<00:00:18.570> reasons

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:19.609 
few reasons

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.950 
few reasons
the<00:00:20.609> pick<00:00:20.820> is<00:00:21.060> called<00:00:21.769> hell<00:00:22.769> super<00:00:23.429> black<00:00:23.960> it's

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
the pick is called hell super black it's

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.839 
the pick is called hell super black it's
made<00:00:25.259> by<00:00:25.439> hell<00:00:25.619> guitars<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.429> can<00:00:26.460> check<00:00:26.730> them

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
made by hell guitars you can check them

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.189 
made by hell guitars you can check them
out<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.150> hell<00:00:27.329> guitars<00:00:27.659> comp<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:29.839> the<00:00:30.839> reason

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
out the hell guitars comp and the reason

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.430 
out the hell guitars comp and the reason
I<00:00:31.319> like<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:31.859> much<00:00:31.919> is<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.480> it<00:00:33.480> has<00:00:34.140> a

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
I like it so much is that it has a

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.130 
I like it so much is that it has a
really<00:00:34.829> nice<00:00:35.039> tone<00:00:35.600> now<00:00:36.600> some<00:00:36.870> people<00:00:36.960> don't

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
really nice tone now some people don't

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.750 
really nice tone now some people don't
think<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.559> picks<00:00:37.949> sound<00:00:38.219> different<00:00:38.609> but<00:00:38.640> I

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
think that picks sound different but I

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.470 
think that picks sound different but I
really<00:00:39.239> do<00:00:39.890> some<00:00:40.890> picks<00:00:41.160> have<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.670> sharp<00:00:42.210> edge

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
really do some picks have a sharp edge

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.189 
really do some picks have a sharp edge
II<00:00:42.840> tone<00:00:43.140> some<00:00:43.800> picks<00:00:44.190> have<00:00:44.609> round<00:00:45.030> tone<00:00:45.660> and

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
II tone some picks have round tone and

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.650 
II tone some picks have round tone and
this<00:00:46.949> one<00:00:47.129> has<00:00:47.339> a<00:00:47.550> rounder<00:00:47.969> tone<00:00:48.179> which<00:00:48.449> I

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
this one has a rounder tone which I

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.799 
this one has a rounder tone which I
really<00:00:48.989> like<00:00:49.190> the<00:00:50.190> material<00:00:50.339> is<00:00:51.030> some<00:00:51.449> sort<00:00:51.750> of

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
really like the material is some sort of

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.000 
really like the material is some sort of
synthetic<00:00:52.670> smooth<00:00:53.670> material<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.989> when<00:00:55.890> you

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
synthetic smooth material and when you

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.549 
synthetic smooth material and when you
pick<00:00:56.219> up<00:00:56.249> the<00:00:56.820> pick<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.239> can<00:00:57.420> feel<00:00:57.719> how<00:00:58.019> smooth

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
pick up the pick you can feel how smooth

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.160 
pick up the pick you can feel how smooth
it<00:00:58.769> it<00:00:59.129> feels<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.789> touch<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.710> then<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.829> has

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
it it feels to touch and then it has

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.410 
it it feels to touch and then it has
sort<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.430> grooves<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:05.940> it's<00:01:06.090> easier<00:01:06.390> to

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
sort of grooves in it so it's easier to

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.290 
sort of grooves in it so it's easier to
grip<00:01:06.690> and<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.290> bit<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.710> indentation<00:01:08.130> as<00:01:08.580> well<00:01:08.790> so

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
grip and a bit of indentation as well so

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.040 
grip and a bit of indentation as well so
it's<00:01:09.420> really<00:01:09.780> easy<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.110> hold<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:11.690> it<00:01:12.690> comes<00:01:12.930> in

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
it's really easy to hold and it comes in

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.090 
it's really easy to hold and it comes in
different<00:01:13.140> thicknesses

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
different thicknesses

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.780 
different thicknesses
I<00:01:14.250> like<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:15.260> medium<00:01:16.260> and<00:01:16.650> sometimes<00:01:17.550> I<00:01:17.640> used

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
I like the medium and sometimes I used

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.030 
I like the medium and sometimes I used
to<00:01:17.880> thinner<00:01:18.090> one<00:01:18.350> this<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.650> thinner<00:01:19.830> one

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
to thinner one this is the thinner one

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.720 
to thinner one this is the thinner one
actually<00:01:20.370> so<00:01:21.210> let<00:01:21.480> me<00:01:21.630> demonstrate<00:01:22.310> I'll<00:01:23.310> play

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.730 
actually so let me demonstrate I'll play

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.340 
actually so let me demonstrate I'll play
with<00:01:23.970> one<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.300> these<00:01:24.390> pigs<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.280> fender<00:01:26.280> medium

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
with one of these pigs a fender medium

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.470 
with one of these pigs a fender medium
first<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.740> I'm<00:01:28.830> using<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.340> sir<00:01:29.870> badger<00:01:30.870> 18<00:01:31.740> and

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
first and I'm using a sir badger 18 and

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.810 
first and I'm using a sir badger 18 and
I'm<00:01:33.480> using<00:01:33.660> a<00:01:33.900> Fender<00:01:34.860> American<00:01:35.280> strat<00:01:35.550> and

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
I'm using a Fender American strat and

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.630 
I'm using a Fender American strat and
I'm<00:01:36.060> also<00:01:36.210> using<00:01:36.690> a<00:01:37.110> tube<00:01:37.650> screamer<00:01:38.040> in

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
I'm also using a tube screamer in

00:01:38.640 --> 00:02:14.699 
I'm also using a tube screamer in
between<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.810> here<00:01:40.050> is<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.410> fender<00:01:40.770> pick

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:46.520 

and<00:02:16.000> here<00:02:17.000> is<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.480> super<00:02:17.989> black

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.590 

there's<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.710> fender<00:02:48.040> pick<00:02:48.310> again<00:02:48.640> so<00:02:49.270> listen

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
there's a fender pick again so listen

00:02:49.600 --> 00:03:15.990 
there's a fender pick again so listen
for<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.990> attack<00:02:59.850> the<00:03:00.850> super<00:03:01.180> black<00:03:14.880> it's<00:03:15.880> a

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
for the attack the super black it's a

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.460 
for the attack the super black it's a
subtle<00:03:16.209> difference<00:03:16.390> maybe<00:03:17.050> and<00:03:17.260> when<00:03:17.350> you

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
subtle difference maybe and when you

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.350 
subtle difference maybe and when you
listen<00:03:18.100> to<00:03:18.130> it<00:03:18.280> in<00:03:18.550> a<00:03:18.670> recording<00:03:19.150> when<00:03:19.270> when

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
listen to it in a recording when when

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.900 
listen to it in a recording when when
you're<00:03:19.480> playing<00:03:19.750> with<00:03:20.080> it<00:03:20.260> it's<00:03:21.040> obvious<00:03:21.730> to

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
you're playing with it it's obvious to

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.080 
you're playing with it it's obvious to
me<00:03:22.050> so<00:03:23.050> a<00:03:23.080> bit<00:03:23.410> of<00:03:23.440> a<00:03:23.560> rounder<00:03:24.100> tone<00:03:24.370> with<00:03:25.000> the

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
me so a bit of a rounder tone with the

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.630 
me so a bit of a rounder tone with the
super<00:03:25.420> black<00:03:25.600> so<00:03:25.990> and<00:03:26.200> it's<00:03:26.680> it<00:03:27.160> feels<00:03:27.459> much

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
super black so and it's it feels much

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.680 
super black so and it's it feels much
better<00:03:27.940> to<00:03:28.120> hold<00:03:29.040> so<00:03:30.120> for<00:03:31.120> me<00:03:31.209> it<00:03:31.300> makes<00:03:31.450> a<00:03:31.540> big

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
better to hold so for me it makes a big

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.140 
better to hold so for me it makes a big
difference<00:03:31.990> in<00:03:32.080> my<00:03:32.110> playing<00:03:32.500> I<00:03:32.800> can<00:03:33.760> hear

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
difference in my playing I can hear

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.690 
difference in my playing I can hear
through<00:03:34.630> the<00:03:34.810> amp<00:03:34.959> that<00:03:35.290> I<00:03:35.350> get<00:03:35.590> a<00:03:35.700> smoother

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
through the amp that I get a smoother

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.030 
through the amp that I get a smoother
attack<00:03:37.030> on<00:03:37.239> the<00:03:37.330> tone<00:03:37.570> it<00:03:37.840> it<00:03:38.230> makes<00:03:38.560> it<00:03:38.739> more

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
attack on the tone it it makes it more

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.490 
attack on the tone it it makes it more
