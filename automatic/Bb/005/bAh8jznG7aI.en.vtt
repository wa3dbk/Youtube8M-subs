the camera I've got that 10 to 17
fisheye<00:00:37.180> zoom<00:00:37.570> which<00:00:37.780> is<00:00:37.899> a<00:00:37.930> great<00:00:38.170> lens<00:00:38.320> for

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
fisheye zoom which is a great lens for

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.599 
fisheye zoom which is a great lens for
shooting<00:00:38.739> skateboarding<00:00:39.250> and<00:00:39.399> the<00:00:39.460> great

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:39.609 
shooting skateboarding and the great

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:42.509 
shooting skateboarding and the great
lens<00:00:39.789> for<00:00:39.969> a<00:00:40.120> video<00:00:40.780> handheld<00:00:41.489> basically<00:00:42.489> a

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:42.519 
lens for a video handheld basically a

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:45.270 
lens for a video handheld basically a
what<00:00:42.730> I'm<00:00:42.820> doing<00:00:43.120> is<00:00:43.680> set<00:00:44.680> my<00:00:44.769> white<00:00:44.920> balance

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
what I'm doing is set my white balance

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.150 
what I'm doing is set my white balance
to<00:00:45.429> daylight<00:00:45.789> and<00:00:46.149> I<00:00:46.809> set<00:00:47.019> my<00:00:47.170> color<00:00:47.649> profile

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
to daylight and I set my color profile

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.619 
to daylight and I set my color profile
to<00:00:48.489> natural<00:00:48.910> so<00:00:49.090> it<00:00:49.179> wouldn't<00:00:49.359> be<00:00:49.449> too

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
to natural so it wouldn't be too

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:51.209 
to natural so it wouldn't be too
saturated<00:00:49.840> so<00:00:50.559> I<00:00:50.590> can<00:00:50.739> work<00:00:50.890> with<00:00:51.039> it<00:00:51.129> a<00:00:51.160> little

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
saturated so I can work with it a little

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.069 
saturated so I can work with it a little
bit<00:00:51.340> in<00:00:51.519> post<00:00:51.760> I<00:00:52.089> give<00:00:52.510> it<00:00:52.600> a<00:00:52.660> color<00:00:52.809> correction

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
bit in post I give it a color correction

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:54.689 
bit in post I give it a color correction
that<00:00:53.230> I<00:00:53.350> want<00:00:53.559> make<00:00:53.800> those<00:00:53.949> decisions<00:00:54.489> later

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
that I want make those decisions later

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.540 
that I want make those decisions later
I'm<00:00:55.149> using<00:00:55.449> that<00:00:55.780> auto<00:00:56.379> exposure<00:00:56.739> lock<00:00:56.890> button

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
I'm using that auto exposure lock button

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.500 
I'm using that auto exposure lock button
to<00:00:58.059> lock<00:00:58.329> my<00:00:58.600> f-stop<00:00:59.109> at<00:00:59.800> 4<00:01:00.280> and<00:01:00.609> then<00:01:01.210> just

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
to lock my f-stop at 4 and then just

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.540 
to lock my f-stop at 4 and then just
dialing<00:01:01.870> in<00:01:02.050> just<00:01:02.289> tweaking<00:01:02.589> it<00:01:02.769> by<00:01:02.949> using<00:01:03.370> the

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
dialing in just tweaking it by using the

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.730 
dialing in just tweaking it by using the
exposure<00:01:03.850> compensation<00:01:04.059> here<00:01:04.780> just<00:01:05.379> drop<00:01:05.590> it

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
exposure compensation here just drop it

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.930 
exposure compensation here just drop it
like<00:01:06.040> a<00:01:06.100> little<00:01:06.400> bit<00:01:06.490> a<00:01:06.520> little<00:01:06.670> bit<00:01:06.820> of

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
like a little bit a little bit of

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.460 
like a little bit a little bit of
negative<00:01:07.060> gain<00:01:07.420> there<00:01:07.659> once<00:01:08.110> that's<00:01:08.320> all

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
negative gain there once that's all

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.630 
negative gain there once that's all
locked<00:01:08.710> in<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.070> light<00:01:09.220> stay<00:01:09.400> nice<00:01:09.610> and

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
locked in the light stay nice and

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.120 
locked in the light stay nice and
consistent<00:01:10.060> I'm<00:01:10.810> really<00:01:11.050> trying<00:01:11.290> to<00:01:11.350> get<00:01:11.500> like

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
consistent I'm really trying to get like

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.100 
consistent I'm really trying to get like
cool<00:01:12.370> things<00:01:12.700> in<00:01:12.820> the<00:01:12.910> foreground<00:01:13.240> keep<00:01:13.960> the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
cool things in the foreground keep the

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.170 
cool things in the foreground keep the
camera<00:01:14.470> moving<00:01:14.740> and<00:01:15.400> just<00:01:15.550> really<00:01:15.820> capture

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
camera moving and just really capture

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.430 
camera moving and just really capture
the<00:01:16.210> energy<00:01:16.600> of<00:01:16.690> the<00:01:16.780> skateboarders<00:01:17.260> in<00:01:17.410> the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
the energy of the skateboarders in the

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:25.800 
the energy of the skateboarders in the
park<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.670> when<00:01:25.210> we<00:01:25.330> were<00:01:25.420> working<00:01:25.450> with<00:01:25.690> the

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
park so when we were working with the

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.120 
park so when we were working with the
wide<00:01:25.960> lens<00:01:26.200> it<00:01:26.410> was<00:01:26.500> very<00:01:26.650> easy<00:01:26.860> to<00:01:27.010> keep

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
wide lens it was very easy to keep

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.730 
wide lens it was very easy to keep
things<00:01:27.370> in<00:01:27.520> focus<00:01:27.550> because<00:01:28.440> just<00:01:29.440> the<00:01:29.530> nature

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
things in focus because just the nature

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.320 
things in focus because just the nature
of<00:01:29.860> the<00:01:29.980> lens<00:01:30.220> and<00:01:30.520> it's<00:01:30.790> a<00:01:30.880> great<00:01:31.030> lens<00:01:31.240> for

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
of the lens and it's a great lens for

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.150 
of the lens and it's a great lens for
the<00:01:31.450> action<00:01:31.780> that<00:01:31.870> way<00:01:32.020> but<00:01:32.710> you<00:01:32.800> know<00:01:32.920> also

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
the action that way but you know also

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.680 
the action that way but you know also
it's<00:01:33.430> fun<00:01:33.610> to<00:01:33.670> use<00:01:33.820> the<00:01:34.000> depth<00:01:34.180> of<00:01:34.300> field<00:01:34.510> of

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
it's fun to use the depth of field of

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.780 
it's fun to use the depth of field of
these<00:01:35.110> cameras<00:01:35.560> so<00:01:36.100> right<00:01:36.250> now<00:01:36.340> I'm<00:01:36.460> using<00:01:36.580> a

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
these cameras so right now I'm using a

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.910 
these cameras so right now I'm using a
200<00:01:37.150> millimeter<00:01:37.480> lens<00:01:37.540> and<00:01:38.380> what<00:01:38.500> I'm<00:01:38.590> doing

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
200 millimeter lens and what I'm doing

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.090 
200 millimeter lens and what I'm doing
is<00:01:39.040> I'm<00:01:39.220> pre<00:01:39.760> setting<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.300> focus<00:01:40.750> on<00:01:41.590> a<00:01:41.650> point

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
is I'm pre setting the focus on a point

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.000 
is I'm pre setting the focus on a point
and<00:01:42.400> letting<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:42.940> action<00:01:43.300> come<00:01:43.600> in<00:01:43.980> into<00:01:44.980> that

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
and letting the action come in into that

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.950 
and letting the action come in into that
point<00:01:45.490> so<00:01:45.790> I<00:01:45.820> have<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.150> skaters<00:01:46.540> kind<00:01:46.900> of

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
point so I have the skaters kind of

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.330 
point so I have the skaters kind of
hitting<00:01:47.170> a<00:01:47.260> very<00:01:47.410> particular<00:01:47.800> part<00:01:48.160> of<00:01:48.250> this

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
hitting a very particular part of this

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.160 
hitting a very particular part of this
rail<00:01:48.550> so<00:01:49.120> they'll<00:01:49.270> come<00:01:49.450> into<00:01:49.750> a<00:01:49.810> very<00:01:49.990> narrow

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
rail so they'll come into a very narrow

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.260 
rail so they'll come into a very narrow
depth<00:01:50.530> of<00:01:50.680> field<00:01:50.920> and<00:01:51.460> so<00:01:51.550> we're<00:01:51.670> using<00:01:51.700> focus

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
depth of field and so we're using focus

00:01:52.270 --> 00:02:10.449 
depth of field and so we're using focus
in<00:01:52.420> that<00:01:52.450> way<00:01:52.750> and<00:01:53.470> it's<00:01:53.680> a

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.589 

one<00:02:11.459> of<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.640> great<00:02:11.849> things<00:02:12.090> about<00:02:12.209> shooting

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
one of the great things about shooting

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.020 
one of the great things about shooting
with<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.900> DSLR<00:02:13.290> is<00:02:13.739> how<00:02:14.190> easy<00:02:14.489> it<00:02:14.700> is<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.910> get

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
with a DSLR is how easy it is to get

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.300 
with a DSLR is how easy it is to get
some<00:02:15.209> camera<00:02:15.540> movement<00:02:15.959> right<00:02:16.950> here<00:02:16.980> we<00:02:17.220> have

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
some camera movement right here we have

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.820 
some camera movement right here we have
a<00:02:17.340> camera<00:02:17.640> slider<00:02:18.000> it's<00:02:18.390> in<00:02:18.780> my<00:02:18.989> kit<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.500> take<00:02:19.709> it
