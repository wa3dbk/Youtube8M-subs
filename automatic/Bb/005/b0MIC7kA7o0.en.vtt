00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
as soon as I have time to a you know

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.109 
as soon as I have time to a you know
record<00:01:10.229> audio<00:01:10.350> for<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:10.860> all<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.100> but<00:01:11.670> anyway

guys<00:01:12.299> as<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.600> can<00:01:12.659> see<00:01:12.799> one<00:01:13.799> thing<00:01:14.010> here<00:01:14.280> is

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
guys as you can see one thing here is

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.679 
guys as you can see one thing here is
more<00:01:14.580> talk<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.000> lot<00:01:15.180> harder<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.509> kill

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
more talk is a lot harder to kill

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.090 
more talk is a lot harder to kill
because<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.170> stomp<00:01:16.470> does<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.710> lot<00:01:16.860> more<00:01:16.920> damage

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
because the stomp does a lot more damage

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.070 
because the stomp does a lot more damage
as<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.490> can<00:01:17.670> see<00:01:17.850> there<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.180> was<00:01:18.540> able<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.780> full

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
as you can see there I was able to full

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.630 
as you can see there I was able to full
full<00:01:19.439> heal<00:01:19.710> with<00:01:19.950> second<00:01:20.340> wind

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
full heal with second wind

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.760 
full heal with second wind
but<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.659> thing<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.960> reason<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.500> stomp

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
but the thing the reason that the stomp

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.469 
but the thing the reason that the stomp
does<00:01:23.009> more<00:01:23.220> damage<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.880> because<00:01:24.240> obviously

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
does more damage is because obviously

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.440 
does more damage is because obviously
it's<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.170> scale<00:01:25.500> for<00:01:25.830> 25<00:01:26.400> players<00:01:26.670> taking<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.299> hit

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
it's a scale for 25 players taking a hit

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.170 
it's a scale for 25 players taking a hit
instead<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.259> 10<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.640> can<00:01:29.880> get<00:01:30.090> away

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
instead of 10 and so you can get away

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.270 
instead of 10 and so you can get away
from<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:30.750> proximity<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:32.009> there<00:01:32.159> are

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
from it in proximity and so there are

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.710 
from it in proximity and so there are
some<00:01:32.490> things<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.880> do<00:01:33.119> make<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.540> little

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
some things that do make this a little

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.899 
some things that do make this a little
bit<00:01:33.930> more<00:01:34.079> difficult<00:01:34.560> but<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.430> terms<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.820> the

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
bit more difficult but in terms of the

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.030 
bit more difficult but in terms of the
damage<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.509> damage<00:01:37.229> like<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.799> actual

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
damage I to damage like that the actual

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.920 
damage I to damage like that the actual
bosses<00:01:38.520> do<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:39.060> probably<00:01:39.180> on<00:01:39.420> par<00:01:39.659> with<00:01:39.689> like

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
bosses do is probably on par with like

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.600 
bosses do is probably on par with like
10<00:01:40.110> man<00:01:40.290> heroic<00:01:40.439> or<00:01:40.860> something<00:01:41.159> like<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.310> and

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
10 man heroic or something like that and

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.480 
10 man heroic or something like that and
so<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.270> was<00:01:42.509> actually<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.649> don't<00:01:44.070> know<00:01:44.280> if

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
so I was actually I I don't know if

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.710 
so I was actually I I don't know if
they'll<00:01:44.640> nerf<00:01:44.820> this<00:01:45.030> or<00:01:45.180> not<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.299> don't<00:01:45.570> really

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
they'll nerf this or not I don't really

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.149 
they'll nerf this or not I don't really
think<00:01:45.780> they<00:01:45.990> will<00:01:46.140> but<00:01:46.290> as<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.500> can<00:01:46.590> see<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.829> was

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
think they will but as you can see I was

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.310 
think they will but as you can see I was
automatically<00:01:47.729> looted<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.360> rawhide<00:01:48.600> bracers

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
automatically looted the rawhide bracers

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.109 
automatically looted the rawhide bracers
it's<00:01:49.560> not<00:01:49.680> like<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.920> old<00:01:50.040> dragon<00:01:50.280> soul<00:01:50.579> where

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
it's not like the old dragon soul where

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.609 
it's not like the old dragon soul where
you<00:01:51.240> actually<00:01:51.390> have<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.720> loot<00:01:51.960> drop<00:01:52.290> which<00:01:52.500> I

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
you actually have a loot drop which I

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.810 
you actually have a loot drop which I
kind<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:52.829> wish<00:01:52.979> they'd<00:01:53.159> just<00:01:53.369> done<00:01:53.579> that

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
kind of wish they'd just done that

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.149 
kind of wish they'd just done that
because<00:01:54.479> like<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:54.810> was<00:01:54.960> gonna<00:01:55.079> die<00:01:55.409> did<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.799> the

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
because like I was gonna die did the the

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.039 
because like I was gonna die did the the
last<00:01:56.399> town<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:56.969> could<00:01:57.149> maybe<00:01:57.270> get<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.540> heroic

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049
