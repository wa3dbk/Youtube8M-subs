00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
wicked ways and go into business with

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.770 
wicked ways and go into business with
the<00:03:06.870> WWE<00:03:07.530> as<00:03:07.969> opposed<00:03:08.969> to<00:03:09.150> being<00:03:09.389> the<00:03:09.540> ultimate

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
the WWE as opposed to being the ultimate

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.020 
the WWE as opposed to being the ultimate
rebel<00:03:10.260> at<00:03:10.530> all<00:03:10.650> times<00:03:10.980> which<00:03:11.219> I<00:03:11.340> took<00:03:11.519> too<00:03:11.730> far

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
rebel at all times which I took too far

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.610 
rebel at all times which I took too far
because<00:03:12.659> of<00:03:12.870> my<00:03:13.109> upbringing

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
because of my upbringing

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.899 
because of my upbringing
um<00:03:15.049> so<00:03:16.049> I<00:03:16.469> think<00:03:17.069> there<00:03:17.430> would<00:03:17.549> have<00:03:17.609> been<00:03:17.669> more

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
um so I think there would have been more

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.920 
um so I think there would have been more
solidarity<00:03:19.909> and<00:03:20.909> it<00:03:21.449> would<00:03:21.690> have<00:03:21.750> increased

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
solidarity and it would have increased

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.099 
solidarity and it would have increased
my<00:03:22.440> income<00:03:22.709> absolutely<00:03:23.669> because<00:03:24.510> they<00:03:24.690> cut<00:03:24.959> me

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
my income absolutely because they cut me

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:26.599 
my income absolutely because they cut me
off<00:03:25.139> when<00:03:25.500> I<00:03:25.560> went<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:25.889> do<00:03:26.040> they<00:03:26.220> live

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
off when I went to do they live

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.479 
off when I went to do they live

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
and Hogan sat down and they did

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:30.530 
and Hogan sat down and they did
no-holds-barred

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
no-holds-barred

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.629 
no-holds-barred
that<00:03:30.870> was<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.199> answer<00:03:31.379> to<00:03:31.590> they<00:03:31.829> live<00:03:32.069> will

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639
