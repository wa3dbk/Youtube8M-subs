00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 we knew the text messages the 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.150
 voice and video calls and well 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.120
 now we will have the olfactory messages 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.910
 the communication by the smell is the 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.480
 concept of the phone water is good we are going 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.480
 discover together 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.900
 we explain a little bit what those 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.100
 on the phone it's a value chain 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.860
 it's a platform it starts 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.750
 first with an application to snap 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.580
 this is the application we find 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.640
 free on the app store 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.600
 the idea is to capture that can be 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.900
 a lot of things it can be from the 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.250
 food that can be it can be 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.070
 holiday it can be 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.309
 it does not matter if we capture a photo 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.820
 and here we will affect odors 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.740
 we have thirty two odors available on 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.380
 will be able to combine these smells we see 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.720
 not but up to 8 combination of two 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.120
 fragrances for to smell 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.190
 for to find the good smell that 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.730
 does not correspond here to our growth 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.009
 once we have captured our at 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.790
 nautile call that another this message 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.410
 auf assets 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:15.190
 we will be able to send it facebook twitter 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:18.580
 sms mails to our correspondent who 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.890
 will receive this set to the notes and who 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.640
 can receive 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:28.060
 besides the message especially the the 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.860
 alert the olfactory message thanks to 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.759
 a broadcaster that's the broadcaster who 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.039
 is going to be sold so 149 dollars on indy 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.319
 gogos who has it so suddenly we go 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:42.160
 restore through cartridges 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:43.360
 will stay eight killed the smell captured by 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.369
 by the user 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.530
 so here we go we'll explain a 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.270
 little bit the principle it works in 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.160
 bluetooth so when the user there 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.069
 is at home he gets his message from 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.950
 the ufac tiff he sends to broadcasters 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:58.539
 the diffuser and on battery for the 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.179
 moment we are still on a state 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.280
 pre - production so it's battery but 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.259
 it may be able to be on 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.819
 mains power 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.580
 it is a diffuser of very smells 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.899
 classic inside we can see if 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.220
 we approach a little bit we can 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:18.340
 see that there are different cartridges 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.290
 to precisely restore these smells there 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.170
 will also have a pack like that that will 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.349
 sold a little later in the year 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.400
 where one can have different here 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.470
 the different cartridges it's 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.140
 present like that it's a little model 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.010
 economic is the nespresso logic or 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.660
 ink cartridge 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.630
 so here is to sell a device but 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.750
 also sell cartridges for 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.209
 restore restore the smells we see 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.130
 well it's still imposing it's still 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.610
 something that aims to stay 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.680
 itself in a shop or at home even 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.560
 and here it is not yet portable we are going 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.660
 to say this is the first step of the project 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.550
 on the phone 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.290
 here we were told the perspectives 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.670
 we could have low 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.680
 direct perspective it's from 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.299
 integration directly on on a 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.680
 phone that means we can 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:10.390
 capture a smell with a picture but 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.730
 also send it directly to a 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.819
 correspondent who will be equipped with this 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.940
 wear there but in very compact version 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.110
 a real reduction in congestion 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.350
 for here to really have a 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.660
 exchange even more direct I the 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.670
 tell it's the first stone it's on 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.549
 a dike or gossas will be sold 149 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.660
 dollars at first it's 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.150
 rather amusing it's rather 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.220
 exciting we can not wait to see the 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.140
 Following this top phone 7 with its brio 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.140
 to sign France thank you and see you soon
