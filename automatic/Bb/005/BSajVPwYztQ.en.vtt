third fret of the sixth string that hit
that<00:00:43.350> as<00:00:43.710> an<00:00:43.829> up<00:00:44.100> because<00:00:44.879> it's<00:00:45.629> on<00:00:45.840> an<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.140> and

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
that as an up because it's on an and and

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.990 
that as an up because it's on an and and
everything<00:00:47.070> that's<00:00:47.280> on<00:00:47.370> hand<00:00:47.640> isn't<00:00:47.820> up

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
everything that's on hand isn't up

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.340 
everything that's on hand isn't up
everything<00:00:48.420> that's<00:00:48.539> on<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.690> beat<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.170> down

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
everything that's on a beat is it down

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.720 
everything that's on a beat is it down
so<00:00:49.710> it's<00:00:49.860> up<00:00:50.039> on<00:00:50.219> G<00:00:50.489> down<00:00:51.270> on<00:00:51.510> b-flat<00:00:52.100> up<00:00:53.100> on<00:00:53.430> B

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
so it's up on G down on b-flat up on B

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.660 
so it's up on G down on b-flat up on B
and<00:00:54.149> then<00:00:54.660> down<00:00:54.899> on<00:00:55.110> C<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.949> see<00:00:56.460> that

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
and then down on C and that see that

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.180 
and then down on C and that see that
little<00:00:56.910> chromatic<00:00:57.059> run<00:00:57.600> G<00:00:58.079> b-flat

this<00:00:59.820> time<00:01:00.000> we<00:01:00.090> approach<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.480> call<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.809> sharp

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
this time we approach to call it a sharp

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.560 
this time we approach to call it a sharp
doesn't<00:01:01.530> really<00:01:01.770> matter<00:01:01.980> in<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.219> case<00:01:02.280> B<00:01:03.210> and

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
doesn't really matter in this case B and

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.480 
doesn't really matter in this case B and
C<00:01:03.920> you<00:01:04.920> can<00:01:05.010> hit<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.220> C<00:01:05.400> three<00:01:05.700> times<00:01:07.100> back<00:01:08.100> to

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
C you can hit the C three times back to

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.450 
C you can hit the C three times back to

the B flat at the first fret and then to
the<00:01:11.549> G<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.260> sequence<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.439> eighth<00:01:13.710> notes<00:01:14.070> G

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
the G that sequence of eighth notes G

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.020 
the G that sequence of eighth notes G
I'm<00:01:15.299> gonna<00:01:15.450> call<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.750> sharp<00:01:16.049> on<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.290> way<00:01:16.409> up

B see see see B flat on the way down and

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.310 
B see see see B flat on the way down and
then<00:01:25.170> G<00:01:25.640> practice<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.939> till<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.930> can<00:01:28.080> play

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
then G practice that till you can play

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.489 
then G practice that till you can play
it<00:01:28.470> pretty<00:01:29.100> steady

00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:31.499 
it pretty steady

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:38.489 
it pretty steady
and<00:01:32.579> repeat<00:01:33.579> it<00:01:36.450> then<00:01:37.450> start<00:01:38.049> working<00:01:38.409> on

00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:38.499 
and repeat it then start working on

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:42.389 
and repeat it then start working on
speeding<00:01:38.950> it<00:01:39.130> up<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.799> try<00:01:41.979> to<00:01:42.039> keep<00:01:42.219> it<00:01:42.340> as

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
speeding it up and try to keep it as

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:43.980 
speeding it up and try to keep it as
clean<00:01:42.609> as<00:01:42.700> you<00:01:42.789> can<00:01:43.000> then<00:01:43.509> you<00:01:43.600> just<00:01:43.780> have<00:01:43.899> to

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
clean as you can then you just have to

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.609 
clean as you can then you just have to
run<00:01:44.140> through<00:01:44.259> that<00:01:44.439> pattern<00:01:44.890> over<00:01:45.520> a<00:01:45.549> C<00:01:45.729> chord

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
run through that pattern over a C chord

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.569 
run through that pattern over a C chord
for<00:01:47.619> four<00:01:47.829> measures<00:01:48.569> make<00:01:49.569> it<00:01:49.689> a<00:01:49.719> c7<00:01:50.459> then<00:01:51.459> do

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
for four measures make it a c7 then do

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.330 
for four measures make it a c7 then do
an<00:01:51.670> f7<00:01:52.090> and<00:01:52.569> the<00:01:53.469> whole<00:01:53.649> melody<00:01:53.979> goes<00:01:54.189> up

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
an f7 and the whole melody goes up

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.029 
an f7 and the whole melody goes up
before<00:01:54.490> so<00:01:55.000> it<00:01:55.840> basically<00:01:56.020> follows<00:01:56.590> a<00:01:56.649> 12<00:01:56.890> bar

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
before so it basically follows a 12 bar

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.980 
before so it basically follows a 12 bar
blues<00:01:57.090> pattern<00:01:58.090> with<00:01:58.240> a<00:01:58.270> slightly<00:01:58.750> different

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
blues pattern with a slightly different

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.949 
blues pattern with a slightly different
twist<00:01:59.229> at<00:01:59.530> the<00:01:59.560> end<00:01:59.649> I<00:02:00.390> am<00:02:01.390> thinking<00:02:01.719> about<00:02:01.780> I

00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:01.959 
twist at the end I am thinking about I

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:03.389 
twist at the end I am thinking about I
probably<00:02:02.380> will<00:02:02.590> putting<00:02:02.979> together<00:02:03.189> a

probably will putting together a

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.399 
probably will putting together a
