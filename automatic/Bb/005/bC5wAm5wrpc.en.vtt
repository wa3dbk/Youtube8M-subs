like the wave to seek sexy results
because<00:04:55.650> I<00:04:55.800> think<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:56.160> wave<00:04:56.310> is<00:04:56.490> binary<00:04:56.700> just

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
because I think the wave is binary just

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.370 
because I think the wave is binary just
you<00:04:57.180> know<00:04:57.300> -<00:04:59.390> this<00:05:00.390> is<00:05:00.570> not<00:05:00.750> the<00:05:00.900> original<00:05:00.990> way

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
you know - this is not the original way

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.540 
you know - this is not the original way
this<00:05:01.530> is<00:05:01.620> the<00:05:01.680> wave<00:05:01.800> sonic<00:05:03.560> pest<00:05:04.560> revolution

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
this is the wave sonic pest revolution

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.600 
this is the wave sonic pest revolution
okay<00:05:05.820> so<00:05:06.510> we're<00:05:06.630> sonic<00:05:06.960> and<00:05:07.230> it<00:05:07.800> has<00:05:08.190> right

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
okay so we're sonic and it has right

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.100 
okay so we're sonic and it has right
here<00:05:08.640> the<00:05:08.910> two<00:05:09.060> buttons<00:05:09.450> like<00:05:09.720> this<00:05:10.230> one<00:05:10.470> is<00:05:10.590> on

you just use this after you go for a

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.630 
you just use this after you go for a
little<00:06:01.720> bit<00:06:01.870> your<00:06:02.800> app<00:06:02.890> out<00:06:03.160> this<00:06:03.460> has

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
little bit your app out this has

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.340 
little bit your app out this has
something<00:06:03.850> aggressive<00:06:04.300> you<00:06:04.390> and<00:06:04.540> stuff<00:06:04.750> then

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.350 
something aggressive you and stuff then

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.520 
something aggressive you and stuff then
you<00:06:05.440> just<00:06:05.680> rinse<00:06:05.980> that<00:06:06.400> and<00:06:07.170> it's<00:06:08.170> pretty

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.530 
you just rinse that and it's pretty

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.310 
you just rinse that and it's pretty
simple<00:06:08.920> and<00:06:09.160> it<00:06:09.640> takes<00:06:10.210> so<00:06:10.660> many<00:06:10.720> will<00:06:11.050> kind<00:06:11.260> of

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
simple and it takes so many will kind of

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.960 
simple and it takes so many will kind of
restate<00:06:11.860> it<00:06:12.550> takes<00:06:12.730> two<00:06:14.550> dozen<00:06:15.550> state<00:06:15.700> funds

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:15.970 
restate it takes two dozen state funds
