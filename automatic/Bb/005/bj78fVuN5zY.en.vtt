00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:09.780
 I'm going to show you how to do a 4d 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.559
 braid is also called boxing bad 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.559
 enough 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:24.890
 first we make a ponytail hair 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.890
 is nice and smooth 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:56.809
 a ponytail 's chest and it 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.970
 result it is useful if it was hair 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.129
 moist is that that braid just like it 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:05.890
 easier 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.890
 I divide the hair into 3 strands 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:15.020
 and then you go pick the outer one that you go 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.680
 split in two and then get the 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.780
 pick the middle part through it 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.540
 fuck your point here is split 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.250
 you get it back together in the middle 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.659
 and then you go the same to the other 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.600
 do side 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:33.729
 so you split the harvest here in two 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.729
 attracts a middle pick through which 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:43.700
 we are going to do the same to the other 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:46.220
 side split they pick you more string 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:51.100
 on the right middle pick them 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.100
 left side 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.240
 And so you get a braid that meets all 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.850
 sides is so square 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.049
 you can see the top and the braid 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.049
 side and bottom 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.900
 we just keep repeating it ourselves 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.900
 until we fully maintain it 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:31.560
 if a little starts on lice 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.560
 wheelchair not my right for weeks 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.460
 various ways appear to be 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.650
 make this braid but I like this 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.650
 by far the easiest way 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:28.140
 you fix it 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.090
 6 a bit different layers in the 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:35.550
 her boerdonk can't go that far 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:39.000
 let it continue and I will decorate it 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.100
 a flower tree in front 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:49.820
 now you have a braid that has a number 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:49.820
 account can run quickly and easily
