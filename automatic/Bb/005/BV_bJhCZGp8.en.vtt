00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 good to all the kids who came to this 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.870
 brand new i am simply sniper 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:11.219
 today we are here on the bios of my new 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:15.170
 computer to make a gpu clock lover 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.789
 in general then guys premise for 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.520
 precisely to make rock lovers of this 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.250
 of a gpu with this guide 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.490
 you need to have the multiplayer unlocked 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.090
 so let's start immediately let's go into the 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.809
 part where there are clocks and voltages 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:37.469
 from the cto but we enter is here we can 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.570
 see that these two items there more clock 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.760
 ring of the edge effect with three 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.160
 more rock packages and there longer north bridge 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.660
 they will be under us we will have to do something 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:52.230
 that is about gpu clock panda has had that 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.600
 it should be up here but in the eye 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.379
 james that would have been hard or the 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.890
 3.5 but we're going to set it to 20 like this 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:05.100
 while the qi more north bridge frequencies 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.960
 we would go to leave on a visa car 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.280
 that it wo n't do us any good for the over 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:15.150
 clock we go out and go on this part 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.299
 here father in the bios figures we enter e 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.799
 we can see these two mdc items one 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:25.200
 is support m of amd there you are supporter 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.090
 this is what this is 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.430
 these two items will have to be 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.130
 disabled because they will be enabled 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.850
 at least the first one after 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:39.119
 disabled these entries we should exit 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.810
 from bios go out without saving yes for me 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.710
 you have to do no because you have to 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.969
 save the changes you have made 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.740
 in the meantime that loads the 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:55.140
 computer I would like to tell you what it is for 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.770
 just remove with the voices 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.450
 those voices need gelli a processor 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.909
 it is always one hundred percent of its own 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.539
 power all the time while if those 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.880
 voices are enabled on the processor 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:11.640
 will come down to 1.4 ghz that to me sincerely 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.910
 I have a lot of hassle with a processor 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.980
 powerful holding to 1.4 so guys us 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.060
 we meet again on the desktop but what guys 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.769
 after the virus 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.459
 let's open these two programs that they are 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:27.810
 gpu z and cp of monitor hardware or a 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:29.549
 kabul and here we can see that the 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.200
 our core speed of our processor 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:37.530
 is 4GB with a x20 multiplayer then 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.329
 guys the lover clock has already been done 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.030
 let's check the temperatures 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:47.459
 of the motherboard required for 35 36 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:50.190
 degrees and let's see the temperature on 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.829
 Our processor is 20 degrees 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.350
 then guys lover what it was 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:57.690
 fact can be this method can 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.630
 be applied both on intel processors 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.700
 that on the amd processor just because 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.639
 the multiplayer unlocked then versions 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.450
 cup inter black edition versions for 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.940
 amd 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.200
 so guys we meet again in a 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.910
 next video has left a nice me 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.720
 I leave a nice little commentary and young city 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.720
 garrison and go
