 I, however, am old too, in my own way 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.620
 so I used all my hopes 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.970
 I had to be able to beat myself on 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.830

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.780
 that not a new well understood that maybe 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.849
 winner then but where they got it 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.410
 said very happy 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.030
 last year between one thing and another not 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.540
 we never managed to win a race 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.470
 marco as always made an engine 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.250
 very reliable that did not give any kind 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.640
 of problem 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:15.860

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.860
 they were perfect 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.150
 a moderate deployment to say the least 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.830
 crowded in the replica category 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.390
 entry level formula of the malossi trophies 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.460
 which has been proving for three seasons 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.110
 a winning recipe to approach i

 the situation in the middle of the group 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.570
 chaotic and everyone is looking for a way to 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.160
 gaining Neapolitan positions does not give up 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.990

 napodano have now made a void 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.100
 despite a constant struggle made of 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.870
 overtaking and counterbalances 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.910
 the two arrive paired with the curves 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.230
 trailing traits in which Nodano slips 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.330
 leaving the victory in the hands of 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.190

 about 5 seconds of the cat fight for 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.350
 third place is rather tight, which it requires 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.180
