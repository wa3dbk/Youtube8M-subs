00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:18.080
Of course the key feature that everybody's
talking about with the Galaxy NX is its connectivity

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.080
options.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.910
It's the world's first interchangeable lens
camera to be 4G LTE enabled, and it's also

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.660
got built-in Wi-Fi and GPS. It runs the Android
Jelly Bean operating system which means that

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.600
you can install a huge amount of different
apps to use directly from the camera, including

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.680
email, social networking and photo editing,
such as Instagram.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.000
We've seen a few cameras equipped with Android
now, but this is the first time a camera with

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.850
a large APS-C sized sensor and interchangeable
lenses has come with the operating system.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:58.170
The Galaxy NX features a 20.3 million-pixel
APS-C sized sensor, which is also joined by

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:06.189
a DRIMe IV image processor, which Samsung
says should deliver speed and accuracy.

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:11.380
Samsung has incorporated the same hybrid autofocusing
system as we've seen previously on other NX

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:18.340
system cameras, while it's also capable of
a maximum shutter speed of an impressive 1/6000

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.899
second.

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:26.259
Probably the biggest thing anybody will notice
about the Galaxy NX is its huge 4.8 inch touchscreen.

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:31.369
This takes up the entire back of the camera,
and as such there are no physical buttons

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.700
on the back, with just a few on top of the
camera.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.369
This screen is very responsive and easy to
use, and while touchscreens aren't to everybody's

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.899
tastes, it doesn't take long before the lack
of physical buttons becomes less of a problem

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:46.360
than you might imagine.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.770
A scrolling dial on top of the camera can
be used to change the shooting mode, while

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.329
you can also use it in conjunction with the
touchscreen to make changes to settings such

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.810
as aperture or shutter speed, depending on
the mode you're in.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.429
Designed for both enthusiast and beginner
photographers, the Galaxy NX has a range of

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:11.790
fun features on board, including Multi Exposure
mode, Animated Photo and Sound &amp; Shot mode.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.230
There's a fair few lenses now available for
the NX range, with many of them featuring

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.040
the innovative iFunction capability, allowing
you to make changes to key settings, such

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.200
as aperture, directly from the lens itself.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.460
We're looking forward to putting the new Galaxy
NX camera through its paces, look out for

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.170
a full review on TechRadar.com soon.
