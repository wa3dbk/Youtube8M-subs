of noise this achievement is obtained

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.060 
of noise this achievement is obtained
with<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.000> two<00:01:18.600> major<00:01:19.430> technical<00:01:21.680> aspect<00:01:22.680> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
with a two major technical aspect the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.620 
with a two major technical aspect the
first<00:01:23.310> one<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:25.350> use<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.560> Griffith<00:01:26.630> base

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
first one is the use of Griffith base

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.850 
first one is the use of Griffith base
each<00:01:28.470> base<00:01:28.860> as<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.220> very<00:01:30.090> high-end<00:01:30.320> grid<00:01:31.320> here

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
each base as a very high-end grid here

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.330 
each base as a very high-end grid here
as<00:01:32.610> we<00:01:32.759> can<00:01:32.909> see<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.299> then<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.770> bottom<00:01:35.159> part

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
as we can see and then the bottom part

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.219 
as we can see and then the bottom part
not<00:01:35.640> only<00:01:35.670> we<00:01:36.060> have<00:01:36.150> agreed<00:01:36.390> in<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.630> front<00:01:36.990> but

not only we have agreed in the front but

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.100 
not only we have agreed in the front but
the<00:01:37.350> grid<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.890> side<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.700> have<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.570> great

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
the grid on the side so you have a great

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.639 
the grid on the side so you have a great
area<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.680> air<00:01:40.920> intake<00:01:41.369> from<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.700> front<00:01:42.649> the
