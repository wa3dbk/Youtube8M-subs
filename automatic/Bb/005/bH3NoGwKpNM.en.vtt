00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
like crazy like I took this off in the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.179 
like crazy like I took this off in the
first<00:01:34.170> day<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.470> wore<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.829> wore<00:01:35.009> for<00:01:35.159> a

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
first day that I wore it I wore for a

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.039 
first day that I wore it I wore for a
couple<00:01:35.400> hours<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.790> then<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.600> just<00:01:36.750> took<00:01:36.869> like<00:01:36.990> a

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
couple hours and then I just took like a

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.859 
couple hours and then I just took like a
regular<00:01:37.850> piece<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.880> paper<00:01:39.000> like<00:01:39.450> toilet<00:01:39.720> paper

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
regular piece of paper like toilet paper

regular piece of paper like toilet paper
or<00:01:40.020> whatever<00:01:40.140> just<00:01:40.680> because<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:41.009> usually<00:01:41.130> just

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
or whatever just because I usually just

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.130 
or whatever just because I usually just
wipe<00:01:41.549> off<00:01:41.759> my<00:01:41.820> lip<00:01:42.150> color<00:01:42.299> before<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.750> wash<00:01:42.960> my

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
face when I did that and then I wash my

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.429

face my less were still stained so

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.069 
face my less were still stained so
unless<00:01:47.070> he's<00:01:47.250> specifically<00:01:47.880> go<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.360> remove<00:01:48.899> it

unless he's specifically go to remove it

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.990 
unless he's specifically go to remove it
your<00:01:49.649> lips<00:01:49.829> will<00:01:50.009> remain<00:01:50.340> stained<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.880> it's

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
and I think that's amazing especially

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.350 
and I think that's amazing especially
for<00:02:01.710> like<00:02:01.829> five<00:02:02.009> or<00:02:02.040> six<00:02:02.340> dollars<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.880> think

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
for like five or six dollars I think

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.499 
for like five or six dollars I think
these<00:02:03.450> are<00:02:03.509> fabulous<00:02:03.899> they're<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.619> twist<00:02:05.130> up

my<00:02:08.429> one<00:02:08.610> small<00:02:09.360> beef<00:02:09.720> with<00:02:09.929> these<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.140> guess<00:02:10.530> is

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
my one small beef with these I guess is

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.370 
my one small beef with these I guess is
the<00:02:11.220> pigmentation<00:02:11.970> varies<00:02:12.720> within<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.170> shade

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
the pigmentation varies within the shade

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.800 
the pigmentation varies within the shade
I<00:02:13.650> do<00:02:13.950> only<00:02:14.280> have<00:02:14.400> two<00:02:14.730> colors<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.270> I<00:02:15.420> didn't

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
you can see that one is a lot less

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.340 
you can see that one is a lot less
pigmented<00:02:41.849> you<00:02:42.269> can<00:02:42.450> easily<00:02:42.720> build<00:02:43.110> this<00:02:43.230> up

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
pigmented you can easily build this up

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.770 
pigmented you can easily build this up
and<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.560> do<00:02:43.620> still<00:02:43.980> love<00:02:44.160> wearing<00:02:44.489> this<00:02:44.790> but

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
and I do still love wearing this but

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.039 
and I do still love wearing this but
this<00:02:45.930> one<00:02:46.080> is<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.230> lot<00:02:46.590> more<00:02:46.860> sheer<00:02:47.360> then<00:02:48.360> when

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
this one is a lot more sheer then when

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.630 
this one is a lot more sheer then when
you<00:02:49.140> build<00:02:49.380> this<00:02:49.560> guy<00:02:49.799> up<00:02:50.010> I<00:02:52.250> think<00:02:53.250> that's<00:02:53.489> the

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
you build this guy up I think that's the

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
you build this guy up I think that's the
one<00:02:53.790> downside<00:02:54.180> there's<00:02:54.360> sort<00:02:54.480> of<00:02:54.540> an

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
one downside there's sort of an

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.509 
one downside there's sort of an
inconsistency<00:02:55.380> within<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.040> pigmentation

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
inconsistency within the pigmentation

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.370 
inconsistency within the pigmentation
but<00:02:56.880> that's<00:02:57.390> also<00:02:57.630> a<00:02:57.690> good<00:02:57.810> thing<00:02:57.870> because<00:02:58.260> if

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
but that's also a good thing because if

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.530 
but that's also a good thing because if
it<00:02:58.950> can<00:02:59.100> appeal<00:02:59.580> to<00:02:59.819> a<00:02:59.850> lot<00:03:00.000> more<00:03:00.180> people<00:03:00.360> like

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
it can appeal to a lot more people like

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.930 
it can appeal to a lot more people like
I<00:03:00.780> personally<00:03:00.840> prefer<00:03:01.560> super<00:03:02.310> pigmented<00:03:02.640> but

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
I personally prefer super pigmented but

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.550 
I personally prefer super pigmented but
I<00:03:03.000> know<00:03:03.090> that<00:03:03.269> some<00:03:03.420> people<00:03:03.690> prefer<00:03:03.810> more

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
I know that some people prefer more

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.550 
I know that some people prefer more
sheer<00:03:04.830> colors<00:03:05.190> so<00:03:06.120> if<00:03:06.630> there<00:03:06.840> are<00:03:06.989> testers<00:03:07.440> at

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
sheer colors so if there are testers at

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
sheer colors so if there are testers at
your<00:03:07.680> store<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:07.950> would<00:03:08.160> definitely<00:03:08.489> recommend

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
your store I would definitely recommend

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.550 
your store I would definitely recommend
testing<00:03:09.420> them<00:03:09.690> out<00:03:09.810> or<00:03:09.959> just<00:03:10.019> look<00:03:10.260> online<00:03:10.410> for

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
testing them out or just look online for
