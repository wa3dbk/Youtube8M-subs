00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.149
 until next time 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:11.920
 as you see and know the corn 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:15.370
 this is more cooked leave it like an hour 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:18.660
 and is not displaced is no longer 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.660
 it's the same 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:26.310
 here I already have him 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.870
 everything already I have it liquefied not only I'm going to 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.730
 empty 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.730
 I'm going to do corn here 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.360
 this does not need to strain because 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.690
 they know that as it was well believed then 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.690
 is 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.700
 Molinito is fine 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.360
 It does not have pieces 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.150
 and I 'm going to put it here 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.830
 right now is I'm going to empty all I'm 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.240
 giving the sample because I am 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:59.450
 doing with the handle 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:03.430
 Well, if I keep doing it like that, 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.430
 be a chorreadero on the stove 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.360
 today I'm going to put it I'm going to put 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:12.190
 everything here in the pot and then I'm going to 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.369
 put the chicken that I have here 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:19.000
 shredded I'll put here on 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:21.300
 Now, you have a few different pots 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.630
 but it's the same 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.030
 I do not know why 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:30.259
 because that first one I'm putting the 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:33.200
 chili and all because the chicken was over 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.090
 a little bit was reached to sew then 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.000
 that's why I'm not going to let you 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.689
 boil here but here has broth from the 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.350
 same that was of the chicken so that it is 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:47.350
 a little fatty cited 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.390
 I tasted good and I told them that 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.140
 all ways for me I like them more 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:56.430
 put the chicken to boil with the corn well 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.430
 grabs more flavor the corn 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.150
 Chile 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:17.209
 I put everything here and put the chicken 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.390
 also now the only thing that is missing is nothing 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.210
 more let it boil 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.200
 and when it boils then I'm going to 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.120
 serve the dish so you are gathering in 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.239

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:34.950
 As I said, I'm not going to go, I was not 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:37.920

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.430

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.819

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:48.900

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:52.230
