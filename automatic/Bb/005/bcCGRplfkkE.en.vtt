 while the caravaneers 100 already announced 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.210
 what are they for? 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.219
 first the left Zionist horsemen 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:11.400
 because forced background of cases already a feat even many cut the 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.849
 roots with their normal outfit and must maintain communications 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.349
 green iguanas of a coupe and a vote in the wilayas absolutely 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:20.990
 the junctions that walks its management pole of

 and it's okay I already have one who likes to travel but allows a clamp 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.159
 Proustian this very legal side

 good it seemed so told new people following new 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.750

 kept in touch with their loved ones 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.700
 then not be a way for that except at low cost called sferen 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.700
 h group technology this cell phone tone 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.750
 the wired phones a caravan is unthinkable huge tile 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.040
 on TV we also think about everything about the internet 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.970
 and sarah ccvm at la lavida the evolution of holding an internet 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.050
 for riders 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.010
 that means it's normal for someone involved a country that is 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.270
 acquired last year 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.150
 the system is a server communications system besides kept 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.380
 many attachments here several american states 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.380
 because it was felt that there was an essential question 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.000
 melissa of his city is not found what I was going to dismiss for the 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.550
 found almost everywhere 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.190
 there kamagated stopovers redheads subjected to steaks three axes 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.610
 who acquires a year the Catalan there are cases where there are guys darroman who 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.010
 announced percent and the so-called Latvian ideal for relaxation 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.310
 fox a year so we can hook up just about anything 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.720
 it's her with a map 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.270
 as for pain because 3 finally a map 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.130
 left to the activation of the country - which allows to communicate directly with 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.170
 an antenna which is also beautiful 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.110
 and at that time we were looking for a movie next year at e-mail 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.930
 we send our photos we can even the speed is so high that we can 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.580
 even make visual communication live there are people who do not have any 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.110
 hundreds can be 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.310
 nervous about these technologies laurent% it's true that to give to the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.650
 telly about 22 years sharing us is not because we are talking about fraud fiesta 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.850
 rs 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.420
 it must be said that for whom being a form to turn on a network without 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.890
 wire it's a network that's unprotected 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.699
 when traveling sudden rise 

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.879
 we like four French 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.619
 it would be that the worst ciba redeemed 

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:15.729
 include getting complicated 

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:17.129
 spades against m 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.099
 often when it's worth it to a woman looking for it's easier because 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:20.599
 than 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.009
 by definition is not the search for a problem-free solution 

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:26.489
 so at that time did you know normal + 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.519
 so I plugged in the whole world of circus years 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.559
 then I never have any virus families or anything 

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:38.249
 alas the credit cards it's me who relies on more assets more 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:39.079
 more 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:41.349
 Palestinian hamas since the end of the session 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.040
 all the electronic gadgets quarantined country mamadou tandja has no 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.790
 time to lose the reference when you are interested in camping caravanning 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.409
 security the capital magazine 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:53.529
 why do we study with everything that comes out as a product 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:57.719
 and then when we have an approach geared towards the people exposed - it 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:00.779
 ensues a mattress and places your mother all the tests indeed 

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:03.109
 if we have a tendency to speak 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.859
 I think we are good but talk but it's worth it to connect but 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:07.070
 why did we do 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.260
 we find his account 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.269
