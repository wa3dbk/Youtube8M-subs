00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.240
 si mon amour is testing for us today 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.240
 the new opel corsa 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.470
 young, dynamic and freshly styled 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.470
 already presents itself 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.180
 fifth generation of the bestseller simone 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.369
 take the new opel corsa today 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.330
 extensively under the magnifying glass as is then 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.330
 the first impression 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.720
 So I have to say the new corsa drives 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.120
 to drive really well very pleasant 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.620
 Of course, there are situations such as 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.600
 for example, if you enter from the traffic lights 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.820
 would like to drive a bit faster 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.739
 should the gas intake not really 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.190
 work simple but if he his point 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.750
 and it has really reached 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.650
 It must have been as it is said 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:02.190
 is fun little turning circle so 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.089
 Fleet maneuvers are quite in it 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.880
 yes I have to say I am very positive 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:11.950
 surprised and for me under the hood 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.810
 New corsa he comes from would 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.090
 already known three-cylinder turbo 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.090
 gasoline direct injection with a liter 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.789
 Displacement for use he makes 85 kw 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.100
 the consumption should be at 4.9 liters 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:26.289
 premium gasoline on 100 kilometers are the 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.950
 driven corsa in the color edition with 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:33.539
 additional extras cost 20,000 85 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.539
 euro in germany 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.660
 yes, our goal was really the 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.850
 make three-cylinder completely transparent 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.210
 so no one notices we have 13 there 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.520
 in it 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.870
 that is, we have the extent of 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.660
 same engine with a balancer shaft 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:50.670
 so that the vibrations are better 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:53.140
 as for some the engine since 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.970
 In 1982, the corsa is in the Spanish 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.950
 Saragossa and Germany in 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.110
 Eisenach built to this day 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.560
 Four generations have been sold now 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.870
 comes the fifth on the market and it 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.150
 is he the new opel corsa was also in 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.310
 punkto design overworked curved 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.530
 form bulky appearance and harmonious 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.750
 lines indicate sportiness 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:20.920
 corsa but sticks to the usual 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:22.690
 silhouette which was still very important to us 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.240
 we just talk about it as well 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.910
 signatures that always return two 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.040
 Hood front area we have one above 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.970
 a so-called temple fold and if they are 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.410
 now on the old vehicles 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.560
 go back also for the first 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.870
 Generation always continuous 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.430
 appears this so-called signature, the 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.680
 same in the strings in 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.030
 page profile so-called safe in the 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.769
 lower area have seen 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.450
 and there we are unlikely 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.709
 put a lot of emphasis on this 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.019
 Signature in the lower area 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.190
 unlikely to be precise 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.910
 and he really has something with quality 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.470
 to do that was super super important to us 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.160
 a lot has happened in the interior as well 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.989
 a lot of room gentle curves bicoloured 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.600
 fairings soft materials and 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.280
 comfortable seats with good page stop in the 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.380
 Center between driver and passenger 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.430
 at the request of the seven inches tall 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.959
 Color touchscreen of the intelli link 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.540
 infotainment systems in the test we start 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:20.239
 the navigation app ringo and wait 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.409
 the parallel time measurement returns 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.409
 rather disappointing result 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.840
 just 52 seconds spd needs running 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.530
 space on the back offers 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.689
 the rÃ¼sselsheimer also by the 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.359
 vaulting in the roof area also have 1 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:43.489
 meter 85 tall persons enough head 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:45.769
 and legroom of the trunk 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.709
 also convinces thanks to the split 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.810
 back bank there is enough bin young 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.370
 dynamic woman like simone should you 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.290
 for the new corsa 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.189
 How did you like the car? 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.189
 is her conclusion 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.700
 on the whole, I find the new one 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.639
 Opel buyer really good is fine 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.439
 driving is agile pleasant 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:07.909
 small manko is the view forward 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:09.799
 I think it's a bit too long 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:12.739
 it limits the view a bit 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:14.299
 and the navi therefore about this app 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:17.389
 a bit limited, too 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:19.669
 function but otherwise great vehicle 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:22.070
 perfect for the city and really 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:27.680
 pleasant driving 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:30.229
 extremely attractive, perfectly networked 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.009
 and with the latest security systems 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.500
 fitted 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:35.240
 the new opel corsa the thrifty 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.090
 small car is from december to one 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.840
 base price of 11,900 80 euros in 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.840
 Germany available
