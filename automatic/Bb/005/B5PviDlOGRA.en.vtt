and<00:03:50.050> then<00:03:50.320> you<00:03:50.410> change<00:03:50.709> and<00:03:51.280> you<00:03:51.340> go<00:03:51.489> back<00:03:51.640> this

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
and then you change and you go back this

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.750 
and then you change and you go back this
way<00:03:51.940> again<00:03:51.970> that<00:03:52.630> forward<00:03:53.019> for<00:03:53.980> junior<00:03:54.519> sick

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
way again that forward for junior sick

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.030 
way again that forward for junior sick
exactly<00:03:55.390> I<00:03:55.420> said<00:03:55.450> look<00:03:56.410> at<00:03:56.530> that<00:03:56.650> get<00:03:56.890> it

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
exactly I said look at that get it

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.840 
exactly I said look at that get it
strong<00:03:57.430> little<00:03:57.790> bit<00:03:58.140> when<00:03:59.140> you<00:03:59.230> do<00:03:59.350> the

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
strong little bit when you do the

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.020 
strong little bit when you do the
sitting<00:04:00.850> down<00:04:01.030> one<00:04:01.300> okay<00:04:02.230> you<00:04:03.010> don't<00:04:03.190> is<00:04:03.760> not

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
sitting down one okay you don't is not

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.400 
sitting down one okay you don't is not
flexible<00:04:04.450> doesn't<00:04:04.870> really<00:04:05.019> matter

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
flexible doesn't really matter

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.250 
flexible doesn't really matter
the<00:04:05.860> idea<00:04:06.340> is<00:04:06.430> trying<00:04:06.700> to<00:04:06.760> reach<00:04:06.989> slowly<00:04:07.989> up

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
the idea is trying to reach slowly up

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.580 
the idea is trying to reach slowly up
designed<00:04:08.769> a<00:04:09.010> bit<00:04:09.160> another<00:04:09.970> okay<00:04:10.870> and<00:04:11.140> then

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
designed a bit another okay and then

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.330 
designed a bit another okay and then
usual<00:04:11.860> rich<00:04:12.070> decide<00:04:12.670> a<00:04:13.000> bit<00:04:13.810> like<00:04:14.050> this<00:04:14.340> and

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
usual rich decide a bit like this and

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.920 
usual rich decide a bit like this and
when<00:04:15.489> you<00:04:15.580> come<00:04:15.730> to<00:04:15.760> Center<00:04:16.180> here<00:04:16.330> try<00:04:16.540> to<00:04:16.570> rich

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
when you come to Center here try to rich

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.229 
when you come to Center here try to rich
in<00:04:17.109> your<00:04:17.260> chest<00:04:17.560> like<00:04:17.769> leaning<00:04:18.549> forward<00:04:18.910> draw

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
a close up Japan now forward like this

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.730 
a close up Japan now forward like this
okay

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
okay

okay
so<00:04:24.340> your<00:04:24.520> exercise<00:04:24.880> lower<00:04:25.240> muscle<00:04:26.050> in<00:04:26.110> the

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
so your exercise lower muscle in the

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.410 
so your exercise lower muscle in the
back<00:04:26.350> okay<00:04:27.310> so<00:04:27.700> when<00:04:27.850> you're<00:04:27.970> doing<00:04:28.090> the<00:04:28.270> line

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
back okay so when you're doing the line

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.500 
back okay so when you're doing the line
the<00:04:28.540> same<00:04:28.690> cause<00:04:29.380> of<00:04:29.560> that<00:04:29.650> closer<00:04:30.370> that<00:04:30.639> back

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
the same cause of that closer that back

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.720 
the same cause of that closer that back
at<00:04:31.690> that<00:04:31.810> lever<00:04:31.990> cause<00:04:32.560> of<00:04:32.740> that<00:04:32.830> cause<00:04:33.580> of

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
at that lever cause of that cause of

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.180 
at that lever cause of that cause of
that<00:04:33.850> better<00:04:34.690> there<00:04:34.960> okay<00:04:35.350> so<00:04:35.889> all<00:04:36.040> this

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
that better there okay so all this

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.010 
that better there okay so all this
movement<00:04:36.460> there<00:04:36.760> got<00:04:37.330> understanding<00:04:37.930> the

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
movement there got understanding the

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.820 
movement there got understanding the
line<00:04:38.230> of<00:04:38.440> it<00:04:38.950> well<00:04:39.550> so<00:04:40.270> each<00:04:40.480> parven<00:04:41.169> is<00:04:41.350> your

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
line of it well so each parven is your

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.590 
line of it well so each parven is your
exercise<00:04:42.100> different<00:04:42.639> part<00:04:42.850> of<00:04:42.880> the<00:04:42.970> body<00:04:43.150> okay

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
moving forward and in understanding so

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.830 
moving forward and in understanding so
each<00:05:50.310> of<00:05:50.340> them<00:05:50.670> exercise<00:05:51.150> when<00:05:51.330> you<00:05:51.420> turn<00:05:51.660> in

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
each of them exercise when you turn in

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.170 
each of them exercise when you turn in
try<00:05:52.140> to<00:05:52.200> cram<00:05:52.620> it<00:05:52.800> down<00:05:53.130> bit<00:05:53.340> more<00:05:53.520> and<00:05:53.880> then

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
try to cram it down bit more and then

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.720 
try to cram it down bit more and then
turn<00:05:54.480> so<00:05:55.050> you<00:05:55.170> can<00:05:55.320> create<00:05:55.590> power<00:05:55.920> when<00:05:56.640> you

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:56.730 
turn so you can create power when you

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.730 
turn so you can create power when you
walk<00:05:56.910> like<00:05:56.940> that<00:05:57.210> okay<00:05:57.510> when<00:05:58.050> you<00:05:58.140> do<00:05:58.260> the<00:05:58.380> palm

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
movement later on you have to make sure

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.050 
movement later on you have to make sure
you<00:06:13.320> turn<00:06:13.470> your<00:06:13.530> ways<00:06:13.830> well<00:06:14.160> and<00:06:14.400> be

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.410 
don't lean okay when you're doing this I

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.340 
don't lean okay when you're doing this I
like<00:06:19.680> this<00:06:19.970> when<00:06:20.970> you<00:06:21.090> punch<00:06:21.420> it<00:06:21.570> don't<00:06:22.110> lean

like this when you punch it don't lean
like<00:06:22.560> this<00:06:23.000> try<00:06:24.000> to<00:06:24.030> get<00:06:24.270> it<00:06:24.360> straight<00:06:24.450> you<00:06:24.750> can

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
like this try to get it straight you can

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.200 
like this try to get it straight you can
because<00:06:25.590> when<00:06:25.710> you<00:06:25.830> move<00:06:26.010> in<00:06:26.250> you<00:06:26.850> want<00:06:27.060> to<00:06:27.120> be

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:50.940 
as always when you practice try to see

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.970 
as always when you practice try to see
you<00:06:51.090> can<00:06:51.210> get<00:06:51.360> ways<00:06:51.660> with<00:06:52.020> power<00:06:52.230> if<00:06:52.590> you<00:06:52.740> can

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:57.780 
the movement you have to do it yourself

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.900 
the movement you have to do it yourself
to<00:06:57.900> make<00:06:58.050> sure<00:06:58.080> you<00:06:58.350> understand<00:06:59.190> them<00:06:59.310> all

00:06:59.900 --> 00:06:59.910 
to make sure you understand them all

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:02.750 
to make sure you understand them all
this<00:07:00.270> basic<00:07:00.750> here<00:07:00.990> or<00:07:01.410> the<00:07:01.620> stop<00:07:01.800> it<00:07:01.920> on<00:07:02.070> you

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:02.760 
this basic here or the stop it on you

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.630 
this basic here or the stop it on you
spend<00:07:03.090> some<00:07:03.210> more<00:07:03.420> time<00:07:03.740> practice<00:07:04.740> practice

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:05.640 
spend some more time practice practice

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.180 
spend some more time practice practice
and<00:07:05.790> then<00:07:06.270> you<00:07:06.750> were<00:07:07.290> able<00:07:07.470> to<00:07:07.680> understand

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:08.190 
and then you were able to understand

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.440 
and then you were able to understand
them<00:07:08.340> a<00:07:08.490> lot<00:07:08.820> of<00:07:08.850> thing<00:07:09.090> you<00:07:09.180> have<00:07:09.210> to

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:09.450 
them a lot of thing you have to

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.090 
them a lot of thing you have to
understand<00:07:09.780> when<00:07:09.930> you<00:07:10.020> do<00:07:10.200> the<00:07:10.320> movement<00:07:10.530> if

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.100 
understand when you do the movement if

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.130 
understand when you do the movement if
got<00:07:11.790> enough<00:07:12.060> power<00:07:12.300> and<00:07:12.570> the<00:07:12.750> ground<00:07:12.960> would

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:13.140 
got enough power and the ground would

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.990 
got enough power and the ground would
lock<00:07:13.380> and<00:07:13.620> back<00:07:13.800> straight<00:07:14.190> then<00:07:14.370> it's<00:07:14.700> okay

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000 
lock and back straight then it's okay

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.030 
lock and back straight then it's okay
then<00:07:15.540> when<00:07:15.720> you're<00:07:15.870> moving<00:07:16.380> a<00:07:16.560> little<00:07:16.950> bit

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:17.040 
then when you're moving a little bit

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.890 
then when you're moving a little bit
difficult<00:07:17.580> because<00:07:18.120> every<00:07:18.450> time<00:07:18.600> you<00:07:18.750> turn

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:18.900 
difficult because every time you turn

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.840 
difficult because every time you turn
wrong<00:07:19.170> you<00:07:19.440> will<00:07:19.560> pour<00:07:19.830> the<00:07:20.250> muscle<00:07:20.610> or<00:07:20.700> you

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:20.850 
wrong you will pour the muscle or you

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:22.670 
wrong you will pour the muscle or you
fall<00:07:21.090> over<00:07:21.120> very<00:07:21.570> easy<00:07:21.750> it's<00:07:22.080> very<00:07:22.320> difficult

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680 
fall over very easy it's very difficult

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.250 
fall over very easy it's very difficult
to<00:07:22.800> use<00:07:23.040> them<00:07:23.220> later<00:07:23.610> on<00:07:23.910> so<00:07:24.450> if<00:07:24.630> you<00:07:24.960> got<00:07:25.110> any
