switch isn't really a switch it's a
momentary<00:01:51.310> hold<00:01:52.270> so<00:01:52.570> if<00:01:52.660> you<00:01:52.750> want<00:01:52.930> to<00:01:52.990> mute

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
momentary hold so if you want to mute

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.440 
momentary hold so if you want to mute
you<00:01:53.380> have<00:01:53.530> to<00:01:53.650> press<00:01:53.860> it<00:01:53.890> and<00:01:54.160> hold<00:01:54.460> it<00:01:54.580> and<00:01:54.640> you

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
you have to press it and hold it and you

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.640 
you have to press it and hold it and you
have<00:01:55.570> to<00:01:55.660> keep<00:01:55.780> holding<00:01:56.110> it<00:01:56.170> as<00:01:56.290> long<00:01:56.440> as<00:01:56.560> you

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
have to keep holding it as long as you

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.310 
have to keep holding it as long as you
want<00:01:56.800> to<00:01:56.860> be<00:01:56.950> muted<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:58.450> other<00:01:58.630> issue<00:01:59.020> that<00:01:59.170> I

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
want to be muted the other issue that I

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.200 
want to be muted the other issue that I
don't<00:01:59.380> like<00:01:59.650> about<00:01:59.800> it<00:01:59.950> is<00:02:00.100> that<00:02:00.280> it<00:02:00.610> has<00:02:00.640> a

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
don't like about it is that it has a

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.770 
don't like about it is that it has a
two-position<00:02:01.900> mute<00:02:02.880> one<00:02:03.880> position<00:02:04.240> is<00:02:04.540> full

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
two-position mute one position is full

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.550 
two-position mute one position is full
muted<00:02:05.790> full<00:02:06.790> mute<00:02:07.030> for<00:02:07.240> no<00:02:07.390> sound<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:08.410> other

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
muted full mute for no sound the other

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.339 
muted full mute for no sound the other
position<00:02:09.039> is<00:02:09.369> 90%<00:02:09.970> mute<00:02:10.539> so<00:02:10.690> it<00:02:10.780> just<00:02:10.959> lowers

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
position is 90% mute so it just lowers

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.440 
position is 90% mute so it just lowers
your<00:02:11.620> volume<00:02:12.040> and<00:02:12.310> what<00:02:12.850> I<00:02:12.880> don't<00:02:12.970> like<00:02:13.150> is

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
your volume and what I don't like is

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.060 
your volume and what I don't like is
that<00:02:13.480> it's<00:02:13.750> very<00:02:13.930> easy<00:02:14.320> to<00:02:14.470> get<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:14.920> two

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
that it's very easy to get the two

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.650 
that it's very easy to get the two
confused<00:02:15.100> and<00:02:15.850> when<00:02:15.940> you<00:02:16.030> think<00:02:16.180> you<00:02:16.270> have<00:02:16.510> the

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
confused and when you think you have the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.130 
confused and when you think you have the
other

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
other

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.410 
other
the<00:02:17.320> person<00:02:17.620> on<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.770> other<00:02:17.860> end<00:02:17.950> muted<00:02:18.420> you

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
the person on the other end muted you

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.650 
the person on the other end muted you
might<00:02:19.600> only<00:02:19.750> have<00:02:19.960> them<00:02:20.170> on<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.450> partial<00:02:22.450> mute

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
might only have them on the partial mute

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.760 
might only have them on the partial mute
and<00:02:22.900> they<00:02:22.990> can<00:02:23.140> still<00:02:23.350> hear<00:02:23.530> what<00:02:23.650> you're

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
and they can still hear what you're

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.110 
and they can still hear what you're
saying<00:02:24.100> so<00:02:24.490> if<00:02:24.580> you're<00:02:24.670> talking<00:02:24.730> bad<00:02:25.000> about

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
saying so if you're talking bad about

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.670 
saying so if you're talking bad about
them<00:02:25.360> that<00:02:25.540> might<00:02:25.780> not<00:02:25.900> be<00:02:25.930> a<00:02:26.050> good<00:02:26.230> thing<00:02:26.410> on

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
them that might not be a good thing on

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.160 
them that might not be a good thing on
the<00:02:27.610> plantronics<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.660> has<00:02:28.930> a<00:02:29.160> on/off<00:02:30.160> mute<00:02:31.170> so

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
the plantronics it has a on/off mute so

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.470 
the plantronics it has a on/off mute so
it's<00:02:32.380> you<00:02:32.710> switch<00:02:32.980> it<00:02:33.130> up<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:33.490> it<00:02:33.760> stays<00:02:34.000> muted

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
it's you switch it up and it stays muted

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.480 
it's you switch it up and it stays muted
for<00:02:35.440> as<00:02:35.530> long<00:02:35.650> as<00:02:35.770> you<00:02:35.830> leave<00:02:35.980> it<00:02:36.070> switched<00:02:36.280> up

for as long as you leave it switched up

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.660 
for as long as you leave it switched up
and<00:02:36.670> then<00:02:37.270> you<00:02:37.360> switch<00:02:37.540> it<00:02:37.660> down<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.920> unmute<00:02:39.280> so

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
and then you switch it down to unmute so

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.060 
and then you switch it down to unmute so
there's<00:02:40.420> no<00:02:40.600> mistaking<00:02:40.900> if<00:02:41.350> it's<00:02:41.680> muted<00:02:41.980> or

susceptible to electric line noise like

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.780 
susceptible to electric line noise like
from<00:02:53.260> fluorescent<00:02:53.860> lights<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.400> you'll<00:02:54.640> hear

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
from fluorescent lights and you'll hear

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.220 
from fluorescent lights and you'll hear
that<00:02:54.820> in<00:02:55.060> comparison<00:02:55.480> that<00:02:55.720> I<00:02:55.780> do<00:02:55.840> in<00:02:55.989> just<00:02:56.140> a

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
that in comparison that I do in just a

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.540 
that in comparison that I do in just a
minute<00:02:56.470> so<00:02:56.620> if<00:02:56.709> you've<00:02:56.830> got<00:02:56.950> any<00:02:57.010> florescent

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
minute so if you've got any florescent

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.150 
minute so if you've got any florescent
lights<00:02:57.670> plugged<00:02:57.970> in<00:02:58.410> nearby<00:02:59.410> it's<00:02:59.800> gonna<00:02:59.920> pick

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
lights plugged in nearby it's gonna pick

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.610 
lights plugged in nearby it's gonna pick

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
up a very noticeable hum so now I'm

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.840 
up a very noticeable hum so now I'm
going<00:03:02.709> to<00:03:02.800> do<00:03:02.890> comparison<00:03:03.400> let<00:03:03.550> you<00:03:03.640> hear<00:03:03.820> how

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
going to do comparison let you hear how

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.940 
going to do comparison let you hear how

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
sort of as a baseline of what should

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.320 
sort of as a baseline of what should
sound<00:03:10.660> good<00:03:10.989> to<00:03:11.890> compare<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.459> other<00:03:12.580> two

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
very expensive they're just fine for

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.400 
very expensive they're just fine for
somebody<00:03:47.390> getting<00:03:47.600> started<00:03:47.990> in<00:03:48.110> podcasting

horrible
I<00:03:50.720> would<00:03:50.930> say<00:03:51.050> that<00:03:51.200> the<00:03:51.290> plane<00:03:51.470> tronics<00:03:51.830> does

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
I would say that the plane tronics does

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.699 
I would say that the plane tronics does
edge<00:03:52.640> out<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:53.090> general<00:03:53.810> electric<00:03:54.050> headset<00:03:54.500> a

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
edge out the general electric headset a

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.520 
edge out the general electric headset a
little<00:03:55.280> maybe<00:03:55.850> just<00:03:56.180> because<00:03:56.480> it<00:03:56.690> is<00:03:57.110> not<00:03:57.350> as

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
little maybe just because it is not as

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.070 
little maybe just because it is not as
susceptible<00:03:58.190> to<00:03:58.820> the<00:03:59.120> fluorescent<00:03:59.930> lighting

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
susceptible to the fluorescent lighting

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.220 
susceptible to the fluorescent lighting
noise<00:04:00.290> as<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:00.830> GE<00:04:01.190> headset<00:04:01.850> is<00:04:02.050> the<00:04:03.050> GE

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230

headset does in my opinion seem to have
a<00:04:05.510> little<00:04:05.660> bit<00:04:05.840> better<00:04:06.020> quality<00:04:06.230> when

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
a little bit better quality when

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.850 
a little bit better quality when
compared<00:04:07.520> side-to-side<00:04:07.850> it<00:04:08.270> wasn't<00:04:08.540> as

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
compared side-to-side it wasn't as

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
compared side-to-side it wasn't as
drastically<00:04:09.860> better<00:04:10.010> sounding<00:04:10.520> as<00:04:10.700> when

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
drastically better sounding as when

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.420 
drastically better sounding as when

surprised<00:04:13.790> at<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:15.200> the<00:04:15.470> lack<00:04:15.709> of<00:04:15.739> difference

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
surprised at the the lack of difference
