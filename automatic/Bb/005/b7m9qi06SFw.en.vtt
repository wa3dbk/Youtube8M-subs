00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:19.250
 or wool beds the hunter speaks to them 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.500
 pirates rolled you have not gold and today after 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.989
 an inactive time I bring you a new 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.179
 one video think before you start the 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:28.070
 video I want to offer you an apology for 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.470
 not having uploaded videos in the last 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.660
 two or three weeks the reason why 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.579
 I could not upload new videos was because 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.739
 I was giving exams of the 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.540
 end of semester at the university and 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.910
 like all those who study in a 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.500
 University will know the last weeks 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.390
 of classes are very difficult and 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.059
 stressful about the final projects 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.820
 exams the supplementary and all 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.980
 those things this was the reason why 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.600
 I have not made videos, I do not want them to think 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.629
 that was for sitting at home 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.670
 scratching my balls xd good too 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.500
 I want to take this opportunity to thank you 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.329
 all of you the fact that the channel 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.179
 already reached 100 subscribers and 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.310
 done a little more I thank you 

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:09.470
 everyone who supports me in doing this 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.360
 videos because if it were not for you 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.640
 are the ones watching the videos the fact 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.590
 that I do them would not do any good 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.840
 thanks for the support to all those who 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.970
 they follow the channel from its beginnings that 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.100
 it was relatively recently and also to 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.409
 those who joined recently I hope that 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.020
 the channel continues to grow and you continue 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.360
 supporting me always thank you good once 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.280
 saying this is the time to continue with 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.380
 the video and today I will talk to you about 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.940
 some theories that deal with the hunter 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.130
 of pirates from the band of the very 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.500
 you guard if guys I talk to you from RhÃ´ne to 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.540
 are for some time I have seen in 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.729
 several youtube videos and one blogs 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.680
 think that many people have created 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.750
 theories about soro and today they 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.550
 I will expose my point of view about 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.090
 said theories to see if in fact 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.920
 they can be feasible or we can not start the 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.020
 first theory and in my opinion the most 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.179
 popular after the time skiing weighs 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.130
 near the scar he has on in 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:03.020
 the left eye and with respect to which 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.539
 have created several theories like the one 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.399
 He says gave me one of his eyes 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.500
 just so that it could develop 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.480
 a new technique or the one that says that only 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.250
 keeps his eye closed because when he 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.660
 open uses hayden clock here from 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.610
 conqueror and things like that 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.250
 well let's start with the analysis 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.240
 I'll start by saying that this is a piece 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.400
 and not naruto 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.650
 Juan Pierre of the characters are usually 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.600
 keep your eyes always in place and 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.340
 not like in naruto that they spend the 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.800
 one another as if they were 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.630
 lending a toy or something like that 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.670
 I do not say it in a mocking way because 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.530
 in I'm also a fan of naruto but let's go 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.120
 in naruto yes they are abused with the 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.730
 Transparency of eyes from one to another 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.860
 character here in one think we have never 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.840
 seen someone giving their eyes to another 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.880
 person and much less than someone 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.890
 perform some ocular technique so 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.750
 affirm that I out gave him his eye to 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.120
 soro to develop a new technique 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.040
 I think it's total stupidity 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.140
 after the timer that we have already seen 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.150
 meow twice the first when the 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.430
 sailors were discussing who had 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.470
 been elected as the seventh chichi luca 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.100
 and the second on one of the covers of the 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.690
 manga together with perona in the chapter 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.850
 747 and on both occasions he has been seen 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.520
 that still keeps his two eyes in his 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.110
 site in any case if there was someone to 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.090
 who does not convince him and follow 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.070
 bent on spreading this theory 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.170
 saying that he only has one eye of mine 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.270
 to perform a technique totally 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.490
 new clarify that this would be impossible 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.240
 since we have never been told in the manga 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.160
 or in some 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.290
 sbs now that the eyes of my car 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.600
 have some skill or that he has 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.700
 an eye power certainly the eyes of 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.740
 my car are different from everyone else 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.050
 piece UAN characters and thanks to 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.880
 these earned his eye nickname from 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.890
 hawk but this does not mean that 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.290
 be special or give you some 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.660
 special power following with theories 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.790
 about soro's eye there is another one that says 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.800
 that only keeps his eye closed since 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.290
 itself opens it shoots its hack and the king 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.030
 this theory also seems illogical to me already 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.980
 that the fact that I now draw lines 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.230
 that seem to come out of the eyes of a 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.210
 character when he wears the king's persimmon 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.670
 it does not mean that this has shot 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.530
 from the eyes I do not doubt that he only has 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.690
 King's jackie since we've always been 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.610
 shown that he has a strong will and 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.650
 firm but saying that your eye has 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.230
 something to do with his check on the king are 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.450
 very different things once clarified 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.430
 these two theories that in my opinion are 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.470
 the most popular ones related to 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.810
 eye scar of envelope I will proceed to 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.940
 give them my point of view it is true that 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.340
 neither of the two theories seems to me 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.230
 feasible but it's not that I believe that 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.240
 Now he put that scar on soros 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.880
 simply by making it see more 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.550
 Even if we admit it now, it only looks more 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.590
 great that before xd but good I have 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.930
 two options about what could have 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.060
 passed with the eye of only the first one is 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.860
 that maybe the eye scar of soro is 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.169
 owe to some confrontation with miau 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.880
 during your training and considering 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.949
 that this is the best swordsman in the 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.509
 world the same one that opened him a while ago 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:55.039
 the chest with his sword does not 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:57.289
 I would be surprised that in your training 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:59.569
 I just received a serious wound and 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.460
 I ended up losing the eye and my 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:03.800
 second option is that maybe gold is what 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.300
 removed for some specific reason I do not know 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.490
 yes to train your hack and of 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.349
 observation in a better way or for some 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.389
 promise to their captain but not 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:13.430
 ruled out this option because in some 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:15.199
 Sometimes we have seen that it is only very 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.449
 able to hurt himself without 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:19.849
 think it a lot like for example when 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:22.069
 he threw his damn sword lazanda and gitex 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:24.319
 in the air to see if it accepted it or 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:26.360
 no or to give another example when you 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:28.099
 the brilliant idea of ââcutting itself 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.949
 the two legs to free themselves from the 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:32.599
 wax of mister tree in his confrontation 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:34.639
 but good whatever the 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:37.009
 reason why he only has that scar 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:38.930
 in his left eye and that nobody from the 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:41.509
 crew has had the curious 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.490
 enough to ask us 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:45.919
 know that it is something important that now 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.960
 does not want to reveal us yet finished 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:50.150
 theories about soro's eye 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.979
 continue with the theory that only 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.199
 comes or is coming from the island of 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:56.419
 cool guano and this theory is mostly 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:58.639
 based on the flashback that what we 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:00.740
 showed in the anime which is something 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:03.050
 different than the one oda showed in the manga 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.150
 in the anime we saw how they asked 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.370
 fox where did he come from and this one answered 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.470
 that I did not know and we also saw that in one 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.539
 of their confrontations with cribs or what 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.490
 use without much difficulty two swords 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:15.860
 to fight even being that his 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.199
 first time trying to use two swords 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.240
 at the same time many people are based on 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:22.370
 that to say that it only comes from guano 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.470
 kun and that's why you can use the swords with 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.810
 that facility however in the manga 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.940
 this never happened in the manga just we were 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.620
 showed to only always losing against 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.080
 queens to his promise to be the best 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.449
 swordsman of the world and later the 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.430
 cuina death do not blame many people 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:39.259
 for believing and spreading this theory since 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.690
 the vast majority among which I include myself 

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:43.639
 we started seeing feet in the anime and 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.470
 we followed with the manga when we put 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:47.510
 a day with the anime 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.760
 that maybe a lot of people think that 

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:52.070
 theory is true as extra data 

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.500
 I want to add that in the volume sbs 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.510
 69 said he was only from 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.940
 of the blue so this theory 

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.980
 it would be totally ruled out good 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.870
 nothing more here the video I hope that 

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.790
 you liked it and if so, please 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.340
 Give it to the laity and share what I already 

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:09.770
 would help a lot with that comment some 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.840
 another theory about soro and subscribe 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:14.020
 to the channel to see more videos up 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.020
 soon
