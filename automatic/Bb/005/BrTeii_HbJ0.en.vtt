knock<00:00:50.340> off<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.820> guys<00:00:50.969> okay<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:51.840> we<00:00:52.079> hear<00:00:52.289> about

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
knock off you guys okay so we hear about

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.350 
knock off you guys okay so we hear about
Aristotle<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.160> lot<00:00:53.399> because<00:00:53.789> his<00:00:53.940> social

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
Aristotle a lot because his social

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.880 
Aristotle a lot because his social
status<00:00:54.570> made<00:00:54.899> his<00:00:55.050> voice<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.469> little<00:00:55.710> louder

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
status made his voice a little louder

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.310 
status made his voice a little louder
but<00:00:56.219> he<00:00:56.340> was<00:00:56.489> almost<00:00:56.820> always<00:00:57.120> wrong<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:58.079> guess

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
but he was almost always wrong I guess

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.229 
but he was almost always wrong I guess
in<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.620> area<00:00:58.920> our<00:00:59.129> society<00:00:59.670> hasn't<00:00:59.940> changed

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
in that area our society hasn't changed

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.209 
in that area our society hasn't changed
very<00:01:00.300> much<00:01:00.510> anyway<00:01:01.289> it's<00:01:01.590> no<00:01:01.739> surprise<00:01:02.190> that

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
very much anyway it's no surprise that

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.219 
very much anyway it's no surprise that
Newton<00:01:02.789> wins<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.180> argument<00:01:03.480> but<00:01:03.899> what<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
Newton wins this argument but what the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.870 
Newton wins this argument but what the
heck<00:01:04.409> was<00:01:04.589> he<00:01:04.619> saying<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.250> wait<00:01:05.489> what<00:01:05.700> was<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
heck was he saying and wait what was the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.539 
heck was he saying and wait what was the
situation<00:01:06.510> again<00:01:06.630> all<00:01:06.990> right<00:01:07.530> hockey<00:01:08.010> the

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
situation again all right hockey the

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.580 
situation again all right hockey the
puck<00:01:08.790> sliding<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.390> ice<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.869> an<00:01:09.990> example<00:01:10.350> of

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
puck sliding on the ice is an example of

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.469 
puck sliding on the ice is an example of
Newton's<00:01:10.799> first<00:01:11.220> law<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.460> motion<00:01:11.610> which<00:01:12.090> says

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
Newton's first law of motion which says

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.390 
Newton's first law of motion which says
if<00:01:12.990> something<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.530> sitting<00:01:13.799> still<00:01:13.950> or<00:01:14.369> moving

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
if something is sitting still or moving

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.760 
if something is sitting still or moving
in<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.000> straight<00:01:15.060> line<00:01:15.450> at<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.200> steady<00:01:16.500> speed

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
in a straight line at a steady speed

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.590 
in a straight line at a steady speed
then<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.400> will<00:01:17.520> keep<00:01:17.729> doing<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.240> until

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
then it will keep doing that until

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.630 
then it will keep doing that until
something<00:01:18.900> else<00:01:19.170> changes<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:19.979> short<00:01:20.369> if

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
something else changes it in short if

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.490 
something else changes it in short if
you<00:01:20.880> don't<00:01:21.119> push<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.360> it'll<00:01:21.869> keep<00:01:22.020> doing<00:01:22.080> what

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
you don't push it it'll keep doing what

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.109 
you don't push it it'll keep doing what
it's<00:01:22.619> doing<00:01:22.680> examples<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:23.790> law<00:01:24.000> are

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
it's doing examples of this law are

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.149 
it's doing examples of this law are
difficult<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.659> find<00:01:24.930> though<00:01:25.170> see<00:01:25.560> most<00:01:25.890> things

called forces and they come in all kinds

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.240 
called forces and they come in all kinds
like<00:01:32.610> pushes<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.390> pulls<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.470> less<00:01:34.770> frequent

like pushes and pulls and less frequent

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.249 
like pushes and pulls and less frequent
forces<00:01:35.670> like<00:01:35.790> buoyancy<00:01:36.390> which<00:01:36.659> we<00:01:36.840> covered<00:01:37.200> in

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
forces like buoyancy which we covered in

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.109 
forces like buoyancy which we covered in
the<00:01:37.409> why<00:01:37.560> do<00:01:37.619> things<00:01:38.009> float<00:01:38.310> video<00:01:38.640> we<00:01:38.939> even

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
the why do things float video we even

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.120 
the why do things float video we even
have<00:01:39.390> some<00:01:39.570> more<00:01:39.720> seemingly<00:01:40.170> magical<00:01:40.829> forces

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
have some more seemingly magical forces

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.160 
have some more seemingly magical forces
like<00:01:41.369> magnetism<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.329> what<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.750> puck<00:01:42.990> is

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
like magnetism so what the puck is

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.020 
like magnetism so what the puck is
giving<00:01:43.439> us<00:01:43.560> all<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:43.829> trouble<00:01:44.280> anyway<00:01:44.610> chill

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.730 
giving us all this trouble anyway chill
I'm<00:01:45.240> getting<00:01:45.509> there<00:01:45.689> okay<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.380> our<00:01:46.590> everyday

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
I'm getting there okay in our everyday

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.770 
I'm getting there okay in our everyday
lives<00:01:47.280> there<00:01:47.700> are<00:01:47.729> two<00:01:47.970> forces<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.659> are

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
lives there are two forces that are

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.260 
lives there are two forces that are
almost<00:01:48.930> always<00:01:49.350> there<00:01:49.920> gravity<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.000> friction

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
almost always there gravity and friction

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.420 
almost always there gravity and friction
as<00:01:51.780> long<00:01:52.049> as<00:01:52.229> what<00:01:52.409> we're<00:01:52.560> looking<00:01:52.890> at<00:01:53.040> doesn't

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
as long as what we're looking at doesn't

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.190 
as long as what we're looking at doesn't
move<00:01:53.549> up<00:01:53.729> or<00:01:53.880> down<00:01:53.939> then<00:01:54.570> gravity<00:01:54.810> doesn't

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
move up or down then gravity doesn't

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.170 
move up or down then gravity doesn't
really<00:01:55.439> affect<00:01:55.829> how<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.159> moves<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.030> one

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
really affect how it moves so that one

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.910 
really affect how it moves so that one
is<00:01:57.210> easy<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.689> ignore<00:01:57.960> friction<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.740> bit

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
is easy to ignore friction is a bit

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.620 
is easy to ignore friction is a bit
trickier<00:01:59.369> though<00:01:59.610> but<00:01:59.969> in<00:02:00.090> hockey<00:02:00.299> there's

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
trickier though but in hockey there's

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.260 
trickier though but in hockey there's
ice<00:02:00.899> nothing<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.740> ever<00:02:01.770> truly<00:02:02.430> frictionless

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
ice nothing is ever truly frictionless

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.569 
ice nothing is ever truly frictionless
but<00:02:03.810> ice<00:02:03.930> gets<00:02:04.229> pretty<00:02:04.469> close<00:02:04.619> it's<00:02:05.310> about<00:02:05.520> a

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
but ice gets pretty close it's about a

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.280 
but ice gets pretty close it's about a
hundred<00:02:05.729> times<00:02:06.119> weaker<00:02:06.600> than<00:02:06.750> any<00:02:06.960> friction

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
hundred times weaker than any friction

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.490 
hundred times weaker than any friction
you're<00:02:07.619> used<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.340> makes<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.700> about<00:02:08.879> 1%

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
you're used to that makes it about 1%

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.820 
you're used to that makes it about 1%
scientists<00:02:10.500> usually<00:02:10.649> ignore<00:02:11.220> things<00:02:11.459> that

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
scientists usually ignore things that

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.260 
scientists usually ignore things that
small<00:02:12.070> and<00:02:12.310> we're<00:02:12.430> gonna<00:02:12.520> do<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:12.820> same<00:02:13.030> thing

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
small and we're gonna do the same thing

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.060 
small and we're gonna do the same thing
for<00:02:13.450> this<00:02:13.540> video<00:02:13.810> if<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.380> wall<00:02:14.590> behind<00:02:14.800> the

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
for this video if the wall behind the

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.070 
for this video if the wall behind the
goal<00:02:15.340> hadn't<00:02:15.790> gotten<00:02:15.940> in<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.300> way<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.840> puck

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
goal hadn't gotten in the way the puck

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.050 
goal hadn't gotten in the way the puck
could<00:02:17.290> have<00:02:17.380> easily<00:02:17.650> slid<00:02:18.190> for<00:02:18.430> 10<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.760> 12

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
could have easily slid for 10 to 12

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.010 
could have easily slid for 10 to 12

so<00:02:20.380> to<00:02:20.440> summarize<00:02:20.980> since<00:02:21.580> ice<00:02:21.820> is

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
so to summarize since ice is

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.880 
so to summarize since ice is
frictionless<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.140> puck<00:02:23.320> isn't<00:02:23.470> moving

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
frictionless and the puck isn't moving

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.410 
frictionless and the puck isn't moving
up<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.130> down<00:02:24.190> as<00:02:24.490> it<00:02:24.610> slides<00:02:24.880> there<00:02:25.300> is

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
up and down as it slides there is

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.390 
up and down as it slides there is
basically<00:02:25.840> nothing<00:02:26.140> affecting<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:26.920> puck<00:02:27.130> and

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
basically nothing affecting the puck and

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.220 
basically nothing affecting the puck and
with<00:02:27.610> nothing<00:02:27.820> trying<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.270> change<00:02:28.570> its<00:02:28.780> motion

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
with nothing trying to change its motion

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.720 
with nothing trying to change its motion
it's<00:02:29.500> going<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.920> keep<00:02:30.100> doing<00:02:30.280> what<00:02:30.550> it's<00:02:30.670> doing

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
it's going to keep doing what it's doing

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.970 
it's going to keep doing what it's doing

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
Newton's first law in action so what

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.050 
Newton's first law in action so what
happens<00:02:33.280> when<00:02:33.430> there<00:02:33.580> is<00:02:33.730> something

happens when there is something
affecting<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:34.720> puck<00:02:34.930> you'll<00:02:35.230> have<00:02:35.380> to<00:02:35.500> watch

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
affecting the puck you'll have to watch

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.590 
affecting the puck you'll have to watch
