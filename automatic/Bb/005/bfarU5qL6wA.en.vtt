00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:04.080
 with the entry into force of the new Lower Saxony dog ​​law on 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.780
 first July 2011 where the obligation to produce a certificate of competence for 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.469
 Dog owner introduced 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.199
 on Monday we already have the preparation for the theoretical 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:16.699
 Exam shown today we show you the practical part 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.160
 the practical examination for the certificate of competence for dog owners as well 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.720
 the preparation for it takes place in two different places and lasts 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.429
 about 60 minutes 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:31.529
 Altena 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.300
 the part next to a distraction Sorman area checked as for example 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.960
 a meadow or a forest edge 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.740
 The components of the exam are controlled go on a leash without 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.740
 Endangerment or harassment of third parties 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.250
 the lingering in the seat or place where the holder is something of his 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.840
 To remove dog 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.940
 No 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.260
 a distance to small amount is sufficient here 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.490
 the greeting by strangers is another component 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.080
 the dog is not allowed to jump or jump at the other person 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.910
 otherwise harass 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.170
 but it is allowed to reject a greeting if not sure how 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.170
 the dog encounters with strangers 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.290
 more important is the assurance that no person is molested by a dog 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.930
 becomes 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.740
 and you can handle that too if you stop an increase encounter 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.390
 in encounters of walkers or joggers is to pay attention that the 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.390
 Distance to the people as large as possible 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.940
 whether they go with their dog to the other side of the way with the dog 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.150
 stay in control or and insurance can go on 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.610
 leave to them 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.730
 every dog ​​owner must have the best strategy for himself and his dog 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.840
 know and master 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.530
 The most important thing here is that nobody is endangered or harassed 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.320
 and the Sit with her dog to clear the way so that all people unhindered 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.349
 can happen 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.519
 Last but not least the meeting with other dogs often a special one 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.269
 The challenge is because you do not know how the strange dog or owner 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.159
 behave 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.680
 make sure that you keep the maximum distance and 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.059
 keep her dog on a leash short 

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:31.799
 Here too, harassment is to be avoided as well as possible 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.799
 Recognize and avoid dangerous situations 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.949
 Various possible scenarios and possible solutions have been discussed 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:45.930
 he discussed the preparatory theory seminar with the participants and he 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.119
 is working 

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:51.789
 The second part of the practice will be in a city-like rally 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:55.809
 The ingredients performed are approximately the same as in distraction 

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:56.980
 Sarnen area 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:57.790
 Indeed 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.790
 In the city it is often more difficult for dogs and humans 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.460
 because the distractions are bigger, for example by bumper cars 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.460
 Groups of people is significantly higher 

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:11.489
 In the entire practical exam, the dog must be safe and without 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.519
 Harassment of third parties will be conducted in case persons are disabled or disabled 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.629
 the examiner can point to the misconduct 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:22.870
 However, the third party is repeatedly harassed is the candidate 

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.399
 failed 

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:26.459
 you also failed 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.989
 when the dog attacks his own keeper or other people 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.129
 repeatedly harasses or attacks other dogs massively harassed 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:39.659
 During the practical exam, aids such as food or toys are in 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:44.109
 every situation allows exaggerated physical hardship over the 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.639
 own dog or other dogs is not tolerated 

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:52.120
 in the city of Cannes sometimes get tight and not every dog ​​goes 

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:55.249
 let pass by groups of people or other dogs 

00:03:56.809 --> 00:04:00.589
 if they do not have such a situation in everyday life and their four-legged friends 

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:01.470
 expect of 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.470
 Of course they do not have to do that in the exam 

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:08.559
 It is quite possible to change the street side of the 

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:13.169
 responsible and foresighted handling of your dog is the a and o 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:19.709
 the components of theoretical and practical expertise meet everyone 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.470
 Dog owners constantly in everyday life and yet they are also for people 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.470
 with dog experience very instructive 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.160
 The online seminar did not do it right theory as it did 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.460
 Probably a lot of serious Vettori for every dog ​​owner 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.219
 recommend that he probably in court 

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:40.249
 when I hear so much about his dog now and about it he has to deal with it too 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:42.080
 understanding is easy 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.800
 a fine thing is important to anyone 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.730
 After successfully completing the exams, the dog owner comes for 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:52.199
 the passed expertise is presented with a certificate 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:57.039
 From the year 2013, each first customer owner and the longer the person 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.220
 had no own dog 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.700
 to complete the theoretical examination before a dog is purchased 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.360
 becomes 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.780
 The practical exam must then be completed within the first year of 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.770
 Dog ownership will be filed 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:10.900
 in Niedersachsen 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.240
 is the notification obligation that is a copy of the certificates must 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.860
 be submitted independently to the community
