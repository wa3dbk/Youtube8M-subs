00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.980
 i am apprenticing too big 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.340
 foreign trade merchant at metro cash 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.340
 carry 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.650
 before I got my education at the metro 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.060
 i did my high school diploma and directly 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.450
 then the training at the metro 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.450
 began 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.120
 As a trainee in the method I 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.500
 I run all departments so you can 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.060
 not from a typical one now 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.160
 speak the daily routine 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.570
 but for the moment it is like this 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.880
 that I am with the morning 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.980
 Head of department and we together 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.100
 go to the department to see if everything 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.140
 looks good and fill the shelves on 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.040
 and then we take the stop 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.250
 orders before 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:55.250
 on the pc and that 's just one of mine 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.250
 daily routines 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.539
 so 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.820
 be open and friendly 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.689
 occur and approach customers 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.850
 can 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.890
 and you should definitely go with it 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.479
 can tackle because in contrast to 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.030
 other commercial training is 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.630
 ago was called that one sometimes with 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.630
 tooth goes 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.380
 for the metro I have 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.390
 decided because the name metro 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.460
 a strong company does not stand for something 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.620
 only nationally known but also 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.230
 international 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:34.480
 and I thought that she was good with me 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:37.280
 can offer opportunities for the future and 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.500
 me after graduation first time one 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.270
 wanted to do commercial training 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.270
 so I have a good base 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.930
 because I love to get up in the morning 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.150
 and not knowing what the day brings 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.590
 and then at work my colleagues 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.410
 to meet with which I am great 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.810
 so understand our offer 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:02.050
 great relationship but also between the 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:05.820
 employees and to the customers so that 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.820
 Mixture means a good deal
