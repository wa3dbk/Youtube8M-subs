00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.630
 participation of the penitentiary service 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.710

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.779

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.750
 expression of freedom distraction 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.689
 fun art and especially thinking about 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.660
 the exit are almost 800 prisoners that from 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:38.210

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.960
 River Plate cultural expression with 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.449
 which is no reason why the murga 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.120
 is not in a prison I people 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.379

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.230
 freedom that is happening in the 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.449
 situation in the context of confinement 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.760
 know the filth knows of the joy of 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.780
 have been outside with which it is not 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.000
 that we are inventing nothing 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.100

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.530
 people express themselves in the carnival corso 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.659
 as you can damming it was out 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.390
 The Murga was the group's initiative 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.720
 militant battalion and now that it was a 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.119
 success go for more even with works of 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.620
 theater we started in the month of 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.900

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.970
