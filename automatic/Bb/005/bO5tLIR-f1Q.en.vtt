hi<00:00:15.610> my<00:00:16.090> name's<00:00:16.299> Danny<00:00:16.540> I<00:00:16.750> play<00:00:17.140> clash<00:00:17.350> of<00:00:17.440> clans

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 
hi my name's Danny I play clash of clans

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.500 
hi my name's Danny I play clash of clans
sometimes<00:00:18.040> so<00:00:18.520> what<00:00:19.000> I<00:00:19.029> thought<00:00:19.210> might<00:00:19.420> be

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:19.510 
sometimes so what I thought might be

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.630 
sometimes so what I thought might be
useful<00:00:19.540> for<00:00:19.900> everybody<00:00:20.320> really<00:00:20.590> is<00:00:20.680> to<00:00:20.890> talk<00:00:21.610> a

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
useful for everybody really is to talk a

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.990 
useful for everybody really is to talk a
little<00:00:22.090> bit<00:00:22.330> about<00:00:23.250> claremore<00:00:24.250> strategy<00:00:24.790> and

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
little bit about claremore strategy and

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.470 
little bit about claremore strategy and
how<00:00:25.450> to<00:00:25.510> win<00:00:25.900> at<00:00:26.200> fam<00:00:26.470> Wars<00:00:26.680> I<00:00:27.420> figured<00:00:28.420> you

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
how to win at fam Wars I figured you

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.670 
how to win at fam Wars I figured you
might<00:00:28.599> be<00:00:28.660> interested<00:00:28.900> to<00:00:29.170> see<00:00:29.259> how<00:00:29.410> the<00:00:29.470> base

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.680 
might be interested to see how the base

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.220 
might be interested to see how the base
is<00:00:29.860> holding<00:00:30.189> up<00:00:30.630> I'm<00:00:31.630> calling<00:00:32.050> this<00:00:32.169> base<00:00:32.410> the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
is holding up I'm calling this base the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.330 
is holding up I'm calling this base the
pachinko<00:00:35.230> base<00:00:35.680> I<00:00:35.890> don't<00:00:36.040> know<00:00:36.100> if<00:00:36.160> you<00:00:36.220> guys

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
pachinko base I don't know if you guys

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.900 
pachinko base I don't know if you guys
remember<00:00:36.400> the<00:00:37.320> Japanese<00:00:38.320> game<00:00:39.280> my<00:00:39.489> throne<00:00:39.879> of

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
remember the Japanese game my throne of

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.280 
remember the Japanese game my throne of
balls<00:00:40.210> up<00:00:40.420> and<00:00:40.660> it<00:00:40.780> goes<00:00:40.989> through<00:00:41.019> these

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
balls up and it goes through these

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.580 
balls up and it goes through these
little<00:00:41.790> pegs<00:00:42.790> essentially<00:00:43.480> and<00:00:43.960> it<00:00:44.199> has<00:00:44.470> to

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
little pegs essentially and it has to

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.580 
little pegs essentially and it has to
land<00:00:44.800> in<00:00:45.790> a<00:00:45.910> plant<00:00:46.090> in<00:00:46.150> a<00:00:46.239> target<00:00:46.660> so<00:00:47.050> this<00:00:47.410> I

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
land in a plant in a target so this I

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.160 
land in a plant in a target so this I
think<00:00:47.649> is<00:00:47.980> the<00:00:48.100> same<00:00:48.280> base<00:00:48.460> so<00:00:49.090> really<00:00:49.989> it's

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
think is the same base so really it's

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.660 
think is the same base so really it's
only<00:00:50.380> a<00:00:50.410> very<00:00:50.590> well<00:00:50.829> it's<00:00:51.010> stopping<00:00:51.430> people

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
only a very well it's stopping people

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.100 
only a very well it's stopping people
from<00:00:51.850> being<00:00:52.120> very<00:00:52.300> targeted<00:00:52.809> when<00:00:52.989> they're

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
from being very targeted when they're

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.530 
from being very targeted when they're
trying<00:00:53.260> to<00:00:53.350> get<00:00:53.530> into<00:00:53.800> the<00:00:53.920> core<00:00:54.129> of<00:00:54.390> course<00:00:55.390> it

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
trying to get into the core of course it

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.510 
trying to get into the core of course it
is<00:00:55.690> possible<00:00:55.780> to<00:00:56.469> because<00:00:57.129> there's<00:00:57.280> lots<00:00:57.340> of

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
is possible to because there's lots of

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.160 
is possible to because there's lots of
building<00:00:57.820> outside<00:00:57.969> it's<00:00:58.510> possible<00:00:58.899> to<00:00:59.020> do<00:00:59.140> a

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
building outside it's possible to do a

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.440 
building outside it's possible to do a
barge<00:00:59.739> to<00:01:00.070> get<00:01:00.190> what<00:01:00.550> you<00:01:00.850> know<00:01:00.969> to<00:01:01.030> get<00:01:01.270> one

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
barge to get what you know to get one

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.049 
barge to get what you know to get one
star<00:01:01.750> but<00:01:02.590> it's<00:01:02.739> really<00:01:02.950> saving<00:01:03.700> the<00:01:03.910> loop

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
star but it's really saving the loop

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.910 
star but it's really saving the loop
that's<00:01:04.210> really<00:01:04.449> important<00:01:04.869> to<00:01:04.899> me<00:01:05.110> I'm<00:01:05.410> with

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
that's really important to me I'm with

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.219 
that's really important to me I'm with
120<00:01:06.640> war<00:01:06.880> winds<00:01:07.119> sorry<00:01:07.660> hundred<00:01:07.930> and<00:01:08.020> twenty

120 war winds sorry hundred and twenty
hundred<00:01:08.649> and<00:01:08.950> twenty<00:01:09.190> defensive<00:01:09.640> wins<00:01:09.850> it's

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
hundred and twenty defensive wins it's

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.230 
hundred and twenty defensive wins it's
actually<00:01:10.360> basically<00:01:11.050> doing<00:01:11.440> too<00:01:11.619> badly<00:01:12.240> yeah

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
actually basically doing too badly yeah

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.700 
actually basically doing too badly yeah
they<00:01:13.390> go<00:01:13.539> so<00:01:13.810> I<00:01:14.050> thought<00:01:14.200> I'd<00:01:14.320> showed<00:01:14.470> out<00:01:14.590> with

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
you so how to win at clan wars well

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.719 
you so how to win at clan wars well
first<00:01:17.440> of<00:01:17.590> all<00:01:17.649> you<00:01:17.800> need<00:01:17.860> to<00:01:18.070> be<00:01:18.160> active<00:01:18.520> so

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
first of all you need to be active so

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.420 
first of all you need to be active so
the<00:01:18.939> clan<00:01:19.150> needs<00:01:19.360> to<00:01:19.630> be<00:01:19.780> up<00:01:20.439> for<00:01:20.830> writing<00:01:21.280> and

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
the clan needs to be up for writing and

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.770 
the clan needs to be up for writing and
that's<00:01:21.729> something<00:01:21.909> you<00:01:22.119> have<00:01:22.299> to<00:01:22.330> check<00:01:22.600> with

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
that's something you have to check with

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.080 
that's something you have to check with
your<00:01:22.900> clanmates<00:01:23.320> before<00:01:23.770> you<00:01:24.040> enter<00:01:24.820> a<00:01:24.880> clam

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
your clanmates before you enter a clam

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.859 
your clanmates before you enter a clam
ball<00:01:26.040> there's<00:01:27.040> absolutely<00:01:27.340> no<00:01:27.520> point<00:01:27.549> in<00:01:27.939> you

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
ball there's absolutely no point in you

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.140 
ball there's absolutely no point in you
know<00:01:28.990> entering<00:01:29.409> clamor<00:01:29.770> if<00:01:29.939> only<00:01:30.939> half<00:01:31.090> the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
know entering clamor if only half the

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.910 
know entering clamor if only half the
people<00:01:31.450> are<00:01:31.509> going<00:01:31.630> to<00:01:31.720> write<00:01:31.840> so<00:01:32.500> that's<00:01:32.680> one

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
people are going to write so that's one

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.310 
people are going to write so that's one
so<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:34.210> second<00:01:34.570> thing<00:01:34.689> you<00:01:34.750> need<00:01:34.810> to<00:01:34.930> do<00:01:35.140> is

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
so the second thing you need to do is

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.320 
so the second thing you need to do is
have<00:01:35.740> a<00:01:35.770> strategy<00:01:36.159> the<00:01:36.759> first<00:01:36.970> part<00:01:37.210> of<00:01:37.240> the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
have a strategy the first part of the

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.740 
have a strategy the first part of the
strategy<00:01:37.540> is<00:01:37.840> that<00:01:38.140> for<00:01:38.650> the<00:01:38.680> first<00:01:39.009> 12<00:01:39.430> hours

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
strategy is that for the first 12 hours

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.090 
strategy is that for the first 12 hours
the<00:01:40.750> rule<00:01:41.049> is<00:01:41.080> if<00:01:41.500> you're<00:01:41.740> going<00:01:41.860> to<00:01:41.920> raid

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
the rule is if you're going to raid

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.120 
the rule is if you're going to raid
that's<00:01:42.670> fine<00:01:43.000> if<00:01:43.540> your<00:01:44.049> first<00:01:44.380> raid<00:01:44.680> always

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
that's fine if your first raid always

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.819 
that's fine if your first raid always
has<00:01:45.310> to<00:01:45.430> be<00:01:45.490> plus<00:01:45.850> 3<00:01:46.270> or<00:01:46.659> minus<00:01:47.229> 3<00:01:47.470> from<00:01:47.650> your

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
has to be plus 3 or minus 3 from your

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:50.880 
has to be plus 3 or minus 3 from your
number<00:01:48.009> so<00:01:48.340> for<00:01:48.520> example<00:01:48.579> I'm<00:01:49.060> number<00:01:49.689> 9<00:01:49.869> I<00:01:50.500> i

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
number so for example I'm number 9 I i

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.850 
number so for example I'm number 9 I i
could<00:01:51.250> write<00:01:51.430> from<00:01:51.750> well<00:01:52.750> 7<00:01:53.229> and<00:01:54.220> 6<00:01:54.520> 6<00:01:54.729> to<00:01:54.970> 12<00:01:55.860> so

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
could write from well 7 and 6 6 to 12 so

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.499 
could write from well 7 and 6 6 to 12 so
I<00:01:56.890> could<00:01:57.220> write<00:01:57.369> three<00:01:57.640> above<00:01:57.850> me<00:01:58.000> or<00:01:58.180> three

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
I could write three above me or three
