00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.610

these<00:04:04.489> are<00:04:04.639> wooden<00:04:04.909> skewers<00:04:05.329> what<00:04:06.139> I<00:04:06.170> did<00:04:06.439> was

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
these are wooden skewers what I did was

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.659 
these are wooden skewers what I did was
soak<00:04:06.920> them<00:04:07.129> in<00:04:07.159> water

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:07.669

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:09.889 
what this does is it prevents them from

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:11.679 
what this does is it prevents them from
splintering<00:04:10.669> when<00:04:10.879> you're<00:04:10.999> sliding<00:04:11.239> the<00:04:11.480> meat

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:11.689 
splintering when you're sliding the meat

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:14.500 
splintering when you're sliding the meat
on<00:04:11.870> also<00:04:12.620> it<00:04:13.010> helps<00:04:13.340> from<00:04:13.519> preventing<00:04:14.359> them

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510
