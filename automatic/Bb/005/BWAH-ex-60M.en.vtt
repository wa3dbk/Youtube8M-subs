00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.860
 hello I'm basti of maxfield support 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.750
 Today I'll tell you what you are doing at the 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.050
 using the maxfield wireless charging 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.970
 ipad mini you have to pay attention to 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.890
 pad mini still a usb cable to 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.590
 connection to a power supply and a 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.720
 German short instructions included one 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.410
 detailed instruction manual finds 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.840
 you on our website under 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.270
 www.maxdome.de the pad has a 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.730
 micro usb input to power it 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.589
 supply and an LED display the 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.620
 current status of the device 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:43.239
 In addition, the loading pad signals 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.609
 with an anti slip ring on the 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.829
 Bottom equipped at all 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:49.960
 smooth surfaces like wood or glass 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.679
 plastic a safe stand too 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.079
 grant 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:55.600
 the second rubber ring on the loading area 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.519
 ensures that the smartphone while 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.510
 the charging process is safe and not 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:01.359
 falls 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.010
 in order to start with the loading process 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.839
 her the pad first with the help of 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.280
 attached usb cable to one 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.190
 Connect power source 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.740
 this is a common 240 volts 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.750
 socket for connection to a 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.149
 you need a separate outlet 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.850
 Power supply with at least 1 5 amps 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:20.920
 output voltage whether your power supply the 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.750
 you can fulfill required values 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.600
 Read directly on the adapter 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.039
 for optimal loading, this must be 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.619
 smartphone in the middle of the wireless 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:32.289
 charging ipad mini will be positioned 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.479
 important here is that the receiver 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.240
 in the smartphone in parallel on the transmitter in the 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.369
 Bed please note that at the 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.229
 Nokia Lumia devices the induction coil 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.090
 in the lower part of the smartphone 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.950
 is attached and the device 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.039
 be positioned accordingly higher 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.189
 the LED indicator must show the respective one 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.869
 active status of the pet mini on red 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.509
 indicates the standby mode 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.979
 when placing an inductive charging 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.049
 enabled device on the charging station 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.659
 the display changes to green 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.280
 the flashing signals that one 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.079
 communication between the transmitter and 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.869
 recipient takes place and the 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:10.149
 Loading has started while reaching 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.500
 of 100% battery while the green remains 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.569
 the led flashes 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.350
 However, there is no current flow 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.480
 more instead 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.580
 as soon as the battery loses power 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.700
 starts the energy transfer again 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.170
 and the battery will be charged again 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.870
 completely normal is a heat development 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.610
 at inductive charging battery as well 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.020
 device itself can become during the 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.150
 Charging process heat 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.040
 however, this development is complete 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.850
 harmless and harmless for battery 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.850
 and smartphone
