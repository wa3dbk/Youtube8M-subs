is entertaining if you're just going to

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.720 
is entertaining if you're just going to
sub<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.439> watch<00:00:25.560> these<00:00:25.769> videos<00:00:25.859> i<00:00:26.310> would<00:00:26.580> rather

sub to watch these videos i would rather

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.960 
sub to watch these videos i would rather
you<00:00:27.000> don't<00:00:27.330> sub<00:00:28.490> because<00:00:29.490> there's<00:00:29.640> only<00:00:29.820> going

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
you don't sub because there's only going

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.040 
you don't sub because there's only going
to<00:00:30.029> be<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.179> few<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.420> these<00:00:30.510> because<00:00:30.720> we<00:00:30.869> can<00:00:30.990> only

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
to be a few of these because we can only

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.410 
to be a few of these because we can only
build<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:31.500> much<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.640> like<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.149> front

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
build so much so this is like the front

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.299 
build so much so this is like the front
gate<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.899> Northern<00:00:34.230> Water<00:00:34.290> Tribe<00:00:34.530> sense

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
gate of the Northern Water Tribe sense

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.750 
gate of the Northern Water Tribe sense
or<00:00:35.430> two<00:00:35.520> months<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.090> side<00:00:36.300> big<00:00:36.960> long<00:00:37.170> gate

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
or two months of the side big long gate

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.700 
or two months of the side big long gate
nice<00:00:38.760> enters<00:00:39.059> here<00:00:39.690> we<00:00:39.989> are<00:00:40.110> just<00:00:40.469> building

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
nice enters here we are just building

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.069 
nice enters here we are just building
the<00:00:40.890> gate<00:00:41.550> concept<00:00:42.120> up<00:00:42.649> right<00:00:43.649> now<00:00:44.899> and<00:00:45.899> that

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
the gate concept up right now and that

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.049 
the gate concept up right now and that
is<00:00:46.320> being<00:00:46.590> built<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.250> we<00:00:47.430> just<00:00:47.579> have<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.879> wait

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
is being built so we just have to wait

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.779 
is being built so we just have to wait
until<00:00:48.360> we<00:00:49.200> can<00:00:49.379> get<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.649> done<00:00:49.710> but<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.610> gate

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
until we can get that done but the gate

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.639 
until we can get that done but the gate
concept<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.510> being<00:00:51.750> done<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.350> when<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.530> come

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
concept is being done so when you come

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.889 
concept is being done so when you come
through<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.920> gate<00:00:53.239> you<00:00:54.239> come<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.539> this<00:00:54.629> bit

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
through the gate you come to this bit

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.590 
through the gate you come to this bit
that's<00:00:55.140> like<00:00:55.289> holding<00:00:55.800> tanks<00:00:56.129> for<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.340> water

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
that's like holding tanks for this water

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.779 
that's like holding tanks for this water
because<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.989> series<00:00:58.379> these<00:00:58.680> get<00:00:58.980> Ward<00:00:59.670> to

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
because in the series these get Ward to

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.430 
because in the series these get Ward to
bend<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.059> down<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.449> then<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:00.660> spit<00:01:00.930> fills<00:01:01.170> up

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
bend it down and then this spit fills up

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.869 
bend it down and then this spit fills up
and<00:01:01.620> then<00:01:01.710> they<00:01:01.859> go<00:01:02.010> up<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.280> their<00:01:02.430> boat<00:01:02.640> and

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
and then they go up in their boat and

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.490 
and then they go up in their boat and
then<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:03.510> gate<00:01:03.750> falls<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.290> then<00:01:04.379> they<00:01:04.470> go

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
then this gate falls and then they go

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.780 
then this gate falls and then they go
out<00:01:04.860> onto<00:01:05.129> here<00:01:05.549> into<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.420> actual<00:01:06.689> main<00:01:06.930> bit

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
out onto here into the actual main bit

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.140 
out onto here into the actual main bit
which<00:01:08.790> printer<00:01:09.060> center<00:01:09.330> here<00:01:09.510> now<00:01:10.020> there's

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
which printer center here now there's

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.300 
which printer center here now there's
the<00:01:12.150> houses<00:01:12.570> are<00:01:12.780> set<00:01:13.170> up<00:01:13.409> here<00:01:13.860> right<00:01:14.430> now<00:01:14.640> to

this<00:01:49.560> Bridge<00:01:49.829> here<00:01:49.860> comes<00:01:50.520> up<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.000> onto<00:01:51.329> there

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
this Bridge here comes up and onto there

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.289 
this Bridge here comes up and onto there
and<00:01:52.710> it's<00:01:52.860> very<00:01:53.040> cool<00:01:53.220> looking<00:01:53.729> very<00:01:54.090> nice

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
this first bit it's took of this quite a

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.069 
this first bit it's took of this quite a
while<00:01:56.610> taking<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.149> quality<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.719> this<00:01:57.810> first

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
while taking this quality of this first

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.010 
while taking this quality of this first
bit<00:01:58.290> nice<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.939> these<00:02:00.030> bridges<00:02:00.299> as<00:02:00.630> well<00:02:00.810> go

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
bit nice so these bridges as well go

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.020 
bit nice so these bridges as well go
over<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.380> here<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.310> know<00:02:02.340> up<00:02:02.579> onto<00:02:02.909> this

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
over to here and you know up onto this

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.300 
over to here and you know up onto this
little<00:02:03.479> first<00:02:03.719> bit<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.110> wall<00:02:04.290> low<00:02:05.250> even

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
little first bit of the wall low even

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.570 
little first bit of the wall low even
sure<00:02:05.549> this<00:02:05.790> bit<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.090> wall<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.420> for<00:02:07.580> but

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
sure this bit of the wall is for but

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.230 
sure this bit of the wall is for but
yeah<00:02:08.789> we<00:02:09.750> have<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:09.959> much

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
yeah we have that much

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.290 
yeah we have that much
and<00:02:11.930> I'll<00:02:12.020> see<00:02:12.200> if<00:02:12.980> you<00:02:13.430> see<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.730> picture<00:02:14.090> if

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
and I'll see if you see the picture if

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.460 
and I'll see if you see the picture if
you<00:02:14.390> haven't<00:02:14.600> seen<00:02:14.690> a<00:02:14.720> picture<00:02:14.960> they'll

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
you haven't seen a picture they'll

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.520 
you haven't seen a picture they'll
actually<00:02:15.620> like<00:02:15.890> houses<00:02:16.490> on<00:02:16.730> like<00:02:17.300> three<00:02:17.570> like

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
actually like houses on like three like

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.530 
actually like houses on like three like
to<00:02:18.770> t<00:02:18.980> two<00:02:19.250> or<00:02:19.370> three<00:02:19.550> tiers<00:02:19.790> going<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.120> and

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
to t two or three tiers going to and

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.000 
to t two or three tiers going to and
they<00:02:20.600> look<00:02:20.780> a<00:02:20.870> little<00:02:21.020> bit<00:02:21.260> like<00:02:21.410> this<00:02:21.710> and<00:02:21.980> a

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
they look a little bit like this and a

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.290 
they look a little bit like this and a
little<00:02:22.160> bit<00:02:22.250> different<00:02:22.760> each<00:02:22.880> one<00:02:23.060> of<00:02:23.120> them

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
little bit different each one of them

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.650 
little bit different each one of them
but<00:02:23.900> they're<00:02:24.200> all<00:02:24.350> like<00:02:24.560> mono<00:02:25.070> color<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:26.540> then

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
but they're all like mono color and then

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.120 
but they're all like mono color and then
just<00:02:26.840> well<00:02:27.200> this<00:02:27.350> one<00:02:27.470> hasn't<00:02:27.620> got<00:02:27.890> an<00:02:27.980> actual

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
just well this one hasn't got an actual

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.040 
just well this one hasn't got an actual
floor<00:02:28.580> yet<00:02:28.880> but<00:02:29.120> this<00:02:29.300> was<00:02:29.480> just<00:02:29.720> like<00:02:29.870> my

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
floor yet but this was just like my

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.050 
floor yet but this was just like my
shell<00:02:30.460> designers<00:02:31.460> just<00:02:31.670> having<00:02:31.910> a<00:02:31.970> little

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
shell designers just having a little

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.910 
shell designers just having a little
mess<00:02:32.300> around<00:02:32.450> seeing<00:02:32.960> what<00:02:33.200> could<00:02:33.680> make<00:02:33.770> it

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
mess around seeing what could make it

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.320 
mess around seeing what could make it
look<00:02:34.040> like<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:34.520> well<00:02:34.640> that's<00:02:34.790> why<00:02:35.000> I<00:02:35.030> came<00:02:35.180> up

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
look like and well that's why I came up

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.960 
look like and well that's why I came up
with<00:02:35.480> it<00:02:35.570> for<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:35.840> little<00:02:35.960> shell<00:02:36.200> design<00:02:36.500> and

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
with it for a little shell design and

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.420 
with it for a little shell design and
obviously<00:02:37.970> it<00:02:38.120> goes<00:02:38.210> up<00:02:38.390> on<00:02:38.510> to<00:02:38.720> tears<00:02:39.190> so<00:02:40.190> now

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
obviously it goes up on to tears so now

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.400 
obviously it goes up on to tears so now
then<00:02:40.850> right<00:02:41.300> on<00:02:41.330> this<00:02:41.540> top<00:02:41.750> tier<00:02:41.990> is<00:02:42.140> whether

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
then right on this top tier is whether

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.070 
then right on this top tier is whether
what<00:02:43.070> the<00:02:43.250> temple<00:02:43.670> is<00:02:43.850> going<00:02:44.270> and<00:02:44.540> like

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
what the temple is going and like

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.330 
what the temple is going and like
there's<00:02:45.230> somebody<00:02:45.440> waterbending<00:02:46.160> training

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
there's somebody waterbending training

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.980 
there's somebody waterbending training
school<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:46.910> some<00:02:47.150> other<00:02:47.270> buildings<00:02:47.630> up<00:02:47.780> here

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
school and some other buildings up here

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.840 
school and some other buildings up here
but<00:02:48.500> this<00:02:48.590> is<00:02:48.740> mainly<00:02:49.010> where<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.340> temple<00:02:49.670> goes

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
but this is mainly where the temple goes

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.820 
but this is mainly where the temple goes
right<00:02:50.120> up<00:02:50.240> here<00:02:50.450> so<00:02:50.960> we<00:02:51.200> still<00:02:51.350> have<00:02:51.530> quite<00:02:51.770> a

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
right up here so we still have quite a

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.940 
right up here so we still have quite a
bit<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:52.010> do<00:02:52.780> but<00:02:53.780> um<00:02:53.960> yeah<00:02:54.650> it's<00:02:54.800> looking

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
bit to do but um yeah it's looking

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.490 
bit to do but um yeah it's looking
looking<00:02:55.610> very<00:02:55.880> very<00:02:56.150> very<00:02:56.660> nice<00:02:56.960> in<00:02:57.140> a<00:02:57.230> minute

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
looking very very very nice in a minute

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.170 
looking very very very nice in a minute
we<00:02:57.950> have<00:02:58.070> that<00:02:58.220> bit<00:02:58.370> down<00:02:58.550> there<00:02:58.730> done<00:02:58.940> and

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
we have that bit down there done and

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.350 
we have that bit down there done and
eventually<00:02:59.750> we'll<00:02:59.960> get<00:03:00.140> this<00:03:00.320> other<00:03:00.470> bit<00:03:00.710> done

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
eventually we'll get this other bit done

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.420 
eventually we'll get this other bit done
we've<00:03:02.360> had<00:03:02.540> to<00:03:02.690> remove<00:03:03.080> and<00:03:03.500> create<00:03:04.040> so<00:03:04.280> much

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
we've had to remove and create so much

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.860 
we've had to remove and create so much
different<00:03:04.850> land<00:03:05.060> for<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.450> front<00:03:05.660> of<00:03:05.750> this

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
different land for the front of this

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.420 
different land for the front of this
place<00:03:06.610> so<00:03:07.610> it's<00:03:07.760> been<00:03:07.940> quite<00:03:08.180> a<00:03:08.210> big<00:03:08.510> big<00:03:09.430> well

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
place so it's been quite a big big well

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.320 
place so it's been quite a big big well
this<00:03:10.610> has<00:03:10.730> been<00:03:10.760> probably<00:03:11.000> one<00:03:11.150> of<00:03:11.240> the

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
this has been probably one of the

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.480 
this has been probably one of the
biggest<00:03:11.540> land<00:03:11.930> changes<00:03:12.620> we've<00:03:12.740> had<00:03:12.890> to<00:03:13.010> do<00:03:13.190> for

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
biggest land changes we've had to do for

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.250 
biggest land changes we've had to do for
the<00:03:13.580> whole<00:03:13.730> server<00:03:14.090> to<00:03:14.780> get<00:03:14.900> it<00:03:14.990> to<00:03:15.110> work

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
the whole server to get it to work

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.800 
the whole server to get it to work
properly<00:03:15.640> but<00:03:16.640> the<00:03:16.880> minute<00:03:17.120> work<00:03:17.360> n<00:03:17.480> is<00:03:17.630> well

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
properly but the minute work n is well

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.140 
properly but the minute work n is well
probably<00:03:18.340> while<00:03:19.340> I'm<00:03:19.430> here<00:03:19.580> I<00:03:19.610> wanted<00:03:19.850> to<00:03:19.970> show

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
probably while I'm here I wanted to show

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.230 
probably while I'm here I wanted to show
you<00:03:20.180> this<00:03:20.300> clock<00:03:20.600> concept<00:03:21.340> so<00:03:22.340> this<00:03:22.550> this

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
you this clock concept so this this

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.270 
you this clock concept so this this
clock<00:03:23.570> here<00:03:23.810> is<00:03:24.080> basically<00:03:24.800> going<00:03:24.890> to<00:03:24.950> be<00:03:25.010> in

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
clock here is basically going to be in

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.850 
clock here is basically going to be in
the<00:03:25.430> cabin<00:03:25.820> in<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.420> Republic<00:03:27.380> City<00:03:27.590> which<00:03:27.830> is

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
the cabin in the Republic City which is

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.950 
the cabin in the Republic City which is
a<00:03:28.040> spawn<00:03:28.370> for<00:03:28.640> the<00:03:28.730> server<00:03:29.000> which<00:03:29.690> we<00:03:29.840> haven't

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960 
a spawn for the server which we haven't

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.720 
a spawn for the server which we haven't
died<00:03:30.230> yet<00:03:30.350> and<00:03:30.950> I<00:03:31.040> basically<00:03:31.190> tell<00:03:31.610> the

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
died yet and I basically tell the

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.630 
died yet and I basically tell the
Minecraft<00:03:32.210> time<00:03:32.710> this<00:03:33.710> here<00:03:33.980> is<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.220> gate

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
Minecraft time this here is the gate

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.760 
Minecraft time this here is the gate
concept<00:03:35.120> we're<00:03:35.240> going<00:03:35.390> to<00:03:35.450> use<00:03:35.600> on<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:35.840> front

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.520 

basically<00:03:39.770> follow<00:03:40.010> picks<00:03:40.670> it<00:03:40.850> up<00:03:40.880> and<00:03:41.530> then

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
basically follow picks it up and then

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.050 
basically follow picks it up and then
bring<00:03:42.830> it<00:03:42.920> back<00:03:42.950> down<00:03:43.250> again<00:03:45.700> so<00:03:46.700> yeah<00:03:46.880> that's
