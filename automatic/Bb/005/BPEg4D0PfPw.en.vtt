00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 minimum track shock to the batch of parts 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.799
 with terrace von ah yes abysses of 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.300
 faults year that was beating ms primas 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.300
 shock of powerful lobbies 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.869
 Hello everyone and all of these 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.240
 masters and today we find ourselves 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.160
 for a little tutorial video so a 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.470
 video about how to eat a yogurt 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.050
 so it's simple you need 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.320
 as material a spoon like those 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.690
 here and yogurts any 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.949
 so I already saw the lid because 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.660
 I did not show them brand but 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.400
 otherwise there will be a small tab to 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.170
 pretty much there and you'll just have to 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.449
 shoot will have to hold with the holding 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.589
 but I can not stand the camera anymore 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.290
 so once you've done this 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:52.280
 you will take your spoon 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:54.769
 here is dipped in yogurt and you 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.390
 do not eat the spoon a be not stupid 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.610
 yogurt 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.479
 so after you do it again until 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.640
 than the other terms and so is there in 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.409
 Waiting for us to get that stuff 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.240
 useless 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.820
 I will make you a little and luxury 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.560
 find himself immediately 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.979
 so you guessed it the ellipse is 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.150
 completed but watch out there now and 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.660
 we were almost done like you 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.900
 can see it's pretty special like 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:27.140
 aspect on the camera so that's 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.750
 the most meticulous step of all 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.290
 rather the rest is simple noting that it 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.420
 It's very hard 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.440
 you will need tomorrow so in 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.840
 the occurrence is going to have a little bit of 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:42.050
 badly you will have to up take the pot of 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.310
 yogurt that you have left once 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.770
 you did all that you took the 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.930
 maximum 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.690
 it's the scraping phase so I'm going 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.220
 hold on but jean louis enter 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.810
 but my knees because my legs 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:59.330
 short no stuff you reverse and so 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:06.320
 will confess keys like these you 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:09.349
 pick up look do you remember 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.049
 remove me and so on key evora 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:14.750
 until the others ends up 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:18.520
 speaking of hunger is the end of this tutorial 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.530
 so I hope you enjoyed it and 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.230

 ask again so I also want to 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.220
 clarify again that this is a 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.830
 video of the books did not happen the 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.110
