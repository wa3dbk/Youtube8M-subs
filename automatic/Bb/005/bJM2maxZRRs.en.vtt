00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
to solve problems and so we looked for

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.170 
to solve problems and so we looked for
is

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:00.909 
modified a little bit to look sci-fi so

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.259 
modified a little bit to look sci-fi so
you'll<00:03:01.299> take<00:03:01.510> like<00:03:01.719> a<00:03:01.859> an<00:03:02.859> old<00:03:03.069> German<00:03:03.909> rifle

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
you'll take like a an old German rifle

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.539 
you'll take like a an old German rifle
you<00:03:04.900> know<00:03:05.019> put<00:03:05.230> three<00:03:05.650> or<00:03:05.769> four<00:03:05.920> scopes<00:03:06.189> on<00:03:06.400> it

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
you know put three or four scopes on it

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.839 
you know put three or four scopes on it
and<00:03:06.730> there<00:03:07.540> you<00:03:07.629> have<00:03:07.689> your<00:03:07.780> storm<00:03:08.319> trooper

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
and there you have your storm trooper

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.460 
and there you have your storm trooper
rifle<00:03:09.849> but<00:03:10.150> really<00:03:10.389> we've<00:03:10.750> gone<00:03:11.319> a<00:03:11.349> lot

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
rifle but really we've gone a lot

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.710 
rifle but really we've gone a lot
further<00:03:11.530> than<00:03:11.769> that<00:03:12.099> and<00:03:12.280> given<00:03:13.000> our<00:03:13.239> trooper

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
further than that and given our trooper

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.679 
further than that and given our trooper
some<00:03:14.290> really<00:03:14.500> awesome<00:03:14.950> weapons<00:03:15.689> technology

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:16.689 
some really awesome weapons technology

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:18.270 
some really awesome weapons technology
is<00:03:16.780> obviously<00:03:17.049> a<00:03:17.109> big<00:03:17.230> part<00:03:17.500> of<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.980> trooper

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
is obviously a big part of the trooper

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.409 
is obviously a big part of the trooper
is<00:03:18.310> and<00:03:18.639> how<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:18.819> trooper<00:03:19.090> does<00:03:19.239> his<00:03:19.389> job

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:19.419 
is and how the trooper does his job

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:21.240 
is and how the trooper does his job

like<00:04:25.030> this<00:04:25.240> is<00:04:25.419> heavy<00:04:25.630> but<00:04:25.930> that<00:04:26.470> was<00:04:26.560> perfect

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:27.009 
like this is heavy but that was perfect

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:30.300 
like this is heavy but that was perfect
because<00:04:27.130> it<00:04:28.090> shows<00:04:28.630> how<00:04:29.020> heavy<00:04:29.380> something<00:04:30.039> can

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.719 
because it shows how heavy something can
be

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729
