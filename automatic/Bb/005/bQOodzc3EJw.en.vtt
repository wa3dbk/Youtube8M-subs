00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
remove any of my other makeup like if I

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.650

lip<00:00:38.190> stuff<00:00:38.489> on<00:00:38.670> or<00:00:38.910> anything<00:00:39.000> on<00:00:39.329> my<00:00:39.450> face

lip stuff on or anything on my face

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.420 
lip stuff on or anything on my face
because<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:40.200> always<00:00:40.469> felt<00:00:40.620> like<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:41.100> does

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
because I always felt like this does

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.160 
because I always felt like this does
that<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.850> washes<00:00:42.329> away<00:00:42.360> everything<00:00:42.899> I

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
that it washes away everything I

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.740 
that it washes away everything I
actually<00:00:43.410> don't<00:00:43.980> use<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.640> other<00:00:44.760> two<00:00:45.210> steps

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
actually don't use the other two steps

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.750 
actually don't use the other two steps
in<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.170> proactive<00:00:46.770> system<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.399> think<00:00:47.670> it's

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
in the proactive system I think it's

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.670 
in the proactive system I think it's
like<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.879> toner<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.570> lotion<00:00:48.750> or<00:00:49.170> moisturizer

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
like a toner and a lotion or moisturizer

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.950 
like a toner and a lotion or moisturizer
I<00:00:50.039> just<00:00:50.520> used<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.910> cleanser<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.690> works

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
I just used the cleanser and it works

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.840 
I just used the cleanser and it works
great<00:00:52.140> for<00:00:52.410> me<00:00:52.649> when<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.039> was<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.280> teenager<00:00:53.489> I
