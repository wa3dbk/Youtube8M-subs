00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
the H&amp;R project mainly because the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.479 
the H&amp;R project mainly because the
history<00:00:44.460> behind<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:45.089> is<00:00:46.160> Marlin<00:00:47.160> doesn't

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
history behind this is Marlin doesn't

them now and any parts that you would
ever<00:00:51.629> need<00:00:51.900> for<00:00:52.110> one<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.440> these<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.860> would

ever need for one of these you would
purchase<00:00:53.339> from<00:00:53.670> $8<00:00:54.239> like<00:00:55.080> I<00:00:55.229> talked<00:00:55.500> about<00:00:55.589> in

purchase from $8 like I talked about in

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.340 
purchase from $8 like I talked about in
the<00:00:55.920> basic<00:00:56.280> disassembly<00:00:56.970> video<00:00:57.269> this<00:00:58.080> would

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
the basic disassembly video this would

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.060 
the basic disassembly video this would
be<00:00:58.470> compared<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.339> H&amp;R<00:01:00.110> top<00:01:01.110> or<00:01:01.379> face<00:01:01.769> it

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
be compared to the H&amp;R top or face it

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.640 
be compared to the H&amp;R top or face it
alright<00:01:02.690> but<00:01:03.690> for<00:01:03.960> all<00:01:04.080> intents<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.559> purposes

and I don't know if you'll be able to
see<00:02:38.730> it<00:02:38.850> or<00:02:38.940> not<00:02:39.060> through<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.450> camera<00:02:39.870> but<00:02:40.200> the

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
see it or not through the camera but the

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.759 
see it or not through the camera but the
inside<00:02:40.739> of<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.070> is<00:02:41.190> actually<00:02:41.730> rifled<00:02:42.269> so<00:02:43.019> I

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
inside of it is actually rifled so I

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.520 
inside of it is actually rifled so I
think<00:02:44.519> the<00:02:44.790> equivalent<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.570> this<00:02:45.750> would<00:02:46.050> be<00:02:46.080> I

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
think the equivalent to this would be I

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.470 
think the equivalent to this would be I
was<00:02:46.830> kind<00:02:47.010> of<00:02:47.070> skeptical<00:02:47.430> about<00:02:47.760> it<00:02:47.970> but<00:02:48.450> I

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
was kind of skeptical about it but I

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.870 
was kind of skeptical about it but I
think<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.840> equivalent<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:49.880> would

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
think the equivalent to it would

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.540 
think the equivalent to it would
actually<00:02:51.120> be<00:02:51.630> that<00:02:52.260> of<00:02:52.470> maybe<00:02:52.709> a<00:02:52.830> little<00:02:52.950> short

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
actually be that of maybe a little short

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.890 
actually be that of maybe a little short
stuff<00:02:54.030> those<00:02:55.220> 22<00:02:56.220> long-rifle<00:02:56.570> revolver<00:02:57.570> or

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
stuff those 22 long-rifle revolver or

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.630 
stuff those 22 long-rifle revolver or
something<00:02:58.260> like<00:02:58.410> that<00:02:58.470> but<00:02:59.220> we're<00:02:59.370> gonna<00:02:59.459> go

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
something like that but we're gonna go

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.759 
something like that but we're gonna go
ahead<00:02:59.760> and<00:02:59.880> try<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.090> out<00:03:00.300> it<00:03:00.989> fits<00:03:01.320> into<00:03:01.560> the

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
ahead and try it out it fits into the

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.600 
ahead and try it out it fits into the
gun<00:03:01.950> just<00:03:02.250> like<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.459> shotgun<00:03:02.850> shell<00:03:04.610> slides

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
gun just like a shotgun shell slides

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.820 
gun just like a shotgun shell slides
right<00:03:05.880> into<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:06.480> end<00:03:07.019> of<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.200> chamber<00:03:07.620> just

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
right into the end of the chamber just

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.490 
right into the end of the chamber just
like<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.880> comes<00:03:09.090> with<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.330> little<00:03:09.570> rod<00:03:09.900> so

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
like that it comes with a little rod so

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.850 
like that it comes with a little rod so
that<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:10.829> can<00:03:11.010> knock<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.640> 22<00:03:12.650> casing<00:03:13.650> out

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
that you can knock the 22 casing out

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.030 
that you can knock the 22 casing out
afterwards<00:03:15.290> this<00:03:16.290> is<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.500> first<00:03:16.709> time<00:03:16.890> I've

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
afterwards this is the first time I've

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.910 
afterwards this is the first time I've
shot<00:03:17.070> it<00:03:17.549> so<00:03:18.230> we're<00:03:19.230> gonna<00:03:19.320> go<00:03:19.500> ahead<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:19.739> do<00:03:19.890> a

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
shot it so we're gonna go ahead and do a

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.620 
shot it so we're gonna go ahead and do a
little<00:03:20.130> bit<00:03:20.340> of<00:03:20.459> a<00:03:20.549> review<00:03:20.700> on<00:03:21.090> it<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.329> see<00:03:21.480> how

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
little bit of a review on it and see how

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.140 
little bit of a review on it and see how
it<00:03:21.780> does<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.380> see<00:03:23.100> what<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.340> accuracy<00:03:23.940> looks

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
it does and see what the accuracy looks

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.330 
it does and see what the accuracy looks
like<00:03:24.299> on<00:03:24.510> it<00:03:24.660> see<00:03:24.840> you<00:03:24.900> know<00:03:24.989> how<00:03:25.739> it<00:03:25.829> functions

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
like on it see you know how it functions

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.300 
like on it see you know how it functions
so<00:03:27.090> I've<00:03:27.600> got<00:03:27.780> a<00:03:27.810> target<00:03:28.140> set<00:03:28.500> up<00:03:28.680> probably<00:03:29.220> at

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
so I've got a target set up probably at

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.920 
so I've got a target set up probably at
about<00:03:30.980> probably<00:03:31.980> about<00:03:32.040> 25<00:03:32.730> 30<00:03:33.090> feet<00:03:33.360> maybe<00:03:33.840> a

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
about probably about 25 30 feet maybe a

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.750 
about probably about 25 30 feet maybe a
little<00:03:34.079> bit<00:03:34.260> further<00:03:34.500> than<00:03:34.680> that<00:03:34.739> so<00:03:35.700> I'm

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
little bit further than that so I'm

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.940 
little bit further than that so I'm
gonna<00:03:35.850> do<00:03:35.970> is<00:03:36.090> go<00:03:36.209> ahead<00:03:36.269> and<00:03:36.450> load<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.780> 22

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
gonna do is go ahead and load the 22

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.600 
gonna do is go ahead and load the 22
the<00:03:39.970> action<00:03:40.970> and<00:03:41.930> clones<00:03:42.320> it<00:03:42.590> just<00:03:43.460> like

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
the action and clones it just like

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:53.190 
the action and clones it just like
normal<00:03:43.930> and<00:03:44.930> we'll<00:03:45.200> see<00:03:45.410> how<00:03:45.560> it<00:03:45.710> does

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.190 

well<00:03:54.200> I<00:03:54.290> will<00:03:54.560> eject<00:03:55.040> out<00:03:55.249> of<00:03:55.780> out<00:03:56.780> of<00:03:56.840> the

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
well I will eject out of out of the

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.050 
well I will eject out of out of the
chamber<00:03:57.650> of<00:03:57.709> the<00:03:57.859> shotgun<00:03:58.129> just<00:03:58.849> like<00:03:59.030> a

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
chamber of the shotgun just like a

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.209 
chamber of the shotgun just like a
normal<00:03:59.329> shotgun<00:03:59.959> shell<00:04:00.230> would<00:04:00.469> and<00:04:01.129> I

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:01.219 
normal shotgun shell would and I

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:03.069 
normal shotgun shell would and I
actually<00:04:01.430> didn't<00:04:02.150> have<00:04:02.269> to<00:04:02.389> use<00:04:02.540> the<00:04:02.719> rod<00:04:02.900> on

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
actually didn't have to use the rod on

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.099 
actually didn't have to use the rod on
that<00:04:03.260> when<00:04:03.409> he<00:04:03.499> came<00:04:03.709> right<00:04:03.950> out<00:04:04.629> the<00:04:05.629> casing

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.109 
that when he came right out the casing

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:08.289 
that when he came right out the casing
would<00:04:06.340> so<00:04:07.340> go<00:04:07.519> ahead<00:04:07.579> and<00:04:07.730> load<00:04:07.819> another<00:04:08.120> one

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
would so go ahead and load another one

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.149 
would so go ahead and load another one
I'm<00:04:08.540> gonna<00:04:08.689> pump<00:04:08.900> few<00:04:09.260> shots<00:04:09.500> at<00:04:09.829> it<00:04:09.859> and<00:04:10.040> see

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:10.159 
I'm gonna pump few shots at it and see

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:50.650 
I'm gonna pump few shots at it and see
what<00:04:10.310> our<00:04:10.400> grouping<00:04:10.790> looks<00:04:11.000> like

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.350 

alright<00:04:51.660> guys<00:04:51.780> so<00:04:51.889> you<00:04:52.889> can<00:04:53.070> see<00:04:53.340> we're<00:04:54.210> not

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
alright guys so you can see we're not

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.780 
alright guys so you can see we're not
gonna<00:04:54.510> win<00:04:54.780> any<00:04:54.990> bullseye<00:04:55.560> competitions<00:04:56.520> with

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
gonna win any bullseye competitions with

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.409 
gonna win any bullseye competitions with
this<00:04:57.240> particular<00:04:58.020> tumbling<00:04:58.740> and<00:04:59.180> that<00:05:00.180> could

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
this particular tumbling and that could

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.930 
this particular tumbling and that could
very<00:05:00.630> well<00:05:00.690> be<00:05:00.870> possible<00:05:01.020> even<00:05:01.919> at<00:05:02.040> 25<00:05:02.370> or<00:05:02.550> 30

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
very well be possible even at 25 or 30

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.460 
very well be possible even at 25 or 30
feet<00:05:03.030> with<00:05:03.479> such<00:05:03.690> a<00:05:03.720> short<00:05:04.220> rifled<00:05:05.220> section<00:05:06.030> of

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
feet with such a short rifled section of

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.230 
feet with such a short rifled section of
rifling<00:05:07.470> in<00:05:07.650> that<00:05:08.010> a<00:05:08.040> doubt<00:05:08.490> one<00:05:08.729> in<00:05:08.910> the<00:05:09.000> Bulls

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
rifling in that a doubt one in the Bulls

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.530 
rifling in that a doubt one in the Bulls
on<00:05:09.860> one<00:05:10.860> here<00:05:11.280> and<00:05:11.490> then<00:05:11.820> some<00:05:12.030> over<00:05:12.330> here

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
on one here and then some over here

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.000 
on one here and then some over here
looks<00:05:12.840> like<00:05:12.930> it's<00:05:13.199> shooting<00:05:13.470> to<00:05:13.650> the<00:05:13.770> right<00:05:13.979> a

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
looks like it's shooting to the right a

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.600 
looks like it's shooting to the right a
little<00:05:14.310> bit

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
little bit

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.350 
little bit
and<00:05:15.500> like<00:05:16.500> I<00:05:16.530> said<00:05:16.830> I<00:05:16.860> was<00:05:17.070> only<00:05:17.190> at<00:05:17.370> 25<00:05:17.910> or<00:05:17.940> 30

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
and like I said I was only at 25 or 30

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.090 
and like I said I was only at 25 or 30
feet<00:05:18.449> and<00:05:18.900> I<00:05:18.930> know<00:05:19.080> I'm<00:05:19.229> not<00:05:19.380> that<00:05:19.590> bad<00:05:19.830> of<00:05:19.889> a

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
feet and I know I'm not that bad of a

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.450 
feet and I know I'm not that bad of a
shot<00:05:20.340> so<00:05:20.850> I<00:05:21.660> would<00:05:22.080> say<00:05:22.290> that<00:05:22.530> accuracy<00:05:23.100> it's

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
shot so I would say that accuracy it's

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.650 
shot so I would say that accuracy it's
pretty<00:05:23.820> poor<00:05:24.710> but<00:05:25.820> what<00:05:26.820> do<00:05:26.880> you<00:05:26.970> expect<00:05:27.060> with

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
pretty poor but what do you expect with

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.650 
pretty poor but what do you expect with
a<00:05:27.740> two<00:05:28.740> and<00:05:28.919> a<00:05:28.950> half<00:05:29.160> inch<00:05:29.430> rifling<00:05:30.360> if<00:05:30.570> that<00:05:30.900> so

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
a two and a half inch rifling if that so

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.200 
a two and a half inch rifling if that so
maybe<00:05:33.660> for<00:05:33.990> a<00:05:34.050> short<00:05:34.710> short<00:05:35.220> distance<00:05:35.820> hunting

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
maybe for a short short distance hunting

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.510 
maybe for a short short distance hunting
in<00:05:36.330> a<00:05:36.360> survival<00:05:36.780> situation<00:05:37.110> or<00:05:37.710> something<00:05:37.889> it

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
in a survival situation or something it

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.480 
in a survival situation or something it
would<00:05:38.669> come<00:05:38.850> in<00:05:39.000> handy<00:05:39.210> to<00:05:39.510> have<00:05:39.979> but<00:05:40.979> like<00:05:41.280> I

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
would come in handy to have but like I

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.250 
would come in handy to have but like I
said<00:05:41.550> not<00:05:41.970> going<00:05:42.150> to<00:05:42.210> win<00:05:42.360> any<00:05:42.539> competitions

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
said not going to win any competitions

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.320 
said not going to win any competitions
bulls<00:05:43.560> under<00:05:43.889> cost<00:05:44.100> you<00:05:44.310> about<00:05:44.430> 20<00:05:44.910> dollars<00:05:45.300> or

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
bulls under cost you about 20 dollars or

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.320 
bulls under cost you about 20 dollars or
so<00:05:46.070> like<00:05:47.070> I<00:05:47.190> said<00:05:47.340> overall<00:05:47.850> I<00:05:47.880> think<00:05:48.090> it<00:05:48.240> would

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
so like I said overall I think it would

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.330 
so like I said overall I think it would
be<00:05:48.449> good<00:05:48.630> for<00:05:48.870> some<00:05:49.080> short<00:05:49.320> distance<00:05:49.949> hunting

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
be good for some short distance hunting

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.990 
be good for some short distance hunting
in<00:05:50.490> a<00:05:50.520> survival<00:05:51.060> situation<00:05:51.410> but<00:05:52.729> out<00:05:53.729> in

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
in a survival situation but out in

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.730 
in a survival situation but out in
target<00:05:54.419> shooting<00:05:54.660> world<00:05:54.960> I<00:05:55.169> don't<00:05:55.410> think<00:05:55.620> it's

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
target shooting world I don't think it's

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.990 
target shooting world I don't think it's
going<00:05:55.919> to<00:05:55.979> be<00:05:57.350> worth<00:05:58.350> the<00:05:58.560> effort<00:05:58.710> but<00:05:59.669> anyway

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
going to be worth the effort but anyway

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.450 
going to be worth the effort but anyway
