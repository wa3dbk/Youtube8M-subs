length of shaft that was hanging off the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.590 
length of shaft that was hanging off the

to be some moving around hacked it off
cleaned<00:01:04.190> it<00:01:04.280> up<00:01:04.460> taking<00:01:05.149> through<00:01:05.300> the<00:01:05.390> bearing

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750

back here on the back axle alright one

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.940 
back here on the back axle alright one
of<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:17.479> other<00:01:17.630> things<00:01:17.869> I<00:01:18.080> was<00:01:18.200> able<00:01:18.320> to<00:01:18.500> do<00:01:18.680> was

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
transmission if you remember correctly

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.380 
transmission if you remember correctly
the<00:01:25.640> last<00:01:25.670> video<00:01:26.619> there<00:01:27.619> was<00:01:27.740> just<00:01:27.979> a<00:01:28.070> shaft

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.859 

that<00:01:32.390> came<00:01:32.659> came<00:01:33.200> out<00:01:33.380> of<00:01:33.470> this<00:01:33.590> back<00:01:34.869> these

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
that came came out of this back these

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.929 
that came came out of this back these
back<00:01:36.110> gears<00:01:36.470> I<00:01:36.650> think<00:01:36.799> it<00:01:36.920> hamp<00:01:37.130> you<00:01:37.549> know<00:01:37.760> hung

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
back gears I think it hamp you know hung

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.980 
back gears I think it hamp you know hung
out<00:01:38.119> probably<00:01:38.270> that<00:01:38.600> far<00:01:39.100> cut<00:01:40.100> it<00:01:40.280> off<00:01:40.659> Sam<00:01:41.659> you

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
out probably that far cut it off Sam you

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.260 
out probably that far cut it off Sam you
know<00:01:42.080> ground<00:01:42.650> it<00:01:42.860> back<00:01:43.070> drilled<00:01:44.030> and<00:01:44.210> tapped

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
know ground it back drilled and tapped

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.960 
know ground it back drilled and tapped
it<00:01:45.040> then<00:01:46.040> I<00:01:46.159> actually<00:01:46.280> just<00:01:46.580> took<00:01:46.760> some

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
it then I actually just took some

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.460 
it then I actually just took some
washers<00:01:47.450> and<00:01:49.420> made<00:01:50.420> a<00:01:50.450> little<00:01:50.750> spacer<00:01:51.170> tacked

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
washers and made a little spacer tacked

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.800 
washers and made a little spacer tacked
in<00:01:51.680> sides<00:01:52.040> for<00:01:52.400> right<00:01:52.520> now<00:01:52.659> made<00:01:53.659> a<00:01:53.689> little

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
in sides for right now made a little

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.480 
in sides for right now made a little
spacer<00:01:54.380> and<00:01:57.400> basically<00:01:58.400> this<00:01:59.170> bolts<00:02:00.170> on

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
spacer and basically this bolts on

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.920 
spacer and basically this bolts on
through<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:01.640> axle<00:02:02.090> and<00:02:02.150> kind<00:02:02.450> of<00:02:02.540> retains

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
through the axle and kind of retains

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.510 
through the axle and kind of retains
these<00:02:03.799> gears<00:02:04.189> the<00:02:05.030> fronts<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.479> same<00:02:05.720> way<00:02:06.520> so

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
these gears the fronts the same way so

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.030 
these gears the fronts the same way so
it<00:02:07.579> just<00:02:07.729> made<00:02:07.880> a<00:02:07.909> same<00:02:08.690> use<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.290> same<00:02:09.530> washers

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
it just made a same use the same washers

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.440 
it just made a same use the same washers
made<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.369> same<00:02:10.600> same<00:02:11.600> setup<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.739> it<00:02:12.860> bolts<00:02:13.190> on

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
made the same same setup and it bolts on

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.800 
made the same same setup and it bolts on
so<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:15.079> primary<00:02:15.350> setup<00:02:16.010> is<00:02:16.810> completely

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
so the primary setup is completely

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.100 
so the primary setup is completely
finished<00:02:18.079> except<00:02:18.620> for<00:02:18.769> the<00:02:18.860> finished<00:02:19.160> welding

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.280 

up<00:02:24.110> front<00:02:24.500> here<00:02:24.739> I<00:02:24.769> was<00:02:25.040> able<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:26.079> get<00:02:27.079> the

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
up front here I was able to get the

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.069 
up front here I was able to get the
footpegs<00:02:27.799> welded<00:02:28.310> on<00:02:28.459> or<00:02:28.669> just<00:02:28.700> tacked<00:02:29.120> on<00:02:29.359> you

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
footpegs welded on or just tacked on you

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:31.390 
footpegs welded on or just tacked on you
can<00:02:30.200> see<00:02:30.350> they<00:02:30.470> got<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:30.650> little<00:02:30.799> bit<00:02:30.950> of<00:02:31.040> angle

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
can see they got a little bit of angle

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.030 
can see they got a little bit of angle
to<00:02:31.549> them

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
to them

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.130 
to them
I've<00:02:32.490> got<00:02:32.700> both<00:02:32.880> sides<00:02:33.150> on<00:02:33.480> they<00:02:33.690> pretty<00:02:33.990> much

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
I've got both sides on they pretty much

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.190 
I've got both sides on they pretty much
the<00:02:34.410> same<00:02:35.420> shorten<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.480> length<00:02:36.630> I'm<00:02:36.870> just<00:02:37.110> a

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
the same shorten the length I'm just a

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.710 
the same shorten the length I'm just a
little<00:02:37.319> bit<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:37.819> she's<00:02:38.819> got<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.000> mocked<00:02:39.300> up<00:02:39.540> so

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
little bit and she's got a mocked up so

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.589 
little bit and she's got a mocked up so
we<00:02:39.780> can<00:02:39.900> see<00:02:40.080> what<00:02:40.170> they<00:02:40.260> look<00:02:40.290> like<00:02:40.500> and

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
actually sit on the bike to suit they

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.000 
actually sit on the bike to suit they
feel<00:02:43.860> like<00:02:44.690> hopefully<00:02:45.690> not<00:02:46.230> really<00:02:46.530> sure<00:02:46.800> yet

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010

hopefully we have some kind of front
controls<00:02:49.230> maybe<00:02:49.500> may<00:02:50.400> operate<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.880> brake

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
controls maybe may operate the brake

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.800 
up top that's the masked cylinder so
they<00:03:07.110> put<00:03:07.350> it<00:03:07.470> back<00:03:07.650> in<00:03:07.830> here<00:03:08.010> somewhere
