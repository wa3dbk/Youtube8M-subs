the<00:00:39.500> car<00:00:39.710> and<00:00:40.010> it<00:00:40.579> saves<00:00:40.790> me<00:00:40.970> some<00:00:41.120> time<00:00:41.390> and

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
the car and it saves me some time and

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.850

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
you know gets my chops in shape to play

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.410 
you know gets my chops in shape to play
without<00:00:45.860> having<00:00:46.340> to<00:00:46.430> pull<00:00:46.610> the<00:00:46.730> entire<00:00:46.880> horn

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
without having to pull the entire horn

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.470 
without having to pull the entire horn
out<00:00:47.600> because<00:00:48.190> it'd<00:00:49.190> be<00:00:49.430> rather<00:00:49.670> restrictive

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
out because it'd be rather restrictive

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.420 
out because it'd be rather restrictive
in<00:00:50.630> the<00:00:50.720> car<00:00:50.930> so<00:00:51.290> instead<00:00:52.100> I<00:00:52.160> get<00:00:52.370> the

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
in the car so instead I get the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:01:30.010 
in the car so instead I get the
mouthpiece<00:00:52.820> out<00:00:52.970> and<00:00:53.180> do<00:00:53.270> this

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.740 

so<00:01:30.590> as<00:01:30.710> you<00:01:30.860> can<00:01:30.979> hear<00:01:31.040> it's<00:01:31.520> an<00:01:31.759> incredibly

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
so as you can hear it's an incredibly

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.050 
so as you can hear it's an incredibly
annoying<00:01:33.200> sound<00:01:33.710> so<00:01:34.040> I<00:01:34.280> really<00:01:34.880> don't

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
annoying sound so I really don't

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.620 
annoying sound so I really don't
recommend<00:01:35.360> doing<00:01:35.720> this<00:01:35.899> in<00:01:36.079> the<00:01:36.200> car<00:01:36.439> with

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
recommend doing this in the car with

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.820 
recommend doing this in the car with
family<00:01:38.630> members<00:01:38.780> or<00:01:39.140> friends<00:01:39.290> in<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:39.619> car

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
family members or friends in the car

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.149 
family members or friends in the car
because<00:01:40.189> they<00:01:40.460> will<00:01:40.970> probably<00:01:41.830> hit<00:01:42.830> you<00:01:43.039> over

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
because they will probably hit you over

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.279 
because they will probably hit you over
the<00:01:43.280> head<00:01:43.399> or<00:01:43.850> you<00:01:44.539> know<00:01:44.630> do<00:01:44.810> something<00:01:45.200> to

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
the head or you know do something to

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.310 
the head or you know do something to
that<00:01:45.470> of<00:01:45.860> that<00:01:46.070> nature<00:01:46.659> unless<00:01:47.659> you<00:01:47.869> you<00:01:48.229> know

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
that of that nature unless you you know

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.230 
that of that nature unless you you know
have<00:01:48.590> brothers<00:01:49.159> or<00:01:49.189> sisters<00:01:49.429> that<00:01:49.820> you<00:01:49.850> really

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
have brothers or sisters that you really

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.090 
have brothers or sisters that you really
want<00:01:50.420> to<00:01:50.479> annoy<00:01:50.780> and<00:01:51.110> even<00:01:51.590> then<00:01:51.740> I<00:01:51.860> wouldn't

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
want to annoy and even then I wouldn't

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.380 
want to annoy and even then I wouldn't
recommend<00:01:52.340> it<00:01:52.580> because<00:01:52.700> your<00:01:52.939> mom<00:01:53.179> or<00:01:53.360> dad

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
recommend it because your mom or dad

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.660 
recommend it because your mom or dad
would<00:01:53.869> definitely<00:01:54.409> ground<00:01:54.950> you<00:01:55.189> for<00:01:55.399> doing

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
would definitely ground you for doing

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.399 
would definitely ground you for doing
that<00:01:55.700> but<00:01:56.539> it's<00:01:56.689> really<00:01:56.780> good<00:01:57.110> for<00:01:57.140> that<00:01:57.289> kind

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409
