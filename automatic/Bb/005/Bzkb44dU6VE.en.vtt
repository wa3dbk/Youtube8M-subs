00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.529
 Hello hello we welcome here 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.289
 when a video tutorials from today 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:21.000
 tutorial I want to give you a new light 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.710
 Imagine what I have in the studio 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.560
 and a hang lightning in the beginning 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.099
 was a very brief definition was 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.340
 Flash light is very often confused 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.989
 everything you see here the 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.660
 most urgent right do that belongs 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.260
 times to this rule you are here 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:48.660
 A neon ring is a circular neon 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:52.140
 bring and these rings shine the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.000
 magic next to these ring-shaped eyes 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.420
 reflex of the many like it in the 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.420
 eyes 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.180
 important is when the ring judge bought 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.650
 I hide smooth times a few pictures a 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.700
 with this effect can see very nice 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.549
 important here is a ringing with 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.979
 a big diameter to buy that 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.909
 Here is one with 65 watts diameter 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.100
 accordingly large 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.290
 and only if the diameter is so big 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.720
 Do you have the chance to enter here? 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.159
 annular eyes reflex trains me 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.750
 have to the theme ring is already running 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.640
 you are welcome to tutorial online 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.220
 look a bit older can 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.680
 just look again but around 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.470
 the light is nothing to you 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:39.540
 lightning the ring I 've got it for 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:42.420
 author dan lin bay discovery 1200 and for 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.909
 There is not only this discovery 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.390
 normal lightning heads to buy but it 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.880
 There are also ring flashes and what is in 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.420
 rain lightning in comparison a light 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.159
 is also an annular light source 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.630
 but much smaller 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.220
 that means we have one here 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.260
 ring-shaped lightning receiver in it 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.530
 and the special feature is that the chamber 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.640
 in this ring a lightning bolt is mounted 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.550
 So I think so very briefly 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.670
 I show my camera so be in here 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.530
 the opening in the middle and 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.930
 then screw up here over the city 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:27.120
 deep screw here the camera with the 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:32.000
 complete flash and then have your time 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:34.500
 a unit of lightning and camera 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.780
 whoever is watching my tutorials will be 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.130
 look a bit skeptical and 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.990
 consider mr normally 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.880
 tells the man to sparkle unleashed 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.640
 more should the flash from the camera 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.280
 bring a nice beautiful light 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.690
 to have a course in the picture 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.870
 We do not have all of that here now 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.700
 have a life light right out of the 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.770
 Objective axis come that is we 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.780
 have a completely flat 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.700
 illumination 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.140
 Nevertheless, this light is a very 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.070
 exciting light especially in the 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.620
 fashion photography and during charles 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.450
 knows who knows I like it a lot 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.790
 bit harder as far as the light goes 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.980
 there is also a diffuser here 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.510
 I'm doing a spotless clean here 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.980
 It may make the light a bit 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.860
 softer still it is with the always 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.150
 still relatively hard on the 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.709
 I see pictures have a shooting 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.350
 made a latex shooting 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.810
 Of course, this fits very directly 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.459
 light very good for that I have with 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.260
 shot this diffuse 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.080
 you only have the problem but now how 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.320
 I 'm the 85 erfurt sigma that's mine 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.260
 always objective in the studio and there 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.720
 it is already relatively tight, go here 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.250
 because to give the feet of the objective 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.400
 It takes a little bit 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.450
 found 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.810
 that's why it does not just do it here 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.400
 top wines take who can because rings 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.750
 but without problems even without this 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.010
 use diffuser then it is not 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.720
 once more crass and yes it is 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.590
 a surface illumination that's that 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.380
 is quite right 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.120
 but we have a brightness drop 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.600
 from the front to the back that creates too 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.930
 again a bit deep in the picture and 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.750
 in that the lightning is much bigger 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.430
 is for example aufsteckblitz 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.440
 Built-in lightning is the light quality 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.970
 still a different one than I like 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.080
 I really like the look 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.530
 now with the time 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.580
 I'm experimenting a lot 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.800
 excited about it 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.170
 you just have to do two things while working 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.480
 note 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:37.040
 Either I measure light and 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.430
 then always stay in the same distance 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:43.640
 from my model or I change 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:48.169
 permanently my light intensity here from 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:50.930
 lightning because the lightning intensity changes 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.790
 of course because I am with mine 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.950
 lightning move together that is if 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.750
 I for my model to ge 23 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.190
 photograph is at once a bright 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.470
 because I take with you lightning automatically 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.480
 I am also on the model of it I go on 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.850
 away to dark that means I have to go in 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.740
 actually works constantly 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.990
 I can also regulate on the 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.330
 on the other hand, if I'm on for example 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.150
 location photograph hotel room 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.070
 shooting for example then i can 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.540
 really go to a model around 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.940
 as long as I'm always the same distance 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:24.500
 the exposure always remains 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.610
 correct always exciting and i have 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.990
 Now here are a very small 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.300
 Guilty so far I'll do it 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.500
 I'm always told on 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.600
 location try the war of 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.190
 to see pictures 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.900
 Now here's a first impression me 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.520
 am very pleased with the light of the 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.240
 last certainty on the one study 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.790
 give it 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.010
 and now just have a look 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:45.500
 bit to blinding you then at the end 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:49.130
 as always the result pictures 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.660
 if you have any questions, please contact me 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:55.310
 Place is here I get that 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:57.770
 from foto tomorrow and he should others 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.229
 are asking writes me writes 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:04.540
 to the video and otherwise I hope 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:04.540
 we'll meet again in two weeks
