00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
and start with these attachments there

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.730 
and start with these attachments there
is<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.650> red<00:00:25.980> dot<00:00:26.340> sight<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:27.300> silencer<00:00:28.019> the

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
is the red dot sight the silencer the

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.740 
is the red dot sight the silencer the
grenade<00:00:29.130> launcher<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.880> know<00:00:30.119> it's<00:00:30.480> kind<00:00:30.689> of

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
grenade launcher I know it's kind of

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.359 
grenade launcher I know it's kind of
upsetting<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.349> that's<00:00:31.560> back<00:00:31.800> for<00:00:32.040> some<00:00:32.219> of

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
upsetting that that's back for some of

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.299 
upsetting that that's back for some of
you<00:00:32.489> but<00:00:32.669> if<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.510> think<00:00:33.809> about<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.140> just<00:00:34.559> just

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
you but if you think about it just just

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.850 
you but if you think about it just just
think<00:00:35.550> broad<00:00:36.170> grenade<00:00:37.170> launchers<00:00:37.680> are

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
think broad grenade launchers are

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.459 
think broad grenade launchers are
frustrating<00:00:38.610> but<00:00:38.879> they're<00:00:39.120> also<00:00:39.270> fun<00:00:39.899> like

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
frustrating but they're also fun like

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.709 
frustrating but they're also fun like
part<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.100> game<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.550> have<00:00:41.700> fun<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.450> you

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
part of the game is to have fun and you

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.319 
part of the game is to have fun and you
got<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.320> admit<00:00:43.620> sometimes<00:00:44.070> it's<00:00:44.640> fun<00:00:44.879> but

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
got to admit sometimes it's fun but

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.600 
got to admit sometimes it's fun but
majority<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.500> time<00:00:46.649> it's<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.920> piss<00:00:47.100> off<00:00:47.309> but

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
majority of the time it's a piss off but

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.490 
majority of the time it's a piss off but
just<00:00:48.149> be<00:00:48.480> honest<00:00:48.840> with<00:00:48.960> yourself<00:00:49.079> grenade

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
just be honest with yourself grenade

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.250 
just be honest with yourself grenade
launchers<00:00:49.860> are<00:00:50.010> not<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.879> terrible<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.809> I'm

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
launchers are not that terrible and I'm

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.510 
launchers are not that terrible and I'm
sure<00:00:52.469> they've<00:00:52.680> tuned<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.070> down<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.219> lot<00:00:53.399> well

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
sure they've tuned it down a lot well

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.279 
sure they've tuned it down a lot well
actually<00:00:53.670> they<00:00:53.910> have<00:00:54.180> tuned<00:00:54.570> them<00:00:54.809> down<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.020> lot

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
actually they have tuned them down a lot

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.840 
actually they have tuned them down a lot
the<00:00:55.440> explosives<00:00:55.949> are<00:00:56.039> not<00:00:56.309> going<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.610> be<00:00:56.730> like

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
the explosives are not going to be like

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.599 
the explosives are not going to be like
modern<00:00:57.180> warfare<00:00:57.329> 2<00:00:57.629> that's<00:00:58.170> for<00:00:58.379> sure<00:00:58.530> now<00:00:59.219> we

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
modern warfare 2 that's for sure now we

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.360 
modern warfare 2 that's for sure now we
also<00:00:59.760> have<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.210> ACOG<00:01:00.719> site<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.770> heartbeat

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
also have the ACOG site the heartbeat

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.719 
also have the ACOG site the heartbeat
sensor<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:03.539> hybrid<00:01:03.899> site<00:01:04.470> which<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.040> that

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
sensor the hybrid site which is that

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.670 
sensor the hybrid site which is that
that<00:01:06.510> nice<00:01:06.720> scope<00:01:07.020> we've<00:01:07.200> been<00:01:07.320> seeing<00:01:07.530> where

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
that nice scope we've been seeing where

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.440 
that nice scope we've been seeing where
people<00:01:07.890> are<00:01:07.979> alternating<00:01:08.610> between<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:09.030> ACOG

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
people are alternating between the ACOG

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.480 
people are alternating between the ACOG
and<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.750> red<00:01:09.930> dot<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.830> that's<00:01:11.010> nice<00:01:11.220> we've

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
and the red dot so that's nice we've

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.890 
and the red dot so that's nice we've
been<00:01:11.610> seeing<00:01:11.790> lots<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.299> footage<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:12.810> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
been seeing lots of that footage in the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.350 
been seeing lots of that footage in the
trailers<00:01:13.350> we<00:01:13.950> have<00:01:14.130> extended<00:01:14.790> magazines

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
trailers we have extended magazines

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.850 
trailers we have extended magazines
thermal<00:01:16.170> scope<00:01:16.500> rapid<00:01:17.460> fire<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.720> H<00:01:18.990> am

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
thermal scope rapid fire and the H am

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.469 
thermal scope rapid fire and the H am
our<00:01:20.220> scope<00:01:20.610> or<00:01:20.880> as<00:01:20.970> i<00:01:21.030> like<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.210> call<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
our scope or as i like to call it the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.940 
our scope or as i like to call it the
hammer<00:01:21.750> scope<00:01:22.080> which<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.409> essentially<00:01:22.920> a

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
hammer scope which is essentially a

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.210 
hammer scope which is essentially a
reflex<00:01:23.580> dot<00:01:24.000> as<00:01:24.299> well<00:01:24.900> as<00:01:25.140> like<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> three<00:01:25.920> times

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
reflex dot as well as like a three times

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.819 
reflex dot as well as like a three times
optical<00:01:26.610> zoom<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.570> basically<00:01:28.140> it's<00:01:28.590> kind<00:01:28.799> of

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
optical zoom so basically it's kind of

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.319 
optical zoom so basically it's kind of
like<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.070> hybrid<00:01:29.430> sight<00:01:29.670> but<00:01:29.880> it's<00:01:30.060> different

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
like the hybrid sight but it's different

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.749 
like the hybrid sight but it's different
rather<00:01:30.840> than<00:01:31.049> having<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.530> cog<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.979> red<00:01:32.130> dot<00:01:32.369> or

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
rather than having a cog and red dot or

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.399 
rather than having a cog and red dot or
however<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.360> hybrid<00:01:33.659> site<00:01:33.869> works<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.229> don't

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
however the hybrid site works I don't

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.719 
however the hybrid site works I don't
know<00:01:34.500> if<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.680> get<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.890> choose<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.310> maybe<00:01:35.549> its

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
know if you get to choose to maybe its

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:36.920 
know if you get to choose to maybe its
thermal<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.240> red<00:01:36.360> dot<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.720> could<00:01:36.840> have

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
thermal and red dot you could have

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.840 
thermal and red dot you could have
whatever<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.290> want<00:01:37.500> there<00:01:37.740> but<00:01:38.579> i<00:01:38.610> think<00:01:38.790> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
whatever you want there but i think the

and<00:01:42.060> then<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.299> three<00:01:42.570> times<00:01:42.840> optical<00:01:43.170> zoom

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
and then a three times optical zoom

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.859 
and then a three times optical zoom
sight<00:01:43.920> we<00:01:44.430> also<00:01:44.610> have<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.970> holographic<00:01:45.450> sight

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
sight we also have the holographic sight

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.770

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
of kept it a bit more focused and I'm

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.180 
of kept it a bit more focused and I'm
hoping<00:02:23.520> more<00:02:23.880> centralized<00:02:24.540> on<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:25.620> gameplay

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
hoping more centralized on the gameplay

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.100 
hoping more centralized on the gameplay
aspect<00:02:26.700> of<00:02:26.850> it<00:02:27.000> not<00:02:27.240> necessarily<00:02:27.959> just

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
aspect of it not necessarily just

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.170 
aspect of it not necessarily just
customization<00:02:28.890> because<00:02:29.100> obviously<00:02:29.520> we<00:02:30.030> have

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
customization because obviously we have

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.630 
customization because obviously we have
a<00:02:30.209> bit<00:02:30.480> of<00:02:30.510> customization<00:02:31.380> here<00:02:31.560> but<00:02:31.709> that's

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
a bit of customization here but that's

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.400 
a bit of customization here but that's
fun<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.120> all<00:02:33.240> but<00:02:33.270> I<00:02:33.480> would<00:02:33.720> rather<00:02:33.900> just<00:02:34.260> play

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
fun and all but I would rather just play

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.260 
fun and all but I would rather just play
a<00:02:34.500> game<00:02:34.770> that<00:02:34.980> kicks<00:02:35.250> ass<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:35.490> is<00:02:35.820> a<00:02:35.850> lot<00:02:36.120> of

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
a game that kicks ass and is a lot of

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.630 
a game that kicks ass and is a lot of
fun<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.600> play<00:02:36.810> so<00:02:37.350> yeah<00:02:37.800> that's<00:02:38.070> all<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.340> got<00:02:38.520> to

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
say on that hopefully the actual

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.309 
say on that hopefully the actual
gameplay<00:02:40.739> is<00:02:41.010> going<00:02:41.130> to<00:02:41.190> be<00:02:41.310> brilliant<00:02:41.700> and

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
gameplay is going to be brilliant and

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.780
