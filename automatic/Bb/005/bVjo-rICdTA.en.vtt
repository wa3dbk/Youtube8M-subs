the end result of that beam is it's
actually<00:02:00.770> two<00:02:01.130> pieces<00:02:01.160> that<00:02:01.850> are<00:02:02.180> each<00:02:02.360> 9,000

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
actually two pieces that are each 9,000

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.630

we<00:02:07.370> had<00:02:07.490> to<00:02:07.610> split<00:02:07.820> that<00:02:08.030> beam<00:02:08.210> in<00:02:08.360> half<00:02:08.600> and

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
we had to split that beam in half and

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.900 
we had to split that beam in half and
then<00:02:09.590> once<00:02:09.800> it<00:02:09.950> made<00:02:10.130> it<00:02:10.250> up<00:02:10.369> to<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:10.580> helipad

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910
