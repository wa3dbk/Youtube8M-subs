him on four consecutive days and so I do

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.029 
him on four consecutive days and so I do
not<00:00:46.170> think<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.530> need<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.710> do<00:00:46.860> four

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
not think you need to do four

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.410 
not think you need to do four
consecutive<00:00:47.370> days<00:00:47.760> because<00:00:48.000> what<00:00:48.149> happened

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
consecutive days because what happened

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.990 
consecutive days because what happened
to<00:00:48.480> me<00:00:48.629> was<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:48.870> um<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.649> just<00:00:50.219> talked<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.879> him

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
to me was that um I just talked to him

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.880 
to me was that um I just talked to him
before<00:00:51.090> separate<00:00:51.600> days<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.289> was<00:00:52.410> fine<00:00:52.649> so

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
before separate days and it was fine so

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.770 
before separate days and it was fine so
I<00:00:53.340> do<00:00:53.460> not<00:00:53.730> think<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.180> need<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.420> do<00:00:54.570> four

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
I do not think that you need to do four

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.099 
I do not think that you need to do four
consecutive<00:00:55.140> days<00:00:55.559> but<00:00:56.180> I'm<00:00:57.180> sure<00:00:57.690> it's<00:00:57.840> okay

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
consecutive days but I'm sure it's okay

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:06.130 
consecutive days but I'm sure it's okay
if<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.410> do<00:00:58.640> um<00:01:01.430> the<00:01:02.430> strange<00:01:02.820> souvenir

region<00:01:16.710> if<00:01:16.830> you've<00:01:16.979> talked<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.250> him<00:01:17.369> or<00:01:18.090> one<00:01:18.360> of

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
region if you've talked to him or one of

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.600 
region if you've talked to him or one of

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
the times you talk to him and yeah so I

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.370 
the times you talk to him and yeah so I
wonder<00:01:24.150> if<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.330> can<00:01:24.450> like<00:01:24.630> hold<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.229> item

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
wonder if you can like hold the item

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.020 
wonder if you can like hold the item
like<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.890> haven't<00:01:26.070> actually<00:01:26.310> tried<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.850> yet

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
like I haven't actually tried that yet

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.940 
like I haven't actually tried that yet
but<00:01:27.570> if<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.780> can<00:01:27.900> hold<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.200> item<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.860> would

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
but if you can hold that item that would

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.840 
but if you can hold that item that would
be<00:01:29.210> interesting<00:01:30.210> because<00:01:30.650> if<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:32.579> can<00:01:32.729> hold

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
be interesting because if you can hold

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.340 
be interesting because if you can hold
that<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.240> main<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.630> could<00:01:33.780> transfer<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.320> a

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
that on the main you could transfer to a

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.370 
that on the main you could transfer to a
maybe<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.189> next<00:01:35.310> generations<00:01:35.939> game<00:01:36.380> maybe

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
maybe the next generations game maybe

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.100 
maybe the next generations game maybe
it'll<00:01:37.560> do<00:01:37.740> something<00:01:38.159> like<00:01:38.840> so<00:01:39.840> in<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.020> event

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
it'll do something like so in the event

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.219 
it'll do something like so in the event
Pokemon<00:01:40.710> how<00:01:41.040> they<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.400> or<00:01:42.060> event<00:01:42.450> items<00:01:42.780> how

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
they can trigger a legendary pokemon or

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.310 
they can trigger a legendary pokemon or
from<00:01:46.500> bring<00:01:47.960> that<00:01:48.960> would<00:01:49.079> be<00:01:49.170> very

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
from bring that would be very

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.910 
from bring that would be very
interesting<00:01:50.270> so<00:01:51.270> maybe<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.259> because

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
interesting so maybe you because

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.850 
interesting so maybe you because
preferring<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.670> in<00:01:53.820> between<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.299> Pokemon<00:01:55.049> X<00:01:55.439> or

pokémon Y to another Pokemon X or poking

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.899 
pokémon Y to another Pokemon X or poking
away<00:01:58.549> see<00:01:59.549> if<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.119> can<00:02:00.619> transfer<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.759> if<00:02:02.759> we

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
away see if you can transfer it if we

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.209 
away see if you can transfer it if we
could<00:02:03.119> then<00:02:03.390> then<00:02:04.140> it'll<00:02:04.530> probably<00:02:04.799> have

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
could then then it'll probably have

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.059 
could then then it'll probably have
