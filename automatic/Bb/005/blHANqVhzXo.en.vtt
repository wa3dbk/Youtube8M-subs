00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.309
 or the rock that I already had here manuel el mar 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.240
 sell 100.006 today let's unlock 

00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:12.509
 all and all the suits so we're going to 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.360
 go let's play mercenaries not the 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.600
 mercenaries ruthlessly eye mercenaries 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.470
 this way I advise that at least 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.699
 play one 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:27.579
 where in urban chaos and what are the 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:31.140
 Manuel costumes like those suits here 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:36.350
 they see me as pirate lions 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.350
 elena of let's say they say 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.130
 police woman that I would not love 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.810
 to arrest me I know the truth but 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.600
 transcending the bad luck that 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.940
 I'm sure it's not my turn to be in crisis 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.930
 that goes like a samurai to the chest 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.120
 discovered here 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.790
 The friend bills, literally 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:00.200
 advertising the face of the 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:03.190
 house of the gamberrete dress laughs 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.550
 literally like a Japanese schoolgirl 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.710
 nothing changes his suit 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.640
 let's say something that seems a bit 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:16.000
 more Spanish here is unlocked carla 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.010
 and the agent has nothing here I come 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.690
 an example of how many points there are that 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:25.060
 do more than 100,000 out of 100 thousand in 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.190
 forward there they put to good here was like 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.770
 I had unlocked Carla playing like this 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.580
 with what he has seen with nothing and slowly 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.940
 It is also what the fairy costume 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.950
 remember all the characters when playing 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.430
 by way of 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.920
 in mercenaries 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.470
 in urban chaos is the track where I 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.650
 I advise you have to earn more than 100 thousand 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.170
 points to win and how I start manuel 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.330
 as a game as I come to you saying in 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.260
 urban chaos and we're not going to start now 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.780
 opinion with the zombies we are going to catch 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.300
 quietly and we're going to break all 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.910
 the crystals because now the 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.850
 Less normal zombies that less 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.610
 resistance have 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.990
 and after that, the 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:18.080
 black the cops will start blogging 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.420
 dogs are also appear and the eau 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.290
 they sprout also so we have to have 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.290
 very careful 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.750
 that I recommend I carry at least 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.330
 as I was very attached to the guns and 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.040
 from body to body too but the thing 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.680
 you win with guns and guns 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.010
 I recommend bringing lost items to 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.320
 well win and have always enough 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.620
 ammunition the issue is to be able to pull the 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.350
 trigger calmly here they see me I have 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.290
 six minutes to literally get 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.900
 everything he proposed me and he shot at 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:57.000
 this crystal and from here on 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:03:00.130
 I start him as I tell you that urban chaos 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.180
 break all the crystals I advise 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.770
 this map and they start like this from this 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.190
 way 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:12.200
 nothing from then on , you know 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:15.050
 they simply trust those 100 thousand points 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.590
 in some advice if you try to do 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.690
 combos and west in juan kills zombies and there 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.110
 many more around as well 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:27.860
 try also to make long combos for 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.620
 at least one of one of 50 I advise them 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.650
 Sirs 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.799
 at least make at least 2 of 20 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.110
 if possible also because like this 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:41.080
 By last so long maybe we can 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.629
 die along the way and the truth is that 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.670
 it does not do any fun has happened to me and the 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:48.010
 truth is that as I tell you it does not 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.579
 no grace every time it was the 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:55.550
 matter and they will go muddy here they see me 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:58.100
 a charge so for now and then clear 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.260
 then when starting again from the 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.140
 level will leave the zombies normalitos 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.660
 but many more and then two will appear 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.590
 children of these here see me I have not 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.810
 done something very long 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.650
 punctuation 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:17.230
 more than 100,000 points and I have killed look 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.320
 the maximum combo has been 32 but I've 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:23.620
 made 102 deaths so that reach 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:27.669
 long combos try to make combos 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:31.300
 long and nothing down here we see suit 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:33.550
 unlocked and nothing but manuel what 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.370
 advantage has this apart from this 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:40.389
 costumes as you have seen before apart 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:44.320
 to be a new skin this character and 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:47.169
 be lion be the least carla and the 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:50.770
 agent will have other configurations is 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:54.760
 say they will carry other weapons which of course 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:57.340
 when facing or playing another 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:01.160
 way to the best in multiplayer 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:03.290
 we can have more advantages 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.660
 and now they will ask and these suits 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.690
 which are nothing as I come 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.200
 saying - in the people and carla to all 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:15.430
 others may have the included ones 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.780
 those of the 4th of ed and these are achieved 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:21.020
 registering on the newly-made page 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:25.340
 gevil dot net and doing its mini 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:27.260
 games contests stories that they 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:31.280
 go proposing me the truth is that I 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:34.580
 I signed up but I said to get these 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.840
 is fifth in q3 the truth is that I do not 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.910
 I'm going to point to the page I'm not going to 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.400
 follow the page in this way as 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:44.980
 they asked to get a skin this 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.980
 and that's what I did happened literally 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.610
 within what fits in skiing this 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.960
 example lions the middle as 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.610
 you see in the first resident evil 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.970
 good in particular as in the first and 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:58.190
 in the third art that is now 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:01.580
 that I showed him as a pirate 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:04.729
 same weapons ie the normal skin 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:07.580
 carries a weapon configuration but the 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:09.620
 pirate skin and this one carries the same 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.080
 weapon configuration but they are 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.900
 different from the first I do not know if I 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:18.259
 understands the question is that getting 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:22.120
 the skin or costumes of the characters 

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:24.910
 we will have much more flexible characters 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:28.389
 if we can have a lion but we will have 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:31.120
 two lion two lion how it sounds this is 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:33.100
 say we can choose between what weapons 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.960
 can carry or what weapons can you 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.510
 carry if I like this suit better and 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.889
 works in this way or in the way 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:41.990
 that was already predetermined 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:44.150
 Well I hope I have surprised you 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:48.009
 doubts and as I always say thank you for 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.009
 have seen me and a hug to all
