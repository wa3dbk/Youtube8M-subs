00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.490
 the nationwide front axle I want to agree today but as a standard 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.679
 the usual 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.679
 somehow the taxi is showing how to join them 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:17.269
 for 90 percent of the approximately ten years does not see 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:18.609
 about that 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:22.699
 I think I have a special one, he has many options without stone position 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.949
 works the other way too 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.340
 all have very few vehicles that have 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.429
 that does not matter if I say now 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.380
 stockist 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.330
 At the light show Weselerin is just a castle here 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.550
 but there are mostly shows 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.580
 What mango around it is not the exact ones 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.580
 to order the ground clearance and he puts you here 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:48.800
 here 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.480
 actually around 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.370
 here and here 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.370
 Zurich in the writing 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.140
 and around 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.370
 despite sure victory in Samara should 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.600
 Year proposed 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.570
 he actually got the whole 80s 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.570
 Politically balance at the same time deeper 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.359
 which is also true in many vehicles she actually is 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.730
 if I do it now 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.730
 it is so read it here 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.450
 sometimes come 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.610
 for her here 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.180
 no Ute Laux have any sense 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.790
 it means 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.159
 They have the direct connection forum processes from themselves 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.690
 about this tax 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.530
 the sirens 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.820
 What happens now is this statement 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.240
 but that's not me 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.240
 Angled is that is usually runs 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.130
 Google's saying can be left 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.650
 usually the snake becomes so terrible 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.790
 okay CD here too 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.790
 okay Tour de Suisse 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.650
 So now Huntelaar is divorcing 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.659
 the four companies would 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:12.369
 the whole thing gets higher and the angle becomes more 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:14.399
 Therefore 

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:16.409
 here will be automatic 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.409
 but the percent more arca you produce 

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:22.019
 also you can tell us that 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.019
 when the stoves hit 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:27.839
 German origin 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:33.179
 Highlight of the still much better progress from the continuing areas 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:37.769
 Although you can say that here 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.329
 this means 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.969
 her seat is the outer wheel 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:46.379
 Angle has relied on angles and that in The Hague has many more genes 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:47.199
 Love made 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:49.179
 what to get in the episode 

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:51.339
 sorry say just that 

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:52.919
 because they make you strong 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:55.120
 that is if now the highest point 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.769
 with writing located here 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.009
 OK 

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:04.289
 Associate the automatic Sfar driving vehicle times thought so changed 

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:05.999
 when turning 

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:08.709
 Percent how do you see that? 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.389
 they have to suffer us once again open times a goal 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:15.639
 even so 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:18.539
 not all slices of the owners 

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:21.539
 for the percent for the height 

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:25.149
 our mission is not 

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:28.529
 with the Chancellor have Olympics 

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:31.529
 Bob Dylan John Lennon 

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:36.599
 there more and more and I have here 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.039
 a lawsuit 

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:40.089
 and 2 who think the same way 

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:43.089
 which certainly thinks the same way 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.369
 Chances blue disc 

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:51.409
 I am also turning back 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:54.429
 like this announcement where I killed 

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:57.429
 now goes so far that such shoes 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.989
 So now I have only just before very low down actually 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.179
 it does not fall out 

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:07.729
 Schonungen Blayne Curtis are occupied 

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:09.979
 just like me to see the sun 

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:12.979
 the angle plays a bigger role 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:17.019
 is this angle your okay 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.650
 the opponent is so pure 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.079
 be it from me 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.380
 then a point they had been here I would like to angle with now 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:26.969
 height adjustment 

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:29.939
 Toni l change nothing 

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:32.900
 Draxler takes care of it 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.599
 Angelique Kidjo lying 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:37.129
 still exercising 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:38.490
 Student 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.009
 that's what the coach sees 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:44.009
 only apply lightly 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.379
 SCANNDY from Hamburg and so on 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:48.700
 also a second skin 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.700
 the alarmed are two equal to the design calls 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:55.439
 nothing happens from reality 9 percent 

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:57.350
 quickly turned around and 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.779
 you have fun two different ways 

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:04.179
 and about one, of course, the water is not before 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.200
 Now I have a soul 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.200
 I'll automatically change that 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:15.469
 less ground clearance 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.400
 to classify the commissioners 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.680
 Although you are fast 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.680
 7 of the statute is not very good nor is it out 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:31.189
 OK 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.960
 she always sees differences around the story massively 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.620
 also against St 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.990
 Trulli and Glock crawl this minute they shot them here 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.610
 Return chances lower 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.099
 I have for very mature clarified earlier 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:50.159
 Music and paint damage located 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:51.909
 that's what happened 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:54.960
 I quote 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.039
 this integrated 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:00.169
 percent has changed quite a bit 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:02.999
 if normalization that percent 

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:05.409
 that makes a difference 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:08.800
 Say she would grace it exactly the case I was stuck with 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.189
 ball head 

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:12.930
 We do not charge too much behind this day 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.930
 Now I take the way here 

00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:19.539
 Nokia 

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:21.809
 Klaus full daily with Carolin 

00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:25.270
 always produce at the first axis 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:28.389
 and should have noticed an expected position 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:30.770
 Lisieur 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.500
 what is the anticipation of Dr that means thrust of the united 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:37.979
 the Dr 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:39.210
 the DHL 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.969
 Denisov 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:42.949
 or went outside 

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:44.430
 4 4 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.809
 after EUR 

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:51.959
 conversely, the space problem Harriman annoys higher orders so right 

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:53.860
 because we are free 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.479
 that would have meant that 

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:57.749
 usually it is like that 

00:06:57.749 --> 00:07:00.479
 if now vehicle parts 

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:02.499
 inconveniently dead 

00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:05.189
 as critics prove the recovery dead 

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:08.600
 if I move sideways or how percent the grid continues upwards 

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.499
 that means the money will be yours 

00:07:11.499 --> 00:07:13.589
 after running 

00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:16.669
 So she had to correct then if that did not want to make herself to 

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:18.159
 Friday as ASP 

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:21.369
 as she says, 000 manufacturers at the beginning 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.119
 and all the more remembered 

00:07:24.119 --> 00:07:25.629
 around 

00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:27.240
 the actual game 

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.999
 the machine should not be like this before Â» 

00:07:29.999 --> 00:07:34.009
 In Cyprus they rain quite easily so now they have just got there 

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:37.199
 this is optimal for the optimal setting 

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:37.699
 OK
