actually hadn't thought about that that

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.720 
actually hadn't thought about that that
I<00:00:56.940> actually<00:00:57.539> did<00:00:57.960> have<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.890> much<00:00:59.160> done<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.609> me

I actually did have that much done to me
I<00:00:59.760> fear<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.059> feel<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.270> bit<00:01:00.449> like<00:01:00.480> Rodney

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
I fear I feel a bit like Rodney

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.200 
I fear I feel a bit like Rodney
Dangerfield<00:01:01.260> now<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.219> know<00:01:02.309> no<00:01:02.489> respect<00:01:02.969> no

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
Dangerfield now you know no respect no

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.010 
Dangerfield now you know no respect no
respect<00:01:04.220> do<00:01:05.220> they<00:01:05.339> really<00:01:05.549> do<00:01:05.729> all<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.210> me

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
respect do they really do all that to me

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.690 
respect do they really do all that to me
and<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.740> think<00:01:08.600> like<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.780> was<00:01:10.490> there<00:01:11.490> was<00:01:11.610> an

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
and I think like it was there was an

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.370 
and I think like it was there was an
element<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.119> like<00:01:12.479> O'Brien<00:01:12.930> was<00:01:13.110> slightly

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
element of like O'Brien was slightly

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.820 
element of like O'Brien was slightly
front<00:01:13.830> line<00:01:14.210> you<00:01:15.210> know<00:01:15.360> he<00:01:15.540> was<00:01:15.689> he<00:01:15.930> was<00:01:16.080> re<00:01:16.259> you

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
front line you know he was he was re you

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.140 
front line you know he was he was re you
know<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:18.170> being<00:01:19.250> slightly<00:01:20.250> maybe

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
know and and being slightly maybe

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.929 
know and and being slightly maybe
foolish<00:01:21.720> he<00:01:22.170> he<00:01:22.560> would<00:01:22.799> put<00:01:23.130> himself<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.759> these

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
foolish he he would put himself in these

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.770 
foolish he he would put himself in these
situations<00:01:24.689> as<00:01:24.840> well<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.290> he<00:01:25.380> would<00:01:25.820> he<00:01:26.820> he<00:01:27.420> I

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
situations as well and he would he he I

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.770 
situations as well and he would he he I
mean<00:01:28.490> you<00:01:29.490> know<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.670> know<00:01:29.820> Brian<00:01:30.150> never<00:01:30.450> kind

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
mean you know you know Brian never kind

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.640 
mean you know you know Brian never kind
of<00:01:30.869> would<00:01:31.140> never<00:01:31.820> sure<00:01:32.869> and<00:01:33.869> perhaps<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.590> is

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
of would never sure and perhaps this is

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.920 
of would never sure and perhaps this is
this<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> character<00:01:35.909> flaw<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.600> he<00:01:36.780> would

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
this is a character flaw that he would

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.300 
this is a character flaw that he would
he<00:01:37.110> wouldn't<00:01:37.350> say<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:37.799> need<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.040> stay<00:01:38.189> home

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
he wouldn't say like I need to stay home

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.130 
he wouldn't say like I need to stay home
with<00:01:38.369> my<00:01:38.549> family<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.299> too<00:01:39.450> dangerous<00:01:39.630> you

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
with my family this is too dangerous you

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.569 
with my family this is too dangerous you
know<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.470> was<00:01:40.619> always<00:01:40.799> like<00:01:41.100> I'm<00:01:41.220> going<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.460> go

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
know it was always like I'm going to go

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.740 
know it was always like I'm going to go
do<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:41.909> because<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.420> right<00:01:42.570> thing

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
do this because this is the right thing

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.160 
do this because this is the right thing
to<00:01:42.869> do<00:01:43.850> so<00:01:44.850> as<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> result<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.600> think<00:01:45.630> he<00:01:45.840> did<00:01:45.990> get

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
to do so as a result I think he did get

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.240 
to do so as a result I think he did get
himself<00:01:46.290> in<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.619> lot<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.799> very<00:01:46.979> sticky

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
himself in a lot of very sticky

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.160 
himself in a lot of very sticky
situations<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.560> then<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.740> mean<00:01:49.950> there's<00:01:50.820> I

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
situations and then I mean there's I

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.740 
situations and then I mean there's I
think<00:01:52.170> also<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.460> writers<00:01:54.149> are<00:01:54.299> maybe<00:01:54.540> a

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
think also the writers are maybe a

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.569 
think also the writers are maybe a
little<00:01:55.079> bit<00:01:55.320> prone<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.890> put<00:01:56.070> me<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.369> those

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
little bit prone to put me in those

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.480 
little bit prone to put me in those
situations<00:01:57.360> because<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:58.409> had<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.979> family<00:01:59.369> as

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
situations because I had the family as

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.420 
situations because I had the family as
well<00:02:00.380> because<00:02:01.380> you're<00:02:01.530> seeing<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.310> know

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
well because you're seeing the you know

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.370 
well because you're seeing the you know
that<00:02:02.600> dramatically<00:02:03.600> you're<00:02:03.899> seeing<00:02:04.170> the

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
that dramatically you're seeing the

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.459 
that dramatically you're seeing the
effects<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:05.390> somebody<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:06.600> jeopardy<00:02:06.840> somebody

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
effects of somebody in jeopardy somebody

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.639 
effects of somebody in jeopardy somebody
in<00:02:07.590> peril<00:02:07.950> not<00:02:08.700> just<00:02:09.000> for<00:02:09.929> themselves<00:02:10.080> but

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
in peril not just for themselves but

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.650 
in peril not just for themselves but
also<00:02:11.039> for<00:02:11.310> other<00:02:11.700> characters<00:02:12.030> on<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.450> show
