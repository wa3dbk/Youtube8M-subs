like to use the software that seems to
work<00:01:50.900> the<00:01:51.170> quickest<00:01:51.590> and<00:01:52.490> that's<00:01:52.640> where<00:01:52.820> we're

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
work the quickest and that's where we're

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.300 
work the quickest and that's where we're
going<00:01:53.060> to<00:01:53.090> do<00:01:53.330> the<00:01:54.320> Advanced<00:01:54.770> tab<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.280> that

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
going to do the Advanced tab and that

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.700 
going to do the Advanced tab and that
way<00:01:56.180> we<00:01:56.299> can<00:01:56.420> also<00:01:56.570> target<00:01:56.990> whichever<00:01:57.500> device

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
way we can also target whichever device

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.670 
way we can also target whichever device
we're<00:01:58.040> trying<00:01:58.250> to<00:01:58.460> recover<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.210> file<00:01:59.420> from<00:01:59.750> so

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
we're trying to recover the file from so

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.560 
we're trying to recover the file from so
in<00:02:01.009> this<00:02:01.189> case<00:02:01.430> you<00:02:01.790> can<00:02:01.939> see<00:02:02.090> that<00:02:02.119> we<00:02:02.450> have

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
in this case you can see that we have

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.210 
in this case you can see that we have
all<00:02:02.780> all<00:02:03.049> the<00:02:03.320> different<00:02:03.619> drives<00:02:03.890> that<00:02:04.130> are

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
all all the different drives that are

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.300 
all all the different drives that are
hooked<00:02:04.310> up<00:02:04.490> to<00:02:04.759> this<00:02:05.750> computer<00:02:05.930> are<00:02:06.409> attached

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
hooked up to this computer are attached

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.910 
hooked up to this computer are attached
right<00:02:07.520> here<00:02:07.579> so<00:02:08.509> you<00:02:09.289> know<00:02:09.379> what<00:02:09.530> I<00:02:09.560> would<00:02:09.739> do

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
okay and just make sure that we get the

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.479 
okay and just make sure that we get the
drive<00:02:19.269> that<00:02:19.450> we<00:02:19.569> want<00:02:19.780> so<00:02:20.019> in<00:02:20.140> this<00:02:20.230> case<00:02:20.500> I'm

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
drive that we want so in this case I'm

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:22.490 
drive that we want so in this case I'm
going<00:02:21.609> to<00:02:21.670> we're<00:02:21.879> going<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:22.060> use<00:02:22.209> this

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
going to we're going to use this

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.490 
going to we're going to use this
removable<00:02:23.500> drive<00:02:23.859> here<00:02:24.219> and<00:02:25.230> we<00:02:26.230> can<00:02:26.349> leave

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
removable drive here and we can leave

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.910 
removable drive here and we can leave
all<00:02:26.680> this<00:02:26.829> checked<00:02:28.019> to<00:02:29.019> run<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.319> scan<00:02:29.560> or<00:02:29.799> you

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
all this checked to run the scan or you

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.630 
all this checked to run the scan or you
can<00:02:30.069> you<00:02:30.400> can<00:02:30.549> uncheck<00:02:30.939> certain<00:02:31.629> things<00:02:32.640> but

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
can you can uncheck certain things but

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.250 
can you can uncheck certain things but
or<00:02:33.879> you<00:02:34.090> can<00:02:34.209> type<00:02:34.359> the<00:02:34.540> file<00:02:34.689> name<00:02:34.720> in<00:02:35.079> here

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
or you can type the file name in here

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.780 
or you can type the file name in here
also<00:02:35.409> but<00:02:36.159> in<00:02:36.250> this<00:02:36.310> case<00:02:36.519> we're<00:02:36.640> just<00:02:36.670> going

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
also but in this case we're just going

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.190 
also but in this case we're just going
to<00:02:36.909> see<00:02:37.060> what<00:02:37.209> kind<00:02:37.390> of<00:02:37.420> files<00:02:37.599> we<00:02:37.810> can<00:02:37.930> recover

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
to see what kind of files we can recover

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.199 
to see what kind of files we can recover
from<00:02:38.349> from<00:02:39.040> this<00:02:39.159> device<00:02:39.459> so<00:02:39.909> you<00:02:39.939> go<00:02:40.120> ahead

which<00:02:46.980> down<00:02:47.980> here<00:02:48.250> is<00:02:48.340> it<00:02:48.459> finds<00:02:48.670> items<00:02:49.060> it

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
which down here is it finds items it

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.500 
which down here is it finds items it
will<00:02:49.269> actually<00:02:49.389> list<00:02:49.810> them<00:02:50.430> together<00:02:51.430> so<00:02:52.329> go

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
will actually list them together so go

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.089 
will actually list them together so go
ahead<00:02:52.569> and<00:02:52.780> we'll<00:02:52.870> let<00:02:52.989> this<00:02:53.169> scan<00:02:53.650> run<00:02:53.889> and

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
ahead and we'll let this scan run and

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.390 
ahead and we'll let this scan run and
then<00:02:54.189> I'll<00:02:54.340> show<00:02:54.669> you<00:02:54.700> what<00:02:55.150> we<00:02:55.269> got<00:02:56.220> okay<00:02:57.220> the

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
scan is complete and you can see that

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.699 
scan is complete and you can see that
software<00:03:00.909> was<00:03:01.329> able<00:03:01.359> to<00:03:01.629> find<00:03:01.930> some<00:03:02.230> different

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
software was able to find some different

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.220 
software was able to find some different
types<00:03:02.889> of<00:03:03.069> files<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.629> the<00:03:04.629> way<00:03:04.780> it<00:03:04.930> sits

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
types of files and the way it sits

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.379 
types of files and the way it sits
organizing<00:03:05.859> them<00:03:05.950> here<00:03:06.159> again<00:03:06.370> is<00:03:06.549> it<00:03:07.060> does<00:03:07.239> it

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:07.389 
organizing them here again is it does it

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:09.750 
organizing them here again is it does it
by<00:03:07.569> whatever<00:03:07.870> type<00:03:08.200> of<00:03:08.319> file<00:03:08.530> it<00:03:08.560> is<00:03:08.829> so<00:03:09.579> we've

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
by whatever type of file it is so we've

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.949 
by whatever type of file it is so we've
got<00:03:09.939> all<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.239> images<00:03:10.599> grouped<00:03:10.840> together
