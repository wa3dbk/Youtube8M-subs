some bug fixing there was some trouble
with<00:00:14.070> broken<00:00:14.580> worlds<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.150> whatnot<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:15.839> was

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
with broken worlds and whatnot I was

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.279 
with broken worlds and whatnot I was
lucky<00:00:16.699> didn't<00:00:17.699> get<00:00:17.880> in<00:00:17.970> trouble<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.600> was<00:00:19.109> able

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.580 
lucky didn't get in trouble I was able
to<00:00:19.590> work<00:00:19.770> here<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:21.060> made<00:00:21.330> my<00:00:21.539> first<00:00:21.590> piston

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
to work here and I made my first piston

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.790 
to work here and I made my first piston
based<00:00:22.859> creation<00:00:23.850> this<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.660> static<00:00:25.350> seed<00:00:25.619> and

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
based creation this is static seed and

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.370 
based creation this is static seed and
flower<00:00:26.070> farm<00:00:26.430> Smurf<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.300> I'm<00:00:27.990> going<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.260> hook

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
flower farm Smurf and I'm going to hook

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.519 
flower farm Smurf and I'm going to hook
up<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.619> link<00:00:28.949> for<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.029> basic<00:00:30.449> design<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.109> I

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
up a link for the basic design and I

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.209 
up a link for the basic design and I
piston<00:00:32.040> eyes<00:00:32.219> dit<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.850> it's<00:00:33.420> working<00:00:33.690> nicely

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
piston eyes dit and it's working nicely

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.520 
piston eyes dit and it's working nicely
tested<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.340> so<00:00:36.090> let's<00:00:36.300> have<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.510> look<00:00:36.600> how<00:00:37.320> it

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
tested it so let's have a look how it

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.150 
tested it so let's have a look how it
works<00:00:37.910> you<00:00:38.910> arrive<00:00:39.210> at<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.600> boat<00:00:39.840> here<00:00:40.170> at<00:00:40.649> the

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
works you arrive at the boat here at the

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.360 
works you arrive at the boat here at the
moment<00:00:41.450> the<00:00:42.450> ceiling<00:00:42.899> can<00:00:43.500> be<00:00:43.649> opened<00:00:44.129> and

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
moment the ceiling can be opened and

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.729 
moment the ceiling can be opened and
closed<00:00:44.789> oh<00:00:45.180> there's<00:00:45.629> some<00:00:45.870> seat<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.440> some

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
closed oh there's some seat that some

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.340 
closed oh there's some seat that some
flowers<00:00:47.190> left<00:00:47.399> from<00:00:47.730> my<00:00:47.760> testing<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.989> ceiling

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
flowers left from my testing the ceiling

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.130 
flowers left from my testing the ceiling
can<00:00:49.530> be<00:00:49.789> opened<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:50.910> closed<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.690> know<00:00:51.989> we

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
can be opened and closed so you know we

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.319 
can be opened and closed so you know we
always<00:00:52.170> have<00:00:52.620> light<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.190> there<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:53.730> this<00:00:54.180> is

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
always have light in there so this is

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.319 
always have light in there so this is
the<00:00:54.510> default<00:00:54.750> setup<00:00:55.260> ceiling<00:00:56.160> open<00:00:56.610> that

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
the default setup ceiling open that

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.860 
the default setup ceiling open that
grass<00:00:57.690> won't<00:00:57.960> die<00:00:58.320> if<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.949> want<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.370> use<00:00:59.579> it

the water and just closed off by now and
we<00:01:43.560> got<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.770> piston<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.520> here<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.780> piston

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
we got a piston in here and the piston

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.789 
we got a piston in here and the piston
can<00:01:46.409> open-close<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.729> let<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.509> water<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:48.899> I'm

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
can open-close and let the water in I'm

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.010 
can open-close and let the water in I'm
going<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.130> quickly<00:01:50.310> open<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:51.000> so<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.930> can<00:01:52.259> see

going to quickly open it so you can see

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.700 
going to quickly open it so you can see
there's<00:01:55.020> some<00:01:55.229> redstone<00:01:55.470> in<00:01:56.009> here<00:01:57.590> there<00:01:58.590> you

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
there's some redstone in here there you

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.719 
there's some redstone in here there you
go<00:01:59.479> the<00:02:00.479> redstone<00:02:00.960> just<00:02:01.290> attached<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.890> hear<00:02:02.130> if

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
go the redstone just attached to hear if

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.170 
go the redstone just attached to hear if
the<00:02:03.210> piston<00:02:03.630> retracts<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.640> water<00:02:05.640> can<00:02:05.939> flow

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
the piston retracts the water can flow

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.290 
the piston retracts the water can flow
through<00:02:06.560> for<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.710> roof<00:02:07.920> it's<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.700> very<00:02:08.940> simple

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
through for the roof it's a very simple

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.930 
through for the roof it's a very simple
design<00:02:09.899> as<00:02:10.110> well<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:11.069> got<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.280> Pistons

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
design as well you got the Pistons

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.280 
design as well you got the Pistons
sticky<00:02:12.540> pistons<00:02:13.020> over<00:02:13.620> here<00:02:13.860> as<00:02:14.010> well

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
sticky pistons over here as well

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:23.240 
sticky pistons over here as well
and<00:02:15.510> just<00:02:17.189> simply<00:02:19.079> put<00:02:20.079> them<00:02:20.290> down<00:02:20.500> like<00:02:20.739> this

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.069 

with<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.459> repeaters<00:02:25.030> in<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:26.920> row<00:02:27.129> and<00:02:28.079> they

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
with the repeaters in a row and they

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:32.640 
with the repeaters in a row and they
open<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:29.650> close<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:31.480> ceiling<00:02:31.959> that's

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
open and close the ceiling that's

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.530 
open and close the ceiling that's
quickly<00:02:32.980> demonstrate<00:02:33.640> it<00:02:35.909> over<00:02:36.909> here<00:02:37.269> there's

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
quickly demonstrate it over here there's

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.839 
quickly demonstrate it over here there's
my<00:02:37.780> contact<00:02:38.640> so<00:02:39.640> it's<00:02:39.819> open<00:02:40.239> now<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.720> if

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
my contact so it's open now and if

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:47.179 
my contact so it's open now and if
that's<00:02:42.849> it<00:02:43.620> really<00:02:44.620> simple<00:02:45.269> works<00:02:46.269> perfectly

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:47.189
