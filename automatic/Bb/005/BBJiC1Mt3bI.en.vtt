00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
and the six eight is huge so we need to

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.139 
and the six eight is huge so we need to
get<00:01:55.560> every<00:01:55.920> single<00:01:56.100> millisecond<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:56.790> we<00:01:56.939> can

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
get every single millisecond that we can

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.149 
get every single millisecond that we can
now<00:01:57.659> if<00:01:58.110> they<00:01:58.290> tell<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.649> they<00:01:58.799> want<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.070> to

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
as much as we can if we can point it

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.089 
as much as we can if we can point it
right<00:02:09.539> at<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:09.899> line<00:02:10.200> where<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.950> guys

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
right at that line where the guys

right at that line where the guys
holding<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.489> stopwatch<00:02:11.700> that's<00:02:12.120> what<00:02:12.270> we

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
holding the stopwatch that's what we

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.030 
holding the stopwatch that's what we
want<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.660> do

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
want to do

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.190 
want to do
so<00:02:13.790> we're<00:02:13.909> going<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.090> have<00:02:14.209> this<00:02:14.299> foot<00:02:14.569> point

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
so we're going to have this foot point

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.020 
so we're going to have this foot point
it<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.409> now<00:02:15.530> we're<00:02:16.159> taking<00:02:16.430> out<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.849> need<00:02:17.000> to

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
it and now we're taking out the need to

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.539 
it and now we're taking out the need to
pivot<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.720> foot<00:02:17.930> first<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:18.470> then<00:02:18.709> go<00:02:18.950> we're

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
pivot the foot first and then go we're

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.100 
pivot the foot first and then go we're
going<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:19.700> keep<00:02:19.879> that<00:02:20.030> foot<00:02:20.239> open<00:02:20.599> we're<00:02:20.989> going

going to keep that foot open we're going

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.869 
going to keep that foot open we're going
to<00:02:21.170> get<00:02:21.319> our<00:02:21.439> we're<00:02:22.340> going<00:02:22.459> to<00:02:22.519> get<00:02:22.610> our<00:02:22.700> weight

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
to get our we're going to get our weight

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.580 
to get our we're going to get our weight
on<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.120> front<00:02:23.269> side<00:02:23.599> and<00:02:23.810> we're<00:02:24.170> now<00:02:24.260> going<00:02:24.470> to

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
on the front side and we're now going to

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.649 
on the front side and we're now going to
explode<00:02:25.250> into<00:02:25.430> that<00:02:25.610> foot<00:02:25.879> and<00:02:25.909> let<00:02:26.239> that<00:02:26.390> foot

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:26.659 
explode into that foot and let that foot

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:29.710 
explode into that foot and let that foot
push<00:02:27.170> this<00:02:27.319> off<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:28.340> go<00:02:28.549> okay<00:02:28.849> so<00:02:28.909> now<00:02:29.209> those

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
push this off and go okay so now those

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.479 
push this off and go okay so now those
two<00:02:29.930> things<00:02:30.170> like<00:02:30.799> I<00:02:30.829> said<00:02:31.069> if<00:02:31.129> you<00:02:31.190> can<00:02:31.310> start

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
two things like I said if you can start

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:32.470 
two things like I said if you can start
in<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.640> sprint<00:02:31.879> of<00:02:31.970> stance<00:02:32.150> that's<00:02:32.269> going<00:02:32.420> to

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
in the sprint of stance that's going to

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.580 
in the sprint of stance that's going to
be<00:02:32.569> the<00:02:32.659> quickest<00:02:33.019> way<00:02:33.140> you're<00:02:33.290> going<00:02:33.409> to<00:02:33.470> get

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
be the quickest way you're going to get

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.530 
be the quickest way you're going to get
down<00:02:33.769> there<00:02:33.980> if<00:02:34.280> they<00:02:34.549> don't<00:02:34.579> it'll<00:02:35.269> be<00:02:35.390> your

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
down there if they don't it'll be your

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.589 
down there if they don't it'll be your
second<00:02:35.959> your<00:02:36.829> second<00:02:37.250> line<00:02:37.549> of<00:02:37.579> defense<00:02:38.030> by

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
second your second line of defense by
