00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:11.559
 then why why did I leave 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:15.280
 the university the society now there 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:19.210
 I tell you a moment then practically 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:22.119
 last January I was sitting in 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:25.840
 this brno and I spoke this girl not 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.669
 I just talked and told this 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.710
 history I practically do you know her 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:33.480
 the story of robert the robots and she makes me 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:37.480
 no i'll do them if i tell you that 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.000
 practically and my brother and I do 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.039
 when we were little we played robert 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.449
 the robot and robertino had to go down the 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:45.879
 cellar stairs and take the other one 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.739
 it was necessary to move like a robot no 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:52.420
 it took those who appeared very much 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:55.960
 mechanics mostly I was doing 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:59.050
 robert because david my brother is 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:03.039
 always been good at hiding 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:05.230
 however I did shrug my shoulders down 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:09.310
 stairs of the cellar and pretended to 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:12.420
 look for him because you know why be 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.420
 robert doing those moves 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:21.450
 I don't know it scared me scared me 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:23.490
 so I sat and waited 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.460
 every time david came out of hiding 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.869
 the fuck was the problem 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.780
 because you don't look for it you know what 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.229
 I answered 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:42.840
 david and i don't want to be robert anymore 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:44.759
 I don't want to be a robot at some 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.789
 point to the bar where I started this 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.200
 story falls silent and I make myself 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.030
 I realize that everyone listened to me no e 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.469
 wisely nod my story up 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.610
 robert as if they knew who knows 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:59.640
 whoever I was, I had a *** 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.390
 revelation I realized that i 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.890
 my friends were not gods 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.470
 it wasn't the golden generation he would have 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.000
 saved the world but simply i 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.150
 children of the lower middle class who 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.989
 played at getting an instruction e 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.280
 that we would bring ours 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.739
 middle class attitude everywhere 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.790
 if we had gone, you know why 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:22.739
 you know because you can't get rid of it 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.069
 you can't just say I want it 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.069
 to be robert 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.659
 and hope that it works yours 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.239
 roots are in a mechanical shop 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:35.870
 in a small shitty city you are the 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:40.010
 son of and eto'o relationships within and 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.659
 surely you try to cancel 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.579
 this part of you is not someone 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:49.370
 but you know that something else happens 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.810
 day you find yourself in a bar telling 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.549

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:58.819
