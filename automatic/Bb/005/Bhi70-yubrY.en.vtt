00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 dotcom today we go with a very manual 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.010
 simple that will help us install 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.690
 wifi flacso any operating system 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.170
 of linux on a usb 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.080
 the program is called x boot and we have it 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.080
 here on wifi we have an article 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.340
 where can we 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.310
 download it here directly we are going to 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.900
 click on download and it opens 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.560
 this screen click on this 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.230
 access and it will tell us if we want to open it 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.100
 save it in this case I already have it what 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.570
 I have saved here 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.699
 here I have it on the desk alone 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.400
 download the zip if you simply 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:44.960
 we have this file which 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.170
 we will put here in the writer and we 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.589
 would remain as is here we press 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.329
 about the program and we're going to tell you 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:57.019
 will not know 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.600
 the file where we have wifis the 4.9 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:03.199
 in this case I have it here we are going to 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.259
 say that the file is linux and the 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.640
 utility is the chs and we say that what 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.530
 to nothing 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.320
 Now what we are going to do is 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.650
 and check that our usb 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.840
 we have inserted is empty in this case 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.329
 we see that it does not have to be 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.530
 is in use has files then what 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:25.329
 what are we going to do is I do sada 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.600
 right button and let's say format 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:31.440
 system to format this this memory 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.050
 we are going to do it 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.630
 fuck senses and let's make a 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.850
 format fast format that with this 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.250
 will serve tells us that you are going to erase 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.780
 the archives we say that yes as 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.830
 you can see this this album has 987 m2 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.650
 of a giga 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.860
 and we leave it here ready to put 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.470
 the operating system where we are going to 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.850
 get the operating system well let's go 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:03.610
 here to the website for wifi of and in 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.960
 the second page in this case conforming 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.580
 they go creating articles are going to 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:12.220
 appear more we go to page 2 and 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.770
 here we have this this article where 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.240
 all versions appear for 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.310
 download in this case we are going to 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.340
 download it 4.9 which is the last and what 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.530
 we are going to do in a reduced version in 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.670
 700 megabytes we just have to press 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.470
 here and we would have prepared it 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.110
 downloading then we will go back 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.250
 here and after having told you where 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.920
 we have the file 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.200
 we tell you to create usb you can also 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.570
 use a cd so you have the option 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.450
 above we select the device 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:47.870
 where are we going to put it and we say ok 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.330
 this process is a little long good 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.430
 It can last between 4 or 5 minutes 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.890
 depending on the computer and memory 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.080
 So what we are going to do is leave 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.150
 here the video and now we continue when 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.910
 is created that I want to show you are a 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.459
 couple of things in this program that we 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.130
 they will like we work here and now 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.140
 we continue well because the process has 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.489
 finished a message has come out and I 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.300
 He said that he was ready USB and 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:19.160
 is what we are going to do is 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:22.520
 we're going to go to the qm tab 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.260
 and we are going to say that here we are going to 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.380
 say where we have the operating system 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.290
 you are everything I wanted to teach you if 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.870
 we give you here we say that there it is 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.890
 QUAD wizisla 24.9 and if you look to us 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:40.130
 open a window where we 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.959
 is taught in operating systems by 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.300
 yes we want to try it we can close it 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.250
 here is an emulator 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.100
 and well, that's all I already have 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.770
 our memory created and ready for 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.470
 use wifi flags on any computer 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:04:01.380
 we can also create a cd if we see 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:03.030
 here create the iso or well the usb that 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:07.040
 it's all I hope you liked it and 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:10.040
