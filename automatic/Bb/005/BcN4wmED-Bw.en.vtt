00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.230 
first person I was I was consciously

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.230 
first person I was I was consciously
quite<00:01:11.280> scared<00:01:12.280> of<00:01:12.430> working<00:01:12.760> with<00:01:12.910> us<00:01:13.030> on<00:01:13.120> the

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
quite scared of working with us on the

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.970 
quite scared of working with us on the
3rd<00:01:13.450> from<00:01:13.660> when<00:01:13.810> Gary<00:01:14.050> Oldman<00:01:14.560> came<00:01:14.800> in

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
3rd from when Gary Oldman came in

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.430 
3rd from when Gary Oldman came in
because<00:01:15.760> I<00:01:16.000> by<00:01:16.540> that<00:01:16.690> point<00:01:16.840> I<00:01:17.020> was<00:01:17.050> more

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
because I by that point I was more

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.410 
because I by that point I was more
knowledgeable<00:01:17.980> about<00:01:18.040> film<00:01:18.550> and<00:01:18.760> about<00:01:18.850> about

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
knowledgeable about film and about about

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.780 
knowledgeable about film and about about
very<00:01:19.660> just<00:01:19.900> driver<00:01:20.350> and<00:01:20.680> acting<00:01:21.070> in<00:01:21.190> general

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
very just driver and acting in general

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.790 
very just driver and acting in general
I'd<00:01:22.240> watched<00:01:22.510> a<00:01:22.690> lot<00:01:22.840> more<00:01:23.020> exposed<00:01:23.590> a<00:01:23.710> lot

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
I'd watched a lot more exposed a lot

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.410 
I'd watched a lot more exposed a lot
more<00:01:23.980> and<00:01:24.160> I<00:01:25.150> knew<00:01:26.140> a<00:01:26.170> lot<00:01:26.260> of<00:01:26.410> his<00:01:26.650> films<00:01:27.010> and

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
more and I knew a lot of his films and

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.240 
more and I knew a lot of his films and
so<00:01:28.420> working<00:01:28.810> with<00:01:28.930> him<00:01:29.140> was<00:01:29.830> very<00:01:29.880> frightening

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
so working with him was very frightening

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.800 
so working with him was very frightening
because<00:01:33.250> I<00:01:33.430> thought<00:01:33.790> he<00:01:33.880> was<00:01:34.000> gonna<00:01:34.090> be<00:01:34.270> like

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
because I thought he was gonna be like

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.390 
because I thought he was gonna be like
his<00:01:34.990> characters<00:01:35.440> in<00:01:35.590> films<00:01:36.010> and<00:01:36.160> of<00:01:36.250> course

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
his characters in films and of course

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.470 
his characters in films and of course
he's<00:01:36.520> not<00:01:36.640> he's<00:01:36.850> a<00:01:36.880> really<00:01:37.120> sweet<00:01:37.300> sweet<00:01:37.780> man<00:01:38.080> I

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 
he's not he's a really sweet sweet man I

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.340 
he's not he's a really sweet sweet man I
take<00:01:40.480> that<00:01:40.660> back

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
take that back

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.010 
take that back
the<00:01:41.680> worst<00:01:41.890> part<00:01:42.420> there's<00:01:43.420> people<00:01:43.600> believing

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
the worst part there's people believing

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.150 
the worst part there's people believing
everything<00:01:44.320> they<00:01:44.560> read<00:01:44.710> in<00:01:44.830> the<00:01:44.860> newspapers

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
everything they read in the newspapers

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.590 
everything they read in the newspapers
maybe<00:01:48.160> only<00:01:48.430> for<00:01:48.880> you<00:01:49.240> to<00:01:49.270> have<00:01:49.480> this

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
maybe only for you to have this

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.230 
maybe only for you to have this
I<00:01:54.690> think<00:01:55.690> the<00:01:56.260> two<00:01:56.470> best<00:01:57.070> performances<00:01:57.700> that

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
I think the two best performances that

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.020 
I think the two best performances that
I've<00:01:58.360> given<00:01:58.510> these<00:01:58.810> films<00:01:59.050> so<00:01:59.230> far<00:01:59.260> of<00:02:00.030> three

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
I've given these films so far of three

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.050 
I've given these films so far of three
and<00:02:01.180> five<00:02:01.360> and<00:02:01.900> I<00:02:02.440> think<00:02:02.770> that<00:02:02.980> is<00:02:03.130> in<00:02:03.640> part<00:02:03.850> to

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
and five and I think that is in part to

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.300 
and five and I think that is in part to
do<00:02:04.180> it<00:02:04.240> further<00:02:04.450> I<00:02:04.630> have<00:02:04.660> Gary<00:02:05.050> Oldman<00:02:05.440> around

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
do it further I have Gary Oldman around
