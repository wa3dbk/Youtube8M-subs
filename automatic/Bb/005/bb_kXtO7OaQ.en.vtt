we're<00:00:38.520> just<00:00:38.550> beating<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.000> crap<00:00:39.149> out<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.450> the

we're just beating the crap out of the

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.190 
we're just beating the crap out of the
drum<00:00:39.870> more<00:00:40.739> often<00:00:40.920> than<00:00:41.219> not<00:00:41.280> it's<00:00:42.270> from<00:00:42.629> the

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
drum more often than not it's from the

drum more often than not it's from the
Tom<00:00:43.469> angles<00:00:43.940> being<00:00:44.940> too<00:00:45.210> steep<00:00:46.129> ideally<00:00:47.129> you

Tom angles being too steep ideally you

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.910 
Tom angles being too steep ideally you
want<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.760> make<00:00:47.910> sure<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.530> when<00:00:49.530> your<00:00:49.680> stick

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
want to make sure that when your stick

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.830 
want to make sure that when your stick
hits<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.430> drumhead<00:00:50.700> it's<00:00:51.059> about<00:00:51.329> as<00:00:51.510> flat<00:00:51.809> as

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
hits the drumhead it's about as flat as

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.290 
hits the drumhead it's about as flat as
possible<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.829> that's<00:00:53.730> going<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.969> get<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.180> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
possible and that's going to get you the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.540 
possible and that's going to get you the
most<00:00:54.539> amount<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.899> rebound<00:00:55.379> off<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.710> drum<00:00:56.370> head

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
most amount of rebound off the drum head

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.490 
most amount of rebound off the drum head
if<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.699> have<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.879> steep<00:00:57.149> angle<00:00:57.449> it's<00:00:58.320> just

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
if you have a steep angle it's just

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.020 
if you have a steep angle it's just
going<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.680> dig<00:00:58.980> into<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.399> drum<00:00:59.640> it's<00:00:59.850> not

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
going to dig into the drum it's not

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.510 
going to dig into the drum it's not
going<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.300> give<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.480> very<00:01:00.690> much<00:01:00.870> bounce<00:01:01.170> back

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
going to give you very much bounce back

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.880 
going to give you very much bounce back
it's<00:01:02.520> not<00:01:02.670> going<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.940> sound<00:01:03.149> very<00:01:03.270> good<00:01:03.660> and

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
it's not going to sound very good and

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.080 
it's not going to sound very good and
also<00:01:04.890> you're<00:01:05.159> going<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.339> be<00:01:05.430> out<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.610> drumhead

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
also you're going to be out a drumhead

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.510 
also you're going to be out a drumhead
pretty<00:01:06.510> quick<00:01:06.810> an<00:01:07.110> easy<00:01:07.830> way<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.250> get<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
pretty quick an easy way to get the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.429 
pretty quick an easy way to get the
placement<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.030> take<00:01:09.210> your<00:01:09.390> stick<00:01:09.630> where<00:01:10.260> this

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
placement is take your stick where this

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.859 
placement is take your stick where this
Tom<00:01:10.740> head<00:01:10.979> would<00:01:11.189> be<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.670> see<00:01:12.479> where<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.720> most

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
Tom head would be and see where the most

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.630 
Tom head would be and see where the most
comfortable<00:01:13.380> playing<00:01:13.680> spot<00:01:14.010> for<00:01:14.280> your<00:01:14.400> hand

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
comfortable playing spot for your hand

comfortable playing spot for your hand
is<00:01:14.850> this<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.750> not<00:01:15.930> very<00:01:15.960> comfy<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.640> not

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
is this is not very comfy this is not

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.510 
is this is not very comfy this is not
very<00:01:17.820> comfy<00:01:18.450> right<00:01:19.009> just<00:01:20.009> as<00:01:20.130> if<00:01:20.340> you're

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
very comfy right just as if you're

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.690 
very comfy right just as if you're
you're<00:01:21.200> using<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.409> hammer<00:01:23.390> natural<00:01:24.390> motion

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
you're using a hammer natural motion

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.730 
you're using a hammer natural motion
find<00:01:26.700> where<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:26.939> Tom<00:01:27.330> should<00:01:27.630> be<00:01:27.810> at<00:01:28.080> that

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
find where that Tom should be at that

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.910 
find where that Tom should be at that
angle<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.369> then<00:01:29.850> place<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.420> Tom<00:01:30.920> head

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
angle and then place the Tom head

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.700 
angle and then place the Tom head
accordingly<00:01:32.670> now<00:01:33.450> your<00:01:33.689> floor<00:01:33.960> tom<00:01:34.229> or

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
accordingly now your floor tom or

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.600 
accordingly now your floor tom or
multiple<00:01:35.340> floor<00:01:35.549> toms<00:01:37.159> should<00:01:38.159> probably<00:01:38.520> be

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
multiple floor toms should probably be

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.399 
multiple floor toms should probably be
relatively<00:01:39.090> flat<00:01:39.420> or<00:01:39.659> slightly<00:01:40.020> angled

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
relatively flat or slightly angled

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.410 
relatively flat or slightly angled
towards<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.070> if<00:01:41.250> you're<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:41.939> traditional

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
towards you if you're in traditional

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.240 
towards you if you're in traditional
grip<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:43.079> might<00:01:43.259> explore<00:01:43.710> an<00:01:43.860> angle<00:01:44.159> that

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
grip you might explore an angle that

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.249 
grip you might explore an angle that
actually<00:01:44.610> goes<00:01:44.790> away<00:01:45.090> from<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.810> little<00:01:46.140> bit

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
actually goes away from you a little bit

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.929 
actually goes away from you a little bit
and<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.799> accommodates<00:01:47.340> for<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:47.670> downward

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
and that accommodates for this downward

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.149 
and that accommodates for this downward
angle<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.630> personally<00:01:49.200> like<00:01:49.439> my<00:01:49.619> floor<00:01:49.890> tom

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
angle I personally like my floor tom

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.940 
angle I personally like my floor tom
flat<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.210> slightly<00:01:51.869> lower<00:01:52.229> than<00:01:52.380> my<00:01:52.649> snare

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
flat and slightly lower than my snare

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.700 
flat and slightly lower than my snare
drum<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.479> it<00:01:54.479> makes<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.780> very<00:01:54.810> easy<00:01:55.110> for<00:01:55.439> me<00:01:55.680> to

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
drum and it makes it very easy for me to

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.300 
drum and it makes it very easy for me to
come<00:01:55.950> off<00:01:56.360> also<00:01:57.360> make<00:01:57.570> sure<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:59.009> drums

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
come off also make sure that the drums

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.580 
come off also make sure that the drums
are<00:01:59.579> as<00:01:59.790> easy<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.479> get<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.869> as<00:02:01.020> possible

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
are as easy to get to as possible

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.649 
are as easy to get to as possible
especially<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:02.250> floor<00:02:02.579> tom<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.390> want<00:02:03.600> to

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
especially this floor tom you want to

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.179 
especially this floor tom you want to
make<00:02:03.780> sure<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.229> drums<00:02:04.469> that<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.740> access

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
make sure that the drums that you access
