00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.839 
working on the emerging tick problem in
Ohio<00:00:06.629> here<00:00:07.290> in<00:00:07.379> Ohio<00:00:07.589> we<00:00:07.770> really<00:00:08.040> have<00:00:08.250> three

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
Ohio here in Ohio we really have three

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.000 
Ohio here in Ohio we really have three
kinds<00:00:09.179> of<00:00:09.300> ticks<00:00:09.830> lonestar's

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
kinds of ticks lonestar's

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.720 
kinds of ticks lonestar's
dog<00:00:11.759> ticks<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.830> black<00:00:13.830> legged<00:00:14.130> or<00:00:14.219> deer<00:00:14.460> ticks

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
dog ticks and black legged or deer ticks

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.490 
dog ticks and black legged or deer ticks
and<00:00:15.120> they<00:00:15.480> each<00:00:15.660> sort<00:00:16.020> of<00:00:16.080> live<00:00:16.289> in<00:00:16.320> a

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
and they each sort of live in a

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.529 
and they each sort of live in a
different<00:00:16.680> habitat<00:00:17.220> so<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.060> first<00:00:18.270> thing<00:00:18.449> you

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
different habitat so the first thing you

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.779 
different habitat so the first thing you
need<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.779> do<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.050> become<00:00:19.350> aware<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.920> where<00:00:20.670> the

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
need to do is become aware of where the

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.330 
need to do is become aware of where the
ticks<00:00:21.029> are<00:00:21.270> so<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.289> know<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.470> go<00:00:22.740> be

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
ticks are so that you know to go be

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.769 
ticks are so that you know to go be
prepared<00:00:23.760> before<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:24.060> walk<00:00:24.330> into<00:00:24.630> those

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
prepared before you walk into those

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.019 
prepared before you walk into those
areas<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.279> if<00:00:26.640> you're<00:00:26.760> going<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.970> be

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
areas and so if you're going to be

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.419 
areas and so if you're going to be
walking<00:00:27.150> into<00:00:27.449> grassy<00:00:27.750> areas<00:00:28.310> that's<00:00:29.310> where

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
walking into grassy areas that's where

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.060 
walking into grassy areas that's where
the<00:00:29.640> American<00:00:30.029> dog<00:00:30.179> tick<00:00:30.210> lives<00:00:30.920> the<00:00:31.920> other

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
the American dog tick lives the other

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.979 
the American dog tick lives the other
tick<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.520> lone<00:00:32.759> Star<00:00:32.910> tick<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.540> that's

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
tick is a lone Star tick and that's

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.360 
tick is a lone Star tick and that's
where<00:00:34.140> we<00:00:34.290> are<00:00:34.320> today<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.770> Lone<00:00:34.950> Star<00:00:35.190> tick

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
where we are today and Lone Star tick

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.459 
where we are today and Lone Star tick
habitat<00:00:35.850> in<00:00:35.969> southern<00:00:36.270> Ohio<00:00:36.570> they<00:00:37.140> live<00:00:37.350> in

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
habitat in southern Ohio they live in

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.770 
habitat in southern Ohio they live in
more<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.770> shrubby<00:00:38.160> habitat<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.910> then<00:00:39.660> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
more of a shrubby habitat and then the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.260 
more of a shrubby habitat and then the
new<00:00:39.930> bad<00:00:40.140> actor<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.680> Ohio<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.280> black

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
new bad actor in Ohio is the black

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.510 
new bad actor in Ohio is the black
legged<00:00:42.660> or<00:00:42.780> deer<00:00:42.989> tick<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.500> it's<00:00:44.070> found<00:00:44.280> in

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
legged or deer tick and it's found in

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.209 
legged or deer tick and it's found in
wooded<00:00:45.120> habitats<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.770> definitely<00:00:46.950> want

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
wooded habitats and you definitely want

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.450 
wooded habitats and you definitely want
to<00:00:47.399> use<00:00:47.989> repellent<00:00:48.989> if<00:00:49.079> possible<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:50.010> also

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
to use repellent if possible and also

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.580 
to use repellent if possible and also
tuck<00:00:50.700> your<00:00:50.879> pants<00:00:51.149> into<00:00:51.329> your<00:00:51.480> socks<00:00:51.590> we're

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
tuck your pants into your socks we're

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.830 
tuck your pants into your socks we're
light<00:00:52.739> colored<00:00:53.070> clothing<00:00:53.149> this<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.329> mainly<00:00:54.539> so

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
light colored clothing this is mainly so

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.479 
light colored clothing this is mainly so
you<00:00:54.930> can<00:00:55.079> visualize<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.710> ticks<00:00:55.949> crawling<00:00:56.370> on

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
you can visualize the ticks crawling on

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.369 
you can visualize the ticks crawling on
the<00:00:56.610> clothing<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.809> when<00:00:57.960> they<00:00:58.050> get<00:00:58.230> on

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
the clothing and so when they get on

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.349 
the clothing and so when they get on
they<00:00:58.710> crawl<00:00:58.980> up<00:00:59.190> until<00:00:59.520> they<00:00:59.640> find<00:00:59.910> exposed

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
they crawl up until they find exposed

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.569 
they crawl up until they find exposed
skin<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.739> one<00:01:01.890> reason<00:01:02.219> people<00:01:02.250> think

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
skin and this is one reason people think

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.729 
skin and this is one reason people think
that<00:01:03.030> ticks<00:01:03.359> fall<00:01:03.930> out<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.140> trees<00:01:04.439> because

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
that ticks fall out of trees because

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:05.870 
that ticks fall out of trees because
they<00:01:04.860> find<00:01:05.100> them<00:01:05.220> on<00:01:05.339> their<00:01:05.460> head<00:01:05.640> all<00:01:05.790> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
they find them on their head all the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.140 
they find them on their head all the
time

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
time

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.120 
time
so<00:01:06.780> ticks<00:01:07.110> are<00:01:07.290> rarely<00:01:07.470> higher<00:01:07.860> than

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
so ticks are rarely higher than

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.679 
so ticks are rarely higher than
knee-high<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.790> then<00:01:08.939> once<00:01:09.119> they<00:01:09.240> get<00:01:09.360> on<00:01:09.479> they

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
knee-high and then once they get on they

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.740 
knee-high and then once they get on they
crawl<00:01:09.960> up<00:01:10.170> what<00:01:11.130> we<00:01:11.250> really<00:01:11.549> recommend<00:01:12.450> is

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
crawl up what we really recommend is

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.420 
crawl up what we really recommend is
that<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.930> not<00:01:13.110> use<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.530> folk<00:01:13.710> methods<00:01:14.159> that

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
that you not use the folk methods that

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.010 
that you not use the folk methods that
people<00:01:14.729> try<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.000> do<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.330> get<00:01:15.420> ticks<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.869> back

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
people try to do to get ticks to back

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.310 
people try to do to get ticks to back
off<00:01:16.229> first<00:01:17.009> they<00:01:17.220> don't<00:01:17.759> work<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.299> number<00:01:19.170> two

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
off first they don't work and number two

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.300 
off first they don't work and number two
they<00:01:19.470> may<00:01:19.619> be<00:01:19.680> dangerous<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.869> and<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.740> and

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
they may be dangerous and and so and

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.760 
they may be dangerous and and so and
also<00:01:23.700> they<00:01:24.060> delay<00:01:24.330> removal<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.560> takes

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
also they delay removal so it takes

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.760 
also they delay removal so it takes
about<00:01:26.570> 24<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.720> 48<00:01:28.020> hours<00:01:28.140> for<00:01:28.500> disease

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
about 24 to 48 hours for disease

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.980 
about 24 to 48 hours for disease
transmission<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.579> occur<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.570> really

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
transmission to occur so you really

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.929 
transmission to occur so you really
shouldn't<00:01:31.290> delay<00:01:31.520> wouldn't<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.579> ticks<00:01:32.790> are

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
shouldn't delay wouldn't the ticks are

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:33.289 
shouldn't delay wouldn't the ticks are
found

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
found

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.600 
found
so<00:01:33.390> using<00:01:33.680> jeweler's<00:01:34.680> forceps<00:01:35.159> or<00:01:35.369> tweezers

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
so using jeweler's forceps or tweezers

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.640 
so using jeweler's forceps or tweezers
grabbing<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.600> tick<00:01:36.780> as<00:01:36.930> close<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.470> skin

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
grabbing the tick as close to the skin

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.590 
grabbing the tick as close to the skin
as<00:01:37.829> possible<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.400> pulling<00:01:38.700> with<00:01:39.180> steady<00:01:39.420> even

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
as possible and pulling with steady even

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.690 
as possible and pulling with steady even
pressure<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.770> way<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:40.950> remove<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.490> tick

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
pressure is the way you remove a tick

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.760 
pressure is the way you remove a tick
and<00:01:41.880> then<00:01:42.000> save<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.420> tick<00:01:42.630> especially<00:01:43.590> if<00:01:43.680> you

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.830 
and then save the tick especially if you
start<00:01:43.860> developing<00:01:44.250> symptoms<00:01:44.820> what<00:01:45.720> you're

Mountain spotted fever and so really

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.690 
Mountain spotted fever and so really
three<00:01:58.409> diseases<00:01:58.710> we<00:01:58.979> worry<00:01:59.189> about<00:01:59.250> in<00:01:59.460> Ohio

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
three diseases we worry about in Ohio

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.270 
three diseases we worry about in Ohio
ehrlichiosis<00:02:00.439> which<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:01.590> transmitted<00:02:02.250> by

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
ehrlichiosis which is transmitted by

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.609 
ehrlichiosis which is transmitted by
Lone<00:02:02.549> Star's<00:02:02.930> Rocky<00:02:03.930> Mountain<00:02:04.259> spotted<00:02:04.439> fever

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
Lone Star's Rocky Mountain spotted fever

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.499 
Lone Star's Rocky Mountain spotted fever
which<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.250> transmitted<00:02:05.790> by<00:02:05.820> American<00:02:06.360> dog

which is transmitted by American dog

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.999 
which is transmitted by American dog
ticks<00:02:06.810> but<00:02:06.960> less<00:02:07.170> than<00:02:07.200> two<00:02:07.469> percent<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.950> the

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
ticks but less than two percent of the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.979 
ticks but less than two percent of the
ticks<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.369> Ohio<00:02:08.670> are<00:02:09.179> carriers<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.869> that

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
ticks in Ohio are carriers of that

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.500 
ticks in Ohio are carriers of that
disease<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.530> then<00:02:11.160> Lyme<00:02:11.489> disease<00:02:11.819> associated

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
disease and then Lyme disease associated

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.229 
disease and then Lyme disease associated
with

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
with

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.630 
with
with<00:02:13.629> the<00:02:13.780> black<00:02:13.989> legged<00:02:14.319> Deer<00:02:14.500> Tick<00:02:14.769> so<00:02:15.519> if

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
with the black legged Deer Tick so if

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.319 
with the black legged Deer Tick so if
there<00:02:15.790> any<00:02:15.909> unusual<00:02:16.239> symptoms<00:02:16.569> a<00:02:17.170> high<00:02:17.650> fever

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
there any unusual symptoms a high fever

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.360 
there any unusual symptoms a high fever
flu-like<00:02:19.329> symptoms<00:02:19.989> then<00:02:20.470> take<00:02:20.980> that<00:02:21.129> tick

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
flu-like symptoms then take that tick

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.470 
flu-like symptoms then take that tick
with<00:02:21.549> you<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:21.849> your<00:02:22.090> health<00:02:22.269> care

with you to your health care

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.970 
with you to your health care
professional<00:02:23.079> and<00:02:23.230> then<00:02:23.680> they'll<00:02:23.829> be

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
professional and then they'll be

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.220 
professional and then they'll be
thinking<00:02:24.459> possibly<00:02:25.120> a<00:02:25.450> tick-borne<00:02:25.720> disease

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
thinking possibly a tick-borne disease

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.410 
thinking possibly a tick-borne disease
and<00:02:26.709> we<00:02:27.099> don't<00:02:27.250> do<00:02:27.370> any<00:02:27.549> testing<00:02:27.939> of<00:02:28.060> ticks<00:02:28.269> in

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
and we don't do any testing of ticks in

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.089 
and we don't do any testing of ticks in
Ohio<00:02:28.689> really<00:02:29.349> you<00:02:29.409> should<00:02:29.560> start<00:02:29.829> treatment

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
Ohio really you should start treatment

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.220 
Ohio really you should start treatment
before<00:02:30.609> any<00:02:30.819> tick<00:02:31.060> is<00:02:31.239> tested<00:02:31.989> for<00:02:32.019> any

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
before any tick is tested for any

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.020 
before any tick is tested for any
disease<00:02:32.920> that's<00:02:33.189> really<00:02:33.489> not<00:02:33.640> going<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:33.849> help

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030

then a couple of websites one is called

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.039 
then a couple of websites one is called
tick<00:03:01.810> encounter<00:03:02.409> and<00:03:02.730> that<00:03:03.730> has<00:03:03.939> the<00:03:04.659> seasonal

tick encounter and that has the seasonal

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.050 
tick encounter and that has the seasonal
activity<00:03:06.040> of<00:03:06.129> ticks<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:06.579> the<00:03:06.670> disease<00:03:06.879> is

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060

transmitted<00:03:07.659> by<00:03:07.810> ticks<00:03:08.109> and<00:03:08.680> then<00:03:09.280> there's

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
transmitted by ticks and then there's

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.979

sorts of information on tickle

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.039 
sorts of information on tickle
identification<00:03:15.579> what<00:03:16.480> diseases<00:03:16.930> they

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
identification what diseases they

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.809 
identification what diseases they
transmit<00:03:17.620> what<00:03:17.859> to<00:03:17.949> do<00:03:18.099> about<00:03:18.220> them<00:03:18.579> and<00:03:18.730> that

transmit what to do about them and that

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.400 
transmit what to do about them and that
sort<00:03:19.120> of<00:03:19.180> thing<00:03:19.359> so<00:03:19.569> those<00:03:19.780> are<00:03:19.930> those<00:03:20.260> are

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
sort of thing so those are those are

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.770

good<00:03:20.680> places<00:03:20.889> to<00:03:21.069> start<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:21.639> then<00:03:22.150> finally<00:03:22.750> I

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
good places to start and then finally I

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.409 
good places to start and then finally I
guess<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.139> CDC<00:03:23.620> if<00:03:24.250> you<00:03:24.400> put<00:03:24.609> CDC<00:03:25.120> and

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:25.419 
guess the CDC if you put CDC and
