point oh this shows the six channel set

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.549 
point oh this shows the six channel set
up<00:00:09.719> it<00:00:10.620> has<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:10.980> apo<00:00:11.460> five<00:00:11.820> motor<00:00:12.469> running<00:00:13.469> on

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
up it has the apo five motor running on

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.760 
up it has the apo five motor running on
two<00:00:13.769> cells<00:00:14.299> and<00:00:15.299> I've<00:00:15.690> got<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:16.109> lot<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.350> mixing

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
two cells and I've got a lot of mixing

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.650 
two cells and I've got a lot of mixing
going<00:00:17.130> on<00:00:17.279> which<00:00:17.520> should<00:00:17.910> make<00:00:18.060> life<00:00:18.330> kind<00:00:18.600> of

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
going on which should make life kind of

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.450 
going on which should make life kind of
fun<00:00:19.070> one<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.189> them<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:21.619> I've<00:00:22.619> got<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:22.949> second

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
fun one of them is I've got a second

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.730 
fun one of them is I've got a second
etalon<00:00:23.760> servo<00:00:24.150> so<00:00:24.359> now<00:00:24.510> we<00:00:24.570> can<00:00:25.019> do<00:00:25.140> flapper<00:00:25.470> on

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
etalon servo so now we can do flapper on

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.660 
etalon servo so now we can do flapper on
I<00:00:26.039> should<00:00:26.730> say<00:00:26.910> yeah<00:00:27.949> flapper<00:00:28.949> on<00:00:29.220> with<00:00:29.580> the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
I should say yeah flapper on with the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.269 
I should say yeah flapper on with the
elevator<00:00:30.109> and<00:00:31.109> kick<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.590> off<00:00:31.619> or<00:00:32.009> we<00:00:32.130> can

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
elevator and kick that off or we can

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.020 
elevator and kick that off or we can
just<00:00:32.309> use<00:00:32.579> them<00:00:32.730> as<00:00:32.850> straight<00:00:33.120> up<00:00:33.270> flaps<00:00:35.030> and

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
just use them as straight up flaps and

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.310 
just use them as straight up flaps and
you're<00:00:36.149> going<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.300> add<00:00:36.480> two<00:00:36.510> cells<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.200> do

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
you're going to add two cells you do

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.240 
you're going to add two cells you do
pick<00:00:37.710> up<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.950> little<00:00:38.190> weight<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:38.690> this<00:00:39.690> should

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
pick up a little weight so this should

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.950 
pick up a little weight so this should
aid<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.640> landings<00:00:42.090> with<00:00:42.540> elevator

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
aid in the landings with elevator

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.580 
aid in the landings with elevator
compensation<00:00:46.640> also<00:00:47.660> below<00:00:48.660> half<00:00:48.930> throttle<00:00:49.260> or

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
compensation also below half throttle or

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.130 
compensation also below half throttle or
below<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.160> third<00:00:50.489> throttle<00:00:50.969> rhetoric<00:00:51.930> kicks

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
below the third throttle rhetoric kicks

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.430 
below the third throttle rhetoric kicks
in<00:00:52.379> coupled<00:00:53.280> rudders<00:00:54.020> so<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.199> when<00:00:55.320> you've

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
in coupled rudders so that when you've

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.760 
in coupled rudders so that when you've
got<00:00:55.620> flashed<00:00:55.949> down<00:00:56.250> use<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:57.350> rudder<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.620> help

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
got flashed down use that rudder to help

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.860 
got flashed down use that rudder to help
you<00:00:58.920> out<00:00:58.980> there<00:01:00.230> also<00:01:01.230> added<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.750> put<00:01:03.750> and

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
you out there also added to it put and

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.420 
you out there also added to it put and
resist<00:01:04.199> this<00:01:04.409> because<00:01:04.799> they<00:01:04.949> were<00:01:05.010> just<00:01:05.220> so

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
resist this because they were just so

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.820 
resist this because they were just so
cool<00:01:05.700> are<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.930> little<00:01:07.470> tiny<00:01:07.799> bright<00:01:08.130> lights

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
cool are the little tiny bright lights

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.910 
cool are the little tiny bright lights
so<00:01:10.830> they're<00:01:11.010> pretty<00:01:11.250> slick<00:01:11.549> they<00:01:11.760> got<00:01:12.920> landing

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
so they're pretty slick they got landing

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.510 
so they're pretty slick they got landing
light<00:01:14.070> strobe<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:15.110> an<00:01:16.110> wingtip<00:01:17.009> lights<00:01:18.170> so

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
light strobe and an wingtip lights so

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.800 
light strobe and an wingtip lights so
they've<00:01:20.520> got<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.850> down<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.210> point<00:01:21.570> nine

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
they've got it down to a point nine

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.170 
they've got it down to a point nine
grams<00:01:22.259> on<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.740> lighting<00:01:23.610> system<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.150> that

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
grams on the lighting system so that

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:32.120 
grams on the lighting system so that
really<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.810> good<00:01:25.759> the<00:01:27.530> servos<00:01:30.229> mid<00:01:31.229> 8th<00:01:31.380> slide

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
really is good the servos mid 8th slide

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.249 
really is good the servos mid 8th slide
off<00:01:32.310> hat<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:32.970> can<00:01:33.090> just<00:01:33.119> slide<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.689> lift<00:01:34.140> it

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
off hat so you can just slide it lift it

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.230 
off hat so you can just slide it lift it
off<00:01:36.650> and<00:01:37.650> hear<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.520> don't<00:01:38.880> know<00:01:38.939> if<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.090> can

off and hear it I don't know if you can
see<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.509> or<00:01:39.720> not<00:01:39.900> with<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:40.860> little<00:01:41.130> camcorder

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
see it or not with this little camcorder

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:47.330 
see it or not with this little camcorder
but<00:01:43.850> well<00:01:44.850> there's<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:46.619> can<00:01:46.770> see<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.130> two

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
but well there's a you can see the two

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:55.310 
but well there's a you can see the two
to<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.450> two<00:01:48.630> aileron<00:01:49.079> servo<00:01:49.110> there

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.510 

wat<00:01:56.320> that<00:01:56.530> are<00:01:56.649> all<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.799> way<00:01:56.890> around<00:01:57.009> and<00:01:57.460> then

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
wat that are all the way around and then

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.450 
wat that are all the way around and then
this<00:01:58.210> ap<00:01:58.570> 05<00:01:58.930> running<00:01:59.259> on<00:01:59.380> two<00:01:59.590> cells<00:01:59.920> well<00:02:00.189> I

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
this ap 05 running on two cells well I

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.360 
this ap 05 running on two cells well I
think<00:02:01.390> it's<00:02:01.659> just<00:02:03.329> gonna<00:02:04.329> be<00:02:04.479> just

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
think it's just gonna be just

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:12.930 
think it's just gonna be just
Gary<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.960> power<00:02:08.200> on<00:02:08.500> it<00:02:08.650> is<00:02:08.800> a<00:02:09.540> pretty<00:02:10.540> intense
