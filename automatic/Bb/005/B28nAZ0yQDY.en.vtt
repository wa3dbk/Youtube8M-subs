character look flat by just painting on
the<00:01:10.320> makeup<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:11.400> if<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.790> use<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.000> stipple

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
the makeup so if you use a stipple

effect<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.140> sponge<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:14.159> gives<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.610> nice

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
effect of the sponge it gives a nice

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.630 
effect of the sponge it gives a nice
natural<00:01:15.270> texture<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.490> overall<00:01:18.080> color<00:01:19.080> and

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
natural texture to the overall color and

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.050 
natural texture to the overall color and
also<00:01:20.640> gives<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.939> bit<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.270> uneven<00:01:22.759> spaces<00:01:23.759> here

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
also gives a bit of uneven spaces here

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.120 
also gives a bit of uneven spaces here
and<00:01:24.270> there<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.869> it's<00:01:24.990> not<00:01:25.290> just<00:01:25.799> one

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
and there so that it's not just one

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.319 
and there so that it's not just one
solid<00:01:26.869> color<00:01:27.869> give<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.860> face<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.460> bit<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:30.030> depth

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
solid color give the face a bit of depth

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.260 
solid color give the face a bit of depth
I<00:01:30.540> use<00:01:30.930> shadows<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.860> certain<00:01:32.220> areas<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:33.090> make

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
I use shadows in certain areas to make

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.560 
I use shadows in certain areas to make
the<00:01:33.509> skin<00:01:33.840> seemed<00:01:34.470> as<00:01:34.650> though<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.220> was<00:01:35.579> getting

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
the skin seemed as though it was getting

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.260 
the skin seemed as though it was getting
closer<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.259> skull<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:38.130> then<00:01:38.939> used

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
closer to the skull I then used

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.300 
closer to the skull I then used
highlights<00:01:39.840> against<00:01:40.320> those<00:01:40.439> shadows<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.130> make

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
highlights against those shadows to make

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.179 
highlights against those shadows to make
a<00:01:41.340> contrast<00:01:42.060> pop<00:01:42.329> even<00:01:42.659> further<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.710> give<00:01:43.920> a

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
a contrast pop even further to give a

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.300 
a contrast pop even further to give a
emaciated<00:01:45.149> walk<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.810> his<00:01:45.930> face<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:46.920> after<00:01:47.040> an

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
emaciated walk to his face so after an

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.399 
emaciated walk to his face so after an
hour<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> half<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:48.149> applying<00:01:48.570> liquid<00:01:48.840> latex

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
hour and a half of applying liquid latex

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.460 
hour and a half of applying liquid latex
oil-based<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.670> alcohol<00:01:51.210> activated<00:01:51.570> makeups

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
oil-based and alcohol activated makeups

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.049 
oil-based and alcohol activated makeups
we<00:01:52.950> finally<00:01:53.220> get<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.850> zombified<00:01:54.390> Franklin
