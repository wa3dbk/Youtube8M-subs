00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
we're gonna see if we can't make us some

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.540 
we're gonna see if we can't make us some
clothing<00:00:50.570> and<00:00:50.840> make<00:00:51.050> it<00:00:51.170> out<00:00:51.320> into<00:00:51.550> 100%

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
clothing and make it out into 100%

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.460 
clothing and make it out into 100%
cotton<00:00:52.820> you<00:00:53.390> know<00:00:53.570> the<00:00:53.750> advantages<00:00:54.410> and

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
cotton you know the advantages and

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.010 
cotton you know the advantages and
disadvantages<00:00:55.400> of<00:00:55.700> that<00:00:55.760> but<00:00:56.570> we'll<00:00:56.780> see<00:00:56.989> how

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
disadvantages of that but we'll see how

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.389 
disadvantages of that but we'll see how
it<00:00:57.470> turns<00:00:57.860> out<00:00:58.220> as<00:00:58.579> far<00:00:58.910> as<00:00:58.940> a<00:00:59.560> earth<00:01:00.560> tone<00:01:00.950> type

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
it turns out as far as a earth tone type

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.270 
it turns out as far as a earth tone type
color<00:01:01.760> and<00:01:02.260> if<00:01:03.260> that's<00:01:03.560> something<00:01:03.829> that<00:01:04.070> we

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
color and if that's something that we

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.370 
color and if that's something that we
can<00:01:04.460> utilize<00:01:04.610> when<00:01:05.180> we're<00:01:05.360> out<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:05.750> woods<00:01:05.960> so

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
can utilize when we're out the woods so

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:14.740 
can utilize when we're out the woods so
stay<00:01:06.620> with<00:01:06.830> me<00:01:06.890> I'll<00:01:07.130> be<00:01:07.280> right<00:01:07.310> back<00:01:13.510> okay<00:01:14.510> all

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
stay with me I'll be right back okay all

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.410 
stay with me I'll be right back okay all
I'm<00:01:14.900> gonna<00:01:15.080> do<00:01:15.350> to<00:01:15.620> make<00:01:15.830> this<00:01:16.040> dye<00:01:16.370> is<00:01:16.909> I've

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
I'm gonna do to make this dye is I've

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.350 
I'm gonna do to make this dye is I've
got<00:01:17.659> a<00:01:17.690> pot<00:01:18.650> of<00:01:18.860> water<00:01:18.890> here<00:01:19.400> on<00:01:19.430> the<00:01:19.580> stove<00:01:19.760> and

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
got a pot of water here on the stove and

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.330 
got a pot of water here on the stove and
I<00:01:20.420> guess<00:01:20.630> that<00:01:20.870> I<00:01:21.409> probably<00:01:21.740> got<00:01:22.010> about<00:01:22.280> a

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
I guess that I probably got about a

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.969 
I guess that I probably got about a
gallon<00:01:22.729> or<00:01:23.000> so<00:01:23.030> in<00:01:23.420> there<00:01:23.659> and<00:01:24.470> I'm<00:01:24.590> gonna<00:01:24.740> take

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
gallon or so in there and I'm gonna take

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.410 
gallon or so in there and I'm gonna take
this<00:01:25.450> walnut<00:01:26.450> and<00:01:26.659> break<00:01:27.560> it<00:01:27.770> up<00:01:27.950> and<00:01:28.700> get<00:01:29.390> it

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
this walnut and break it up and get it

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.899 
this walnut and break it up and get it
into<00:01:29.810> some<00:01:29.990> small<00:01:30.320> or<00:01:30.560> workable<00:01:31.250> pieces<00:01:31.729> so

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
into some small or workable pieces so

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.850 
into some small or workable pieces so
that<00:01:32.090> we<00:01:32.210> can<00:01:32.390> get<00:01:32.570> all<00:01:32.750> of<00:01:32.930> that<00:01:32.960> dye<00:01:33.320> out<00:01:33.650> of

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
that we can get all of that dye out of

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.469 
that we can get all of that dye out of
there<00:01:35.049> walnuts<00:01:36.049> are<00:01:36.320> full<00:01:36.619> of<00:01:37.119> tannin<00:01:38.119> and

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
there walnuts are full of tannin and

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.230 
there walnuts are full of tannin and
iodine<00:01:39.310> and<00:01:40.310> I<00:01:40.460> think<00:01:40.729> that's<00:01:40.940> going<00:01:41.090> to<00:01:41.150> be

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
iodine and I think that's going to be

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.870 
iodine and I think that's going to be
good<00:01:41.570> for<00:01:41.810> us<00:01:41.960> as<00:01:42.110> far<00:01:42.350> as<00:01:42.409> creating<00:01:43.250> our<00:01:43.520> dyes

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
good for us as far as creating our dyes

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.539 
good for us as far as creating our dyes
I<00:01:44.299> understand<00:01:44.900> that<00:01:45.290> in<00:01:45.470> the<00:01:46.130> more<00:01:46.340> ancient

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
I understand that in the more ancient

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.810 
I understand that in the more ancient
times<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.420> Indians<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:48.350> other<00:01:48.979> peoples<00:01:49.520> have

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
times the Indians and other peoples have

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.020 
times the Indians and other peoples have
used<00:01:50.180> this<00:01:50.510> particular<00:01:50.960> dye<00:01:51.820> for<00:01:52.820> their

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
used this particular dye for their

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.020 
used this particular dye for their
camouflage<00:01:53.619> so<00:01:54.619> we're<00:01:55.369> going<00:01:55.490> to<00:01:55.580> give<00:01:55.790> that<00:01:55.820> a

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
camouflage so we're going to give that a

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.499 
camouflage so we're going to give that a
shot<00:01:56.360> I<00:01:56.750> thought<00:01:57.470> it<00:01:57.619> would<00:01:57.770> be<00:01:57.890> a<00:01:57.920> fun<00:01:58.250> project

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
shot I thought it would be a fun project

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.960 
shot I thought it would be a fun project
now<00:01:59.509> a<00:01:59.900> warning<00:02:00.560> about<00:02:00.979> this<00:02:01.189> stuff<00:02:01.490> if<00:02:01.790> you

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.150 
just plain old flat colored soil and I
think<00:03:29.630> that<00:03:29.840> would<00:03:30.050> blend<00:03:30.290> in<00:03:30.530> a<00:03:30.560> real<00:03:30.800> beauty

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160
