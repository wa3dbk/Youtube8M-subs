00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
um right now I'm gaming in a two KDP 15

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.510 
um right now I'm gaming in a two KDP 15
not<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.989> red<00:00:55.140> one<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.379> walnut<00:00:56.010> one<00:00:56.219> with<00:00:56.430> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
not the red one the walnut one with the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.010 
not the red one the walnut one with the
black<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.789> think<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.329> guys<00:00:57.480> have<00:00:57.690> seen<00:00:57.870> that

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
black I think you guys have seen that

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.889 
black I think you guys have seen that
one<00:00:58.289> not<00:00:58.940> basically<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.059> love<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.539> pattern

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
one not basically I love that pattern

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.070 
one not basically I love that pattern
that<00:01:00.960> left<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.410> glove<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.800> can't<00:01:01.980> put<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.250> down

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
that left that glove I can't put it down

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.320 
that left that glove I can't put it down
so<00:01:04.189> that's<00:01:05.189> why<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.460> kind<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.880> held<00:01:06.060> off<00:01:06.180> my

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
so that's why I kind of held off my

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.840 
so that's why I kind of held off my
breaking<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.810> one<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.320> mean<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.220> use<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.610> I

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
breaking this one in I mean I use it I

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.880 
breaking this one in I mean I use it I
usually<00:01:09.510> take<00:01:09.720> some<00:01:09.930> ground<00:01:10.110> balls<00:01:10.229> with<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.740> I

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
usually take some ground balls with it I

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.490 
usually take some ground balls with it I
haven't<00:01:11.250> bobbled<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.610> ball<00:01:12.080> it<00:01:13.080> just<00:01:13.290> feels

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
haven't bobbled the ball it just feels

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.469 
haven't bobbled the ball it just feels
really<00:01:13.680> good<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:15.380> um<00:01:16.380> yeah<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.520> basically<00:01:17.970> it

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
really good so um yeah so basically it

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.179 
really good so um yeah so basically it
is<00:01:18.540> got<00:01:19.500> black<00:01:20.280> mesh<00:01:20.630> with<00:01:21.680> white<00:01:22.680> well<00:01:22.979> theme

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
is got black mesh with white well theme

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.660 
is got black mesh with white well theme
and<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.790> mean<00:01:24.119> very<00:01:24.360> well<00:01:24.509> things<00:01:24.840> already<00:01:25.670> with

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
and I mean very well things already with

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.010 
and I mean very well things already with
the<00:01:26.790> tan<00:01:27.030> palm<00:01:27.710> it's<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.799> pro<00:01:29.040> 200<00:01:29.280> pattern

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
the tan palm it's a pro 200 pattern

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.420 
the tan palm it's a pro 200 pattern
which<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.200> kind<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.770> between<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:34.369> okay<00:01:35.369> so

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
which is kind of in between the okay so

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.350 
which is kind of in between the okay so
the<00:01:35.670> NP<00:01:36.180> patterns<00:01:36.570> are<00:01:36.750> very<00:01:36.780> flat<00:01:37.909> the<00:01:38.909> dj2

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
the NP patterns are very flat the dj2

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.960 
the NP patterns are very flat the dj2
pattern<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.170> kind<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.439> in<00:01:40.650> between<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.280> NP<00:01:41.939> and

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
pattern is kind of in between the NP and

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.960 
pattern is kind of in between the NP and
the<00:01:42.180> pro<00:01:42.360> 200<00:01:42.840> patterns<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.979> 200<00:01:44.460> patents<00:01:44.850> are

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
the pro 200 patterns the 200 patents are

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.010 
the pro 200 patterns the 200 patents are
considered<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.600> be<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:46.049> deeper<00:01:46.470> patterns<00:01:46.920> but

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
considered to be the deeper patterns but

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.109 
considered to be the deeper patterns but
in<00:01:49.020> my<00:01:49.200> opinion<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.130> not<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.640> deep<00:01:50.850> glove

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
in my opinion this is not a deep glove

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.910 
in my opinion this is not a deep glove
at<00:01:51.240> all<00:01:51.329> especially<00:01:51.840> if<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.229> go<00:01:52.350> conventional

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.429 
one is considered a shortstop pattern
which<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.790> mostly<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.450> shortstop<00:02:07.110> but<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.320> can

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
which is mostly a shortstop but it can

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.890 
which is mostly a shortstop but it can
be<00:02:07.530> used<00:02:07.710> all<00:02:07.890> over<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.190> diamond

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.330 

for<00:02:12.900> second<00:02:13.140> place<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:13.440> would<00:02:13.620> want<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:13.980> little

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
for second place I would want a little

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.130 
for second place I would want a little
bit<00:02:14.489> more<00:02:14.550> shallow<00:02:14.940> glove<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.540> little<00:02:15.750> more

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
bit more shallow glove a little more

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.630 
bit more shallow glove a little more
glove<00:02:16.349> that<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.530> can<00:02:16.709> handle<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.129> little<00:02:17.220> easier

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
glove that I can handle a little easier

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.809 
glove that I can handle a little easier
I<00:02:18.230> panting<00:02:19.230> let's<00:02:19.349> go<00:02:19.410> fine<00:02:19.739> but<00:02:20.069> for<00:02:20.580> second

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
I panting let's go fine but for second

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.809 
I panting let's go fine but for second
base<00:02:20.940> so<00:02:21.090> just<00:02:21.300> prefer<00:02:21.599> smaller<00:02:21.900> glove<00:02:25.819> so

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
base so just prefer smaller glove so

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.900 
base so just prefer smaller glove so
let's<00:02:27.120> see<00:02:27.420> it's<00:02:28.049> God<00:02:28.250> no<00:02:29.250> cracking<00:02:29.790> or

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
let's see it's God no cracking or

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.190 
let's see it's God no cracking or
anything<00:02:30.150> nothing<00:02:30.569> yet

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.900 

so<00:02:34.200> this<00:02:34.410> glove<00:02:34.650> does<00:02:34.890> have<00:02:35.129> the<00:02:35.280> stiffest<00:02:35.700> on

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
so this glove does have the stiffest on

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.300 
so this glove does have the stiffest on
my<00:02:36.030> pinky<00:02:36.390> I've<00:02:36.510> ever<00:02:36.750> felt<00:02:37.080> even<00:02:37.830> with<00:02:38.099> the

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
my pinky I've ever felt even with the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.360 
my pinky I've ever felt even with the
mesh<00:02:39.260> um<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.440> don't<00:02:40.590> think<00:02:40.769> you<00:02:40.860> guys<00:02:40.980> can<00:02:41.220> see

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
mesh um I don't think you guys can see

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.089 
mesh um I don't think you guys can see
this<00:02:41.519> but<00:02:41.880> on<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.599> padding<00:02:42.989> it<00:02:43.440> is<00:02:43.590> white<00:02:43.890> on

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
this but on the padding it is white on

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.650 
this but on the padding it is white on
both<00:02:44.250> sides<00:02:44.579> and<00:02:44.819> if<00:02:44.880> you<00:02:44.940> have<00:02:45.060> watched<00:02:45.329> any

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
both sides and if you have watched any

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.199 
both sides and if you have watched any
of<00:02:45.750> dirty<00:02:46.019> 30<00:02:46.290> videos<00:02:46.799> don't<00:02:47.610> bite<00:02:47.790> stuff<00:02:48.060> is

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
of dirty 30 videos don't bite stuff is

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.780 
of dirty 30 videos don't bite stuff is
the<00:02:48.360> good<00:02:48.510> stuff<00:02:48.890> so<00:02:49.890> if<00:02:49.980> it's<00:02:50.160> white<00:02:50.400> on<00:02:50.430> both

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
the good stuff so if it's white on both

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.150 
the good stuff so if it's white on both
sides<00:02:51.150> that<00:02:51.690> means<00:02:51.900> it's<00:02:52.079> pretty<00:02:52.500> pretty

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
sides that means it's pretty pretty

sides that means it's pretty pretty
stiff<00:02:53.519> and<00:02:53.819> it<00:02:53.970> is<00:02:54.120> pretty<00:02:54.390> stiff<00:02:54.709> so<00:02:57.590> yeah<00:02:58.590> if

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
stiff and it is pretty stiff so yeah if

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.520 
stiff and it is pretty stiff so yeah if
you<00:02:58.950> guys<00:02:59.069> can<00:02:59.370> tell<00:02:59.400> this<00:02:59.910> is<00:03:00.090> a<00:03:00.230> very<00:03:01.230> stiff

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
you guys can tell this is a very stiff

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.869 
you guys can tell this is a very stiff
lug<00:03:01.739> even<00:03:02.010> with<00:03:02.099> the<00:03:02.220> mesh<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.549> mean<00:03:02.700> I've<00:03:02.849> used

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
lug even with the mesh I mean I've used

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.920 
lug even with the mesh I mean I've used
this<00:03:03.209> quite<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.510> bit<00:03:03.599> and<00:03:03.959> it's<00:03:04.860> still<00:03:05.900> you<00:03:06.900> know

this quite a bit and it's still you know
it's<00:03:07.829> stiff

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
it's stiff

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.150 
it's stiff
um<00:03:09.569> if<00:03:10.049> I<00:03:10.170> were<00:03:10.349> to<00:03:10.440> get<00:03:10.590> another<00:03:10.799> proto

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
um if I were to get another proto

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.099 
um if I were to get another proto
Carlmont<00:03:11.519> custom<00:03:11.879> I'm<00:03:12.540> not<00:03:12.750> sure<00:03:12.900> what<00:03:13.019> I

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
Carlmont custom I'm not sure what I

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.550 
Carlmont custom I'm not sure what I
would<00:03:13.170> get<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:14.180> would<00:03:15.180> probably<00:03:15.450> get<00:03:15.750> an<00:03:15.900> NP<00:03:16.260> for

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
would get I would probably get an NP for

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.759 
would get I would probably get an NP for
pattern<00:03:16.980> with<00:03:17.160> an<00:03:17.280> Iowa<00:03:17.639> I<00:03:18.590> don't<00:03:19.590> think<00:03:19.709> I

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
pattern with an Iowa I don't think I

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.680 
pattern with an Iowa I don't think I
would<00:03:19.889> go<00:03:19.920> mesh<00:03:20.250> back<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:20.790> I<00:03:20.850> don't<00:03:21.299> think<00:03:21.569> I

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
would go mesh back and I don't think I

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.599 
would go mesh back and I don't think I
would<00:03:21.840> get<00:03:21.989> preferred<00:03:22.500> leather<00:03:25.190> if<00:03:26.190> I<00:03:26.340> could

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
would get preferred leather if I could

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.910 
would get preferred leather if I could
get<00:03:26.900> I'm<00:03:27.900> not<00:03:27.989> sure<00:03:28.230> where<00:03:28.349> I<00:03:28.380> would<00:03:28.590> get<00:03:28.739> guys

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
get I'm not sure where I would get guys

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.390 
get I'm not sure where I would get guys
so<00:03:29.700> you<00:03:29.790> guys<00:03:29.940> have<00:03:30.120> any<00:03:30.239> ideas<00:03:31.040> leave<00:03:32.040> me<00:03:32.220> some

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
so you guys have any ideas leave me some

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.640 
so you guys have any ideas leave me some
comments<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:33.209> I'll<00:03:33.569> definitely<00:03:34.349> look<00:03:34.500> at

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
comments and I'll definitely look at

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.270 
comments and I'll definitely look at
them<00:03:34.859> but<00:03:35.849> also<00:03:36.000> I<00:03:36.150> just<00:03:36.269> wanted<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.630> say<00:03:36.840> I

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
them but also I just wanted to say I

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.559 
them but also I just wanted to say I
kind<00:03:38.280> of<00:03:38.400> had<00:03:38.549> this<00:03:38.669> idea<00:03:38.819> I<00:03:39.030> have<00:03:39.180> not<00:03:39.299> talked

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
kind of had this idea I have not talked

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.470 
kind of had this idea I have not talked
it<00:03:39.720> over<00:03:39.810> with<00:03:39.989> a<00:03:40.790> grant<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.940> other<00:03:42.060> person<00:03:42.419> on

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
it over with a grant the other person on

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.009 
it over with a grant the other person on
the<00:03:42.599> channel<00:03:43.519> I<00:03:44.519> think<00:03:45.269> we<00:03:45.359> could<00:03:45.540> do<00:03:45.690> a

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
the channel I think we could do a

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.610 
the channel I think we could do a
channel<00:03:46.650> where<00:03:47.280> we<00:03:47.310> have<00:03:48.260> quite<00:03:49.260> a<00:03:49.290> bit<00:03:49.590> of

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
channel where we have quite a bit of

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.190 
channel where we have quite a bit of
people<00:03:49.980> who<00:03:50.130> want<00:03:50.370> to<00:03:50.430> make<00:03:50.609> gloves<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.299> then

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
people who want to make gloves and then

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.710 
people who want to make gloves and then
evolve<00:03:52.829> it<00:03:53.010> into<00:03:53.280> one<00:03:53.459> really<00:03:53.790> big<00:03:54.180> channel

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
evolve it into one really big channel

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.360 
evolve it into one really big channel
with<00:03:55.620> more<00:03:55.980> than<00:03:56.160> one<00:03:56.370> person<00:03:58.040> so<00:03:59.040> we've<00:03:59.160> got

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
with more than one person so we've got

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.210 
with more than one person so we've got
10<00:03:59.970> 15<00:04:00.239> people<00:04:00.720> making<00:04:01.260> videos<00:04:01.620> so<00:04:02.069> it's

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
10 15 people making videos so it's

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.089 
10 15 people making videos so it's
they're<00:04:02.669> constantly<00:04:03.239> coming<00:04:03.599> out<00:04:03.919> so<00:04:04.919> I<00:04:04.950> think

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
they're constantly coming out so I think

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.740 
they're constantly coming out so I think
that<00:04:05.370> would<00:04:05.489> be<00:04:05.639> a<00:04:05.669> good<00:04:05.790> idea<00:04:05.910> we<00:04:06.359> could<00:04:06.569> even

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
that would be a good idea we could even

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.629 
that would be a good idea we could even
you<00:04:07.709> know<00:04:07.829> that<00:04:08.190> could<00:04:08.310> be<00:04:08.400> fun<00:04:09.200> um<00:04:10.280> so<00:04:11.280> yeah<00:04:11.459> if

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
you know that could be fun um so yeah if
