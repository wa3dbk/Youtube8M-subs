 capital 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.100
 so in others although rich in details and many innovations 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.089
 technological 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:28.989
 This is an apartment. 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:30.289
 in the 80's 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.520
 the apartment is actually 400 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.530
 was a couple of guests a young couple southwest of beijing 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.560
 That's when they called me the reform project. 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.820
 03 20 calls four suites only three 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.250
 so she does not want her son to be a reconfiguration of the pop singer 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.580

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.000
 lisboa a client's will was to use 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.130
 see the cold 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.770
 in the social area so I said gate as we will need to be sexy 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.990
 so let's use wood 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.990
 People for that mitchell contrast 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.630
 the most cozy apartment 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.630
 the apartment has 320 square meters 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:13.770
 bill 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.320
 the high standard then I found it brightness candidate 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.320
 also bring more refinement 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.580
 and right at the entrance 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.720
 a swinging door with a detail in iron stick when entering the apartment to 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.890
 sense of environment integration is complete 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.969
 it was in this tone 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:35.969
 was marked and could not grow. 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.140
 he has a measure 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.030
 the small ones 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.530
 relatively small 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.130
 why I thought it was good how to make a great platform strip all dodo 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.640
 brick that we have on this wall as a shelter we'll see what we're going to put in a 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.680
 pivoting door 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.880
 I will send or the king is a modern element 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.900
 and I wanted 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.390
 value wood 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.630
 pulling it 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.340
 as handle solution so I made a track 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.370
 the ofert 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.190
 in that track and I've made a pulling inline horse 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:20.459
 this panel it has exactly the width of the gallery so I grew white wing and 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.459
 consequently increased by law 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:31.229
 I wanted our reaction to defeat 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:34.309
 to make the environment more cozy 

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:37.779
 victor explains carmo fadul the doors 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:41.469
 is access 

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:46.789
 a large bench that serves as a steak with hanging cabinets 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:48.499
 he remains in detention 

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:50.139
 turned pro 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:54.650
 what is very important is very used at night because it is a light told 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.449
 that illuminates 

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:58.059
 practical acts 

00:02:58.059 --> 00:03:00.469
 are served in the 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:02.879
 there in the lunch room 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.879
 We have the Tocantins 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.709
 on these issues that are from the dow Jones on the two basement doors 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.029
 higher 

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:14.269
 that make the 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:15.679
 much more practical 

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:16.799
 because you 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.619
 Had the door she stood on the 

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:21.499
 a position you have made or 

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:24.629
 you have virtually access to the area 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.629
 that part of the moment you want 

00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:34.219
 in the son's bedroom the use of high-gloss lacquer declares the time highlights 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:35.900
 the decoration of the environment 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.419
 the cabinets 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:39.579
 they were all gone 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.319
 makeup 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.329
 with a color 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.880
 if we keep strong it's a very clear thing 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.699
 already the same shade of the wall 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:51.999
 and sliding door systems 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:53.749
 the trio environments 

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:56.759
 the tickets are very big 

00:03:56.759 --> 00:04:00.589
 the doors admit to have access to internal apart of cabinets 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.629
 without needing to occupy 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:05.830
 ahead 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.159
 of the closet with the support of April 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:13.489
 already in her room the children we the other partners like to run with this 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:14.449
 goal 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:15.969
 real part 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:17.400
 4th of the couple 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.190
 armed and spacious growth of almost all customers 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.199
 between the headlines 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.169
 coated by marlos 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:32.150
 in the doubt doubt creates but also another line further away 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.610
 really exists 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.610
 the countries of the region 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.650
 we have 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.029
 internal determination 

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:51.119
 with the pdc that the treaty musicians opens the door to the closet if the sandy 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:55.009
 when the customer does not want delivery notes 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:59.440
 silver-of-house a neighborhood square simply fits the door of that 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:02.880
 session of the year restricted to that internal part 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.309
 Yes, it is from a milk ribbon. 

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:09.129
 I think it affects five of those built-in telescopes so you 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:11.969
 abrams from lost and not fill up with courage 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:15.830
 and special hardware were left on were also used on the sixth on the shelves 

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:20.490
 which were used as a shoemaker 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.030
 with this couple is a couple open to any kind of novelty they have accepted 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.360
 very well 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.360
 our ideas regarding 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.979
 I'm professional the inter finishes 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:40.120
 I also very much the official said 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.740
 has here in the state-of-the-art automation system 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.770
 the hardware finishes of the carpentry resolutions cover 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.460
 expenses 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.979
 without juninho 3 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:55.729
 is to stay here I am worship says everything was very well accepted by the customer wings

 they liked it very much and always said benigni after they asked me 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.529
 to adopt this type of solution 

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:10.439
 this comfort process 

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:12.909
 saw 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:15.909
 sophistication to design 

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:20.829
 as
