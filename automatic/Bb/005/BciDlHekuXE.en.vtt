00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
network well there's something called

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.780 
network well there's something called
click<00:02:13.659> bombing<00:02:16.319> and<00:02:17.319> what<00:02:18.040> click<00:02:18.250> bombing<00:02:18.640> is

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
click bombing and what click bombing is

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.390 
click bombing and what click bombing is
is<00:02:19.090> basically<00:02:19.870> when<00:02:20.230> you<00:02:20.769> have<00:02:20.980> a<00:02:21.010> regular

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
is basically when you have a regular

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.910 
is basically when you have a regular
monetized<00:02:22.150> YouTube<00:02:22.299> account<00:02:22.840> or<00:02:23.049> a<00:02:23.080> more<00:02:23.739> than

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
monetized YouTube account or a more than

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.199 
monetized YouTube account or a more than
I<00:02:24.489> guess<00:02:25.360> a<00:02:25.540> more<00:02:25.900> than<00:02:27.090> monetized<00:02:28.090> YouTube

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
I guess a more than monetized YouTube

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.720 
I guess a more than monetized YouTube
account<00:02:28.659> so<00:02:28.750> let's<00:02:29.019> say<00:02:29.080> you<00:02:29.170> have<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.319> better

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730
