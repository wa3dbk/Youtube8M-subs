sacrifice women around the sack fryer

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.700 
sacrifice women around the sack fryer
real<00:00:38.280> fragile<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.660> just<00:00:39.870> take<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.200> easy

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
real fragile so just take it easy

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.190 
real fragile so just take it easy
gently<00:00:41.700> lift<00:00:41.910> up<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.270> fungus<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.020> dead

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
gently lift up the fungus and the dead

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.680 
gently lift up the fungus and the dead
eggs<00:00:43.500> with<00:00:43.800> your<00:00:43.829> turkey<00:00:44.280> baster<00:00:44.700> helps<00:00:45.629> to

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
eggs with your turkey baster helps to

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.779 
eggs with your turkey baster helps to
have<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.840> net<00:00:46.200> down<00:00:46.500> close<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.039> there<00:00:47.460> because

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
have a net down close to there because

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.790 
have a net down close to there because
you<00:00:48.090> can't<00:00:48.300> really<00:00:48.600> grab<00:00:48.899> these<00:00:49.140> eggs<00:00:49.500> and

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
you can't really grab these eggs and

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.830 
you can't really grab these eggs and
pick<00:00:50.460> them<00:00:50.579> out<00:00:50.730> out<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.360> water<00:00:51.600> they're

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
pick them out out of the water they're

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.900 
pick them out out of the water they're
usually<00:00:52.050> clumped<00:00:52.710> together<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:53.250> bunches<00:00:53.699> so

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
usually clumped together in bunches so

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.209 
usually clumped together in bunches so
it<00:00:54.570> really<00:00:54.750> helps<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.140> have<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.350> net<00:00:55.649> down<00:00:55.949> there

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
it really helps to have a net down there

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.930 
it really helps to have a net down there
close<00:00:56.579> or<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.300> spoon<00:00:57.750> works<00:00:58.140> as<00:00:58.440> well<00:00:58.649> -<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
close or a spoon works as well - the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.240 
close or a spoon works as well - the
trick<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.270> just<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.930> move<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.199> fry<00:01:01.620> away<00:01:01.920> from

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
trick is just to move the fry away from

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.090 
trick is just to move the fry away from
the<00:01:02.399> eggs<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:03.080> gently<00:01:04.080> scoop<00:01:04.470> up<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.890> bad

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100

eggs or anything that has fungus on them

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.440 
eggs or anything that has fungus on them
and<00:01:07.920> put<00:01:08.220> them<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.580> net<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.030> remove<00:01:09.869> them

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.969 

just<00:01:14.450> take<00:01:14.689> your<00:01:14.869> time<00:01:15.049> getting<00:01:15.409> the<00:01:15.560> eggs<00:01:15.740> and

just take your time getting the eggs and

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.160 
just take your time getting the eggs and
the<00:01:16.070> fungus<00:01:16.430> out<00:01:16.640> may<00:01:17.509> even<00:01:17.750> take<00:01:17.960> you<00:01:18.140> a

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
the fungus out may even take you a

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
a little deeper but the same thing you

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.859 
a little deeper but the same thing you
just<00:01:54.560> lift<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:55.310> fungus<00:01:55.789> or<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.090> dead<00:01:56.270> eggs<00:01:56.539> up

and<00:01:57.740> it<00:01:57.860> helps<00:01:58.100> to<00:01:58.190> have<00:01:58.250> a<00:01:58.399> small<00:01:58.729> net<00:01:59.090> or<00:01:59.420> a

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
and it helps to have a small net or a

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.710 
and it helps to have a small net or a
spoon<00:01:59.869> or<00:02:00.140> even<00:02:00.200> your<00:02:00.500> hand<00:02:00.940> to<00:02:01.940> capture<00:02:02.569> the

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
basket and you can remove larger

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.150 
basket and you can remove larger
quantities<00:02:08.060> of<00:02:08.090> dead<00:02:08.840> eggs<00:02:09.080> at<00:02:09.350> one<00:02:09.530> time<00:02:09.860> this

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.830 
quantities of dead eggs at one time this
way<00:02:14.230> just<00:02:15.230> be<00:02:15.470> aware<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.860> Elevens<00:02:16.780> they<00:02:17.780> do

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
way just be aware the Elevens they do

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.150 
way just be aware the Elevens they do
get<00:02:18.110> stuck<00:02:18.350> to<00:02:18.709> these<00:02:18.860> clumps<00:02:19.220> of<00:02:19.400> eggs<00:02:21.160> don't

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
get stuck to these clumps of eggs don't

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.979 
get stuck to these clumps of eggs don't
forget<00:02:22.459> you<00:02:22.640> can<00:02:22.670> just<00:02:23.000> gently<00:02:23.360> blow<00:02:23.750> them

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
seems to help break apart the Elevens

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.679 
seems to help break apart the Elevens
that<00:02:43.099> are<00:02:43.220> stuck<00:02:43.579> to<00:02:43.849> the<00:02:43.879> fungus<00:02:44.390> and<00:02:44.599> the

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
dead eggs and it also gets everything

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.949 
dead eggs and it also gets everything
out<00:02:47.989> from<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.409> corners<00:02:48.890> and<00:02:49.159> from<00:02:49.549> underneath

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
out from the corners and from underneath

the sides of the basket where you can

above the Elevens this way and you can

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:11.470 
above the Elevens this way and you can
remove<00:03:00.890> those<00:03:01.159> as<00:03:01.370> well

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480
