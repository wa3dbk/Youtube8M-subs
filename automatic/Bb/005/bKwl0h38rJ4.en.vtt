an<00:01:18.510> expert<00:01:18.990> has<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.980> do<00:01:20.100> with<00:01:20.220> golf<00:01:20.930> what<00:01:21.930> is

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
an expert has to do with golf what is

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.470 
an expert has to do with golf what is
the<00:01:22.320> only<00:01:22.560> part<00:01:23.190> of<00:01:23.370> the<00:01:23.580> golf<00:01:23.820> course<00:01:24.120> where

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 
the only part of the golf course where

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.500 
the only part of the golf course where
you<00:01:24.630> use<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.870> putter<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:27.090> green<00:01:27.390> yes<00:01:29.420> all<00:01:30.420> right

you use a putter the green yes all right

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.600 
you use a putter the green yes all right

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
so you might be the only part of a golf

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.850 
so you might be the only part of a golf
course<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.120> actually<00:01:33.630> no<00:01:33.840> see<00:01:34.230> I<00:01:34.500> would
