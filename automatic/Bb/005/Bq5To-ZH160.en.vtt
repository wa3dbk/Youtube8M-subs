00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
over here I've lifted the tire

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.979 
over here I've lifted the tire
approximately<00:02:36.470> I<00:02:36.680> have<00:02:37.100> like<00:02:37.489> almost<00:02:38.120> half<00:02:38.870> an

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
approximately I have like almost half an

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.400 
approximately I have like almost half an
inch<00:02:39.140> space<00:02:40.100> between<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:40.610> tire<00:02:40.820> and<00:02:40.850> the

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
inch space between the tire and the

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.729 
inch space between the tire and the
floor<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:42.650> that's<00:02:43.459> exactly<00:02:44.150> what<00:02:44.330> we<00:02:44.480> need<00:02:44.739> to

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
floor and that's exactly what we need to

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.550 
floor and that's exactly what we need to
be<00:02:45.860> able<00:02:46.130> to<00:02:46.519> move<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:47.000> tire<00:02:47.180> securely<00:02:47.900> and

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
be able to move the tire securely and

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.250 
be able to move the tire securely and
the<00:02:49.310> next<00:02:49.580> step<00:02:49.790> it's<00:02:50.060> going<00:02:50.299> to<00:02:50.450> be<00:02:50.600> to<00:02:51.019> remove

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
the next step it's going to be to remove

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.289 
the next step it's going to be to remove
the<00:02:51.500> screws<00:02:51.769> and<00:02:52.040> you're<00:02:52.579> gonna<00:02:52.670> see<00:02:52.880> now<00:02:52.910> it's

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
very easy because I've already untighten

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.860 
very easy because I've already untighten
