00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.920
 hello and welcome to odl tv 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.049
 some 20 years, the survival 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.629
 expert anton lehnerz his own knife 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.939
 conceived and brought out the german 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.430
 expedition this year brings that 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.259
 company icon now in a reprint out 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.640
 and that's exactly what I put you 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.640
 now in more detail 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.440
 As always, we go first to the 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:39.010
 technical data a the blade length 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:42.220
 german expeditions 2000 is 17 4 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.040
 cm the knife has a cliff 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.780
 blade the tip is so very good 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.699
 controllable and the knife offers 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.989
 sufficient also for good cutting 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.199
 achievements 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:57.460
 the blade is almost 5 mm throughout 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:59.610
 thick and 34 cm deep on the sound 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.320
 back there is a thumb pad 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.239
 the blade is ground flat what the 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.850
 knife route euro and characteristics at 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:10.810
 cutting lends 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:14.550
 In total, the Gek 2029 is 5 cm long 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:18.280
 it brings 278 grams on the scales that 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.050
 knife has a flat at the 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.670
 At the end there is a strike piece 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.950
 which is used to break in slices 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.789
 can be used and a hole for 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.789
 a catch strap 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.890
 we come to the material at the steel 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.630
 put on pictures k 110 steel better 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.660
 known under his American 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.140
 Name D2 The tool steel is very 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.660
 robust 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.330
 ross sluggish and above all very cut 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.420
 However, he only takes a normal one 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.210
 sharpness to the two handle scales of the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.130
 Gek 2000 are made of black anodized 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.390
 aluminum 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.220
 a highlight of the knife is the 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.800
 Sheath made of black core leather 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.960
 it has a cross trottel loop 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.430
 and allows the knife also at 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.430
 closed divorce pull 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.709
 so now but canned 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:20.700
 a knife like the german expedition 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.379
 after 2000 is a knife for the rough 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.629
 work in this area like here 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:27.959
 The splitting of wood completes this 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.700
 Knife off as expected with flying colors 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.639
 also work in the normal range are 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.620
 No problem for the knife here 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:39.129
 the flat address of the blade and the 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.709
 d2 steel for good results clearly 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:44.530
 it will be more difficult for the gek 2000 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.450
 the finer ones especially the 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.310
 sound wide but also the missing 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.560
 possibility the knife earlier to 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.560
 grab complicate such work 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.810
 Let's go to the conclusion on the 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.670
 operability 1 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.300
 the knife is in spite of the 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.160
 unusual grip well in hand 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.530
 already often criticized the predecessor 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.780
 the handle was handled in cold weather 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.380
 Therefore, we have the sample on the temple 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.750
 made and the gek 2000 an hour 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.860
 deep-frozen for a long time 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.650
 in the beginning, the handle is indeed 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.989
 uncomfortably cold but this is 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.140
 already after a short time and you can 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.540
 work normally with the knife 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.530
 the german expeditions 2000 is good 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.000
 balanced and easy sound plastic 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.670
 Based on protection ensures sufficient 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.920
 Safety in handling the knife can 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.200
 easily from the right and left-handed 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.140
 The divorce is, however, to be used 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.070
 designed for right-handed people in this 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:52.050
 by the way , the gek 2000 is very safe 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.600
 There is a grain for cleaning and care 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.820
 a special care tobi due to the 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.590
 steel and the open structure holds 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.920
 However, the nursing effort is very in 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.920
 border 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.940
 we come to the conclusion of the german 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.670
 expedition on 2000 brings a lot 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.280
 Preferences with you in the first place 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.430
 convinced the massive blade and the 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.500
 mÃ¼ller k 110 tool steel this 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.610
 Combination is made for larger ones 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.050
 Exercises in the outdoor and survival area 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.230
 We were also positively surprised by the 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.700
 handle the gek 2000 although the form 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.470
 certainly not everyone's thing 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.450
 There is quite good in the hand and 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.450
 is much less even when cold 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.370
 unpleasant than expected already 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.270
 we have addressed the very beautiful 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.590
 and functional crosstalk leather sheath 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.540
 You do not have to pay a little in the price 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.600
 pocket grab the german 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.990
 expeditions of icon costs at least 260 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:58.070
 but for that you get a real one 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.070
