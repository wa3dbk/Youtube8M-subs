out of stock pretty much I've stalking
all<00:00:43.600> suppliers<00:00:44.130> purely<00:00:45.130> because<00:00:45.280> people

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
all suppliers purely because people

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.150 
all suppliers purely because people
break<00:00:46.720> in<00:00:46.870> their<00:00:46.990> plastic<00:00:47.290> ones<00:00:47.440> I<00:00:47.560> guess<00:00:47.740> so

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
break in their plastic ones I guess so

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.770 
break in their plastic ones I guess so
they're<00:00:48.460> all<00:00:48.610> running<00:00:48.820> and<00:00:49.210> turn<00:00:49.450> into<00:00:49.600> Ally
