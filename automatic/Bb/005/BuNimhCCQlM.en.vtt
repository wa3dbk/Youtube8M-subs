00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:10.740
 because they give lamborghini history 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.599
 started from an insult to be helpful 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.880
 lamborghini was the owner of a well 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.980
 The success of the tractor company in Italy 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.410
 but when it demanded better parts to 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.119
 his ferrari was designed by enzo 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.699
 ferrari as if it were a simple 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.949
 raging tractor mechanic 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.050
 lamborghini and decided to build a motor 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.570
 better to prove that the ferrari was 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.930
 wrong they are also known by the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.760
 flashy style with sharp angles 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.219
 grandiose windshields and windshields 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.190
 however, the greatest innovation 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.559
 of all were the vertical doors that 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.600
 debuted in lamborghini accounts 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.969
 originally developed as a 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.190
 solution to the crowded parking 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.199
 doors have become the trademark of 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.469
 company and are in all major 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.440
 current models thanks to the 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.210
 cars doors to lamborghini were 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.680
 installed in all types of vehicles 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.870
 pickup truck 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.350
 the round civics trying to imitate his 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.350
 style 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:16.070
 speaks guys who're talking about half a kilo and 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.799
 all are welcome to another video 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.579
 of moral forces the galera in the video of 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:27.310
 today we will do a test drive of 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:31.220
 Lamborghini Aventador guys this 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:34.640
 machine is awesome guy for now 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.920
 It is one of the strongest cars I already you 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.679
 because I could already drive in a game of 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.020
 type race, if it were not now if this 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:45.200
 face that really is fabulous does not have 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.179
 idea of ​​how good this car is to play 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.280
 I already sent the first corner that I 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.590
 I said that the car was good to play more 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.399
 Come on, I'm playing here with all the 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:58.220
 assists to off admitted back 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.630
 here and I did not want to go back but I'm going 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.280
 have to go back because I already went there 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.640
 Off my god 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.740
 so I'm playing like all 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.310
 when the power is off 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:13.760
 simulator and his face was already 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.859
 my car from a lot of thanou much 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.200
 I've barely been days since I was young. 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:20.690
 I was going to play the game and it was 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.299
 Running really well this one is more 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.400
 Tranquil, we can not win all of them. 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.079
 although the race too and not just 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.470
 already in the first lap in the first 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:31.110
 curves 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.150
 we can not recover can 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.390
 give super good then I will have a light 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.190
 reasoning to the difficulty of the dribbles 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.330
 attack the artificial intelligence of 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.010
 my opponents are at 35 as 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.780
 expert is not this 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.790
 the guys are very fucking mainly 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.670
 the first ones can do 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.220
 very fierce position disputes 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.140
 and it will not always be possible to win 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.390
 What 's coolest is over 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.660
 making the guy next to me 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.240
 coming back from the side here and the blow and 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.180
 for you to have an idea of ​​how it is 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.730
 realistic piloting here this difficulty 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.490
 artificial intelligence né 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.770
 this makes the game much more 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.990
 cool because so not always important 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.090
 is to overcome the important legal lazio is 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.950
 but if you can make a 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.110
 beautiful of a race 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.640
 you end up getting much more satisfied 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.130
 than sometimes simply winning a 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.780
 The guys are very 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.240
 even police 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.770
 so come on, I said I was with 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.709
 A spectacular car. I'm with a guy. 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.050
 spectacular because no one can handle pain 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.600
 a super nice car you can 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.780
 visual quality of the interior of the 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.190
 car is magnificent is very beautiful and a 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.190
 of the things that caught my attention 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.500
 in this car he is very stable he 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.670
 has incredible stability does not come out of 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.269
 back in curves 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.850
 you can just stick the tac teat 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:59.070
 in fact it is the finger on the accelerator and 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.230
 that the car does not come out of the back in time 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.970
 to accelerate the output of 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.130
 stability curve is super 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.530
 because the traction in the four 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.810
 wheels and this ends up making it 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.370
 another point I like 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.410
 car brakes 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.470
 I thought it went very well if you can. 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:19.350
 just brake a little more inside 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.510
 the curve than with a car drew in 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.490
 for example the attraction in the 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.300
 The front looks like the car is 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.760
 I do not know if it 's my impression but 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:32.100
 I had more or less this perception is that 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.990
 He ends up being a little better too. 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.540
 braking 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.260
 Anyway, we 're already here in second 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.720
 placed 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.580
 You can see that my glass of 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.870
 door here left side cable 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.440
 trilling right 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.520
 that impact back there it ends 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.380
 happening 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.200
 also happens with windshield glass 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.840
 trynka and really the windshield glass 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.540
 When you crack, it's a fuck, everybody. 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.660
 simply disrupts this hell 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.130
 sun that is already on your face ends 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.420
 end up messing up, huh? 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.340
 This is natural when you are 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:10.090
 really traveling on a road that has 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:13.030
 that sun in front of you and the sun 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.370
 he crosses the windshield of the car he 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:19.360
 really end up messing up a lot and 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:21.640
 here in the forza the staff took care 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.730
 to make you have the same 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:27.190
 and the broken glass 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:30.600
 also damaging quite good and is 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:33.460
 on our last lap everything's cool until 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:36.100
 despite the difficulties imposed by the 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.530
 opponents and also because of my lack of 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.530
 skill in the beginning it but it is that 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:44.500
 car is very good so you playing 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.510
 More or less, let's say, you're done. 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.330
 getting well present but with 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:51.610
 the weakest car would surely be 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.220
 would not be in the first would have a 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.690
 positions further back to suffering 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.060
 stay in second third bedroom 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.130
 placed at last depends a lot on the car 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.560
 also this car is very good he is 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:06.430
 above average so let's say with 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.660
 you end up standing out one 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.220
 another thing I want to also comment 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.530
 with you here at the beginning of the video I ended up 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.000
 no no not commenting but you are 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:16.810
 noting that whenever it is occurring 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.100
 with a company is unprecedented here in this 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.230
 let's say that way 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.950
 I'm putting the story of the automaker 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:25.660
 at the beginning of the video is the first 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:27.970
 The story went from mclaren to second now 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.990
 It's going to be lamborghini and so we 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.490
 will doing 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.230
 I'll make some videos that are 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.480
 unknown cars from assemblers present 

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:36.070
 play with another with another car 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.440
 lamborghini I will not have it any more 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:40.630
 Because he's going to tell you the story. 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.090
 It's going to be the same for not being like that. 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.430
 Only with a different car, right? 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:48.070
 so stay 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:53.710
 that, whenever he has written the 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:56.080
 history of the car maker xy bh j will be 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.360
 about the history of the automaker that I 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.380
 I'll be telling you beauty with 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.880
 the bike almost at the end final curve 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.440
 Calm there's only one thing I forgot. 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.670
 this is the lane of le mans 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.280
 I'll talk to you more in another 

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:11.440
 video I really like it but it has 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:14.590
 very best tracks in this game but it is 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:17.350
 It's also not a good challenge. 

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:19.660
 worth enjoy this circuit that le mans 

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:21.490
 It's really cool, I hope the galera 

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:24.070
 You have enjoyed this video very much. 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:27.900
 Thank you for the company and we see each other. 

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:27.900
 in the next video bye bye
