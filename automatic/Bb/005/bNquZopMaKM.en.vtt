now<00:01:37.140> made<00:01:37.350> my<00:01:37.560> skin<00:01:37.619> suddenly<00:01:38.549> have<00:01:38.850> it's

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
now made my skin suddenly have it's

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.600 
now made my skin suddenly have it's
almost<00:01:39.570> like<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.810> dry<00:01:40.140> break<00:01:40.470> out<00:01:40.740> my<00:01:41.040> skin<00:01:41.460> is

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
almost like a dry break out my skin is

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.719 
almost like a dry break out my skin is
extremely<00:01:42.390> dry<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.770> found<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.310> using<00:01:44.490> the

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
extremely dry and I found that using the

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.850 
extremely dry and I found that using the
wire<00:01:44.909> cell<00:01:45.180> fusion<00:01:45.360> ink<00:01:45.720> wasn't<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.380> best<00:01:46.619> for

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
wire cell fusion ink wasn't the best for

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.889 
wire cell fusion ink wasn't the best for
that<00:01:46.920> not<00:01:47.310> because<00:01:47.759> because<00:01:48.540> somebody<00:01:48.810> would

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
that not because because somebody would

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.170 
that not because because somebody would
else<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.320> dry<00:01:49.500> skin<00:01:49.799> said<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.100> they<00:01:50.189> felt<00:01:50.939> like

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
else a dry skin said that they felt like

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.340 
else a dry skin said that they felt like
there<00:01:51.420> might<00:01:51.630> not<00:01:51.750> have<00:01:51.810> enough<00:01:52.110> time<00:01:52.290> to

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
there might not have enough time to

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.830 
there might not have enough time to
spread<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.979> think<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.700> was<00:01:54.030> okay<00:01:54.509> but<00:01:54.810> I

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
spread it think that was okay but I

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.060 
spread it think that was okay but I
think<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:56.520> finished<00:01:56.939> look<00:01:57.210> was<00:01:57.600> just<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.170> kind

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
think the finished look was just to kind

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.310 
think the finished look was just to kind
of<00:01:59.130> flat<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.909> I<00:02:00.299> had<00:02:00.479> specifically<00:02:00.990> said<00:02:01.079> it

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
of flat and I had specifically said it

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.679 
of flat and I had specifically said it
wasn't<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.740> flat<00:02:01.979> look<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:03.060> wasn't<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.390> flat

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
wasn't a flat look it wasn't a flat

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.420 
wasn't a flat look it wasn't a flat
matte<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.200> wasn't<00:02:04.439> when<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.829> when<00:02:05.100> my<00:02:05.219> skin

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
matte and it wasn't when I when my skin

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.219 
matte and it wasn't when I when my skin
had<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.670> little<00:02:05.850> bit<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.060> oil<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.600> but<00:02:07.079> now

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
had a little bit of oil to it but now

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.839 
had a little bit of oil to it but now
it's<00:02:07.469> very<00:02:07.680> very<00:02:08.039> dry<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.459> I've<00:02:08.520> got<00:02:08.670> dry

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
it's very very dry and I've got dry

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.160 
it's very very dry and I've got dry
patches<00:02:09.149> where<00:02:09.479> these<00:02:09.629> blemish

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
patches where these blemish

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.110 
patches where these blemish
like<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.770> needed<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.160> bring<00:02:11.310> some<00:02:11.550> life<00:02:11.730> back<00:02:11.970> to

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
like I needed to bring some life back to

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.420 
like I needed to bring some life back to
my<00:02:12.240> skin<00:02:12.630> so<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.260> had<00:02:13.410> started<00:02:13.890> using<00:02:13.920> Mac

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
my skin so I had started using Mac

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.979 
my skin so I had started using Mac
strobe<00:02:14.849> cream<00:02:15.150> underneath<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:15.870> which

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
strobe cream underneath it which

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.860 
strobe cream underneath it which
definitely<00:02:16.590> helped<00:02:16.980> but<00:02:17.670> I<00:02:18.030> just

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
definitely helped but I just

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.080 
definitely helped but I just
instead<00:02:19.470> switched<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:20.069> another<00:02:20.340> foundation<00:02:21.000> I

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
instead switched to another foundation I

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.940 
instead switched to another foundation I
switched<00:02:21.390> using<00:02:21.599> my<00:02:21.810> YSL<00:02:22.319> tape<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.770> shake

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
switched using my YSL tape to shake

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.400 
switched using my YSL tape to shake
laughs<00:02:23.190> which<00:02:23.940> is<00:02:23.970> more<00:02:24.360> geared<00:02:24.870> towards<00:02:24.930> dry

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
laughs which is more geared towards dry

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.170 
laughs which is more geared towards dry
skin<00:02:25.739> I<00:02:25.770> think<00:02:26.160> although<00:02:26.340> I<00:02:26.459> think<00:02:26.610> it's<00:02:27.000> fine

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
skin I think although I think it's fine

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.449 
skin I think although I think it's fine
for<00:02:27.390> my<00:02:27.480> own<00:02:27.630> skin<00:02:28.020> they<00:02:28.890> didn't<00:02:29.130> when<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.310> was

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
for my own skin they didn't when I was

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.850 
for my own skin they didn't when I was
in<00:02:29.640> Boots<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.569> saw<00:02:30.780> this<00:02:30.959> little<00:02:31.140> beauty<00:02:31.590> and

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
in Boots I saw this little beauty and

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.559 
in Boots I saw this little beauty and
it's<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.100> Max<00:02:32.310> Factor<00:02:32.430> skin<00:02:33.060> Luminizer

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
it's the Max Factor skin Luminizer

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:34.970 
it's the Max Factor skin Luminizer
foundation<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.319> I<00:02:34.380> thought<00:02:34.530> well<00:02:34.709> I'll<00:02:34.800> try

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
foundation and I thought well I'll try

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.250 
foundation and I thought well I'll try
it<00:02:35.100> but<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.489> don't<00:02:35.580> imagine<00:02:35.940> it<00:02:36.330> would<00:02:36.450> be<00:02:36.569> good

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
it but I don't imagine it would be good

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.780 
it but I don't imagine it would be good
enough<00:02:37.470> coverage<00:02:37.980> for<00:02:38.220> me<00:02:38.310> but<00:02:38.489> I'm<00:02:38.580> wearing

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
enough coverage for me but I'm wearing

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.640 
enough coverage for me but I'm wearing
it<00:02:39.000> today<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.480> I've<00:02:39.599> done<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.810> demo<00:02:40.200> of<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.470> and

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
it today and I've done a demo of it and

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.710 
it today and I've done a demo of it and
I<00:02:40.739> would<00:02:40.800> say<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.340> it<00:02:41.430> is<00:02:41.459> medium<00:02:42.269> coverage

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
I would say that it is medium coverage

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.170 
I would say that it is medium coverage
but<00:02:43.319> it<00:02:43.560> is<00:02:43.620> buildable<00:02:44.220> I<00:02:44.519> have<00:02:44.730> used<00:02:44.970> two

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
but it is buildable I have used two

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.880 
but it is buildable I have used two
coats<00:02:45.480> of<00:02:45.660> it<00:02:45.780> today<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.290> then<00:02:46.440> finished<00:02:46.739> off

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
coats of it today and then finished off

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.759 
coats of it today and then finished off
with<00:02:46.920> just<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.550> Too<00:02:48.269> Faced<00:02:48.540> cocoa<00:02:49.080> found<00:02:49.590> a

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
with just the Too Faced cocoa found a

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.100 
with just the Too Faced cocoa found a
powder<00:02:50.130> foundation<00:02:50.430> but<00:02:51.090> as<00:02:51.269> I<00:02:51.720> said<00:02:51.780> in<00:02:52.019> the

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
powder foundation but as I said in the

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.660 
powder foundation but as I said in the
review<00:02:52.470> of<00:02:52.500> that<00:02:52.709> one<00:02:52.890> I<00:02:52.920> don't<00:02:53.069> think<00:02:53.370> that

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
review of that one I don't think that

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.460 
review of that one I don't think that
that<00:02:53.819> is<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.000> full<00:02:54.330> coverage<00:02:54.600> it's<00:02:55.019> just<00:02:55.290> like<00:02:55.440> a

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
that is a full coverage it's just like a

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.080 
that is a full coverage it's just like a
finishing<00:02:55.890> powder<00:02:56.190> there's<00:02:56.580> nothing<00:02:56.910> really

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
finishing powder there's nothing really

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.550 
finishing powder there's nothing really
much<00:02:57.450> more<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.900> it<00:02:58.019> than<00:02:58.110> that

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
much more to it than that

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.320 
much more to it than that
so<00:02:58.980> that's<00:02:59.190> how<00:02:59.340> I<00:02:59.370> got<00:02:59.549> this<00:02:59.760> finished<00:03:00.090> today

think<00:04:40.230> I<00:04:40.350> may<00:04:40.560> be<00:04:40.590> geared<00:04:41.010> towards<00:04:41.360> drier<00:04:42.360> skin

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
think I may be geared towards drier skin

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.230 
think I may be geared towards drier skin
or<00:04:42.930> luminizing<00:04:43.470> skin<00:04:44.100> I<00:04:44.280> often<00:04:44.820> worry<00:04:45.000> about

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
or luminizing skin I often worry about

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.460 
or luminizing skin I often worry about
breaking<00:04:45.450> out<00:04:45.810> but<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.140> good<00:04:46.260> thing<00:04:46.290> about

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
breaking out but the good thing about

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.350 
breaking out but the good thing about
this<00:04:46.860> is<00:04:47.100> like<00:04:47.430> I<00:04:47.550> said<00:04:47.730> listen<00:04:47.910> for<00:04:48.270> me

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
this is like I said listen for me

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.390 
this is like I said listen for me
doesn't<00:04:48.570> pose<00:04:48.840> any<00:04:48.870> problems<00:04:49.470> it<00:04:49.740> has<00:04:50.160> got<00:04:50.370> a

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
doesn't pose any problems it has got a

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.040 
doesn't pose any problems it has got a
vitamin<00:04:50.580> E<00:04:50.940> in<00:04:51.000> it<00:04:51.180> which<00:04:51.330> can<00:04:51.540> sometimes

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
vitamin E in it which can sometimes

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.780 
vitamin E in it which can sometimes
cause<00:04:52.320> me<00:04:52.500> to<00:04:52.620> break<00:04:52.800> out<00:04:53.010> but<00:04:53.160> it<00:04:53.280> also<00:04:53.460> has<00:04:53.760> a

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
cause me to break out but it also has a

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.640 
cause me to break out but it also has a
nice<00:04:53.940> thin<00:04:54.210> amide<00:04:54.420> in<00:04:54.600> it<00:04:54.720> which<00:04:55.110> is<00:04:55.260> very<00:04:55.320> good

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
nice thin amide in it which is very good

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.350 
nice thin amide in it which is very good
for<00:04:55.800> skin<00:04:55.950> that<00:04:56.130> is<00:04:56.370> an<00:04:56.490> ingredient<00:04:56.760> that<00:04:57.180> is

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
for skin that is an ingredient that is

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.200 
for skin that is an ingredient that is
in<00:04:57.710> freedom<00:04:58.710> and<00:04:59.010> you<00:04:59.190> know<00:04:59.310> acne<00:04:59.730> treatments

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
in freedom and you know acne treatments

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.120 
in freedom and you know acne treatments
so<00:05:00.450> I<00:05:00.660> thought<00:05:01.080> that<00:05:01.200> was<00:05:01.320> really<00:05:01.470> interesting

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
so I thought that was really interesting

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.650 
so I thought that was really interesting
and<00:05:02.310> I'm<00:05:02.700> really<00:05:03.030> pleased<00:05:03.300> with<00:05:03.510> the

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
and I'm really pleased with the

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.290 
and I'm really pleased with the
ingredient<00:05:04.140> applies<00:05:04.470> really<00:05:04.890> well<00:05:05.100> I<00:05:05.400> think<00:05:05.850> I

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
ingredient applies really well I think I

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.060 
ingredient applies really well I think I
said<00:05:06.360> did<00:05:06.750> I<00:05:06.840> that<00:05:07.020> it<00:05:07.110> was<00:05:07.260> medium<00:05:07.710> coverage

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
said did I that it was medium coverage

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.650 
said did I that it was medium coverage
medium<00:05:08.460> to<00:05:08.580> buildable<00:05:08.880> coverage<00:05:09.300> I'll<00:05:09.480> show

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
medium to buildable coverage I'll show

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.080 
medium to buildable coverage I'll show
you<00:05:09.720> the<00:05:09.810> demo<00:05:10.110> at<00:05:10.230> the<00:05:10.260> end<00:05:10.380> anyway<00:05:10.830> I'm<00:05:11.580> not

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
you the demo at the end anyway I'm not

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.480 
you the demo at the end anyway I'm not
sure<00:05:12.330> how<00:05:12.510> it<00:05:12.630> would<00:05:12.720> work<00:05:12.750> for<00:05:12.990> I<00:05:13.680> generally

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
sure how it would work for I generally

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.490 
sure how it would work for I generally
still<00:05:14.730> have<00:05:14.940> oily<00:05:15.300> skin<00:05:15.330> but<00:05:15.840> it's<00:05:15.960> just<00:05:16.170> in<00:05:16.410> a

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
still have oily skin but it's just in a

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.280 
still have oily skin but it's just in a
very<00:05:16.710> very<00:05:16.920> dry<00:05:17.220> phase<00:05:17.520> at<00:05:17.790> the<00:05:17.880> moment<00:05:18.290> but

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
very very dry phase at the moment but

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.080 
very very dry phase at the moment but
I'm<00:05:19.440> not<00:05:19.650> sure<00:05:19.860> if<00:05:20.010> it<00:05:20.130> would<00:05:20.220> be<00:05:20.340> too<00:05:20.640> much<00:05:20.820> for

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
I'm not sure if it would be too much for

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.970 
I'm not sure if it would be too much for
oily<00:05:21.360> skin<00:05:21.780> I<00:05:21.990> think<00:05:22.020> it<00:05:22.410> would<00:05:22.530> be<00:05:22.650> okay

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
oily skin I think it would be okay

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.250 
oily skin I think it would be okay
though<00:05:23.220> because<00:05:23.400> it's<00:05:23.700> not<00:05:23.940> it's<00:05:24.690> not<00:05:24.840> a<00:05:24.900> shiny

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
though because it's not it's not a shiny

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.710 
though because it's not it's not a shiny
finish<00:05:25.560> at<00:05:25.890> all<00:05:26.220> and<00:05:26.550> even<00:05:27.240> looking<00:05:27.510> at<00:05:27.600> it

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
finish at all and even looking at it

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.420 
finish at all and even looking at it
there<00:05:27.900> I<00:05:27.930> thought<00:05:28.230> all<00:05:28.440> that<00:05:28.650> looks<00:05:29.040> like

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
there I thought all that looks like

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.550 
there I thought all that looks like
there<00:05:29.820> might<00:05:29.940> be<00:05:30.000> quite<00:05:30.390> a<00:05:30.420> lot<00:05:30.840> you<00:05:31.230> know<00:05:31.500> it

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
there might be quite a lot you know it

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.490 
there might be quite a lot you know it
might<00:05:31.710> be<00:05:31.740> 50/50<00:05:32.750> Foundation<00:05:33.750> and<00:05:33.930> luminize

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
might be 50/50 Foundation and luminize

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.690 
might be 50/50 Foundation and luminize
there<00:05:34.710> but<00:05:34.830> actually<00:05:34.950> it<00:05:35.190> doesn't<00:05:35.490> feel<00:05:35.640> like

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
there but actually it doesn't feel like

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.400 
there but actually it doesn't feel like
that<00:05:35.940> on<00:05:36.210> the<00:05:36.330> skin<00:05:36.480> it<00:05:36.750> feels<00:05:36.960> like<00:05:37.140> there's<00:05:37.350> a

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
that on the skin it feels like there's a

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.950 
that on the skin it feels like there's a
little<00:05:37.620> bit<00:05:37.980> of<00:05:38.130> something<00:05:38.370> in<00:05:38.700> it<00:05:38.850> so<00:05:39.780> I<00:05:39.810> think

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
little bit of something in it so I think

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.430 
little bit of something in it so I think
this<00:05:40.260> will<00:05:40.410> probably<00:05:40.530> be<00:05:40.860> okay<00:05:41.130> for<00:05:41.790> normal

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
this will probably be okay for normal

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.470 
this will probably be okay for normal
boilie<00:05:43.440> dry<00:05:44.190> I<00:05:44.550> think<00:05:44.850> it<00:05:44.940> would<00:05:45.060> be<00:05:45.120> okay<00:05:45.390> for

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
boilie dry I think it would be okay for

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.990 
boilie dry I think it would be okay for
everybody<00:05:45.780> except<00:05:46.440> maybe<00:05:46.740> very<00:05:47.460> very<00:05:47.790> oily

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
everybody except maybe very very oily

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.300 
everybody except maybe very very oily
and<00:05:48.270> when<00:05:48.420> my<00:05:48.540> oily<00:05:48.870> skin<00:05:49.170> comes<00:05:49.740> back<00:05:49.980> I'll<00:05:50.190> be

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
and when my oily skin comes back I'll be

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.220 
and when my oily skin comes back I'll be
able<00:05:50.400> to<00:05:50.640> tell<00:05:50.820> you<00:05:50.970> that<00:05:51.000> but<00:05:51.840> at<00:05:51.990> the<00:05:52.080> moment

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:52.230 
able to tell you that but at the moment

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:53.570 
able to tell you that but at the moment

on here I'll even addendum on this video

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.380 
on here I'll even addendum on this video
I<00:06:31.680> applied<00:06:32.040> it<00:06:32.250> with<00:06:32.460> I've<00:06:32.850> applied<00:06:33.090> it<00:06:33.270> with

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:33.390 
I applied it with I've applied it with

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:33.930 
I applied it with I've applied it with
my<00:06:33.479> fingers

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
my fingers

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.370 
my fingers
I've<00:06:34.090> applied<00:06:34.240> it<00:06:34.480> with<00:06:34.600> a<00:06:34.630> sponge<00:06:34.990> I<00:06:35.110> haven't

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:35.380 
I've applied it with a sponge I haven't

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.960 
I've applied it with a sponge I haven't
tried<00:06:35.500> it<00:06:35.560> with<00:06:35.740> a<00:06:35.800> brush<00:06:35.980> yet<00:06:36.250> I<00:06:36.430> think<00:06:36.730> a

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
tried it with a brush yet I think a

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.180 
tried it with a brush yet I think a
brush<00:06:37.480> would<00:06:37.690> be<00:06:37.810> absolutely<00:06:38.200> fine<00:06:38.500> I<00:06:38.770> don't

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.190 
brush would be absolutely fine I don't

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.650 
brush would be absolutely fine I don't
see<00:06:39.310> any<00:06:39.490> issues<00:06:39.760> with<00:06:39.910> that<00:06:40.060> but<00:06:40.210> I<00:06:40.240> found<00:06:40.450> it

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:40.660 
see any issues with that but I found it

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.990 
see any issues with that but I found it
really<00:06:40.840> nice<00:06:41.650> to<00:06:41.680> apply<00:06:42.130> with<00:06:42.340> with<00:06:42.640> fingers

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.000 
really nice to apply with with fingers

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.730 
really nice to apply with with fingers
and<00:06:43.030> with<00:06:43.390> us<00:06:43.510> with<00:06:43.900> my<00:06:44.050> Beauty<00:06:44.350> Blender<00:06:44.380> and<00:06:44.650> I

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:44.740 
and with us with my Beauty Blender and I

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.940 
and with us with my Beauty Blender and I
think<00:06:44.920> that's<00:06:45.070> probably<00:06:45.250> what<00:06:45.490> I<00:06:45.520> will<00:06:45.850> use<00:06:46.950> it

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:47.950 
think that's probably what I will use it

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.430 
think that's probably what I will use it
did<00:06:48.940> last<00:06:49.210> all<00:06:49.480> day<00:06:49.660> that<00:06:49.930> was<00:06:50.020> another<00:06:50.230> thing

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440 
did last all day that was another thing

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.350 
did last all day that was another thing
that<00:06:50.590> I<00:06:50.680> was<00:06:50.890> I<00:06:51.130> was<00:06:51.730> and<00:06:52.030> I'm<00:06:52.150> always

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.360 
that I was I was and I'm always

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.000 
that I was I was and I'm always
concerned<00:06:52.630> about<00:06:53.080> when<00:06:53.200> I<00:06:53.230> see<00:06:53.470> a<00:06:53.500> luminizing

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.010 
concerned about when I see a luminizing

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.580 
concerned about when I see a luminizing
foundation<00:06:54.700> or<00:06:54.820> one<00:06:55.030> for<00:06:55.270> dry<00:06:55.420> skin<00:06:55.810> I<00:06:55.990> always

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:56.590 
foundation or one for dry skin I always

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:58.290 
foundation or one for dry skin I always
think<00:06:56.800> that<00:06:56.860> on<00:06:57.070> me<00:06:57.310> it's<00:06:57.640> not<00:06:57.850> going<00:06:58.060> to<00:06:58.120> last

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:58.300 
think that on me it's not going to last

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.870 
think that on me it's not going to last
because<00:06:58.630> of<00:06:58.780> having<00:06:59.110> oily<00:06:59.350> skin<00:06:59.680> and<00:07:00.550> I<00:07:00.670> don't

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:00.880 
because of having oily skin and I don't

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:01.950 
because of having oily skin and I don't
know<00:07:00.970> whether<00:07:01.090> it's<00:07:01.270> to<00:07:01.420> do<00:07:01.540> with<00:07:01.570> the<00:07:01.720> state

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 
know whether it's to do with the state

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.720 
know whether it's to do with the state
of<00:07:02.080> my<00:07:02.170> skin<00:07:02.380> at<00:07:02.500> the<00:07:02.560> moment<00:07:02.860> but<00:07:02.980> this<00:07:03.160> didn't

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:03.730 
of my skin at the moment but this didn't

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.870 
of my skin at the moment but this didn't
change<00:07:04.210> really<00:07:05.020> all<00:07:05.320> day<00:07:05.590> I've<00:07:06.040> put<00:07:06.340> it<00:07:06.430> on<00:07:06.580> at

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:06.880 
change really all day I've put it on at

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.060 
change really all day I've put it on at
about<00:07:07.420> 8<00:07:07.900> o'clock<00:07:07.960> in<00:07:08.320> the<00:07:08.470> morning<00:07:08.560> something

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.070 
about 8 o'clock in the morning something

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.100 
about 8 o'clock in the morning something
like<00:07:09.370> that<00:07:09.550> and<00:07:09.790> it<00:07:10.120> was<00:07:10.210> still<00:07:10.510> looking<00:07:11.080> the

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:11.110 
like that and it was still looking the

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.930 
like that and it was still looking the
same<00:07:11.200> at<00:07:11.740> about<00:07:11.950> 6<00:07:12.340> o'clock<00:07:12.460> in<00:07:12.640> the<00:07:12.760> evening

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:12.940 
same at about 6 o'clock in the evening

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.530 
same at about 6 o'clock in the evening
it<00:07:13.300> barely<00:07:13.690> looked<00:07:14.020> any<00:07:14.260> different<00:07:14.680> and<00:07:15.540> yeah

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:16.540 
it barely looked any different and yeah

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.090 
it barely looked any different and yeah
I<00:07:16.750> think<00:07:16.840> it'll<00:07:17.170> be<00:07:17.320> fine<00:07:17.530> I<00:07:17.560> haven't<00:07:17.890> worn<00:07:17.980> it

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:18.100 
I think it'll be fine I haven't worn it

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.770 
I think it'll be fine I haven't worn it
to<00:07:18.220> work<00:07:18.430> yet<00:07:18.760> which<00:07:18.910> is<00:07:19.060> normally<00:07:19.360> when<00:07:19.510> I<00:07:19.540> get

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:19.780 
to work yet which is normally when I get

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.510 
to work yet which is normally when I get
the<00:07:19.900> best<00:07:20.140> test<00:07:20.500> because<00:07:20.800> I<00:07:20.890> can<00:07:21.070> see<00:07:21.220> kind<00:07:21.430> of

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520 
the best test because I can see kind of

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.430 
the best test because I can see kind of
close<00:07:21.760> up<00:07:21.790> but<00:07:22.480> I<00:07:22.540> was<00:07:22.720> out<00:07:22.840> and<00:07:23.020> about<00:07:23.200> in<00:07:23.410> the

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:23.440 
close up but I was out and about in the

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.110 
close up but I was out and about in the
town<00:07:23.740> yesterday<00:07:24.220> and<00:07:24.310> whatnot<00:07:24.610> so<00:07:24.820> couldn't

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:38.650 
something else that I sometimes wonder
