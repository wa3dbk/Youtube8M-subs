00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:10.660
 Well, this is the guitar that we have 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:14.650
 modified is a guitar that has a 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.850
 very good wood and what we have 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.570
 worked basically has been the change 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:23.080
 of the pills therefore some wilkinson 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.810
 vintage ok and we have done a cleaning 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.539
 of the mast as well as its hydration and 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.029
 cleaning also the frets also 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:34.000
 we have made a soul adjustment of the 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.740
 guitar that is a little bit tense and 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.870
 what he was doing was a small storage room in 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.620
 the first frets on the strings 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.270
 higher is worth seeing the sound again 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.690
 in the lic and then we play a little bit 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.690
 of distortion 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.580
 Y 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.010
 Y 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.410
 we are playing with the pill 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.480
 mast so you can see the big difference 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:12.260
 of sound we do not go directly to the 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.260
 bridge and you will see how dense 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.150
 good 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.240
 we're going to the middle side 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.920
 and 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.270
 nothing 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.770
 do not 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.430
 and well let's try with 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.349
 distortion 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.349
 and for you to see as an area 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.050
 i 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.790
 with the
