 August continues 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.349
 then he was out of last-or may have made then my mother still has 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.359
 As usual, the role model for this was, among others, Cameron das 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.359
 motorsport event Agnes helped 

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:35.069
 Auto Motor and Sport TV accompanies Winkelhock one day before the dtm finale 

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:36.750

 in the lunch break with plenty of carbohydrates to strengthen 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.920
 one must not forget that the FDP is loud very very close » 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.660
 it will 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.930
 that means then temperatures between 15 60 Kate Middleton when we on this 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.630
 Level is as a substitute 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.380
 to that of course also the men were in the choice of Europe replace it 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.900
 The drivers have to drink over three liters on a race day 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.830
 To compensate for fluid loss in the body 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.590
 after lunch, the next appointment will follow 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.290
 the tactical meeting

 further loosen on kaup-hasler in the body of a hydraulic pressure 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.920
 but it is unique 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.890
 on state help is a good form as well 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.040
 the annual report 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.910
 a hot discussion about driving at the curbs 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.210
 so-called Corts ignited it will be serious yet 20 minutes until qualifying 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.130
 Orally 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.859
 a majority is considered safe 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:55.969

 by Martin Ebel Le Maire 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.880
 there are anything but elsewhere 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.049
 However, so because IT is still everything has been cheaper one 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.120
 To convene a special session 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.580
 Felix then comes down from the start to take care lucky charms 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.079
 "No matter I always do the holidays 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:17.349
 Bowman spent time with my mother won on race weekend 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.749
 racer 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:24.669
 Markus Winkelhock is still cool, but only five minutes later he is off 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:26.190
 nothing to feel 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.459
 the tension is too great 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.469
 It was exhausting to choose or perhaps remember 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:34.609
 because of the right-wing extremists 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:38.019
 the thought circles just goes for qualifying 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.329
 at the Matterhorn 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.329
 become a reader reporter 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:46.349
 Winkelhock leaves the box at 1.50 pm 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.349
 Ideally, he sits in the race car for an hour 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.370
 qualifying in the DTM consists of four sectors in each round 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.789
 excrete the slowest drivers 

00:02:56.789 --> 00:03:01.429
 at the beginning it looks good Markus Winkelhock who is not among the front 

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:04.979
 Eyes of many employers Rosberg was always better on tours 

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:12.119
 first pit stop 

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:14.919
 just do not make a mistake now 

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:16.139
 refueling 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:19.139
 the tires change everything works perfectly 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:23.629
 Winkelhock starts in the second sector 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.349
 Now it's time to accelerate again and the enormous 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.119
 Withstand centrifugal forces in the bends 

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:32.259
 on board 

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:37.239
 the thoughts of father Manfred Fehr more than 25 years ago about the ring 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.789
 drove and in 1985 in a sports car race 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.239
 LTO fatally injured 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.129
 then the big disappointment 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:50.199
 # 13 after the second qualifying segment means Markus 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:51.959
 the premature 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.359
 and that's his home track 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:59.109
 Even if Engineer career - is at a loss Markus Winkelhock is bitterly disappointed 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.419
 and leaves the pit lane the frustration sits deep 

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:08.089
 Dr 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:15.099
 the qualifying has gone the time to process the disappointment or to 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.750
 Just walk through the 29-year-old does not stay along with 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.009
 Racing colleague Alexandre Prémat 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:24.740
 for the next one it may be easier to get an official one 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.080
 Event begins 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.710
 there are already hundreds waiting for ddr citizens there is interest in the 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.139
 both drivers 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.309
 Markus also has to nibble at his performance 

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:36.809
 The fans do not seem to care 

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:40.089
 There are sets in almost every race as the hotter one should 

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:41.210
 Middle and percent 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.210
 Gesine Schwan sees the main conference must say 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.090
 but it's great that there are such people 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.620
 the official said this 4 percent drive consignment percent 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.610
 Of course it is quite clear in sports that sport lives 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.669
 Dusseldorf 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:59.199
