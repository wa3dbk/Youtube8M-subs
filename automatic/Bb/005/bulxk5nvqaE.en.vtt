the<00:00:32.219> idea<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:33.210> doing<00:00:33.510> something<00:00:33.930> really<00:00:34.920> great

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
the idea of doing something really great

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.290 
the idea of doing something really great
in<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.280> game<00:00:35.460> but<00:00:35.640> doing<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.000> with<00:00:36.149> your

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
in the game but doing it with your

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.780 
in the game but doing it with your
friends<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.950> concept<00:00:38.309> here<00:00:38.489> like<00:00:38.700> I

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
friends so the concept here like I

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.010 
friends so the concept here like I
mentioned<00:00:38.969> earlier<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.629> we're<00:00:39.870> going<00:00:39.960> to

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
mentioned earlier is that we're going to

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.560 
mentioned earlier is that we're going to
have<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.200> ratio<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:40.920> ratio<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:41.969> basically

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
have a ratio and the ratio is basically

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.420 
have a ratio and the ratio is basically
going<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.020> be<00:00:43.140> we're<00:00:43.469> shooting<00:00:43.710> for<00:00:43.739> about<00:00:43.980> 75%

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
going to be we're shooting for about 75%

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.090 
going to be we're shooting for about 75%
like<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.940> said<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.329> in<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.480> 25-person<00:00:46.440> raid<00:00:46.770> as

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
like I said so in a 25-person raid as

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.040 
like I said so in a 25-person raid as
long<00:00:47.640> as<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.820> have<00:00:47.910> 20<00:00:48.239> players<00:00:48.450> there<00:00:48.780> from

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
long as you have 20 players there from

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.360 
long as you have 20 players there from
your<00:00:49.200> bag<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.710> would<00:00:49.829> then<00:00:49.980> earn<00:00:50.160> those

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
your bag you would then earn those

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.970 
your bag you would then earn those

here's<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.630> couple<00:01:21.780> examples<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.470> what<00:01:22.680> some

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
here's a couple examples of what some

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.350 
here's a couple examples of what some
things<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.400> we<00:01:23.520> think<00:01:23.640> could<00:01:23.820> be<00:01:23.939> cool<00:01:24.150> guild

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
things that we think could be cool guild

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.359 
things that we think could be cool guild
achievements<00:01:24.479> become<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> grandmaster<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.250> all

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
achievements become a grandmaster in all

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.219 
achievements become a grandmaster in all
professions<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:27.689> would<00:01:27.810> mean<00:01:27.960> your

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
professions so this would mean your

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.080 
professions so this would mean your
guild<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.740> would<00:01:28.860> want<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.100> have<00:01:29.250> exactly

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
guild you would want to have exactly

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.370

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
what it says one person that's a

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.840 
what it says one person that's a
grandmaster<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.040> everything<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.640> doing

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
grandmaster and everything and doing

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.830 
grandmaster and everything and doing
that<00:01:32.970> would<00:01:33.180> give<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.570> guild

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
that would give you that guild

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.260 
that would give you that guild

can<00:01:38.250> only<00:01:38.369> happen<00:01:38.549> within<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.970> guild<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.390> these

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
can only happen within a guild and these

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.420 
can only happen within a guild and these
would<00:01:40.560> be<00:01:40.650> achievements<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.250> get

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
would be achievements that you get

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.530 
would be achievements that you get
rewarded<00:01:41.549> for<00:01:43.130> so<00:01:44.130> here's<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.430> look<00:01:44.579> at<00:01:44.790> kind<00:01:45.479> of

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
rewarded for so here's a look at kind of

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.819 
rewarded for so here's a look at kind of
a<00:01:45.630> mock-up<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:46.140> what<00:01:46.200> we<00:01:46.409> could<00:01:46.530> see<00:01:46.680> the

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
a mock-up of what we could see the

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.010 
a mock-up of what we could see the
system<00:01:47.040> looking<00:01:47.399> like<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:47.820> there's<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.240> new

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
system looking like so there's a new

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.510 
system looking like so there's a new
category<00:01:49.259> in<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.710> left<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.130> achievement

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
category in the left of the achievement

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.399 
category in the left of the achievement
panel<00:01:50.850> for<00:01:51.180> guild<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.689> over<00:01:52.140> there<00:01:52.290> in<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
panel for guild and over there in the

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.800 
panel for guild and over there in the
right<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.740> can<00:01:52.890> see<00:01:53.070> those<00:01:53.540> those<00:01:54.540> one<00:01:54.720> in

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
right you can see those those one in

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.450 
right you can see those those one in
there<00:01:54.930> become<00:01:55.320> exalted<00:01:55.799> with<00:01:55.979> all<00:01:56.070> factions

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
there become exalted with all factions

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.020 
there become exalted with all factions
United<00:01:57.060> Nations<00:01:57.390> example<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.439> one<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.860> think<00:01:59.579> we

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
United Nations example of one I think we

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.859 
United Nations example of one I think we
actually<00:02:00.119> have<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.390> achievement<00:02:00.659> for

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
actually have that achievement for

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.440 
actually have that achievement for
single<00:02:01.229> players<00:02:01.409> now<00:02:02.009> someone<00:02:02.820> actually<00:02:03.090> gets

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
single players now someone actually gets

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.690 
single players now someone actually gets
that<00:02:03.570> too<00:02:03.810> but<00:02:04.110> with<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.950> idea<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.310> doing<00:02:05.460> this

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
that too but with the idea of doing this

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.010 
that too but with the idea of doing this
for<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:05.939> guild<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.479> then<00:02:06.630> down<00:02:06.780> at<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:06.960> bottom

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
for a guild and then down at the bottom

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.690 
for a guild and then down at the bottom
you<00:02:07.500> can<00:02:07.530> see<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.890> concept<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.340> would<00:02:08.459> be

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
you can see the concept it would be

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.820 
you can see the concept it would be
showing<00:02:08.910> like<00:02:09.300> your<00:02:09.450> guild<00:02:09.690> logo<00:02:09.869> when<00:02:10.560> this

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
showing like your guild logo when this

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.350 
showing like your guild logo when this
pops<00:02:11.099> up<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.520> everyone<00:02:11.849> in<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.000> guild<00:02:12.120> would

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
pops up and everyone in the guild would

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.130 
pops up and everyone in the guild would
see<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.720> when<00:02:12.930> you're

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
see that when you're

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.590 
see that when you're
gets<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.650> achievement<00:02:16.640> so<00:02:17.640> finishing<00:02:18.270> up<00:02:18.420> a

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
gets the achievement so finishing up a

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.170 
gets the achievement so finishing up a
couple<00:02:18.840> new<00:02:19.050> features<00:02:19.380> we're<00:02:19.740> talking<00:02:20.010> about

couple new features we're talking about
one<00:02:21.180> big<00:02:21.209> thing<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.290> interface<00:02:22.650> is<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:23.010> do

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
one big thing and the interface is to do

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.570 
one big thing and the interface is to do
a<00:02:23.130> guild<00:02:23.400> newsfeed

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.610 

I've<00:02:30.240> got<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.450> mock-up<00:02:30.750> of<00:02:30.930> this<00:02:31.320> for<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:31.560> guys

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
I've got a mock-up of this for you guys

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.290 
I've got a mock-up of this for you guys
to<00:02:31.890> see<00:02:32.040> in<00:02:32.160> just<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:32.400> minute<00:02:32.580> here<00:02:32.670> but<00:02:33.180> the

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
to see in just a minute here but the

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.390 
to see in just a minute here but the
concept<00:02:33.720> is<00:02:33.840> that<00:02:33.900> we'd<00:02:34.230> show<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:35.100> know<00:02:35.220> the

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
concept is that we'd show you know the

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.060 
concept is that we'd show you know the
last<00:02:35.610> maybe<00:02:36.300> two<00:02:36.990> to<00:02:37.170> three<00:02:37.440> days<00:02:37.590> worth<00:02:37.950> of

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
last maybe two to three days worth of

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.170 
last maybe two to three days worth of
things<00:02:38.280> that<00:02:38.460> are<00:02:38.550> happened<00:02:38.880> within<00:02:39.000> the

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
things that are happened within the

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.700 
things that are happened within the
guild<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.600> this<00:02:39.780> would<00:02:39.930> be<00:02:39.960> right<00:02:40.290> on<00:02:40.560> the

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
guild and this would be right on the

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.620 
guild and this would be right on the
guild<00:02:40.920> pain<00:02:41.160> when<00:02:41.460> you<00:02:41.550> log<00:02:41.760> in<00:02:42.000> we're<00:02:42.540> gonna

do a whole new new UI for the guild pain
and<00:02:45.150> it<00:02:45.390> would<00:02:45.480> show<00:02:45.630> things<00:02:45.900> like<00:02:46.170> boss<00:02:46.440> kills

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800

the<00:03:56.340> guild<00:03:56.610> overall<00:03:57.450> and<00:03:57.720> so<00:03:58.020> this<00:03:58.140> is<00:03:58.200> going

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
the guild overall and so this is going

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.690 
the guild overall and so this is going
to<00:03:58.530> be<00:03:58.650> supported<00:03:59.100> through<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.340> talent

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
to be supported through the talent

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.390 
to be supported through the talent
system<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.270> the<00:04:00.870> pitch<00:04:01.050> here<00:04:01.350> is<00:04:01.650> that<00:04:01.920> you'll

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
system and the pitch here is that you'll

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.740 
system and the pitch here is that you'll
be<00:04:02.520> able<00:04:02.640> to<00:04:02.850> spend<00:04:03.210> a<00:04:03.330> certain<00:04:03.450> amount<00:04:03.600> of

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
be able to spend a certain amount of

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.440 
be able to spend a certain amount of
talent<00:04:03.930> points<00:04:04.230> to<00:04:04.860> up<00:04:05.160> a<00:04:05.310> percentage<00:04:05.850> of<00:04:06.090> gold

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
talent points to up a percentage of gold

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.570 
talent points to up a percentage of gold
and<00:04:06.780> this<00:04:07.200> is<00:04:07.350> extra<00:04:07.800> gold<00:04:07.980> that<00:04:08.280> would<00:04:08.400> drop

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
and this is extra gold that would drop

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.300 
and this is extra gold that would drop
so<00:04:08.850> let's<00:04:09.030> say<00:04:09.210> you<00:04:09.630> know<00:04:10.110> you<00:04:10.650> kill<00:04:10.920> yog<00:04:11.280> and

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
so let's say you know you kill yog and

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.730 
so let's say you know you kill yog and
he<00:04:11.790> normally<00:04:12.210> drops<00:04:12.480> 10<00:04:12.840> gold<00:04:13.110> and<00:04:13.470> you<00:04:13.560> have

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
he normally drops 10 gold and you have

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.500 
he normally drops 10 gold and you have
five<00:04:14.100> percent<00:04:14.430> extra<00:04:14.670> here<00:04:14.880> he's<00:04:15.300> going<00:04:15.420> to

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
five percent extra here he's going to

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.060 
five percent extra here he's going to
drop<00:04:15.690> that<00:04:15.750> extra<00:04:16.170> gold<00:04:16.380> and<00:04:16.860> when<00:04:16.950> it's

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
drop that extra gold and when it's

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.800 
drop that extra gold and when it's
looted<00:04:17.430> it<00:04:17.640> will<00:04:17.790> go<00:04:17.880> directly<00:04:18.060> to<00:04:18.540> the<00:04:18.570> guild

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
looted it will go directly to the guild

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:26.030 
looted it will go directly to the guild
bank<00:04:19.020> automatically<00:04:24.440> so<00:04:25.440> instead<00:04:25.770> of<00:04:25.830> doing

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
bank automatically so instead of doing

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.850 
bank automatically so instead of doing
something<00:04:26.430> like<00:04:26.610> a<00:04:27.300> tax<00:04:27.840> system<00:04:28.110> or<00:04:28.560> a<00:04:28.590> tin

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
something like a tax system or a tin

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.070 
something like a tax system or a tin
system<00:04:29.280> where<00:04:29.490> every<00:04:30.270> single<00:04:30.660> bit<00:04:30.810> of<00:04:30.840> gold

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
system where every single bit of gold

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.900 
system where every single bit of gold
that<00:04:31.290> every<00:04:31.680> member<00:04:31.950> of<00:04:31.980> the<00:04:32.160> guild<00:04:32.340> gets<00:04:32.670> gets

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
that every member of the guild gets gets

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.550 
that every member of the guild gets gets
taxed<00:04:33.210> instead<00:04:33.750> we<00:04:33.960> thought<00:04:34.170> that<00:04:34.320> this<00:04:34.410> would

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
taxed instead we thought that this would

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.440 
taxed instead we thought that this would
be<00:04:34.620> a<00:04:34.890> little<00:04:35.220> bit<00:04:35.400> of<00:04:35.460> a<00:04:35.490> cooler<00:04:35.940> way<00:04:36.180> to<00:04:36.240> do

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
be a little bit of a cooler way to do

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:37.610 
be a little bit of a cooler way to do
this<00:04:36.570> so<00:04:36.750> everyone<00:04:37.020> just<00:04:37.050> feels<00:04:37.350> like<00:04:37.470> they're

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
this so everyone just feels like they're

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.470 
this so everyone just feels like they're
getting<00:04:37.680> rewarded<00:04:38.280> for<00:04:38.790> their<00:04:38.820> contributions

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
getting rewarded for their contributions

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.120 
getting rewarded for their contributions
to<00:04:39.570> the<00:04:39.750> guild<00:04:39.960> rather<00:04:40.260> than<00:04:40.500> being<00:04:40.830> taxed

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
to the guild rather than being taxed

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.950 
to the guild rather than being taxed
another<00:04:44.130> thing<00:04:44.370> through<00:04:45.360> the<00:04:45.450> UI<00:04:45.660> we'd<00:04:45.870> like

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
another thing through the UI we'd like

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.060 
another thing through the UI we'd like
to<00:04:46.080> do<00:04:46.170> is<00:04:46.200> to<00:04:46.320> be<00:04:46.350> able<00:04:46.470> to<00:04:46.620> invite<00:04:46.830> other

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
to do is to be able to invite other

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.710 
to do is to be able to invite other
guilds<00:04:47.490> to<00:04:47.610> events<00:04:48.000> and<00:04:48.150> we<00:04:48.240> think<00:04:48.390> this<00:04:48.570> is

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
guilds to events and we think this is

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.450 
guilds to events and we think this is
great<00:04:49.020> for<00:04:49.230> pug<00:04:49.590> guilds

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.800 

so<00:04:55.460> you<00:04:55.520> might<00:04:55.759> have<00:04:55.880> two<00:04:56.120> guilds<00:04:56.389> it<00:04:56.660> only

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
so you might have two guilds it only

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.140 
so you might have two guilds it only
have<00:04:57.110> say<00:04:57.380> maybe<00:04:57.650> fifteen<00:04:58.130> members<00:04:58.340> each<00:04:58.729> 20

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
have say maybe fifteen members each 20

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.939 
have say maybe fifteen members each 20
members<00:04:59.270> each<00:04:59.569> but<00:04:59.840> they<00:04:59.930> want<00:05:00.139> to<00:05:00.229> run<00:05:00.410> 25

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:00.949 
members each but they want to run 25

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:02.710 
members each but they want to run 25
player<00:05:01.220> raids<00:05:01.490> this<00:05:02.180> way<00:05:02.360> they<00:05:02.539> could<00:05:02.690> have

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
player raids this way they could have

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.120 
player raids this way they could have
might<00:05:02.960> that<00:05:03.169> other<00:05:03.380> guild<00:05:03.710> through<00:05:04.039> the

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
might that other guild through the

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.439 
might that other guild through the
calendar<00:05:04.520> system<00:05:04.880> and<00:05:05.030> be<00:05:05.120> able<00:05:05.210> to<00:05:05.330> have

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449
