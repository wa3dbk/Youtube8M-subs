00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.430
 business operation 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.950

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:06.390
 support 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:08.870

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.590
 area 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.950
 this is this requirement 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.729
 but it's okay 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.729
 is already 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:35.640
 it's like a spray that sets the section 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.640
 of hair 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:48.600
 It is working very well but it was 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:53.159
 taking a solution very long 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.900
 apart for this interest you put it and 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.680
 who is with us 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.680
 at night 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.810
 what I did was this 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.470
 grab a nightmare 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:23.190
 and I started to get the juice out of an onion 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:23.190
 that is pure concentrate down here headquarters 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.269
 the future 12 would move 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.680
 this honey 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.680
 that they keep and suddenly you see 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.980
 and is that according to carmen taras comes very 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.760
 all right 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.760
 and here 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.000
 this ice 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.659
 homemade 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.220
 but all the fortnights 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.819
 for why will 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.330
 and I said you grab a teaspoon 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:34.319

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:38.290
 develop full equal for you to grab 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:42.580
 making grabs is a bone very well 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.580
 it can not be the transit 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:51.670
 grabbing honey a teaspoon a diet 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.670
 with the transit 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.250
 cast 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.050
 but you put in the night communication 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.940
 you have hair 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:15.980

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.100
 irritation 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.910
 the hair you have to put our 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.480
 attention in the pleasure for that 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.930
 and then it's also our stop because 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.930

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.040
 because if it does not exist 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.169
 then he 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:30.400
 they do not work when the position 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:36.190

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:53.089
 they can not get too 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:59.099

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:28.219
 sometimes it's enough 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:28.219
 in this situation until he
