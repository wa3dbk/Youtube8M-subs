00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.680
 hey people maybe you are now 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.480
 I just noticed that a bit 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.640
 look fancier than usual and that 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.369
 is because I decided 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.009
 I have the spouse to air and that 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:28.009
 It's simply about the look of one 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.840
 star the aso looks a bit like too 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.110
 share and have many of you 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.190
 i said i look like men 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.500
 and that's why I tried too 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.870
 to create your style 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.829
 and if you want to see me like that 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.649
 have made 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.840
 then stay tuned then catch 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.840
 Let's start with the make up and that 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.050
 I use the bibi cream from Dior 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.550
 the oas children bibi cream find the 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.170
 I really really great the dect 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.510
 just all skin and her rows 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.760
 hold off and also has a relative 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.530
 matte finish that's why I find quite 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.140
 well you can of course any 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.120
 any foundation to use as take 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.190
 I now from clinique the airbrush 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.900
 concealer and just apply it 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.310
 all places where I just still 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.560
 wants to have a little bit of power 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.009
 and also under the eyes with this one 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.869
 look a little brighter and then 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.060
 is my albert's eyebrow going 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.530
 to use because you with it the 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.270
 eyebrows really pretty good 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.149
 can emphasize how I think 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.770
 and I love just about anything at 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.079
 the look of the men cycle very much 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.210
 I'm slippery for that 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.460
 cream the acts always wants from chanel 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.079
 decided so has an art days 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.740
 you already have such a slippery base and 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.270
 I think that's perfect for that 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.969
 and it looks so out of sight 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.469
 then you can just get a black one 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:48.259
 eyeshadow or any 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:50.390
 kajal and thus a thick line 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.909
 just pull your waterline because 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.799
 Amanda Seyfried also has a yes one 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.420
 pulled very thick lidstrich 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.579
 in the picture what I as 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.799
 take inspiration from there 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.140
 we just so dark a red and gives 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.490
 that fold into yours and dazzle that 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.490
 Yes very good 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.270
 so the whole look gets a bit 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.400
 more deep and it will also be perfect 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.180
 Wearable in the evening if you have such a kind 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.560
 Smokie then created it now 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.060
 namely again the same color but 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.400
 this time gives to the lower one 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.590
 Waterline so you emphasize your eyes 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.489
 just a little more and it 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.080
 everything seems a bit dramatic and 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.350
 I decided to do that later 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.480
 these pink eyeshadow apply to 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.060
 just a little more 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.860
 how to give liza and such a radiance 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.290
 then comes my current one 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.209
 Favorite mascara and two bremer dom 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.250
 mascara by patrice for use 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.590
 I'm just doing my upper 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.220
 eyelashes and of course then the 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.220
 lower 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.690
 so all my face not particularly 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.629
 I just worked from 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.430
 lancome son highlighter applied and 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:03.530
 I also have it inside 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.480
 Eye angle applied to the eyes 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.019
 to radiate a little more than that 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.480
 already do and for the 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.700
 then cheek bobby brown that 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.370
 tornesch and wear that easy 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.709
 generous in the photo I as 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.239
 source of inspiration 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.099
 he men do not doubt a browser 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:26.209
 that's why I have this time too 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:27.769
 omitted, and for my lips grab 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.860
 this time to two products once 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:33.730
 a medellÃ­n lipstick in his 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.620
 nice pink color and then mine 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.390
 mccreesh in the grass I'll just give it 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.319
 again on top of it so that one 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.180
 very cheap look 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.280
 and that's how the complete make-up looks like 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.650
 from here you can see the eyes again 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.970
 a bit more accurate and I think they are 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.019
 actually very nice especially for 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.239
 evening and then we come now too 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.970
 already to the hair 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.650
 because we are the same with our hair 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.810
 I have to edit curling iron 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.989
 My first brushed with it really 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.370
 there are no knots in there and then you can 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.290
 you also have a bit of heat protection 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.810
 wear spray on because we want and 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.250
 haha yes do not harm too much and then 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.280
 simply take it any 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.769
 curling iron have the eso and just try 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.810
 to block the lower part of organs 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.669
 because on the photo he has men cell 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.260
 only the lower part is lured 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.330
 and I thought that was really nice 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.250
 especially for people with long hair 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.070
 because it looks really great 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.500
 and then you can just do your hair 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.880
 lure it until it looks like this in the end 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.180
 then it could be again a bit 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.250
 by brush and it was actually 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.630
 pretty much with the hair I have 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:43.840
 that still with hairspray a bit 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.840
 fixed and so is the final result 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.790
 and then we come to it now too 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.470
 the outfit I just have a whole 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.870
 simple outfit chosen 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:03.350
 you see a black jeans and here 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.240
 boyfriend blazer and the make up is 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.790
 really what stands out 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.280
 the shoes are my ankle boots by 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.450
 Deichmann and they are really right 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.460
 great so I think the outfit is perfect 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.650
 if you have a girlfriend in the evening 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.710
 cocktail drink then you want to go 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.690
 you really know very chic and 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:23.450
 Casual outfit is also totally comfortable 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:26.060
 Incidentally, a horrible top is monkey 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:28.550
 and love that about everything so that is 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:31.310
 a very cool look as I think and 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:34.280
 that 's it so I hope the video 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.530

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.970

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.100
 and she can actually do that one day 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.400

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.460

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.600
