00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.410 
straightaway felt like it's gonna be
great<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.529> play<00:00:31.830> live<00:00:32.040> at<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.369> drummer<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:33.270> was

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
great to play live at a drummer so I was

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.150 
great to play live at a drummer so I was
breaking<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.809> all<00:00:33.899> down<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.170> sort<00:00:34.710> preparing

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
breaking it all down and sort preparing

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.830 
breaking it all down and sort preparing
how<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.399> was<00:00:35.550> gonna<00:00:35.640> go<00:00:35.850> about<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.180> live<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.570> but

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
how I was gonna go about it live and but

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.450 
how I was gonna go about it live and but
well<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.260> literally<00:00:37.680> can't<00:00:38.010> play<00:00:38.190> all<00:00:38.219> these

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
well I literally can't play all these

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.799 
well I literally can't play all these
elements<00:00:38.879> in<00:00:38.969> one<00:00:39.120> go<00:00:39.300> because<00:00:39.360> it's<00:00:39.660> just

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
elements in one go because it's just

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.290 
elements in one go because it's just
requires<00:00:40.440> four<00:00:40.710> arms<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.760> decided<00:00:42.120> well

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
requires four arms so I decided well

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.150 
requires four arms so I decided well

sticks<00:00:45.719> said<00:00:46.410> right<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.680> take<00:00:46.890> some<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
sticks said right you take some of the

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.700 
sticks said right you take some of the
rim<00:00:47.670> rim<00:00:48.030> clicks<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.930> play<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.289> on<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:49.620> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
rim rim clicks you play that on on the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.450 
rim rim clicks you play that on on the
floor<00:00:49.920> tom<00:00:50.210> I'll<00:00:51.210> simplify<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.770> overall<00:00:53.160> part

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
floor tom I'll simplify the overall part

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.700 
floor tom I'll simplify the overall part
so<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:53.940> can<00:00:54.090> go<00:00:54.210> between<00:00:54.390> cover<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.350> Tom

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
so I can go between cover the the Tom

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.139 
so I can go between cover the the Tom
figure<00:00:56.039> between<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.399> floor<00:00:56.610> Tom<00:00:56.789> my<00:00:56.940> mind

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
figure between the floor Tom my mind

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:05.560 
figure between the floor Tom my mind
second<00:00:57.510> rack<00:00:57.690> Tom<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.829> rim<00:00:59.070> as<00:00:59.340> well

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.429 

formula<00:01:06.570> wise<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.110> pretty

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
formula wise it is pretty

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.710

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.620 
make it move and that's my approach with
all<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.590> songs<00:02:15.830> daily<00:02:16.070> that<00:02:16.910> I<00:02:17.180> want<00:02:17.540> to

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
all the songs daily that I want to

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.510 
all the songs daily that I want to
replicate<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.680> record<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.190> wouldn't<00:02:19.400> talk

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
replicate the record I wouldn't talk

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.520 
replicate the record I wouldn't talk
about<00:02:19.760> feeling<00:02:20.120> of<00:02:20.240> people<00:02:20.660> playing<00:02:20.900> it<00:02:21.080> as<00:02:21.470> a

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
about feeling of people playing it as a

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.640 
about feeling of people playing it as a
song<00:02:21.920> gusset<00:02:22.340> is<00:02:22.459> kind<00:02:22.670> of<00:02:22.700> more<00:02:22.940> of<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.209> same

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
song gusset is kind of more of the same

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.979 
song gusset is kind of more of the same
the<00:02:24.650> second<00:02:25.010> half<00:02:25.160> of<00:02:25.310> verse<00:02:25.340> two<00:02:25.850> I<00:02:26.060> bring<00:02:26.510> the

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
the second half of verse two I bring the

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.229 
the second half of verse two I bring the
snare<00:02:27.320> in<00:02:27.500> itself<00:02:27.860> should<00:02:28.730> play<00:02:28.910> around<00:02:29.120> the

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
snare in itself should play around the

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:30.729 
snare in itself should play around the
time<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.480> just<00:02:29.840> move<00:02:30.080> around<00:02:30.320> a<00:02:30.440> little<00:02:30.530> bit

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
time to just move around a little bit

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.740 
time to just move around a little bit
