 Hello and welcome here

 that is the ps and stands here 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.519
 Unfortunately , there is no operating costs 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.019
 stated that is a pity 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:31.920

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.950

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.370
 almost, unfortunately, not what you about 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:44.219
 work as well as rise or ever from 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:48.059
 on the outside everything fits that pretty much 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.570
 money is pretty daring but well it 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:01:03.000

00:00:51.570 --> 00:01:04.949

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.810
 you do not really see her that nice 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.760
 done on it 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.420
 but that's what everyone should do 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.159
 decide 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.400
 demand is also required for connections 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.760
 that it's not that nice 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.760
 been processed 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.820
 out there 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.360

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.340
 the for 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.070

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.070
 OK 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.670
 perhaps 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.880
 it stays 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.689

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.689

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.550
 no idea why 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.160
 slightly relaxed 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.970
 4 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.970
