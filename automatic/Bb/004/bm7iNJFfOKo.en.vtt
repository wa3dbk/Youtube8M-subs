00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:12.639
 talk with you about 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.199
 non-toxic cosmetics one of the big 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.510
 changes that I wanted to make when I 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:18.940
 mudara of country was to have a life more 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.099
 healthy and in this I also include 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.349
 buy a little more conscious the 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.599
 products that I use so I started to 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.999
 investigate and I 'm getting familiar with 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.990
 the issue of non-toxic products in 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:31.269
 this time I am going to talk to you 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.730
 specifically of cosmetics and 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:36.670
 personal grooming beauty products 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.350
 etcetera the truth is that most of 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.600
 the cosmetics that we use all 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.370
 these trademarks of all life 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.530
 they have a number of ingredients 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.600
 toxic that little by little then we are going 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.430
 doing more and more damage without 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.629
 we realize that so the 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.399
 I invite you to keep watching this video 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.620
 so that they become familiar with 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.690
 this and it gets a little differentiate 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.879
 among the products that they can buy and 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.100
 those who should leave a little bit of 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.840
 side recently I made a purchase for a 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.460
 page that is very popular in this 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.260
 moment that is called in heart 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.510
 puntocom that is played in the little box 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.980
 information and I wanted to replenish 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.180
 those products that were 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.250
 ending by one 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.560
 that they were healthier and less 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.630
 toxic and how to find out if these 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.310
 products are toxic or not or any 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.590
 product that we can buy in a 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.690
 supermarket or in any store 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.850
 pharmacy I will explain more 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.440
 forward but now I want to show you 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.090
 what are the products you buy that 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.860
 if they are healthy and that is worth it 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.780
 buy the first thing I want 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.400
 show of yesterday's purchase because 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.619
 I also bought other things that I'm going to 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.330
 show later but first thing 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.050
 I want to show you are these two 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.530
 More expensive 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:45.710
 are more expensive for the face and are from the 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.490
 brand queen slim one is one of these that 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.260
 peel 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:53.780
 and two more grapes and the other one is like a 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.550
 moisturizing olive oil mask 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.820
 of grapes I use it a little to exfoliate 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.620
 to remove the dead skin and the other 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.450
 of course to moisturize because I have 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.370
 very dry skin and it really has 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.250
 very much liked these two products the 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.590
 feeling that leaves me very fresh not 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.440
 are these super-heavy masks that 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.000
 you feel like they leave you or a layer or when 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.430
 you are going to peel them you feel that they are 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.140
 really removing the epidermis because 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.240
 they are very strong these masks are a 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.040
 little softer and they are super 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.560
 recommended the other product that 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.380
 I want to show facial care is this 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.780
 of ardor organics this is a cleaner 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.580
 for the face a very soft gel that 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.760
 use to make up I use it 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.400
 when I take a bath and I untangle myself 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.170
 has as a citrus essence this 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.629
 product is based on what we 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.540
 we know as the sorrow of aloe or the 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:46.879
 aloe vera juice among other products 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.360
 but its main product is this and it is 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:52.420
 high in vitamin c 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.970
 and therefore it is antioxidant is a 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.860
 very gentle cleaner and I love the smell 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.320
 it's also very refreshing all these 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.510
 products are like very natural 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.700
 then the sensations of freshness and 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.100
 for this time of the heat they seem to me 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.810
 excellent so I also recommend 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.880
 much this product one of the products 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.250
 which contain more toxic are the 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.770
 deodorants and this was something that I 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.330
 I really wanted to change there are other 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.830
 trademarks also that are 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.050
 eliminating its ingredients a little 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.480
 toxic like aluminum parabens 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:26.410
 however I found this also in 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.380
 yesterday that from the crystal brand and it's a 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:32.739
 deodorant of these normal roll 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.390
 liquid there are other types of deodorants 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.920
 if they do not like these from the 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.630
 deodorants is complicated because 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.270
 you have to prove what these functions and 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.640
 which ones I did not sweat a lot so this 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.620
 it has been good for me but good if you have 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.580
 a sweat a little stronger you have 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.580
 to try another deodorant type maybe 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.100
 but this one says that it's made out of 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.350
 Natural minerals then does not contain 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.750
 these other toxics that especially 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.880
 they go much easier to the body 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.830
 when we the girls shave us 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.900
 moss and pores are much more 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.120
 open much more sensitive absorb 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.250
 this kind of toxic so it's very 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.600
 important that they take into account change 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.400
 its deodorant 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.260
 if you want to start making this change 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.510
 of products also maybe change my 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.330
 browser because I used one that is 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.850
 very popular to wash dial rhythms 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.650
 dancing and apparently these products 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.010
 they're super toxic so I've 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.870
 investigated so for this deficit is 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.330
 formula that I had never tried this 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.490
 brand and in fact this brand me the 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.860
 recommended a friend a color of my 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.200
 sister who uses only this brand of 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.450
 makeup and I bought it naiker and 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.460
 it really is soon I love me 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.620
 love the tone that this has comes in 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.630
 two tones a little more bandage for the 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.000
 people who have the skin or latex more 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.600
 dark and 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.310
 for the paler people like me and it has 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.590
 like various tones so you can go 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.360
 mixing as you want and I love 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.280
 to be super super well and for 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.220
 last I also wanted to show you a 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.600
 product so they can see that they can 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.540
 find these products in their stores 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:08.330
 local as long as they are attentive to 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:12.230
 its components and this is the bathroom 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:15.050
 of the deliplus brand that is mercadona 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:17.240
 mercadona this is a soap a gel of 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:21.020
 bathroom here is used a lot this 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.600
 version is a natural ibiza soap 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.360
 flour for oily skin and it's 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.790
 thyme and oil of pablos and I like 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:32.440
 a lot because he has this smell again 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:34.570
 herbal I was talking about 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:38.170
 I do not know there are people who do not like it 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:40.540
 smell herbs to me I like other 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:43.000
 even in this time it refreshes me 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.190
 then I feel that just like I am 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.160
 fighting is like this commercial of 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.960
 yerbal this is the classic cats in the 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.300
 tango girls not in a jungle or in a 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.130
 jungle I do not remember is more or less that 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.720
 sensation but without the toxics that 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.480
 They have this type of products 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.330
 trade now let's see if a 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.010
 product is toxic or not, I 'm going to give them 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:06.700
 the tips that I have taken into account 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:08.320
 the methodology that I use to know 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.260
 If this is the case or not, you can 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.030
 investigate about other methods that 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:16.060
 be comfortable for you but I 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:18.190
 basically I used three things that 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.930
 technology offers us the first of 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.880
 One is a web page called 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.610
 'the good wife' dotcom of course 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:27.070
 which in the information box and is 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.470
 a page that is a database 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.810
 has I think about 70 thousand 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:34.210
 products within your list and you can 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.310
 choose if you want to evaluate it according to 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.680
 health according to environmental damage 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.420
 also animals or not etcetera the 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.520
 second thing I use is a page 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:46.120
 web is also a bit the same 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:48.040
 methodology of the previous one because I do not know 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.900
 it's all the journalism that I 'm left 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.460
 inside of me he tells me that I always have 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.950
 to compare at least the sources though 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.720
 are more or less similar and this is 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:58.870
 flame wm 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.160
 point ong and I like these two pages 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.600
 because they even make you one 

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.490
 specific description of 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.550
 ingredients of this product and which 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:08.740
 they are of high concern of concern 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.720
 moderate which are highly toxic 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.790
 which ones not because it 's okay and why not 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.430
 and also take into consideration other 

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:17.050
 things like the environment and the third thing 

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:19.000
 that he used when I'm on the street 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:23.270
 used an application that is called 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.979
 ingredients watch in which you can 

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:28.110
 introduce a specific ingredient 

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:30.539
 this is going to say its level of toxicity and 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.519
 whether it is to worry or not and this has been 

00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:34.469
 everything for this video I hope you have them 

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:36.300
 liked that it has been useful and that they can 

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:39.089
 start applying these little things to 

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:41.550
 little go see what product they use 

00:07:39.089 --> 00:07:44.129
 which do not get overwhelmed because when 

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:46.409
 check your cabinets are going to start 

00:07:44.129 --> 00:07:49.469
 see that everything they have is toxic 

00:07:46.409 --> 00:07:51.929
 normal soul are doing that little change 

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:54.089
 to little so if they want me to talk more 

00:07:51.929 --> 00:07:56.279
 of this topic later on when
