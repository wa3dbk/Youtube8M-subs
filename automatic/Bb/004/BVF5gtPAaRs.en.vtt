00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
it's going to be about about your index

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.550

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
amount of glue on it so i'm pressing

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.630 
amount of glue on it so i'm pressing
that<00:03:32.030> down<00:03:32.239> holding<00:03:33.140> it<00:03:33.260> since<00:03:33.920> Freddy<00:03:34.400> down

turning on the blank side and then
you're<00:03:59.930> pinching<00:04:00.859> the<00:04:01.519> middle<00:04:01.940> you're

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
you're pinching the middle you're

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.750 
you're pinching the middle you're
starting<00:04:02.780> at<00:04:03.109> the<00:04:03.140> middle<00:04:03.650> and<00:04:03.920> then<00:04:04.519> you're

pinching the middle then you picture the

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.710 
pinching the middle then you picture the
top<00:04:07.400> of<00:04:07.640> it<00:04:07.790> then<00:04:07.819> you're<00:04:08.180> pitching<00:04:08.600> the
