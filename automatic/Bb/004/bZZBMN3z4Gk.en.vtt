 It is finally brave 4 people studded at this time of the two released 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:23.880
 In as expected when the package is also of the same series the front side and the back side 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.480
 Also considered in thunderbird if there is green Oh rear and yellow rear 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.440
 I will 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.440
 And then immediately review in 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:40.120
 Leiden Doll first die shop doll contents at roughly plant body and the weapon and shield 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:44.360
 Manuals are also included in the Met, Mount Parts and Merging Auxiliary Parts 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:50.270
 If you turn the manual over, you will also find instructions on how to combine thunderbirds . 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:53.260
 Let's assemble the chat First , take out the clear parts from here 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:58.780
 I also remove parts from the case 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:06.620
 First of all , put clear parts and cloak on the back side to shield 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:10.880
 If you have the parts and the met parts and shields and weapons 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:15.230
 It is Kansai Leyden Doll Yes, as always as it was easily done in a while 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:19.910
 It is totally focused and Breakfast Raven and Katori Vuitton basic make 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:22.190
 The cloak also has a clear part and comes with a shield, so it 's common to work with a ball joint 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:26.610
 Can move freely 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:29.940
 But when the neck card but I do not this does not occur is hard to Helsingborg 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:36.360
 Of course there will be an action pose 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:38.630
 You can also remove parts and transform from figure state to block state 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.900
 This is also usual 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:46.040
 Yes i feel like this 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:51.770
 After all transformation is fun to play after all 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:55.040
 During that there Yes I mean once again to expand the part 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:59.960
 We entered and deformation in Leiden Doll 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:03.860
 Next, during the loan, the baron body, the shield and the weapon part 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:10.280
 Cloak after union auxiliary parts and barron manual 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:11.000
 Personally, personality also grown significantly and I think Baron and integrated with and from grass is quite like the first 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.030
 It was 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.060
 Then take out the auxiliary parts from the vinyl 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:22.410
 Case to barrow 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:25.170
 I take out the body is common to other heroes except from the chest of the chest , but parts are in the mantle 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.800
 Put parts on the shield 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:32.489
 And I make a weapon and splash the parts after that 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.420
 I met a cloak and shield and 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.040
 It is safe 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.939
 It is Kansai baron 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:44.030
 Barlow is also good I'm less focused than other developments 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:49.069
 I'm horny, but this Bukoyama design is cool 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:54.560
 The shape of the mount has also changed, and the weapon purse also has a diamond cut. 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:59.000
 Because this is also common to work, it moves freely to some extent 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:03.080
 Midori Tokuzawa of the pilot who can be done by aligning with Leiden Doll 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.500
 It will come nicely and the two people are lined up because it is also often act together 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:13.170
 And all four heroes are done by this 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:16.370
 Oh, this is good because the personal color of each character is different 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.370
 It is rough to line up 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:28.730
 can you do 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:37.459
 We introduced the version of Tenkai Night US Magazine pedia ç¦… with exclusion 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.330
 A small US magazine figures are painted say Body Parts whether Met parts Toka properly 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.230
 Because 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.860
 It is close to the image in the play, and the base colors of the green and yellow are also beautiful with good coloring 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.060
 is not it 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.450
 After all it was decided to line up the leading role import and it was decided more than Tenkai Knight rice type 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.080
 media 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.830
 It was introduction of Leiden Doll and Baron
