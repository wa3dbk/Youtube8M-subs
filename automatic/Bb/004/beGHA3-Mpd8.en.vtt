and windows then you need to use

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.679 
and windows then you need to use
surveying<00:01:13.770> techniques<00:01:14.159> like<00:01:14.700> triangulation

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689

in the garden whilst you're doing the
survey<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.130> also<00:01:29.549> need<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.759> look<00:01:30.000> at<00:01:30.119> things

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.330 
survey you also need to look at things
outside<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:31.110> garden<00:01:31.320> anything<00:01:32.189> like

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
outside the garden anything like

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.550 
outside the garden anything like
overhanging<00:01:32.970> trees<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.780> make<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.200> note<00:01:34.530> of

overhanging trees and make a note of

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.740 
overhanging trees and make a note of
these<00:01:34.890> on<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.340> survey<00:01:35.759> these<00:01:36.299> will<00:01:36.570> all

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
these on the survey these will all

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.609 
these on the survey these will all
affect<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.650> eventual<00:01:38.159> design<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.030> garden

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
affect the eventual design of the garden

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.950 
affect the eventual design of the garden
you<00:01:40.619> also<00:01:40.740> need<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.040> do<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> site<00:01:41.850> analysis<00:01:42.750> as

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
you also need to do a site analysis as

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.560 
you also need to do a site analysis as
well<00:01:43.020> as<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.770> measuring<00:01:44.220> take<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.909> soil<00:01:45.240> sample

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
well as the measuring take a soil sample

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.410 
well as the measuring take a soil sample
it's<00:01:46.049> really<00:01:46.649> important<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.909> know<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
it's really important that you know the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.960 
it's really important that you know the
pH<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.229> type<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.920> your<00:01:50.130> soil<00:01:50.430> when<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.759> comes

to planting you need to look beyond the
garden<00:01:53.640> boundaries<00:01:54.119> as<00:01:54.240> well<00:01:54.420> see<00:01:55.049> if<00:01:55.140> there

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
garden boundaries as well see if there

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.590

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
process is to find someone that you
