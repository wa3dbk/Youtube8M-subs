00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.340
 and 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.590
 and I started listening to classical music 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.800
 I would be 7 or 8 years old 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.410
 and I realized that it was an ingredient 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.090
 optimal for happiness I think to give 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.190
 a concert is to communicate your 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.230
 feelings and is in some way 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.690
 also receive the concert do not do it 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.140
 you only the Astur concert and the 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.140
 public 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.590
 i 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.030
 the guitar has many more 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.299
 possibilities with orchestras of which 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.830
 in principle at first it seems 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.409
 I was lucky to play with those who are 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.150
 very good and the truth is that they help 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.670
 get the best out of yourself when you're 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.590
 touching what happens is that there is no 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.570
 many possibilities to play with the 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.840
 orchestra would have to be a little more 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.799
 recognized and figure more within the 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.799
 schedules and are 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.140
 Y 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.430
 one 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.630
 me when I look for an instrument to 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.670
 I'm looking for an instrument that suits 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:10.540
 a little bit to my personality as 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:13.660
 interpreter and I think that as an interpreter I 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:17.350
 I give a value 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:20.110
 very big to the color to the bell I like it 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.720
 a lot of painting the music that I play coloring 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.400
 the and then for me it's basic that the 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.290
 instrument offer me a palette of 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.960
 very broad colors I knew these 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.610
 guitars because they were good enough 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.510
 known when she was looking 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.819
 instruments 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.260
 and see those possibilities that have 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.439
 timbrics was what decided me to 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:42.120
 try to get one and thankfully 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:45.390
 the builder matÃ­as de ammÃ¡n 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.459
 he was very interested before we started 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.099
 build me the instrument was interested 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:53.489
 much to know how I played and was 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:56.810
 some concerts and in the end one did 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.810
 the guitar for me 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.190
 ah 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.470
 I think one of the characteristics that 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:08.110
 I have to comment that is that I like 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.810
 some way break with what is 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.760
 has taken for granted as soon as 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.560
 interpretation as to how 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.480
 transcript some of the 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.669
 transcripts that I have done have been a 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.960
 little flashy because they were 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:21.960
 very different from others 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.740
 ah 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.139
 ah 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.680
 ah 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:07.680
 ah 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:15.199
 in principle I suppose that by being 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:17.860
 I feel very comfortable with the Spanish 

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:17.860
 Spanish repertoire 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:31.590
 Well the truth is that the profession of 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:34.410
 some way is a bit sacrificial there 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.450
 that work hard but once 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.160
 you are on stage is very 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.780
 rewarding when I'm in the 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.960
 stage not only I also give 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:46.590
 I receive and somehow I feel that the 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:48.690
 I do not leave it alone because there is a 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:51.060
 interaction with the public each 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:53.070
 concert is different and each concert 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.430
 I have different sensations sensations 

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.320
 new 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.100
 and it's an absolutely experience 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.100
 fascinating 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:26.180
 I think music helps me to be 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:28.310
 happier is a basic ingredient for 

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:31.249
 my happiness and I would also like 

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:33.319
 reach the public 

00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:35.949
 direct the public a little bit of that 

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:35.949
 happiness
