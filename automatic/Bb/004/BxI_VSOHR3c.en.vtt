 tee 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:35.930
 It is really here . 8 This time the land setting is released 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:40.870
 Because say squid's ed that I'm doing the meat in that crd 08 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:42.899

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.899

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:54.250
 I 'm trying it now but it's not final 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:59.500
 I have put a spring for f 1 in the carman's road goal of the rear damper 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:03.730
 Pump to Funbara in the back when sank I'm not allowed to touch in one g state

 Is it at a stage where it is worth watching? 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.980
 After that, it is just bad that there is no weight roller 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:24.400
 Everyone abandoned Lear but not 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:29.920
 If you don't have it, it will die for me 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:32.830
 Multiplied by the action when viewed in total because the can as early as the praise minute to fly to take the plunge 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.920
 I like it because I can get started quickly 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:39.390
 It seems that there is no meat for the entire force 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.390

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.600
 After all 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:55.540
 If you get up, you will be able to run well and you will try to generate it well. 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.570

00:02:49.090 --> 00:03:03.300
 I want to bring out the feeling that the front lifts up when I went together like cooking now voluntary d 1 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:05.330
