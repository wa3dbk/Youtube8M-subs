on<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.240> thing<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.899> crazy<00:01:52.290> i'm<00:01:52.530> sure<00:01:52.680> the

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
on this thing this is crazy i'm sure the

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.490 
on this thing this is crazy i'm sure the
airflow<00:01:53.250> here<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:53.759> incredible<00:01:54.540> it's<00:01:55.020> got<00:01:55.259> some

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
airflow here is incredible it's got some

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.130 
airflow here is incredible it's got some
steel<00:01:55.920> lining<00:01:56.729> in<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.210> looks<00:01:57.630> like<00:01:57.810> really

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
steel lining in the it looks like really

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.200 
steel lining in the it looks like really
the<00:01:58.259> propeller<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.829> some<00:01:59.219> spaceship<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.000> then

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
the propeller of some spaceship and then

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.730 
the propeller of some spaceship and then
you've<00:02:00.360> got<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.689> radiator<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.350> takes<00:02:01.590> up

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
you've got this radiator that takes up

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.910 
you've got this radiator that takes up
most<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.219> card<00:02:02.579> i<00:02:02.820> mean<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.719> respects<00:02:04.710> here

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
most of the card i mean it respects here
