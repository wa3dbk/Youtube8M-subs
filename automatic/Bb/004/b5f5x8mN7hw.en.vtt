00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
know when it when push comes to shove

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.090 
know when it when push comes to shove
all<00:02:40.670> too<00:02:41.000> often<00:02:41.500> folks<00:02:42.500> in<00:02:42.650> elected<00:02:43.010> office

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
all too often folks in elected office

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.800 
all too often folks in elected office
they're<00:02:43.460> looking<00:02:43.760> out<00:02:43.820> for<00:02:43.880> themselves<00:02:44.420> and

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
they're looking out for themselves and

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.130 
they're looking out for themselves and
not<00:02:45.530> looking<00:02:45.860> out<00:02:45.980> for<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:47.720> folks<00:02:47.870> who<00:02:48.020> put

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
them there there are too many

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.010 
them there there are too many
compromises<00:02:50.690> that<00:02:52.240> the<00:02:53.240> special<00:02:53.660> interests

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
compromises that the special interests

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.620 
compromises that the special interests
have<00:02:54.170> too<00:02:54.350> much<00:02:54.530> power<00:02:55.090> they<00:02:56.090> just<00:02:56.300> got<00:02:56.450> too

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
have too much power they just got too

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.990 
have too much power they just got too
much<00:02:56.780> clout<00:02:57.220> there's<00:02:58.220> too<00:02:58.340> much<00:02:58.520> big<00:02:58.760> money

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000

washing<00:02:59.750> around<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:02.930> I<00:03:03.590> decided<00:03:03.950> finally<00:03:04.340> to

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
washing around and I decided finally to

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.160 
washing around and I decided finally to
get<00:03:05.120> involved<00:03:05.570> because<00:03:05.690> I<00:03:06.550> realized<00:03:07.900> if<00:03:08.900> I

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
get involved because I realized if I

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.500 
get involved because I realized if I
wasn't<00:03:09.410> willing<00:03:09.680> to<00:03:09.800> step<00:03:10.040> up<00:03:10.220> and<00:03:10.280> be<00:03:11.240> true<00:03:11.480> to

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
wasn't willing to step up and be true to

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.260 
wasn't willing to step up and be true to
the<00:03:11.690> things<00:03:11.900> I<00:03:12.080> believe<00:03:12.350> in<00:03:12.850> then<00:03:13.850> the<00:03:13.970> system

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
the things I believe in then the system

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:20.530 
the things I believe in then the system
wouldn't<00:03:14.480> change<00:03:18.700> every<00:03:19.700> single<00:03:20.000> one<00:03:20.270> of<00:03:20.300> you

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
wouldn't change every single one of you

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.170 
wouldn't change every single one of you

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
had that same kind of moment at the

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.870
