00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.600 

every<00:00:52.360> note<00:00:52.600> has<00:00:52.809> a<00:00:52.840> really<00:00:53.350> hard<00:00:53.620> impact<00:00:53.890> and

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
every note has a really hard impact and

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.060 
every note has a really hard impact and
that's<00:00:54.879> unlike<00:00:55.809> the<00:00:55.989> rubbery<00:00:56.350> feel<00:00:56.739> that<00:00:56.980> you

that's unlike the rubbery feel that you

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.619 
that's unlike the rubbery feel that you
get<00:00:57.250> from<00:00:57.370> playing<00:00:57.579> a<00:00:57.730> blackface<00:00:58.149> Fender<00:00:58.600> amp

get from playing a blackface Fender amp
so<00:00:59.290> this<00:00:59.440> is<00:00:59.590> not<00:00:59.770> your<00:00:59.949> little<00:01:00.340> winged<00:01:00.660> Texas

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
tone that can also be driven into a

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:16.980 
tone that can also be driven into a
harder<00:01:08.170> crunch<00:01:15.390> okay<00:01:16.390> so<00:01:16.479> that's<00:01:16.750> still

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
harder crunch okay so that's still
