00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.170
 we are in the state of morelos 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:30.480
 amazing and the flying fox is the 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.509
 biggest bat in the world true or 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.509
 false 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.710
 but because we do not do one thing 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.520
 come with me and we look for your food and we 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.520
 We put trade 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.620
 because his little face resembles the face of 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.990
 a show holds its ears well 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.720
 unemployed and because I do not return it 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.700
 big because when they open their wings 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.239
 can measure up to one meter 20 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.970
 between a hyena 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.579
 between their fingers and in their bodies they have 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.409
 a membrane that make the kind of wing 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:14.409
 it does a water function 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.020
 no these bats do not attack only 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.729
 eat fruits in some places 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.380
 consider pests because they form the 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.010
 fruits of the plantations then the 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.600
 people do not love them so much 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.340
 first you have to get very very high and 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.810
 I do not think you should hang up because 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.810
 I think you can defend and bite 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.390
 which is the common saying that these are like 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.820
 vampires of a myth a belief that 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.759
 we have how their form is different they are 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.720
 always hung then do not believe us 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.540
 fear 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.120
 because they are always hanging good 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.060
 Murcia evolved and adapted to 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.400
 always hanging are very clumsy in 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:04.370
 the floor because his arms are very long 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.370
 then they can not walk or anything 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.000
 very well 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:15.940
 the flying fox is the most 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.010
 great of the true or false true world 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:23.660
 has an amplitude of the opening pull 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:27.330
 from 140 to 180 centimeters what makes it 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.400
 the greatest of all bats 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.680

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.390
 amazing and a huge animal and 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.300
 accompanying the next with tacos 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.300
 of the most amazing goodbye
