set your preference of how fast you want

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.209 
set your preference of how fast you want
the<00:00:44.760> fans<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.120> go<00:00:45.649> okay<00:00:46.649> now<00:00:46.680> let's<00:00:47.039> go<00:00:47.160> ahead

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
the fans to go okay now let's go ahead

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.979 
the fans to go okay now let's go ahead
and<00:00:47.430> take<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.579> look<00:00:47.850> at<00:00:48.000> how<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.300> system<00:00:48.600> fan

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
and take a look at how the system fan

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:49.569 
and take a look at how the system fan
works

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
works

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.029 
works
on<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:51.449> fan<00:00:51.660> controller<00:00:52.079> we<00:00:52.410> currently<00:00:52.649> have

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
on the fan controller we currently have

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.569 
on the fan controller we currently have
it<00:00:53.190> set<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.210> lowest<00:00:54.420> rpm<00:00:55.430> when<00:00:56.430> we

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
it set to the lowest rpm when we

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.479 
it set to the lowest rpm when we
increase<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.090> RPM<00:00:57.800> you'll<00:00:58.800> notice<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.309> the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
increase the RPM you'll notice that the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.689 
increase the RPM you'll notice that the
LEDs<00:01:00.000> as<00:01:00.270> well<00:01:01.079> as<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> fan<00:01:01.500> speed<00:01:01.829> gets

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
LEDs as well as the fan speed gets

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.760 
LEDs as well as the fan speed gets
faster<00:01:03.769> when<00:01:04.769> we<00:01:04.799> decrease<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.570> LEDs<00:01:07.049> get

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
faster when we decrease it the LEDs get

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.109 
faster when we decrease it the LEDs get
dimmer<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.850> fan<00:01:09.090> speed<00:01:09.390> slows<00:01:10.350> down

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
dimmer and the fan speed slows down

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:17.590 
dimmer and the fan speed slows down
increase<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.439> gets<00:01:13.439> faster<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.189> brighter

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.630 

some<00:01:18.350> other<00:01:18.530> features<00:01:18.740> of<00:01:19.070> the<00:01:19.159> silent<00:01:19.520> Pro

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
some other features of the silent Pro

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.149 
some other features of the silent Pro
hybrid<00:01:20.090> are<00:01:20.479> the<00:01:20.659> 80<00:01:20.840> plus<00:01:21.170> gold<00:01:21.200> that<00:01:21.920> you<00:01:22.010> see

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
hybrid are the 80 plus gold that you see

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.810 
hybrid are the 80 plus gold that you see
right<00:01:22.310> here<00:01:22.450> it<00:01:23.450> has<00:01:23.690> a<00:01:23.720> passive<00:01:24.110> PFC<00:01:24.979> meaning

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
right here it has a passive PFC meaning

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.050 
right here it has a passive PFC meaning
that<00:01:25.910> it<00:01:26.060> doesn't<00:01:26.210> have<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.600> voltage<00:01:26.960> switch

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
that it doesn't have the voltage switch

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.570 
that it doesn't have the voltage switch
it<00:01:29.060> also<00:01:29.210> has<00:01:29.510> fully<00:01:29.960> modular<00:01:30.229> tables<00:01:30.950> but

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
it also has fully modular tables but

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.430 
it also has fully modular tables but
that's<00:01:31.760> not<00:01:31.970> it<00:01:32.119> those<00:01:32.300> cables<00:01:32.750> are<00:01:32.869> extended

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
that's not it those cables are extended

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.170 
that's not it those cables are extended
now<00:01:34.100> let's<00:01:34.369> go<00:01:34.490> ahead<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:34.790> take<00:01:34.910> a<00:01:34.940> closer

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
now let's go ahead and take a closer

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.650 
now let's go ahead and take a closer
look<00:01:35.330> at<00:01:35.600> some<00:01:35.630> of<00:01:35.900> the<00:01:35.960> features<00:01:37.270> okay<00:01:38.270> let's

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
look at some of the features okay let's

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.120 
look at some of the features okay let's
take<00:01:38.810> a<00:01:38.869> closer<00:01:39.170> look<00:01:39.290> at<00:01:39.590> how<00:01:39.710> the<00:01:39.770> fully

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
take a closer look at how the fully

feature works on the power supply as you

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.379 
feature works on the power supply as you

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:51.389 
can see the LEDs on the case fans are

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:54.229 
can see the LEDs on the case fans are
all<00:02:51.540> on<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:52.620> system<00:02:53.010> is<00:02:53.189> fully<00:02:53.609> functional

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
all on the system is fully functional

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.479 
all on the system is fully functional
and<00:02:54.269> running<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:55.530> only<00:02:55.620> thing<00:02:55.889> that's<00:02:56.069> not<00:02:56.219> on

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
and running the only thing that's not on

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.099 
and running the only thing that's not on
is<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:57.299> power<00:02:57.510> supply<00:02:57.689> fan<00:02:59.629> the<00:03:00.629> reason<00:03:00.959> for

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
is the power supply fan the reason for

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.050 
is the power supply fan the reason for
that<00:03:01.260> is<00:03:01.469> that<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:01.829> hasn't<00:03:02.010> reached<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.549> 200

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
that is that it hasn't reached the 200

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.479 
that is that it hasn't reached the 200
watt<00:03:03.209> loading<00:03:03.810> yet<00:03:04.079> nor<00:03:04.650> has<00:03:04.919> it<00:03:04.950> reached<00:03:05.220> to

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
watt loading yet nor has it reached to

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.470 
watt loading yet nor has it reached to
50<00:03:05.879> degrees<00:03:06.269> Celsius<00:03:06.829> temperature<00:03:08.269> but<00:03:09.269> if<00:03:09.389> we

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
50 degrees Celsius temperature but if we

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.800 
50 degrees Celsius temperature but if we
switch<00:03:09.720> it<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:09.870> manual<00:03:10.109> mode<00:03:10.349> the<00:03:11.599> first<00:03:12.599> thing

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
switch it to manual mode the first thing

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.750 
switch it to manual mode the first thing
you'll<00:03:13.019> notice<00:03:13.169> is<00:03:14.040> that<00:03:14.129> the<00:03:14.400> power<00:03:14.609> supply

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
you'll notice is that the power supply

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.890 
you'll notice is that the power supply
fan<00:03:15.409> automatically<00:03:16.409> turns<00:03:16.680> on<00:03:16.889> and<00:03:17.689> in<00:03:18.689> that

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
fan automatically turns on and in that

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:26.540 
fan automatically turns on and in that
mode<00:03:19.250> we<00:03:20.250> can<00:03:20.359> increase

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.470 

or<00:03:26.910> decrease<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:28.170> fan<00:03:28.410> speed<00:03:29.240> so<00:03:30.240> there<00:03:30.390> you

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
or decrease the fan speed so there you

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.970 
or decrease the fan speed so there you
have<00:03:30.510> it<00:03:30.660> guys<00:03:30.930> thanks<00:03:31.410> for<00:03:31.440> watching<00:03:31.890> a
