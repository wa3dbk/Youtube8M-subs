00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.690
 from the new dom is the next need 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.660
 for speed about underground 3 and gta 5 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.160

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:24.359
 obermeier and come now - dear june 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.609
 Fans please make sure that you 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.800
 currently had nothing in mind or out 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.750
 blinking for any other reasons 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.480
 is that because otherwise you'll miss him 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:42.480
 sight of ingame graphic from doom 4 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:44.129
 so be prepared in 321 yes that was it 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.020
 again more than the outlook on 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.730
 this double-barreled shotgun and that 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.860
 Demons able with the slow 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.780
 There are no shooting missiles at first 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.770
 until the official announcement of the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.079
 the game is supposed to be on the e3 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.579
 press conference of bbe firm on 14 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.980
 June 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.620
 but good that it also in official 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.049
 material is in fact scenes from the one 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.869
 you have found the mashed doom 4 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.159
 in the linkedin profile of mark bristol der 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.070
 Back then for the CGI trailer 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.720
 production company blood was responsible and 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.939
 this video shows a completely different one 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.189
 approach to doom namely that there the 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.950
 Resistance on the earth against the demons 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.350
 brut is fighting for something 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.600
 fresher but so is the new duo 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.439
 do not look so enjoy yourself 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.369
 on these pictures 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.369
 as long as you still can 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.900
 according to the official need for speed 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.119
 facebook page will be this week 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.800
 next need for speed announced there 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.780
 there is this picture on which this text 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.420
 is to be read and it shows first of all have 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.979
 Not much if you but with 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.840
 then you can get photoshop skills here 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.670
 daily turn up the brightness 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.710
 and recognizes that in the background two 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.750
 drifting sports car in front of a 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.520
 nocturnal big city can be seen and 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.649
 That's why many fans are now in bright 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.570
 upset because they suspect that that 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.670
 next need for speed therefore a new one 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.739
 underground so probably speed 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.750
 underground would become three 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.060
 it will be really slow time for that 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.560
 the underground 2 is 2004 already 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.530
 the last one appeared thematically 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.480
 similar game came then 2006 good 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.980
 possible so that ea tried this time 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.140
 with need for speed again a new one 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.290
 find rauszubringen underground 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.610
 let's do that on the 21st 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.830
 and if I apologize now I have to 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.570
 again briefly to the super from the intro 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.570
 to slim down to underground 1 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.880
 publisher take two has its current 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.340
 business figures announced while 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.890
 pretty much with the sales figures of gta 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.560
 5 stated that may but also 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:01.520
 because until today, gta 5 has over all 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.630
 platforms 52 million times 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.210
 sold 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.710
 Nevertheless, tektur also notices that gta 5 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.780
 actually already in the last one 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.890
 Fiscal year has appeared because this 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.870
 year you had a clear 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.450
 decline in sales 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.670
 besides, you also had a 295 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.560
 million us dollars expensive net loss 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.150
 Report 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.440
 cenik the boss of take-two explains 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.360
 anyway that's one of the best 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.160
 Business years of all time for the 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.410
 company was and then takes care of 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.450
 quite a mess because an analyst 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.150
 was wondering what happened in the long run 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.670
 announced story dlc s for gta 5 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.140
 he has not said much 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.210
 I can not remember that one 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.020
 ever announced something like that shortly 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:39.770
 but then there was the 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.870
 rectification 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.550
 he only promised himself and if 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.530
 rockstar games so far is here 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.390
 information would then spread 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.580
 they play that with their own 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.920
 do it yourself if rockstar games 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.000
 By the way, still inspirations would need something 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.400
 you can do it that way 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.070
 I found this john marsden mod for 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.070
 gta 5 as a solo campaign pretty cool 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:13.060
 the house that was words with news us 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.130
 See you tomorrow for the next 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.130
 output up to then keep playing
