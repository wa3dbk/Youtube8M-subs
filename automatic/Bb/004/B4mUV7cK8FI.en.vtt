00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:12.169
 arrives now in Brazil the bluetooth technology is that five developed by the 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:15.169
 mercedes-benz for the engines that equip their trucks and buses 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.410
 protec 5 counts with selective catalytic reduction and 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.070
 motor 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.070
 reducing pollutant emissions and fuel consumption 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.440
 or protec 5 will be used as of 2012 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.590
 when it comes into force the new Brazilian legislation for the control of 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.530
 heavy vehicle emissions 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.200
 proconve p7 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.450
 which require an 80% reduction in emissions of particulate matter 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.890
 and 60 percent in nitrogen oxide emissions 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.610
 three years ago the mercedes technological development center 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.910
 prepares this new technology for the specific conditions of the 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.050
 american transport villa team american 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.460
 around 50,000 hours of testing and bench testing and 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.570
 bluetooth is that 5 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.760
 and about 8 million kilometers traveled with trucks and buses. 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.189
 different types in urban areas 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:11.720
 road and off-road 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.869
 confidence of this solution mercedes 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.329
 are about 300 thousand trucks 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:22.119
 and more than 25,000 urban and road buses traveling around the world with 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:23.620
 this technology 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.860
 the technical flu 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.500
 is a technology that was used to meet a number five 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.360
 It is in Europe, however, when transported that for Brazil we are 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.070
 to our musicians all here in Brazil in terms of profile registered in 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.480
 disney fuel performance terms 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.880
 you have started to bring technology and make an adjustment what the 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.630
 Marketplace 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.630
 Brazilian is a person of standing 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.390
 south texas tech 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.850
 to use the blade 32 which is a liquid reducing agent of 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.160
 Automotive nitrogen in vehicle exhaust 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.190
 it functions as a post-treatment system of the caciques copy by 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.110
 selective catalytic reduction 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.010
 which reduces the emission of nitrogen assets 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:14.300
 the extremely efficient work system was 98 4% the lieutenant of pm in the 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.129
 driving 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.969
 and practically transformed the youth center in little meters 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:20.719
 thorny hand waiting here 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:22.409
 soon to be spokeswoman 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:26.979
 in the hand practically vetoed environmentally friendly and with a degree of efficiency 

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:29.239
 never done before 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.310
 Maintenance intervals are most engines with 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.119
 bluetooth is that 5 

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:37.739
 with this the vehicles are more available for the work 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.640
 but its efficiency requires careful attention to the other components of the engine and to the 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:44.549
 fuel quality 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:49.349
 it is necessary to use the common diesel of surprise and 50 with the s10 and with greater 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.949
 number of seven years which increases the burning 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:55.849
 the proper maintenance and use of genuine parts are 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:00.749
 essential to achieve lower emissions and reduced consumption. 

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:02.219
 durability 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:06.639
 the catalyst used by the infinitely distended mercer and is the only one in the 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:11.079
 Brazilian market that is studied which guaranteed as space of resistance 

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:14.979
 the dosing system also does not require major maintenance 

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:20.319
 only need to change the water filter every two years as proof to work 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:21.519
 best 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.519
 will have a pretty performance 

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:29.239
 practically unmatched by current technology and 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.449
 very very good fuel 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:35.059
 and all this together will allow a robustness the product 

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:39.559
 which will end up resulting in no lower operating cost with a 

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:42.559
 very high product reliability 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.840
 the truck was found the actor 28 31 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.319
 Our lady is that 17 22 for urban buses are the first vehicles 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.899
 partnership with the technician 

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:59.399
 the full suitability of bluetooth technology is that five viseu de 

00:03:59.399 --> 00:04:03.179
 oil and also cane and biodisel audience increase the advantages 

00:04:03.179 --> 00:04:06.799
 environmental and economic aspects of this new solution of mercedes 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.769
 the introduction of bluetooth technology is that 5 in brazil there was a big and 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.679
 development capability by the precision of the engine components and 

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:23.559
 vehicles 

00:04:23.559 --> 00:04:28.409
 with special attention to the motor to the post-treatment system of gases 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:30.970
 typical conditions of use in South America 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.099
 and fuel quality 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:38.029
 These innovations reaffirm the innovative vocation of mercedes assets and demonstrated 

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:42.229
 technological capacity to meet emission control standards
