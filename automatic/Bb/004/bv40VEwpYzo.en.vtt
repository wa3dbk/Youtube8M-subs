00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
want to take very small steps in doing

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.970 
want to take very small steps in doing
so<00:02:58.920> and<00:02:59.750> with<00:03:00.750> animals<00:03:01.290> this<00:03:01.500> could<00:03:01.680> very<00:03:01.709> well

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
so and with animals this could very well

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.420 
so and with animals this could very well
even<00:03:02.489> be<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.910> study<00:03:03.180> of<00:03:03.300> animals<00:03:04.160> this<00:03:05.160> could

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
even be the study of animals this could

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.070 
even be the study of animals this could
be<00:03:05.810> even<00:03:06.810> learning<00:03:07.500> more<00:03:07.830> about<00:03:07.890> nature

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
be even learning more about nature

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.920 
be even learning more about nature
environmental<00:03:10.080> work<00:03:11.150> getting<00:03:12.150> into<00:03:12.720> that

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
in the past but this is also about

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.570 
in the past but this is also about
recognizing<00:04:55.440> gifts<00:04:55.800> that<00:04:55.950> you've<00:04:56.220> acquired

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
recognizing gifts that you've acquired

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.510 
recognizing gifts that you've acquired
in<00:04:56.910> this<00:04:57.060> lifetime<00:04:57.330> in<00:04:57.810> others<00:04:58.140> but<00:04:58.530> I<00:04:58.800> really

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
in this lifetime in others but I really

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.280 
in this lifetime in others but I really
feel<00:04:59.700> a<00:04:59.730> lot<00:05:00.000> of<00:05:00.120> compassion<00:05:00.660> and<00:05:00.810> love<00:05:00.990> around

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.280 
feel a lot of compassion and love around
with<00:05:01.500> this<00:05:01.740> and<00:05:02.150> I<00:05:03.150> think<00:05:03.630> some<00:05:03.840> of<00:05:03.870> you<00:05:04.110> may

further your studies and the the thing

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.409 
further your studies and the the thing
with<00:05:12.960> this<00:05:13.110> is<00:05:13.320> that<00:05:13.610> you<00:05:14.610> know<00:05:14.760> you<00:05:14.850> can<00:05:15.180> you

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
with this is that you know you can you

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.430 
with this is that you know you can you
can<00:05:15.570> let<00:05:15.780> that<00:05:15.990> go<00:05:16.260> and<00:05:16.290> just<00:05:16.740> know<00:05:16.950> that<00:05:16.980> if

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
can let that go and just know that if

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.710 
can let that go and just know that if
because<00:05:19.440> this<00:05:19.680> is<00:05:19.950> divinely<00:05:20.490> guided<00:05:21.180> and<00:05:21.630> you

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
can let go of the concerns because the

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.909 
can let go of the concerns because the
money<00:05:27.240> will<00:05:27.480> be<00:05:27.630> there<00:05:27.660> it's<00:05:28.169> it's<00:05:28.620> a<00:05:28.710> matter

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
money will be there it's it's a matter

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.480 
money will be there it's it's a matter
of<00:05:29.120> just<00:05:30.120> knowing<00:05:30.419> that<00:05:31.020> this<00:05:31.470> is<00:05:31.919> going<00:05:32.310> to

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
of just knowing that this is going to

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.460 
of just knowing that this is going to
happen<00:05:32.640> when<00:05:33.150> it's<00:05:33.300> supposed<00:05:33.390> to<00:05:33.780> happen<00:05:33.870> I

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
happen when it's supposed to happen I

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.480 
happen when it's supposed to happen I
also<00:05:35.430> feel<00:05:35.850> that<00:05:36.110> the<00:05:37.110> higher<00:05:37.320> education<00:05:37.560> you

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
also feel that the higher education you

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.010 
also feel that the higher education you
know<00:05:38.580> again<00:05:38.940> going<00:05:39.180> back<00:05:39.300> to<00:05:39.450> mercury

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
know again going back to mercury

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.560 
know again going back to mercury
retrograde<00:05:40.500> that<00:05:41.070> this<00:05:41.580> might<00:05:41.820> even<00:05:42.000> be<00:05:42.240> solo

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
retrograde that this might even be solo

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.659 
retrograde that this might even be solo
work<00:05:42.960> rather<00:05:43.260> than<00:05:43.380> going<00:05:43.710> back<00:05:44.070> to<00:05:44.310> school

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
work rather than going back to school

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:48.560 
work rather than going back to school
this<00:05:44.700> could<00:05:45.330> be<00:05:46.040> you<00:05:47.040> going<00:05:47.520> to<00:05:47.669> school<00:05:48.030> and

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
this could be you going to school and

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.840 
this could be you going to school and
just<00:05:48.840> doing<00:05:49.080> making<00:05:49.500> an<00:05:49.560> online<00:05:50.040> course<00:05:50.310> solo

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
just doing making an online course solo

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.640 
just doing making an online course solo
or<00:05:51.120> where<00:05:51.630> you're<00:05:51.780> not<00:05:51.960> around<00:05:52.200> a<00:05:52.380> lot<00:05:52.530> of

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
or where you're not around a lot of

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.340 
or where you're not around a lot of
people<00:05:52.979> too<00:05:53.190> so<00:05:53.490> this<00:05:54.240> could<00:05:54.450> be<00:05:54.510> that

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
people too so this could be that

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.430 
people too so this could be that
possibility<00:05:55.890> as<00:05:56.370> well<00:05:56.570> but<00:05:57.570> I<00:05:57.840> really<00:05:58.169> feel

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
possibility as well but I really feel

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.820 
possibility as well but I really feel
that<00:05:59.450> you<00:06:00.450> know<00:06:00.570> this<00:06:00.960> this<00:06:00.990> you're<00:06:01.620> being

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
that you know this this you're being

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.050 
that you know this this you're being
divinely<00:06:02.130> guided<00:06:02.430> to<00:06:02.760> do

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
divinely guided to do

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.210 
divinely guided to do
this<00:06:03.180> and<00:06:03.419> that<00:06:03.450> God<00:06:04.110> has<00:06:04.470> your<00:06:04.650> back<00:06:04.740> on<00:06:05.010> this

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
this and that God has your back on this

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.970 
this and that God has your back on this
but<00:06:06.090> there's<00:06:06.419> a<00:06:06.480> significant<00:06:07.200> transformation

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:07.980 
but there's a significant transformation

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.620 
but there's a significant transformation
that's<00:06:08.130> going<00:06:08.430> to<00:06:08.520> occur<00:06:08.610> with<00:06:09.150> this<00:06:09.389> so

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
that's going to occur with this so

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.159 
that's going to occur with this so
