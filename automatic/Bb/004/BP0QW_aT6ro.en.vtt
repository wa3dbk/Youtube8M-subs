00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
you're going to add in the asparagus and

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.850 
you're going to add in the asparagus and
I'm<00:01:25.530> turning<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.100> flame<00:01:26.579> to<00:01:26.880> high<00:01:30.680> and<00:01:31.680> we're

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
I'm turning the flame to high and we're

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.210 
I'm turning the flame to high and we're
going<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.040> toss<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:32.399> on<00:01:32.579> high<00:01:33.140> until<00:01:34.140> it's<00:01:35.130> a

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
going to toss this on high until it's a

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.780 
going to toss this on high until it's a
little<00:01:35.250> soft

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.370 

so<00:01:40.330> it<00:01:40.450> takes<00:01:40.540> about<00:01:40.720> eight<00:01:40.990> to<00:01:41.140> ten<00:01:41.350> minutes

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
so it takes about eight to ten minutes

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.310 
so it takes about eight to ten minutes
on<00:01:41.860> high<00:01:42.100> heat<00:01:42.370> and<00:01:42.550> we've<00:01:42.820> been<00:01:43.320> consistently

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
on high heat and we've been consistently

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.730 
on high heat and we've been consistently
tossing<00:01:45.100> it<00:01:45.250> so<00:01:46.000> it<00:01:46.210> is<00:01:46.360> ready<00:01:46.630> now<00:01:46.720> yep<00:01:47.320> and

remember asparagus tends to have a

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.780 
remember asparagus tends to have a
