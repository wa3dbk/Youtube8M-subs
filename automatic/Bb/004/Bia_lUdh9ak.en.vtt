00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
it allows you to get much more realistic

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.550 
it allows you to get much more realistic
and<00:00:17.580> accurate<00:00:18.000> results<00:00:18.420> than<00:00:18.750> you<00:00:19.080> know<00:00:19.170> GI

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
and accurate results than you know GI

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.390 
and accurate results than you know GI
and<00:00:20.990> ambient<00:00:21.990> occlusion<00:00:22.140> with<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.859> cinema<00:00:23.189> 4d

ancient really well and it's really good
for<00:00:25.949> just<00:00:26.130> creating<00:00:26.519> hyper-realistic

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
for just creating hyper-realistic

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.939 
for just creating hyper-realistic
renders<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:27.960> your<00:00:28.050> render<00:00:28.260> times<00:00:28.470> go<00:00:28.650> up<00:00:28.769> over

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
renders and your render times go up over

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.580 
renders and your render times go up over
blah<00:00:29.250> blah<00:00:29.490> it's<00:00:29.789> really<00:00:30.029> nice<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.210> have<00:00:30.590> so

these<00:00:32.369> are<00:00:32.550> some<00:00:32.640> pretty<00:00:32.759> basic<00:00:33.090> materials

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
these are some pretty basic materials

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.959 
these are some pretty basic materials
but<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.649> hope<00:00:35.010> they'll<00:00:35.219> help<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.820> get

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
but I hope they'll help you to get

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.040 
but I hope they'll help you to get
familiar<00:00:36.420> with<00:00:37.460> the<00:00:38.460> v-ray<00:00:39.059> render<00:00:39.660> engine

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
familiar with the v-ray render engine

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.690 
familiar with the v-ray render engine
and<00:00:40.290> how<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.739> materials<00:00:41.250> replace<00:00:41.550> the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
and how the materials replace the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.229 
and how the materials replace the
central<00:00:42.030> 40<00:00:42.329> materials<00:00:42.950> so<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.550> got<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:45.030> also

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
central 40 materials so you got I also

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.850 
central 40 materials so you got I also
sort<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.629> have<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> little<00:00:45.870> scene<00:00:46.230> set<00:00:46.500> up<00:00:46.620> here

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
basic glossy black material you know you

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.359 
basic glossy black material you know you
almost<00:01:03.809> chrome<00:01:04.290> it's<00:01:04.530> not<00:01:04.650> chrome<00:01:04.920> ish<00:01:05.159> but

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
almost chrome it's not chrome ish but

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.940 
almost chrome it's not chrome ish but
it's<00:01:05.549> just<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.909> black<00:01:06.479> reflecting<00:01:07.260> material

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
it's just a black reflecting material

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.510 
it's just a black reflecting material
and<00:01:08.240> as<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.420> can<00:01:09.570> see<00:01:09.860> if<00:01:10.860> we<00:01:11.040> ever<00:01:11.189> get<00:01:11.369> done

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
and as you can see if we ever get done

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.179 
and as you can see if we ever get done
rendering<00:01:12.170> yeah<00:01:13.170> it's<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.439> thing<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:13.860> we

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
rendering yeah it's a thing that we

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.320 
rendering yeah it's a thing that we
rated<00:01:14.400> any<00:01:14.670> times<00:01:14.970> are<00:01:15.180> not<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:16.080> fun<00:01:16.350> at<00:01:16.470> all

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
rated any times are not that fun at all

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.960 
rated any times are not that fun at all
but<00:01:18.330> like<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.840> said<00:01:18.950> really<00:01:19.950> realistic<00:01:20.430> great

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
but like I said really realistic great

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.810 
but like I said really realistic great
result<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.930> know<00:01:22.049> it's<00:01:22.259> worth<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.710> if<00:01:23.040> you

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
result you know it's worth it if you

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.310 
result you know it's worth it if you
know<00:01:23.909> for<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.150> lot<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.330> animations<00:01:24.960> it's<00:01:25.140> worth

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
know for a lot of animations it's worth

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.800 
know for a lot of animations it's worth
it<00:01:25.500> when<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.710> really<00:01:25.979> need<00:01:26.130> things<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.520> be

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
it when you really need things to be

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.490 
it when you really need things to be
realistic<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:27.930> highly<00:01:28.259> detailed<00:01:29.060> so<00:01:30.500> then

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
realistic and highly detailed so then

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.929 
realistic and highly detailed so then
they're<00:01:31.590> under<00:01:31.740> terms<00:01:31.950> aren't<00:01:32.280> too<00:01:32.520> bad<00:01:32.700> you

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
they're under terms aren't too bad you

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.399 
they're under terms aren't too bad you
can<00:01:33.090> definitely<00:01:33.240> optimize<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.170> little

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
can definitely optimize this a little

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.740 
can definitely optimize this a little
bit<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:35.369> blurry<00:01:35.880> reflections<00:01:36.450> or<00:01:36.600> what's

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
bit the blurry reflections or what's

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.620 
bit the blurry reflections or what's
taking<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.079> long<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:37.710> one<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.630> but

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
taking so long in this one and but

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.889 
taking so long in this one and but
that's<00:01:39.990> about<00:01:40.579> 45<00:01:41.579> seconds<00:01:42.030> or<00:01:42.210> 50<00:01:42.509> seconds

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
that's about 45 seconds or 50 seconds

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.639 
that's about 45 seconds or 50 seconds
per<00:01:43.079> frame<00:01:43.320> which<00:01:44.009> isn't<00:01:44.340> too<00:01:44.460> bad<00:01:44.640> but

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
per frame which isn't too bad but

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.830 
per frame which isn't too bad but
anyways<00:01:46.649> you've<00:01:46.860> got<00:01:47.149> in<00:01:48.149> this<00:01:48.329> package<00:01:48.810> you

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
anyways you've got in this package you

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.270 
anyways you've got in this package you
know<00:01:49.110> other<00:01:49.290> than<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.500> materials<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.040> also

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
know other than the materials you also

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.760 
know other than the materials you also
have<00:01:50.600> set<00:01:51.600> up<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.079> just<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.409> spheres

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
have set up this is just the spheres

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.240 
have set up this is just the spheres
right<00:01:53.040> here<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.939> lights<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.329> used<00:01:54.860> you<00:01:55.860> can<00:01:56.100> see

right<00:02:16.700> at<00:02:16.820> work<00:02:16.940> you<00:02:17.150> need<00:02:17.300> a<00:02:17.330> camera<00:02:17.630> the

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
right at work you need a camera the

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.980 
right at work you need a camera the
light<00:02:18.590> you<00:02:19.160> know<00:02:19.220> with<00:02:19.430> a<00:02:19.460> beer<00:02:19.670> a<00:02:19.790> tag<00:02:20.000> both<00:02:20.840> of

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
light you know with a beer a tag both of

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.730 
light you know with a beer a tag both of
them<00:02:21.050> and<00:02:21.290> then<00:02:22.070> you<00:02:22.220> need<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.640> go<00:02:23.020> into<00:02:24.020> render

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
them and then you need to go into render

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.800 
them and then you need to go into render
settings<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:25.490> make<00:02:25.790> sure<00:02:26.000> that<00:02:26.150> veer<00:02:26.360> acreage

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
settings and make sure that veer acreage

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.810 
settings and make sure that veer acreage
it's<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.470> one<00:02:27.590> that's<00:02:27.620> selected<00:02:28.010> so<00:02:28.730> I've

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
it's the one that's selected so I've

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.160 
it's the one that's selected so I've
done<00:02:28.970> all<00:02:29.120> that<00:02:29.150> for<00:02:29.330> you<00:02:29.660> so<00:02:29.810> this<00:02:29.960> should

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
done all that for you so this should

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.160 
done all that for you so this should
work<00:02:30.200> right<00:02:30.530> out<00:02:30.650> of<00:02:30.770> the<00:02:30.890> box<00:02:31.210> but<00:02:32.210> let's<00:02:33.080> just

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
work right out of the box but let's just

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.630 
work right out of the box but let's just
move<00:02:33.770> on<00:02:33.920> and<00:02:33.980> show<00:02:34.250> you<00:02:34.340> some<00:02:34.400> of<00:02:34.550> the

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
move on and show you some of the

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.060 
move on and show you some of the
materials<00:02:35.060> so<00:02:35.660> I'm<00:02:35.750> going<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:35.930> delete<00:02:36.050> all<00:02:36.410> the

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
materials so I'm going to delete all the

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.360 
materials so I'm going to delete all the
material<00:02:37.520> off<00:02:37.610> of<00:02:37.790> here<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:38.920> let's<00:02:39.920> go<00:02:40.070> on<00:02:40.220> to

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
material off of here and let's go on to

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.490 
material off of here and let's go on to
the<00:02:40.490> rocks<00:02:40.760> materials<00:02:41.570> that<00:02:41.780> i<00:02:41.870> created<00:02:42.230> this

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
the rocks materials that i created this

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.120 
the rocks materials that i created this
is<00:02:42.680> a<00:02:42.710> set<00:02:43.010> of<00:02:43.100> theater<00:02:43.520> right<00:02:43.730> down<00:02:43.970> here<00:02:44.270> and

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
is a set of theater right down here and

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.770 
is a set of theater right down here and
we're<00:02:46.130> going<00:02:46.250> to<00:02:46.280> show<00:02:46.460> you<00:02:46.520> how<00:02:47.030> to<00:02:47.090> use<00:02:47.180> how

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
we're going to show you how to use how

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.300 
we're going to show you how to use how
to<00:02:47.840> sort<00:02:48.110> of<00:02:48.170> stack<00:02:48.380> materials<00:02:48.920> and<00:02:49.040> be<00:02:49.160> ready

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
to sort of stack materials and be ready

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.820 
to sort of stack materials and be ready
and<00:02:49.460> as<00:02:49.850> well<00:02:50.060> as<00:02:50.090> using<00:02:50.780> a<00:02:51.050> displacement<00:02:51.470> here

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
and as well as using a displacement here

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.490 
and as well as using a displacement here
yeah<00:02:52.190> excuse<00:02:52.760> me<00:02:52.910> displacement<00:02:53.600> material<00:02:54.290> in

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
yeah excuse me displacement material in

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.130 
yeah excuse me displacement material in
v-ray<00:02:54.910> so<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.210> first<00:02:56.390> thing<00:02:56.570> you<00:02:56.780> want<00:02:56.960> to<00:02:56.990> do

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
v-ray so the first thing you want to do

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.360 
v-ray so the first thing you want to do
you're<00:02:57.290> going<00:02:57.320> to<00:02:57.470> have<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.710> actually<00:02:57.830> open<00:02:58.130> up

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
you're going to have to actually open up

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.130 
you're going to have to actually open up
the<00:02:58.430> spheres<00:02:58.880> you<00:02:59.120> know<00:02:59.240> drop<00:02:59.450> down<00:02:59.690> you<00:02:59.960> know

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
the spheres you know drop down you know

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.460 
the spheres you know drop down you know
a<00:03:00.410> little<00:03:01.070> list<00:03:01.550> there<00:03:01.880> so<00:03:02.510> add<00:03:02.870> the

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
a little list there so add the

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.110 
a little list there so add the
displacement<00:03:03.920> material<00:03:05.560> then<00:03:06.560> add<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:07.880> color

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
displacement material then add the color

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.380 
displacement material then add the color
material<00:03:09.250> his<00:03:10.250> displacement<00:03:10.760> isn't<00:03:11.240> actually

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
material his displacement isn't actually

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.320 
material his displacement isn't actually
on<00:03:11.720> a<00:03:11.750> channel<00:03:12.140> like<00:03:12.730> this<00:03:13.730> material<00:03:14.210> this<00:03:14.240> is

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
on a channel like this material this is

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.390 
on a channel like this material this is
a<00:03:14.450> vray<00:03:14.840> a<00:03:15.080> signature<00:03:15.710> here<00:03:15.830> it's<00:03:16.070> called<00:03:16.310> the

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
a vray a signature here it's called the

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.620 
a vray a signature here it's called the
very<00:03:16.610> advanced<00:03:16.970> material<00:03:17.390> but<00:03:17.480> it's

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
very advanced material but it's

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.210 
very advanced material but it's
basically<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:18.320> one<00:03:18.740> you're<00:03:18.860> going<00:03:18.950> to<00:03:19.040> use

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
basically the one you're going to use

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.100 
basically the one you're going to use
the<00:03:19.340> whole<00:03:19.490> time<00:03:19.700> as<00:03:19.940> you<00:03:20.180> can<00:03:20.300> see<00:03:20.570> there's<00:03:20.870> no

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
the whole time as you can see there's no

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.810 
the whole time as you can see there's no
option<00:03:21.440> versus<00:03:21.860> displacement<00:03:22.250> that<00:03:22.760> the

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
option versus displacement that the

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.060 
option versus displacement that the
whole<00:03:22.970> separate<00:03:23.300> material<00:03:23.870> for<00:03:24.650> that<00:03:24.830> which

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
whole separate material for that which

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.460 
whole separate material for that which
is<00:03:25.190> a<00:03:25.220> beer<00:03:25.490> a<00:03:25.610> displacement<00:03:26.030> material<00:03:26.660> but

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
is a beer a displacement material but

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.110 
is a beer a displacement material but
anyways<00:03:27.830> and<00:03:28.010> then<00:03:28.130> I've<00:03:28.220> created<00:03:28.310> this<00:03:28.790> sort

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
anyways and then I've created this sort

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.680 
anyways and then I've created this sort
of<00:03:29.240> like<00:03:29.540> like<00:03:29.870> in<00:03:30.170> dirt<00:03:30.830> thing<00:03:31.610> and<00:03:32.060> you're

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
of like like in dirt thing and you're

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.050 
of like like in dirt thing and you're
going<00:03:32.810> to<00:03:32.870> add<00:03:33.020> that<00:03:33.050> on<00:03:33.560> top<00:03:33.980> of<00:03:34.040> all<00:03:34.610> the

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
going to add that on top of all the

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.600 
going to add that on top of all the
spheres<00:03:35.209> and<00:03:35.780> then<00:03:36.560> this<00:03:36.830> is<00:03:36.980> important<00:03:37.459> you

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
spheres and then this is important you

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.640 
spheres and then this is important you
select<00:03:38.000> all<00:03:38.240> of<00:03:38.270> them<00:03:38.540> and<00:03:38.780> you<00:03:39.200> need<00:03:39.350> to<00:03:39.470> mix

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
select all of them and you need to mix

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.560 
select all of them and you need to mix
the<00:03:39.920> textures<00:03:40.370> let's<00:03:40.850> just<00:03:41.060> make<00:03:41.180> sure<00:03:41.390> that's

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
the textures let's just make sure that's

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.680 
the textures let's just make sure that's
good<00:03:41.840> okay<00:03:42.200> so<00:03:42.890> if<00:03:43.040> I<00:03:43.130> did<00:03:43.310> this<00:03:43.430> right<00:03:43.760> which<00:03:44.600> I

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
good okay so if I did this right which I

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.110 
good okay so if I did this right which I
hope<00:03:44.900> I<00:03:44.990> did<00:03:46.030> when<00:03:47.030> we<00:03:47.060> hit<00:03:47.330> render<00:03:48.940> we<00:03:49.940> should

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
hope I did when we hit render we should

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.420 
hope I did when we hit render we should
see<00:03:50.330> the<00:03:50.420> displacement<00:03:51.020> material<00:03:51.530> the<00:03:52.190> color

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
see the displacement material the color

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.340 
see the displacement material the color
material<00:03:52.670> and<00:03:53.240> then<00:03:53.390> the<00:03:53.480> lichen<00:03:53.840> material<00:03:54.260> on

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
material and then the lichen material on

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:01.050 
material and then the lichen material on
top<00:03:54.410> of<00:03:54.709> that<00:03:55.090> so<00:03:56.090> let's<00:03:56.450> see<00:03:56.780> what<00:03:56.930> happens

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.030 

this<00:04:01.690> shouldn't<00:04:01.930> take<00:04:01.989> too<00:04:02.140> long<00:04:02.319> again<00:04:02.830> to

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
this shouldn't take too long again to

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.570 
this shouldn't take too long again to
see<00:04:03.280> no<00:04:03.430> displacement<00:04:03.940> material<00:04:04.980> but<00:04:05.980> while

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
see no displacement material but while

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.100 
see no displacement material but while
that's<00:04:06.790> rendering<00:04:07.239> you<00:04:07.630> know<00:04:07.720> the<00:04:07.989> other

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
that's rendering you know the other

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.449 
that's rendering you know the other
thing<00:04:08.170> that<00:04:08.319> you<00:04:08.440> get<00:04:08.709> in<00:04:08.860> this<00:04:08.980> is<00:04:09.190> just<00:04:09.370> a

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
thing that you get in this is just a

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.850 
thing that you get in this is just a
seamless<00:04:09.819> background<00:04:10.360> and<00:04:10.569> that's<00:04:11.560> nothing

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
seamless background and that's nothing

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.380 
seamless background and that's nothing
special<00:04:12.130> but<00:04:12.310> you<00:04:12.880> know<00:04:12.940> helps<00:04:13.270> with<00:04:13.360> the

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
special but you know helps with the

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.699 
special but you know helps with the
scene<00:04:13.660> oh<00:04:15.239> yeah<00:04:16.239> let's<00:04:16.540> just<00:04:16.600> watch<00:04:17.230> it<00:04:17.260> render

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
scene oh yeah let's just watch it render

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.440 
scene oh yeah let's just watch it render
I<00:04:17.970> have<00:04:18.970> GI<00:04:19.739> or<00:04:20.739> I<00:04:21.130> don't<00:04:21.639> know<00:04:21.790> what<00:04:21.970> the<00:04:22.270> rate

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
I have GI or I don't know what the rate

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.030 
I have GI or I don't know what the rate
calls<00:04:22.690> it<00:04:22.840> but<00:04:22.960> basically<00:04:23.080> the<00:04:23.440> equivalent<00:04:23.560> of

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
calls it but basically the equivalent of

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.180 
calls it but basically the equivalent of
global<00:04:24.820> illumination<00:04:25.139> that<00:04:26.139> vray<00:04:26.560> uses<00:04:26.980> and

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
global illumination that vray uses and

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.290 
global illumination that vray uses and
so<00:04:27.310> that's<00:04:27.460> why<00:04:27.639> it's<00:04:27.669> doing<00:04:27.940> all<00:04:28.180> these

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
so that's why it's doing all these

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.230 
so that's why it's doing all these
passes<00:04:28.870> i<00:04:29.320> have<00:04:29.980> it<00:04:30.100> on<00:04:30.160> medium<00:04:30.400> you<00:04:30.760> can<00:04:30.790> drop

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
passes i have it on medium you can drop

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.860 
passes i have it on medium you can drop
it<00:04:31.300> too<00:04:31.570> low<00:04:31.780> or<00:04:32.880> raised<00:04:33.880> alpha<00:04:34.240> beta<00:04:34.450> if<00:04:34.720> you

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
it too low or raised alpha beta if you

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.360 
it too low or raised alpha beta if you
want<00:04:35.080> to<00:04:35.169> need<00:04:35.260> them<00:04:35.380> more<00:04:35.500> realistic<00:04:35.860> result

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
want to need them more realistic result

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.790 
want to need them more realistic result
or<00:04:36.610> you<00:04:37.180> can<00:04:37.330> turn<00:04:37.510> it<00:04:37.570> off<00:04:37.810> and<00:04:37.840> you<00:04:38.530> know<00:04:38.650> do

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
or you can turn it off and you know do

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.219 
or you can turn it off and you know do
the<00:04:38.919> shadows<00:04:39.280> and<00:04:39.310> whatnot<00:04:39.729> yourself<00:04:40.150> I<00:04:40.450> like

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
the shadows and whatnot yourself I like

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:43.469 
the shadows and whatnot yourself I like
to<00:04:41.260> just<00:04:41.470> leave<00:04:41.710> it<00:04:41.830> on<00:04:41.889> medium<00:04:42.210> because<00:04:43.210> the

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
to just leave it on medium because the

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:46.950 
to just leave it on medium because the
render<00:04:43.690> times<00:04:43.930> aren't<00:04:44.320> too<00:04:44.650> bad<00:04:44.860> and<00:04:45.810> you<00:04:46.810> get

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
render times aren't too bad and you get

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.040 
render times aren't too bad and you get
the<00:04:47.080> best<00:04:47.229> result<00:04:47.620> not<00:04:48.370> very<00:04:48.610> much<00:04:48.790> hassle<00:04:49.540> at

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
the best result not very much hassle at

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.740 
the best result not very much hassle at
all<00:04:51.120> so<00:04:52.120> here<00:04:52.990> we<00:04:53.020> go<00:04:53.139> okay<00:04:53.919> now<00:04:54.100> result<00:04:54.630> and<00:04:55.630> it

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
all so here we go okay now result and it

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.680 
all so here we go okay now result and it
looks<00:04:55.960> like<00:04:56.020> I<00:04:56.229> did<00:04:56.380> everything<00:04:56.650> right<00:04:57.330> so<00:04:58.330> as

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
looks like I did everything right so as

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.140 
looks like I did everything right so as
you<00:04:59.320> can<00:04:59.440> see<00:04:59.710> we've<00:05:00.220> got<00:05:00.250> the<00:05:00.520> displacement

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
you can see we've got the displacement

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.850 
you can see we've got the displacement
material<00:05:01.630> the<00:05:01.960> color<00:05:02.200> material<00:05:02.440> and<00:05:03.100> then<00:05:03.729> our

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
material the color material and then our

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.460 
material the color material and then our
little<00:05:05.860> like<00:05:06.039> in<00:05:06.220> material<00:05:06.930> so<00:05:07.930> let's<00:05:08.200> move<00:05:08.289> on

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
little like in material so let's move on

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:09.810 
little like in material so let's move on
to<00:05:08.500> the<00:05:08.680> next<00:05:08.710> one<00:05:08.950> I'm<00:05:09.160> going<00:05:09.250> to<00:05:09.310> do<00:05:09.460> a<00:05:09.490> piece

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
to the next one I'm going to do a piece

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.320 
to the next one I'm going to do a piece
on<00:05:11.190> through<00:05:12.190> the<00:05:12.370> water<00:05:12.580> texture<00:05:12.970> I<00:05:13.090> can<00:05:13.240> just

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
on through the water texture I can just

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.180 
on through the water texture I can just
drop<00:05:13.510> this<00:05:13.720> onto<00:05:13.990> the<00:05:14.140> sphere<00:05:14.440> or<00:05:14.650> I'm

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
drop this onto the sphere or I'm

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.590 
drop this onto the sphere or I'm
actually<00:05:15.370> going<00:05:15.610> to<00:05:15.700> drop<00:05:15.850> it<00:05:16.030> onto<00:05:16.150> the<00:05:16.270> null

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
actually going to drop it onto the null

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.469 
actually going to drop it onto the null
so<00:05:17.050> just<00:05:18.039> don't<00:05:18.250> want<00:05:18.520> the<00:05:18.669> the<00:05:19.000> hyperness

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
so just don't want the the hyperness

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.659 
so just don't want the the hyperness
part<00:05:19.840> to<00:05:19.990> affect<00:05:20.289> this<00:05:20.440> for<00:05:20.740> our<00:05:20.950> effective

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
part to affect this for our effective

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:24.840 
part to affect this for our effective
material<00:05:22.090> i<00:05:22.180> guess<00:05:22.360> so<00:05:22.810> let's<00:05:22.990> render<00:05:23.140> this<00:05:23.850> so

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
material i guess so let's render this so

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:30.210 
material i guess so let's render this so
that's<00:05:25.030> just<00:05:25.120> this<00:05:25.630> is<00:05:25.780> just<00:05:25.810> the<00:05:26.110> water<00:05:29.220> more

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
that's just this is just the water more

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:37.570 
that's just this is just the water more
rendering<00:05:30.700> more<00:05:30.850> waiting<00:05:31.470> how<00:05:32.470> long<00:05:32.650> is<00:05:32.800> this

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.909 

hopefully<00:05:38.389> I<00:05:38.419> don't<00:05:38.509> have<00:05:38.689> to<00:05:38.780> cut<00:05:38.990> this<00:05:39.139> sets

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 
hopefully I don't have to cut this sets

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:45.690 
hopefully I don't have to cut this sets
of<00:05:40.039> pain

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.910 

and<00:05:45.820> I<00:05:46.720> think<00:05:47.020> this<00:05:47.140> will<00:05:47.290> be<00:05:47.350> the<00:05:47.740> last

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:47.920 
and I think this will be the last

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.100 
and I think this will be the last
material<00:05:48.490> but<00:05:48.910> I<00:05:49.030> show<00:05:49.240> you<00:05:49.300> guys<00:05:49.540> out<00:05:49.900> of<00:05:49.930> this

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
material but I show you guys out of this

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.830 
material but I show you guys out of this
pack<00:05:50.380> because<00:05:51.190> I<00:05:51.400> feel<00:05:52.090> like<00:05:52.120> this<00:05:52.390> video<00:05:52.690> has

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
pack because I feel like this video has

here we go ah so as you can see I mean

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.760 
here we go ah so as you can see I mean
it<00:06:13.880> doesn't<00:06:14.150> really<00:06:14.900> look<00:06:15.260> like<00:06:15.320> it's<00:06:15.650> that

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
it doesn't really look like it's that

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.129 
it doesn't really look like it's that
transparent<00:06:16.520> right<00:06:16.669> now<00:06:16.820> but<00:06:17.660> you<00:06:17.840> guys<00:06:17.960> are

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:18.139 
transparent right now but you guys are

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:19.300 
transparent right now but you guys are
going<00:06:18.229> to<00:06:18.320> have<00:06:18.440> to<00:06:18.530> believe<00:06:18.770> me<00:06:18.830> it<00:06:19.250> is

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
going to have to believe me it is

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.070 
going to have to believe me it is
transparent<00:06:19.880> it's<00:06:20.330> just<00:06:20.600> because<00:06:20.900> the

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
transparent it's just because the

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.409 
transparent it's just because the
background<00:06:21.290> is<00:06:21.830> sort<00:06:22.070> of<00:06:22.100> blue<00:06:22.310> as<00:06:22.460> well<00:06:22.490> that

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:23.419 
background is sort of blue as well that

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:24.790 
background is sort of blue as well that
you're<00:06:23.600> not<00:06:23.690> getting<00:06:23.990> that<00:06:24.110> transparency

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
you're not getting that transparency

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.850 
you're not getting that transparency
effect<00:06:25.479> but<00:06:26.479> looks<00:06:26.870> pretty<00:06:27.110> cool<00:06:27.260> anyways<00:06:27.680> I

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
effect but looks pretty cool anyways I

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:35.680 
effect but looks pretty cool anyways I
think<00:06:30.520> yeah<00:06:31.520> looks<00:06:32.270> good<00:06:33.910> so<00:06:34.910> I'm<00:06:35.060> just<00:06:35.270> just

can<00:07:11.600> see<00:07:11.810> using<00:07:12.500> this<00:07:13.130> plane<00:07:13.570> that<00:07:14.570> I<00:07:14.660> have<00:07:14.810> in

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:14.990 
can see using this plane that I have in

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.570 
can see using this plane that I have in
here<00:07:15.020> it's<00:07:15.289> right<00:07:15.440> here<00:07:15.650> and<00:07:16.280> you<00:07:16.820> know<00:07:16.940> I<00:07:16.970> have
