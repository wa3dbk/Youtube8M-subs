00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:11.470
 she everybody then today 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:14.889
 we find ourselves for a new video 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:17.410
 dofus fof like I said I 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.359
 was playing less in leap month is 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:23.079
 a lot more at pokemon right now 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:27.220
 so I started to create a 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:30.630
 perfect team with a lot of luck 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:34.059
 a lot of pokemon fight with the ev 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.760
 well well stat is celebrating and for this 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.400
 to do it I needed a set to 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.500
 dead to be able to hang but pokemon 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:45.550
 and put myself to death I needed them 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.830
 be cost 6 iv iv that's what we 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.180
 call a little the basic nesta of the 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.060
 pokemon in fact without it ever 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.100
 nothing done before so it's a little sestao 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.730
 level 1 if you prefer and he me 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.770
 so the six iv to know pv 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.489
 attack defense attack spe defense peace 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.780
 max to be able to words climbs 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.799
 and create cost of non pokemon 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.840
 competitive blow so I got a little on 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.520
 google i searched a little i found 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.780
 so poke ebit which is a super site I 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.969
 you really recommend it if you come 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.439
 to launch in the competition and in the 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:19.840
 stratum 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.810
 and he actually explains that the most 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.710
 quick to do a pretty enough breeding 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.909
 consequent and is good is correct there 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.009
 must have what is called a 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:34.840
 morphing if I go there ie with 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:37.990
 the six iv to the max with puts himself to death on 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.179
 can use an object called the 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.670
 destiny and which will allow to transfer 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:43.990
 blow them away and put death to his 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.170
 pokemon that we want to make 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.050
 competitive parma by reproduction in 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.420
 made 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.790
 you will have understood it the hardest it is 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.920
 to have put to death if I go and I 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.340
 think a lot of people will see this 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.200
 video 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.700
 gold dofus because it's really very 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.270
 difficult to get a metamorph 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.070
 lived without cheating I know that two 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.830
 methods to have it now it's 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.070
 the action pleases them and I hate this 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.210
 end object it's really there cheaters 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.310
 it's also cheating in its pure state 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.100
 done and I do not find it cool to play 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.060
 with pokemon generate like that I 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.930
 prefer to do it myself 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.990
 so that's why I'm going to 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.940
 show a little trick to get 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.140
 so kills six iv and so for himself 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.180
 launch in pokemon breeding 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.090
 competitive for after being able to go 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.380
 beat online 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.410
 so if we will start by going on 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.410
 google 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.880
 we go on google and there we type 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:48.280
 metamorph 6 iv 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:52.000
 so there you will have in results 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.220
 besides there are no hands here so 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.810
 you're going to type it on google and 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.370
 you go the first result you 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.950
 go to a site called offers 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.740
 dead six iv for a block so if so 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.620
 you click on it I fell on it 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.240
 after some research on google 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.300
 France is really very simple very 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.030
 fast and you come across their site 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.110
 So here we are reading a little bit 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.350
 a frequently asked questions we do not care 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.800
 little 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.630
 so we're going to make a request here 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.820
 so there he explains you puts to death six 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:27.820
 iv basic Japanese is of nature 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:30.700
 modest so indicated for that your 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:33.150
 pseudo pokemon the name of the trainer and a 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.700
 counterpart necessarily he does not give it 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.130
 like that but it deserves a loophole and 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.070
 a small counterparty so in exchange 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.140
 support us by thanking us 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.940
 page sharing or pokemon 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.570
 strategic or a chromatic wedge 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.910
 so also to know that me being a little 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.770
 again on pokemon I have never seen 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.050
 shiny in x and y 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.780
 and I did not have pokemon 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.550
 strategic since I needed 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.930
 iv metamorphosis to start so this 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:08.380
 what I did was that I went on 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:13.250
 twitter and I just tweeted so 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:15.740
 I thank him for having 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.030
 created this site and so to finally have 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.010
 how cool it was to have created this site 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:24.710
 is to give people makeovers and 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:28.540
 I also posted so surely on me 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:31.640
 on my twitter page it's a video 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:35.240
 a video they had asked on 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:37.700
 their pages to make to turn so 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:43.190
 I'm doing them so here they say from 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:45.230
 well thank to thank and well 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.360
 by doing a little pub what is 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.830
 normal so that's what I did I 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.270
 created a topic 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.710
 so I create them there are more than one 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.460
 week so I will not find him 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:01.040
 I may be watching 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:02.720
 So here it was, so here it is 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.390
 that was it was ten days ago 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.070
 so I posted by collecting with my 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.620
 twitter account 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.900
 already I started by thanking them 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.370
 because otherwise world of courtesies 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.910
 I explained to them why I 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.230
 was looking for a metamorph 6 iv is there a 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.910
 also explained that I could not 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.800
 exchanged shiny because I did not have 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.480
 not but that I had followed them on 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.530
 twitter so their official page and that 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.840
 I was going to turn the page on 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.580
 various forums and and that I alert 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.620
 unitary maximum all they were going 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.200
 post because all doubles all 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.760
 players should be entitled to the 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.480
 to see if I'm actually going 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:43.060
 Then I posted my username and 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:45.800
 my friend code of the ds and so I did 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.060
 I put the link of the little pub that I 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.730
 they had done for them that's us 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.530
 is nothing complicated really I them 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:54.350
 had just I just thanked them in 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.970
 turning a page up and we 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.310
 even sees that the site administrator 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.140
 answered me so really really a 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.150
 great community ensures website really 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:04.670
 no complaints 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.650
 and I had my master death movie 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.630
 together four hours after because I 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.880
 had it posted in the morning is it not to 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.400
 to be connected but really four 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.780
 hours later I had my metamorph and 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.070
 Here I had the start to eat well 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.530
 check the seized property so go 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:21.110
 it's really a site that works from 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.660
 giant is making a big pub and I hope 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.950
 that you too can ask for your 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.960
 put your death because apparently it 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.690
 also transfers on curly new 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:32.570
 version on rosa is still on 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:35.600
 pokemon x and y moreover I have my girlfriend 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:37.010
 irl also who started it 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.810
 to do a little competition with 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.760
 me in de v2 she also made a 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.960
 request on the site hi friend have put 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.890
 two days to answer him because the 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.200
 site was in maintenance 

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:47.570
 but she was the same she just 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.030
 made a small pub on twitter she 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:52.040
 thanked and she had the metamorphosis 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.880
 6 iv so really anyone who 

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.110
 seek to put themselves in the 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.060
 competition and in the stratum that is 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.250
 really who's really great is 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.830
 a great game I really recommend 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:03.680
 to go through them and just right here 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.090
 asked for it and put it to death 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:09.740
 six iv on the site here will have no 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:12.590
 problem really there is nothing to say here 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:16.400
 I hope that this you would have you would have 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:17.990
 kept my windows are active here 

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.090
 so yes as I said I hope it 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.620
 will help you get into it and 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.180
 then if you ever have questions 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.500
 you did not understand something 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.060
 thing 

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.600
 do not hesitate to ask in your 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.640
 request 

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:31.250
 but otherwise really the site is great 

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.050
 well explained and it takes what takes what 

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.600
 it takes three minutes to get a 

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:37.760
 dead meta if I go there it's frankly 

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:39.590
 it's great so that's it 

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:42.650
 we'll be back very soon for a 

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:44.300
 new video I hope maybe on 

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:47.150
 pokemon or on dofus I do not know yet 

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:49.100
 what about dofus I have a little more of the 

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.660
 all motivational apart from the tournament the 

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.790
 red cap and it's not much 

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:54.620
 that motivates me to play and then I will 

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:55.760
 see you soon and enjoy your 

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:59.110
