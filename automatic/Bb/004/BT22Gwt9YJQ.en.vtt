00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
really hard to get and that's great for

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.730 
really hard to get and that's great for
making<00:01:53.250> Pommier<00:01:53.850> or<00:01:54.299> tart<00:01:54.869> tatin<00:01:55.020> and

upside-down apple tart okay so I've got

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.630 
upside-down apple tart okay so I've got
my<00:01:57.689> crumbly<00:01:58.140> paper<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:59.070> I'm<00:01:59.220> just<00:01:59.250> going<00:01:59.520> to

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
my crumbly paper and I'm just going to

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.600 
my crumbly paper and I'm just going to
stick<00:01:59.909> it<00:01:59.939> in<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.360> middle<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:02.340> tart<00:02:02.580> shell

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
stick it in the middle of the tart shell

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.130 
stick it in the middle of the tart shell
and<00:02:04.580> this<00:02:05.580> is<00:02:05.790> gonna<00:02:05.970> weigh<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.360> down<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.840> puff

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
and this is gonna weigh it down the puff

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.499 
and this is gonna weigh it down the puff
pastry<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.860> just<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.759> puffs<00:02:09.000> up<00:02:09.239> so<00:02:09.450> you

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
pastry is just that it puffs up so you

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.899 
pastry is just that it puffs up so you
want<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.989> keep<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.349> from<00:02:10.979> puffing<00:02:11.159> up<00:02:11.519> as<00:02:11.730> much

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:11.909 
want to keep it from puffing up as much

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:13.880 
want to keep it from puffing up as much
as<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.150> can<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:12.900> I've<00:02:13.110> got<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.409> rice<00:02:13.590> up

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
as you can and I've got the rice up

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.920 
as you can and I've got the rice up
about<00:02:14.159> two-thirds<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:14.939> the<00:02:15.090> way<00:02:15.239> and<00:02:15.480> it's

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
about two-thirds of the way and it's

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.170 
about two-thirds of the way and it's
actually<00:02:16.169> going<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.349> kind<00:02:16.560> of<00:02:16.650> create

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
actually going to kind of create

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.119 
actually going to kind of create
a little<00:02:17.420> bit<00:02:17.540> of<00:02:17.659> a<00:02:18.260> lip<00:02:18.469> which<00:02:18.769> is<00:02:18.950> great

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
a little bit of a lip which is great

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:20.410 
a little bit of a lip which is great
because<00:02:19.250> that'll<00:02:19.549> help<00:02:19.640> keep<00:02:19.730> our<00:02:20.030> filling

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
because that'll help keep our filling

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.869 
because that'll help keep our filling
from<00:02:20.930> overflowing<00:02:21.549> depending<00:02:22.549> on<00:02:22.640> what<00:02:22.790> you

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
from overflowing depending on what you

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.459 
from overflowing depending on what you
what<00:02:23.060> kind<00:02:23.239> of<00:02:23.269> filling<00:02:23.540> you<00:02:23.659> want<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:23.870> use<00:02:23.989> now

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:24.469 
what kind of filling you want to use now

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:25.479 
what kind of filling you want to use now
I'm<00:02:24.530> just<00:02:24.650> gonna<00:02:24.739> put<00:02:24.950> it<00:02:25.010> on<00:02:25.159> the<00:02:25.280> tray

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
I'm just gonna put it on the tray

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.490 
I'm just gonna put it on the tray
that'll<00:02:26.209> be<00:02:26.329> easier<00:02:26.659> to<00:02:26.870> maneuver<00:02:27.230> in<00:02:27.349> your

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
that'll be easier to maneuver in your

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.110 
that'll be easier to maneuver in your
oven<00:02:27.739> than<00:02:27.920> trying<00:02:28.219> to<00:02:28.400> hold<00:02:28.579> it<00:02:28.760> from<00:02:28.939> the

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
oven than trying to hold it from the

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
oven than trying to hold it from the
sides<00:02:29.359> we're<00:02:30.140> gonna<00:02:30.260> bake<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:30.680> at<00:02:31.269> 375<00:02:32.269> and

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
sides we're gonna bake it at 375 and

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.379 
sides we're gonna bake it at 375 and
it's<00:02:33.769> gonna<00:02:33.889> take<00:02:34.129> about<00:02:34.280> 45<00:02:34.879> minutes<00:02:35.180> so

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:35.389 
it's gonna take about 45 minutes so

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:37.569 
it's gonna take about 45 minutes so
don't<00:02:35.629> panic<00:02:35.930> that<00:02:36.230> is<00:02:36.319> taking<00:02:36.680> too<00:02:36.829> long<00:02:36.859> it's

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
don't panic that is taking too long it's

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.459 
don't panic that is taking too long it's
really<00:02:37.700> actually<00:02:38.120> very<00:02:38.299> hard<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:39.019> burn<00:02:39.170> puff

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:39.469 
really actually very hard to burn puff

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:42.429 
really actually very hard to burn puff
pastry<00:02:39.980> so<00:02:40.010> don't<00:02:40.700> worry<00:02:41.079> the<00:02:42.079> thing<00:02:42.260> that's

pastry so don't worry the thing that's

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:43.599 
pastry so don't worry the thing that's
really<00:02:42.620> important<00:02:43.189> when<00:02:43.280> you're<00:02:43.430> baking

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:43.609

anything out of puff pastry is to bake
it<00:02:45.680> all<00:02:45.859> the<00:02:46.040> way<00:02:46.129> through<00:02:46.239> otherwise<00:02:47.239> those

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
it all the way through otherwise those

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.360 
it all the way through otherwise those
layers<00:02:47.780> in<00:02:48.019> the<00:02:48.109> middle<00:02:48.379> will<00:02:48.650> just<00:02:48.859> a<00:02:49.040> gummy

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
layers in the middle will just a gummy

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.640 
layers in the middle will just a gummy
and<00:02:49.730> they<00:02:49.909> won't<00:02:50.209> have<00:02:50.540> that<00:02:50.780> light<00:02:51.079> and<00:02:51.379> flaky

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
and they won't have that light and flaky

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.920 
and they won't have that light and flaky
texture<00:02:52.639> that's<00:02:52.939> really<00:02:53.299> the<00:02:53.419> whole<00:02:53.540> point<00:02:53.810> of

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
texture that's really the whole point of

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.449 
texture that's really the whole point of
this<00:02:54.049> kind<00:02:54.319> of<00:02:54.379> dough<00:02:54.590> so<00:02:54.769> we're<00:02:54.980> gonna<00:02:55.069> pop<00:02:55.340> it

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
this kind of dough so we're gonna pop it

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:02.259 
this kind of dough so we're gonna pop it
in<00:02:55.549> the<00:02:55.639> oven<00:02:58.150> and<00:03:00.459> I'm<00:03:01.459> gonna<00:03:01.579> rotate<00:03:02.060> it<00:03:02.180> in

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
in the oven and I'm gonna rotate it in

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.720 
in the oven and I'm gonna rotate it in
about<00:03:02.419> 20<00:03:02.719> minutes<00:03:02.870> so<00:03:03.310> after<00:03:04.310> you've<00:03:04.459> baked
