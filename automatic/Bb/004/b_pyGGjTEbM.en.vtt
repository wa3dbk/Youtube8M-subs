probably<00:01:15.270> Reggie<00:01:17.810> by<00:01:18.810> our<00:01:19.140> guests<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.530> they

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
probably Reggie by our guests that they

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.859 
probably Reggie by our guests that they
do<00:01:19.710> make<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.299> kind<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.420> hoping<00:01:21.689> that

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
do make that kind of hoping that

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.429 
do make that kind of hoping that
Nintendo<00:01:22.680> would<00:01:22.860> come<00:01:23.100> across<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.640> video

Nintendo would come across this video

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.289 
Nintendo would come across this video
and<00:01:25.439> probably<00:01:25.830> just<00:01:26.070> get<00:01:26.580> some<00:01:26.759> ideas<00:01:27.119> about

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
and probably just get some ideas about

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.060 
and probably just get some ideas about
of<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.780> since<00:01:28.530> they're<00:01:28.680> probably<00:01:28.890> still

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
of it since they're probably still

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.340 
of it since they're probably still
making<00:01:29.640> Pokemon<00:01:30.210> for<00:01:30.570> X&amp;Y<00:01:30.840> they're<00:01:31.229> not

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
completely done yet and they could just

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.670 
completely done yet and they could just
yeah<00:01:34.890> do<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.869> but<00:01:37.430> knowing<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:39.680> regigigas

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680
