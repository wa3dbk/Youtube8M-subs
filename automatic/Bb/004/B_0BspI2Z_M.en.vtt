d hear it earth wind water fire and

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.440 
d hear it earth wind water fire and
heart<00:00:06.710> yeah<00:00:07.710> we<00:00:07.950> have<00:00:08.099> audio<00:00:08.370> enabled<00:00:09.150> for

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
heart yeah we have audio enabled for

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.410 
heart yeah we have audio enabled for
this<00:00:09.599> video<00:00:10.050> so<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.400> that's<00:00:11.969> because<00:00:12.269> we're

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
this video so and that's because we're

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.169 
this video so and that's because we're
gonna<00:00:12.509> show<00:00:12.690> off<00:00:12.809> those<00:00:13.049> old<00:00:13.230> end<00:00:13.469> credits

gonna show off those old end credits
music<00:00:15.179> box

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
music box

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.380 
music box
but<00:00:16.109> here's<00:00:16.320> quick<00:00:16.650> daytime<00:00:17.190> footage<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:18.060> dirt

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
but here's quick daytime footage of dirt

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.710 
but here's quick daytime footage of dirt
and<00:00:18.720> cobblestone<00:00:20.210> because<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.300> was<00:00:21.420> unable<00:00:21.570> to

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
and cobblestone because I was unable to

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.970 
and cobblestone because I was unable to
get<00:00:21.900> that<00:00:22.050> when<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:22.769> visited<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.550> Capitol<00:00:24.980> but

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
get that when I visited the Capitol but

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.759 
get that when I visited the Capitol but
let's<00:00:26.369> get<00:00:26.519> right<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.420> only<00:00:28.349> started

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
let's get right to it I only started

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.420 
let's get right to it I only started
easing<00:00:28.920> redstone<00:00:29.460> two<00:00:29.730> weeks<00:00:29.939> ago<00:00:30.269> but<00:00:30.810> let's

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
easing redstone two weeks ago but let's

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:44.500 
easing redstone two weeks ago but let's
damn

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.990 

and<00:00:45.890> it's<00:00:46.890> looping<00:00:47.460> very<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:48.089> nicely<00:00:49.789> the<00:00:50.789> one

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
and it's looping very it nicely the one

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.119 
and it's looping very it nicely the one
downside<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.229> multiplayer<00:00:52.829> server

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
downside is this is a multiplayer server

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.380 
downside is this is a multiplayer server
and<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:54.210> you're<00:00:54.780> going<00:00:55.019> to<00:00:55.620> have<00:00:55.949> black<00:00:56.909> jumps

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
and so you're going to have black jumps

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.240 
and so you're going to have black jumps
that's<00:00:57.600> just<00:00:57.809> gonna<00:00:57.989> happen<00:00:58.229> if<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:59.100> her

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
that's just gonna happen if this her

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.859 
that's just gonna happen if this her
single-player<00:00:59.879> and<00:00:59.909> play<00:01:00.420> completely

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:00.869 
single-player and play completely

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:04.219 
single-player and play completely
consistently<00:01:01.789> so<00:01:02.789> here<00:01:03.119> stop<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.629> by<00:01:03.989> just

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
consistently so here stop it by just

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:13.700 
consistently so here stop it by just
standing<00:01:04.470> there<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.509> it<00:01:06.509> will<00:01:06.869> stop<00:01:12.680> so<00:01:13.680> let

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
standing there and it will stop so let

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.880 
standing there and it will stop so let
me<00:01:14.460> show<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.820> magic<00:01:15.090> behind<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.899> and

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
me show you the magic behind this and

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.550 
me show you the magic behind this and
why<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:17.340> important<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.390> setup<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.840> have<00:01:19.080> for

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
why it's important the setup I have for

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.770 
why it's important the setup I have for
a<00:01:19.590> multiplayer<00:01:20.100> server<00:01:20.299> so<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.360> don't<00:01:21.569> want

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
a multiplayer server so you don't want

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.800 
a multiplayer server so you don't want
the<00:01:22.619> looping<00:01:23.039> to<00:01:23.159> happen<00:01:23.549> forever

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
the looping to happen forever

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.690 
the looping to happen forever
accidentally<00:01:24.810> if<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.080> were<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.259> leave

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
accidentally if you were to leave

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.399 
accidentally if you were to leave
because<00:01:26.700> that's<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.090> drag<00:01:27.299> on<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.509> server<00:01:27.780> so

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
because that's a drag on the server so

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.990 
because that's a drag on the server so
here<00:01:28.679> we<00:01:28.770> are<00:01:28.799> we<00:01:29.159> have<00:01:29.190> a<00:01:29.369> pressure<00:01:29.729> plate

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
here we are we have a pressure plate

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.180 
here we are we have a pressure plate
with<00:01:30.360> an<00:01:30.479> item<00:01:30.780> dropped<00:01:31.080> so<00:01:31.679> when<00:01:31.830> you<00:01:31.920> come<00:01:32.100> up

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
with an item dropped so when you come up

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.620 
with an item dropped so when you come up
to<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.340> corner<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.850> pick<00:01:33.060> up<00:01:33.209> the<00:01:33.330> item

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
to that corner you pick up the item

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.109 
to that corner you pick up the item
deactivates<00:01:34.440> a<00:01:34.560> pressure<00:01:34.830> plate<00:01:35.069> and<00:01:35.880> this<00:01:35.970> is

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
deactivates a pressure plate and this is

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.770 
deactivates a pressure plate and this is
a<00:01:36.149> NAND<00:01:36.479> gate<00:01:37.009> needs<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.190> signal<00:01:38.819> from<00:01:39.060> two

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
a NAND gate needs a signal from two

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.230 
a NAND gate needs a signal from two
different<00:01:39.959> sources<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:41.250> flip<00:01:41.850> through<00:01:42.119> a

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
different sources to flip through a

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.559 
different sources to flip through a
signal<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.069> that<00:01:44.069> repeater<00:01:44.729> prevents<00:01:45.509> the

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:45.569 
signal and that repeater prevents the

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:47.359 
signal and that repeater prevents the
signal<00:01:45.899> from<00:01:46.140> coming<00:01:46.470> back<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.799> activating

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
signal from coming back and activating

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.230 
signal from coming back and activating
that<00:01:47.490> dispenser<00:01:48.090> again<00:01:48.930> otherwise<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:50.039> would

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
that dispenser again otherwise it would

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.730 
that dispenser again otherwise it would
keep<00:01:51.240> going<00:01:51.420> forever<00:01:53.960> but<00:01:54.960> he<00:01:55.109> was<00:01:55.200> my<00:01:55.289> ultra

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
keep going forever but he was my ultra

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.609 
keep going forever but he was my ultra
compact<00:01:56.219> design<00:01:57.710> it's<00:01:59.359> stacked<00:02:00.359> very<00:02:01.229> closely

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
compact design it's stacked very closely

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.669 
compact design it's stacked very closely
this<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.219> best<00:02:03.000> for<00:02:03.329> songs<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.229> only<00:02:04.320> really

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
this is best for songs that only really

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.479 
this is best for songs that only really
have<00:02:04.950> one<00:02:05.460> instrument<00:02:05.820> playing<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:07.489> the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
have one instrument playing and the

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.539 
have one instrument playing and the
important<00:02:08.880> things<00:02:09.030> here<00:02:09.239> are<00:02:09.450> these<00:02:09.600> uh<00:02:10.549> spots

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:11.549 
important things here are these uh spots

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:13.490 
important things here are these uh spots
at<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.790> edges<00:02:12.180> those<00:02:12.600> are<00:02:12.780> those<00:02:13.079> really<00:02:13.380> the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
at the edges those are those really the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.560 
at the edges those are those really the
the<00:02:13.950> tricky<00:02:14.310> ones<00:02:14.519> showing<00:02:14.880> how<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.180> wrap

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
the tricky ones showing how to wrap

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.820 
the tricky ones showing how to wrap
around<00:02:15.600> but

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.090 

stop<00:02:20.830> this<00:02:21.810> it'll<00:02:22.810> show<00:02:22.990> you<00:02:23.050> a<00:02:23.170> little<00:02:23.320> other

trick up my sleeve

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.940 
trick up my sleeve
yeah<00:02:27.970> just<00:02:28.240> two<00:02:28.420> weeks<00:02:28.630> messing<00:02:29.440> around<00:02:29.530> with

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
yeah just two weeks messing around with

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.240 
yeah just two weeks messing around with
redstone<00:02:30.430> learning<00:02:31.210> it<00:02:31.360> I<00:02:31.570> think<00:02:32.200> I've<00:02:32.320> done

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
redstone learning it I think I've done

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.270 
redstone learning it I think I've done
pretty<00:02:33.550> well<00:02:33.670> learning<00:02:34.060> it<00:02:34.330> so<00:02:34.510> far<00:02:35.160> leave<00:02:36.160> my

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
pretty well learning it so far leave my

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.670 
pretty well learning it so far leave my
bedroom<00:02:38.610> but<00:02:39.610> here's<00:02:40.000> a<00:02:40.060> door<00:02:40.690> design<00:02:41.050> I<00:02:41.350> found

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
bedroom but here's a door design I found

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.040 
bedroom but here's a door design I found
just<00:02:41.920> on<00:02:42.070> a<00:02:42.130> youtube<00:02:42.580> video<00:02:42.730> I'll<00:02:43.090> link<00:02:43.630> it<00:02:43.840> and

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050
