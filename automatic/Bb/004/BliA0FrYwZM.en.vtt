 open it was director 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.080
 the dichato music library has many scores 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.080
 prepare that we can use to compose 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.750
 we will combine here individual rhythmic instruments 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.750
 to illustrate the principle of intuitive composition 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.850
 exploring the content of these libraries is very easy 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.710
 schools with two blacks in opposite directions are partitions 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.590
 the contents of a partition its form temporarily when you 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.590
 hover over his nikon with the mouse 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.300
 if you click on the icon the score is played in a continuous loop 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.300
 until the mouse comes out of the icon 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.610
 but 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.810
 it is presented here 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.759
 these are measures that each include not a single instrument a 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.759
 small rhythmic sequence 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.050
 to discover them we suggest to spend some time to explore 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:42.070
 these bookstores 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.070
 and listen to the excerpts therein 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:13.180
 it is not necessary to understand how the score displays 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.180
 is written 

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:27.519
 the choice of this extreme is based on your personal account 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.519
 just by listening to them 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:09.039
 the music desktop allows you to create a group in which you can then 

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:12.039
 gathered extracts that you like 

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:22.429
 you can change its size by dragging its lower right corner 

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:32.429
 let's choose the first league now but that inspires us to start a 

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:35.429
 composition 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.450
 a group can be listened to by the fire button and all the partitions 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.450
 who will be there will be heard 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.629
 a group must be placed in a continuous loop which allows to continue to 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:00.629
 use partitions while listening to the result directly 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.349
 m 

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:15.360
 it's a partition you do not like listening to all you can 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.360
 delete it by clicking on the cross 

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:27.969
 you can also directly replace one partition with another 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:30.969
 sliding it while holding the control key 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:39.790
 when the celebrity completes you can then develop it and him 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:40.599
 add agreements
