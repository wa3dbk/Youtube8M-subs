like wave 10 or 12 i think and that

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.420 
like wave 10 or 12 i think and that
might<00:01:31.110> seem<00:01:31.350> pretty<00:01:31.530> pathetic<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.159> but

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
might seem pretty pathetic to you but

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.039 
might seem pretty pathetic to you but
honestly<00:01:32.820> i<00:01:33.150> haven't<00:01:33.600> been<00:01:33.750> able<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.960> play

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
with any of my friends because nobody

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.190 
with any of my friends because nobody
has<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> game<00:01:35.760> but<00:01:35.909> me<00:01:36.060> really<00:01:36.360> i<00:01:36.540> play<00:01:37.049> with<00:01:37.170> a

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
has a game but me really i play with a

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.539 
has a game but me really i play with a
couple<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.409> there<00:01:37.530> youtubers<00:01:37.890> but<00:01:38.130> we<00:01:38.280> are<00:01:38.369> all

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
couple of there youtubers but we are all

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.370 
couple of there youtubers but we are all
noobs<00:01:38.909> at<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:39.450> it's<00:01:39.630> very<00:01:39.840> difficult<00:01:40.170> to

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
noobs at it so it's very difficult to

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.440 
noobs at it so it's very difficult to
stay<00:01:40.590> alive<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.070> level<00:01:41.310> 10<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.790> actually<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.390> lot

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
stay alive so level 10 is actually a lot

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
stay alive so level 10 is actually a lot
harder<00:01:42.510> than<00:01:42.720> you'd<00:01:42.900> believe<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.260> can<00:01:43.380> see

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
harder than you'd believe in you can see

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.020 
harder than you'd believe in you can see
right<00:01:43.500> here<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.159> think<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.520> can't<00:01:44.790> read<00:01:44.970> what

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
right here on I think I can't read what

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.149 
right here on I think I can't read what
way<00:01:45.180> this<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.540> this<00:01:46.470> might<00:01:46.619> be<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.740> boss<00:01:46.950> wave

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
way this is this might be a boss wave

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.580 
way this is this might be a boss wave
but<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:48.180> way<00:01:48.360> right<00:01:48.510> here<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.810> giant-ass

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
but this way right here that giant-ass

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.740 
but this way right here that giant-ass
boss<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.460> difficult<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:51.150> take<00:01:51.330> down<00:01:51.510> we

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
boss is so difficult to take down we

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.390 
boss is so difficult to take down we

much<00:02:06.450> like<00:02:06.630> zombies<00:02:07.080> that<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.320> think<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.799> it

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
much like zombies that I think that it

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.979 
much like zombies that I think that it
might<00:02:08.009> be<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.340> next<00:02:08.489> thing<00:02:09.299> that<00:02:09.509> we<00:02:09.750> play

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
might be the next thing that we play

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.559 
might be the next thing that we play
until<00:02:10.379> zombies<00:02:10.830> comes<00:02:11.519> out<00:02:11.670> in<00:02:11.849> 2015<00:02:12.209> like<00:02:12.480> I

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
until zombies comes out in 2015 like I

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.479 
until zombies comes out in 2015 like I
said<00:02:12.840> sledgehammer<00:02:13.650> games<00:02:13.739> is<00:02:14.069> making<00:02:14.340> next

call<00:02:14.549> duty<00:02:14.819> so<00:02:15.029> I<00:02:15.090> don't<00:02:15.239> think<00:02:15.359> they'll<00:02:15.450> be

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
call duty so I don't think they'll be

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.390 
call duty so I don't think they'll be
zombies<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:16.349> Trek<00:02:16.620> may

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
zombies so Trek may

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.920 
zombies so Trek may
hopefully<00:02:18.000> we'll<00:02:18.150> bring<00:02:18.239> back<00:02:18.420> zombies<00:02:18.810> when

because it's zombies but you're just

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:47.750 
because it's zombies but you're just
playing<00:02:46.530> his<00:02:46.680> plants<00:02:47.069> instead<00:02:47.250> of<00:02:47.430> flying<00:02:47.549> as

playing his plants instead of flying as
regular<00:02:48.090> characters<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.689> there<00:02:49.200> isn't

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
regular characters and there isn't

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
really a storyline per se but the

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:53.690 
really a storyline per se but the
