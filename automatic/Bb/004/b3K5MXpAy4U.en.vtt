00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.050
 where we are again turned on has 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.730
 us according to the video, it's about that 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.279
 theme was lost places videos already 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.560
 can discuss what are lost places 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.450
 does that make sense that note i would like 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.880
 Of course you do not animate which one 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.980
 ruin to go in there and a bus there 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.789
 best to climb in the morning without a gate 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.440
 break 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.940
 there are many illegal ones 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.239
 By now you can see the displays 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.220
 Book was a certain pay and has 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.280
 even whole orient tips booking easy 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.480
 times google curry sausage places 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.570
 visit 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.739
 There are so many legal and that 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.229
 I want you out and that in the 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:48.080
 useful and the video here is about it 

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:49.489
 what you need from technology you can see 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.890
 take pictures with digital 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.470
 SLR why not 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.030
 compact and quite simply because here is 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.229
 super wide angle has meant 10 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.320
 that means I get just such 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:04.970
 clean up a lot when I can 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:10.869
 caulk most of the room 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:13.939
 the bath works very well at all 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:16.759
 Of course you can also macro or too 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.619
 one of a rich table focal length 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.079
 make very nice pictures of details 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.329
 but that's just taste should that 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:25.340
 I want to suggest mostly 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:27.770
 a tripod with all the answers to the lost 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.409
 places that dark not the tripod 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.710
 I can use this 100 user 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.590
 photographs and direction newspaper from 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.170
 partially 10 20 seconds can use 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.219
 also changes of direction later 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.469
 to make city hall 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:44.570
 to the subject real ever get the tenant 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:47.149
 line is made statements of the ring 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.270
 show that I have something else 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:54.499
 I want to try and I want you 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.819
 here show little construction site and statements 

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:59.390
 I like the camera I make as I 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:00.039
 that's why it's so easy 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.479
 new items 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.460
 This is how my perspective became 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.249
 my screen you right us 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.360
 made as much as I liked her 

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:10.640
 See the visual conditions are very 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.870
 that's why it's very bad 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.890
 I also clear my direction of what I am from 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.890
 addressed has the hdr 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.610
 we come times without settings 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.320
 and I photograph this 100 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.300
 so that's the whole thing later 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.270
 Reworking can be less noise 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.160
 in there have these beginner cameras then 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.740
 So far we have problems in the 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.710
 residential areas that they strongly irritate when 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.690
 you later on the depths holds 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.240
 reinforced as I said I used 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.610
 in the manual focus here from just when 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.500
 you go in very dark places 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.470
 photographed and focused en passant 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:52.750
 the autofocus often misses 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:54.580
 I also use the self-timer here 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.360
 So one of the camera self-timer 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.660
 patient seconds 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.920
 so that it does not blur when mucking out 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:04.600
 and I 'm gonna cut it out too 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.280
 this uses the mode because I'm blind 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.350
 the pantec carpet chosen with care 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.650
 at 10 millimeters focal length before that 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.330
 you shop all the way to the back and the camera 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.490
 then gives the exposure time and on 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:20.200
 jump 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:27.160
 if you are focused on the liveview 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:28.420
 the magnifying glass and then you look out me 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.510
 my project wants people to sleep 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.870
 and plays and even more details too 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.870
 see 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.930
 then it fits me quite well there 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.060
 I see now had a 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.220
 exposure time of 130 10 seconds 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.050
 that would be quite difficult in the 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.760
 thirtieth second freehand 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.060
 take pictures or just a tripod 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:52.930
 And now I'm pressing a patent trigger 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.480
 my picture right in the box I guess 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.870
 you also many perspectives 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.959
 try 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.290
 I now hang in connection immediately two 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.350
 pictures with different 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.440
 perspectives on it and let's see what 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.440
 comes out 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.290
 at the spot you see now time 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.700
 the different perspectives and 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.440
 you can see that quite well what that means 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.959
 if you look for example from the side or 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.150
 Frontal photographed advantages like 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.410
 me personally not so or then 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.030
 Just what I said when you go 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.230
 just a nice detail 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.010
 I did that with the example 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.630
 50 made by tamron what you do 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.390
 also again can come pictures 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.650
 you can pick up the circle 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.510
 The same goes on from the outside 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.800
 photograph and is not so synonymous 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.810
 Danger exposed I find such a 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.130
 outdoor shot also has its conscience 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.370
 delight in all things when you go to 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.750
 Examples also include things 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.580
 again the gas mask if the course 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.840
 need golden cut it need 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.340
 also not necessarily a gas mask says 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.300
 certainly a bottle is enough 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.770
 which is broken or broken glass and 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.100
 I just think that something like this 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.570
 has its own appeal 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.060
 there are a few left on the spot 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.890
 pictures where I take a photo trip to 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.200
 Obviously, he did that completely 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.120
 paid a legal trip and was able to do so 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.300
 no longer lord and stop 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.040
 and take pictures and you can 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.270
 Now still look at the place hope 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.730
 I you had fun with the courage had 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.450
 what is learned or maybe you can for 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:21.460
 your photos what use and implement 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.720
 after that there will be a video what I have 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.990
 in bed and taken have with the 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.210
 mopo where you can see something like this unedited 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.560
 looks for all who are looking for 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.660
 these locations are interesting 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.950
 at the moment if you have the video 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.950
 If you like it, please 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:38.400
 have brought then it is please 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:43.240
 sometimes with your facebook 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:46.840
 Photo friends and what a thumb after 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:49.080
 up there and subscribe us and we'll see 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.080
 U.S. again
