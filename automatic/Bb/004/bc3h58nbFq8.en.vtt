okay<00:00:04.790> hello<00:00:05.790> everybody<00:00:06.029> today<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:07.319> case<00:00:07.529> that

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
okay hello everybody today the case that

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.740 
okay hello everybody today the case that
we<00:00:07.890> are<00:00:07.919> going<00:00:08.130> to<00:00:08.250> discuss<00:00:08.639> is<00:00:08.880> a<00:00:08.940> unique<00:00:09.450> case

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
we are going to discuss is a unique case

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.350 
we are going to discuss is a unique case
again<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.290> very<00:00:10.530> uncommon<00:00:11.070> finding<00:00:11.580> but<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.150> very

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
again a very uncommon finding but a very

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.720 
again a very uncommon finding but a very
