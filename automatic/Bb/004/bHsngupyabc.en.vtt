 the problem of the size of the signs 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.770
 stored in public archives 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.660
 administrations becomes more and more 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.000
 difficult for the continuous increase of 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.280
 volume this problem has been addressed 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.289
 by the railway administration that has 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.420
 established at the service of a 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.880
 experimental purpose a micro plant 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.859
 photographic the operator uses 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.510
 the micro reproducer device in the 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.119
 whose chamber is inserted a film 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.400
 on reel and photographs documents or books 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.840
 the latter are placed on a plane 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.880
 mobile with an upward movement 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.800
 press the pages explained against a 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:41.760
 crystal to allow a recovery 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:43.590
 perfect when shooting is proceeding 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.570
 to the development of the negative in the specific

 darkroom accurately executed on 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.120
 washing finally controls the 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.120
 result 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.770
 of the same film can be 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.510
 reproduce positive copies quickly 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.260
 allow a printing machine a

 contact 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.960
 documents and reduced microfilm 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.030
 can always be consulted 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.799
 to the reading apparatus with which 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.810
 each frame is projected 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.700
 enlarged repeating with extreme 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.700
 clarity of the micro filmed document 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.880
 when it is necessary to reproduce the 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.770
 reduced document on enlarged paper 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.480
 compared to the original one is made 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.640
 the operation using a municipality 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.500
 enlarger the pairs thus obtained e 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.260
 they are perfectly more readable 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.150
 of the original here is a random document 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.090
 to its perfect reproduction obtained 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.680
 from the small frame it led to the center 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.960
 the film used for the film book is 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.850
 its amiable starts its format allows 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.460
 to keep in a small box 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.050
 size one thousand frames hundreds of 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.960
 thousands of documents will be placed 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.550
 very small buildings la 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.340
 end of the old files is now 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.340
 marked the last stage will be the pulp
