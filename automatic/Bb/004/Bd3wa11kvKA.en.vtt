00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.110 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:16.519 

this<00:00:10.110> is<00:00:10.320> an<00:00:10.469> update<00:00:10.920> of<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.790> last<00:00:15.529> product

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
this is an update of the last product

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.790 
this is an update of the last product
that<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:16.890> unboxed<00:00:17.609> that<00:00:17.820> little<00:00:18.180> LCD<00:00:18.600> screen<00:00:19.080> it

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
that I unboxed that little LCD screen it

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.109 
that I unboxed that little LCD screen it
actually<00:00:19.859> did<00:00:20.580> not<00:00:23.630> allow<00:00:24.630> my<00:00:24.840> camera<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.439> be

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
actually did not allow my camera to be

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.580 
actually did not allow my camera to be
it<00:00:27.119> wasn't<00:00:28.130> the<00:00:29.130> LCD<00:00:29.609> couldn't<00:00:29.970> close<00:00:30.590> with

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
it wasn't the LCD couldn't close with

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
it wasn't the LCD couldn't close with
the<00:00:31.890> lens<00:00:32.700> facing<00:00:33.420> inwards<00:00:34.190> but<00:00:35.190> it's<00:00:35.370> cool

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
the lens facing inwards but it's cool

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.170 
the lens facing inwards but it's cool
because<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.120> LCD<00:00:36.329> cover<00:00:37.020> kind<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:38.180> protects

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
because the LCD cover kind of protects

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.119 
because the LCD cover kind of protects
it<00:00:39.390> anyway<00:00:39.750> so<00:00:39.780> it's<00:00:40.440> not<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.620> big<00:00:40.770> deal<00:00:42.200> so<00:00:43.200> see

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
it anyway so it's not a big deal so see

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:55.040 
it anyway so it's not a big deal so see
if<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:51.350> it's<00:00:52.350> got<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:53.660> Canon<00:00:54.660> logo

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
if this is this it's got the Canon logo

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.280 
if this is this it's got the Canon logo
here

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.820 

so<00:01:02.290> if<00:01:03.010> anyone<00:01:03.700> is<00:01:04.120> oh<00:01:04.420> so<00:01:04.989> it's<00:01:05.470> a<00:01:05.560> remote

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
so if anyone is oh so it's a remote

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.140 
so if anyone is oh so it's a remote
control<00:01:06.250> for<00:01:06.580> the<00:01:07.080> Canon<00:01:08.080> t3i<00:01:08.320> and<00:01:09.280> it's

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
control for the Canon t3i and it's

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.570 
control for the Canon t3i and it's
probably<00:01:10.480> works<00:01:10.900> for<00:01:11.110> other<00:01:11.260> canons<00:01:11.770> also<00:01:14.580> if

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
probably works for other canons also if

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.810 
probably works for other canons also if
anyone<00:01:16.390> who's<00:01:17.170> watching<00:01:17.500> these<00:01:17.830> videos<00:01:18.340> knows

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
anyone who's watching these videos knows

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.050 
anyone who's watching these videos knows
anything<00:01:19.420> about<00:01:20.160> looks<00:01:21.160> like<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.460> box<00:01:21.729> it<00:01:22.030> was

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
anything about looks like the box it was

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.960 
anything about looks like the box it was
probably<00:01:22.660> supposed<00:01:22.990> to<00:01:23.290> come<00:01:23.530> in<00:01:23.710> but<00:01:23.970> they

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
probably supposed to come in but they

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.410 
probably supposed to come in but they
ended<00:01:25.150> up<00:01:25.240> flattening<00:01:25.840> it<00:01:26.940> but<00:01:27.940> it<00:01:28.060> does<00:01:28.240> say

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
ended up flattening it but it does say

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.090 
ended up flattening it but it does say
canon<00:01:28.869> i<00:01:28.990> it<00:01:29.050> so<00:01:29.440> i<00:01:29.470> don't<00:01:29.710> know<00:01:29.800> if<00:01:29.830> this<00:01:30.070> is

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
canon i it so i don't know if this is

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.520 
canon i it so i don't know if this is
like<00:01:30.399> a<00:01:32.910> authentic<00:01:33.910> thing<00:01:34.450> but<00:01:34.990> i<00:01:35.020> think<00:01:35.290> i<00:01:35.380> got

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
like a authentic thing but i think i got

like a authentic thing but i think i got
it<00:01:35.680> for<00:01:35.830> like<00:01:35.979> a<00:01:36.009> buck<00:01:36.399> or<00:01:36.610> two<00:01:37.410> so<00:01:38.410> definitely

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
it for like a buck or two so definitely

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.219 
it for like a buck or two so definitely
go<00:01:39.520> on<00:01:39.670> ebay<00:01:40.090> and<00:01:40.330> get<00:01:40.479> one<00:01:40.600> of<00:01:40.720> those<00:01:40.840> if<00:01:41.080> you

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
go on ebay and get one of those if you

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:47.010 
go on ebay and get one of those if you
want<00:01:41.440> to<00:01:43.259> here's<00:01:44.259> what<00:01:44.560> it<00:01:44.680> looks<00:01:44.890> like<00:01:45.130> I<00:01:46.020> mean

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
want to here's what it looks like I mean

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.690 
want to here's what it looks like I mean
what<00:01:47.229> it<00:01:47.350> is<00:01:47.500> coming<00:01:47.830> from<00:01:47.950> China<00:01:48.280> so<00:01:48.550> who

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
what it is coming from China so who

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.670 
what it is coming from China so who
really<00:01:48.880> knows<00:01:49.180> if<00:01:49.390> it's<00:01:49.570> real<00:01:49.810> or<00:01:49.960> not<00:01:49.990> so<00:01:52.680> I

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
really knows if it's real or not so I

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.249 
really knows if it's real or not so I
guess<00:01:54.130> if<00:01:54.280> I<00:01:54.399> take<00:01:54.640> slide<00:01:55.450> this<00:01:55.690> part<00:01:55.899> out<00:01:56.020> the

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
guess if I take slide this part out the

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.830 
guess if I take slide this part out the
battery<00:01:56.649> becomes<00:01:57.009> connected<00:01:57.610> it's<00:01:58.600> got<00:01:58.810> a

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
battery becomes connected it's got a

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.040 
battery becomes connected it's got a
little<00:01:59.170> switch<00:01:59.470> right<00:01:59.500> here<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:01.360> know<00:02:01.509> for

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
little switch right here you know for

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.789 
little switch right here you know for
all<00:02:02.290> the<00:02:02.320> things<00:02:02.799> that<00:02:03.130> I<00:02:03.810> usually<00:02:04.810> ignore<00:02:05.590> the

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
all the things that I usually ignore the

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.340 
all the things that I usually ignore the
instruction<00:02:06.369> manual<00:02:06.790> over<00:02:07.090> looks<00:02:07.960> like<00:02:08.140> I

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
instruction manual over looks like I

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.570 
instruction manual over looks like I
might<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:10.000> would<00:02:10.119> be<00:02:10.269> nice<00:02:10.479> to<00:02:10.750> have<00:02:10.899> a

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
instruction manual for this thing like

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.539
