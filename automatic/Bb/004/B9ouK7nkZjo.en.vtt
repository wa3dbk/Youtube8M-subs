00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.629
 what a wave to see how it is greeted 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.850
 mixer that emits thanks for being here 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.130
 again on my channel and this day 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.380
 I bring the review or the analysis of what 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.860
 is going to be the trailer of the first most 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.860
 SE busca 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.630
 when I burn here we are already going to 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.850
 start to analyze what you see in and first 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.230
 glove mode in the new game this 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.390
 great saga of video games that to me in what 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.070
 I've always liked staff a lot and 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.590
 let's talk a little bit you know that 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.630
 this is a personal opinion the truth 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.890
 this is what I think and you know that 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.780
 many people can not think what 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.550
 same as me so let's start 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.010
 analyze a bit as we all know 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.320
 ni ferpi was officially presented at 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.420
 what was the and 3 showed a trailer 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.879
 which we can see that this game is going to 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.530
 have incredible graphics the 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.010
 truth I think that they are going to be 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.630
 graphics and much above the normal 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.140
 that have been seen in what is the 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.910
 previous nor profile and in which you can 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.530
 see there's going to be an open world what 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.790
 we could see what was happening there 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.620
 there's going to be a world where you're going to 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.930
 be able to confuse the police to your 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.180
 way you will be able to execute jumps as 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.729
 when I say jump it's going to refer to how 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.770
 when you go very fast with the car and you go 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.890
 to be able to jump with the car making a 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.080
 some very spectacular jumps you go to 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.080
 be able to confuse your opponents by taking 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.520
 shortcuts try to go unnoticed 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.890
 or go to land 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.079
 in which you will be able to get the most 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.600
 advantage to the car is the best speed 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:28.399
 that the car may have more than everything 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.130
 you are going to drive where you want to go 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.719
 discover hidden game experiences 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.819
 you will be able to meet with 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:37.670
 friends or just go out and give 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:39.200
 back and play to outwit the police by 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.560
 which makes me very good because it's going to 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.509
 be a game with an open world 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.060
 let's talk a little bit about what 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.100
 is the autoblog are all of what is said 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.810
 in English what is going to do that 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.640
 your friends are the protagonists of 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.590
 all aspects of the most wanted 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.149
 autolog will also show you the 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.310
 records of your friends while 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.320
 you drive through the city performing jumps 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.090
 competing in each street will cross you 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.159
 down the street or doing brutal drive 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.799
 time coder rap is as it is said in 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.830
 Spanish the protagonists are going to be here 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:13.310
 your friends and you or you are going to be 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.110
 the protagonist and your friends as is 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.690
 saying in the key of moxos glove in 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.030
 lies in the intense competitiveness but 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.280
 it's going to be registering gentlemen all 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.069
 what you are going to do and it will show you 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.110
 friends your scores your times and 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.299
 the most remarkable speeds the 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.430
 personalization is the key gentlemen 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:34.040
 teach outlook to whoever wants 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.840
 defeat and really and the skin 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.610
 personal will be the recommendations that 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.930
 I'll do to you like for example if I'm 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.940
 playing and I made my account and that 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.530
 is playing the same game and I put 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.780
 there I want to defeat my friend 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.400
 tec he's going to have to customize the 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.350
 tests that I have to do to be able to 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.180
 defeat which makes me very good 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.980
 so now it's going to be more than everything 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.260
 to be able to be in a system 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.960
 competition with your friends when you're 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.580
 playing in the online way talking about 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.230
 play online let's talk a little bit 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.450
 about what I understand only what 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.060
 Does multiplayer or multiplayer mode 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.520
 the online game is based on an intense 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.980
 competitiveness games by team 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.200
 constant scores an elaborate 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.960
 rating system and endless 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.340
 of rewards and improvement you will fight 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.500
 to have to be fighting for a position 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.910
 in the starting line crosses the goal and 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.130
 stay with the victory from here the 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.630
 report there are no screens this is very 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.670
 important gentlemen who will see that 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.380
 I was analyzing is not going to see screens 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.840
 with waiting rooms so you 're not going to 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.760
 be in a lobby like waiting to be able 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.890
 play so that's going to be very good 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.930
 you will be able to bring the different 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.790
 action tests that they will see because 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.500
 happens to be a free world, that is, you 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.510
 you are going to enter what is going to be what I am 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.980
 imagining the map and you're just going to 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.250
 enter the map and there you will go to look 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.320
 what is going to be the competition that you are going to 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.980
 to be able to do so you will always be able to 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.760
 the same thing to you to compete and explore 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.799
 at your own pace you do not have to walk 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.079
 what an open world you are going to do it 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.900
 little by little as you go grabbing 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:05.409
 remember that if you have played 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.780
 what the hardware appointment as hot 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:09.370
 persecution as if it is in Spanish and the 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.930
 saga of all these games are already going to 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.610
 being a bit was badly bristling with the 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.370
 driving in the characteristics of the 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.530
 games at the speed of shocks the 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.780
 spectacular spectacular clashes 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.360
 forgiveness and a very very big action and the 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.729
 33 also so this has not changed 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.190
 the gameplay of the signal game is going to be 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.419
 always the same although the graphs 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.729
 I'm going to thrill as I told the 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:34.000
 At the beginning of weeks , I think 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:35.650
 they are very very good so this is in 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.750
 what is the multiplayer 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.150
 when we are going to talk a bit about what happens 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.850
 If I hold, I reserve what will be the 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.190
 limited edition of what this will be 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.500
 great game more sources of fertile demos 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.120
 walter what is it that you are going to be able to 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.710
 get you going to be able to have one of the 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.560
 three parks that they are offering 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:56.169
 which one the first of those who 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.820
 flame is called speed forgiveness is called that 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.930
 is what he grasps with spirit four hours 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.820
 of double experience 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.949
 which is points so you will be able to be 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.449
 playing for four hours and all 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:07.580
 points they will hire you double for 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:09.740
 four hours which I do very well 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.380
 good if you have lovers to be able to win 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.330
 many points and go up like this level in 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.639
 this kind of egg another of the things that 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.190
 you can receive or choose will be in the 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.380
 park that is called striker streeter 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.720
 as you could say in Spanish that is 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:27.350
 what you grab with these claws of 2012 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.509
 porsche 911 race so that if you 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:32.030
 I really like the porsche car 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:34.009
 wants to have a car when the 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.620
 game in case the issue grabs it 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:39.020
 limited you will be able to grab that 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.490
 car in that for that other detail that 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.620
 You can also take the one called the 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.910
 cover the power that is what it consists 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.150
 poor is that you will be able to grab the 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:49.070
 maserati granturismo and is a package of 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.470
 Power train race adjusted for 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.180
 increase power and impact well 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.949
 that these are the three things that you can 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.979
 choose me in my case maybe it's 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:59.960
 I would win the power because the points 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:01.639
 they're going to do when we're playing like that 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.410
 that but I can definitely 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:05.569
 recommend gentlemen this game is going to be 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.819
 super super good and it would be good if 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:09.830
 they could book it so I gamer if 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:11.869
 they want me to bring them one more video 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.509
 about this leave it here in the box 

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:15.619
 comments and tell me here in the box 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:18.319
 comments also what is it that 

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:20.689
 think about this style I would buy or not 

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:23.059
 I would buy it and if I would buy it in the 

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:24.559
 what and if not because I would not buy it 

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:26.419

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:27.770
