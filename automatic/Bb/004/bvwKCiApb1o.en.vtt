00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 the times than electric cars mainly 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.319
 small and handy were over 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.360
 because trucks could soon be with 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.290
 Electric motors on Swiss roads 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.840
 be on the move 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.690
 This one, for example, is one of the biggest 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.720
 Today he has electric trucks in the world 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.550
 Zurich premiere celebrated and this celebrity 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.029
 is considered a Swiss masters achievement 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.410
 thanks to the highly efficient 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.019
 electric motors and batteries 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.720
 latest generation daily ranges of 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.450
 possible up to 300 kilometers 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.969
 it also manages to do this for 18 tons 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.950
 the gotthard pass up 10 to 10 has 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.780
 Run the electric truck for the test 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.790
 compete against a diesel truck 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.100
 can result in surprising 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:49.289
 schubert Salvatore Kacar claudia seiler 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.079
 she is a longtime test driver and 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.739
 Instructors cut off worth over 25 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.649
 years truck the electric diesel duel two 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.460
 equally sized camions load 14 tons each 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:06.009
 heavy start Gotthard restaurant only 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.060
 falls goal gotthard pass 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.130
 the batteries are fully charged after 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.500
 six hours 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.200
 lord the car of her feeling of the state yes 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.930
 sure that everything goes well and the test 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:24.770
 was passed diesel claudia rope 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:25.909
 300 liters of beer trucks were new 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:33.770
 most are saving 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:36.080
 hopefully a few will work 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.759
 days before in the workshop from one 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.700
 normal came young have the engineers 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:45.649
 built a truck instead of huge 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:48.140
 diesel engine's electro guests 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.850
 two high tech batteries gigantic each 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.130
 13 tons heavy 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.080
 comparatively easy to change the 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.289
 biggest driving batteries of switzerland 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.549
 For the first time, the sensation is reach 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:03.440
 up to 300 kilometers 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.920
 but the real masterpiece is whole 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.979
 small 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.200
 the electric motor is highly efficient 95 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.530
 percent efficiency of two 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.200
 over 400 ps 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.239
 that is only possible because the 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.580
 highly efficient time warner is the 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.320
 power bring trumps with the truck 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.710
 efficient and environmentally friendly 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.170
 Agreed 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.280
 but an electric truck can also be fast 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.890
 with keep the traffic 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.660
 the first test comparison trip over 200 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.660
 meter shows this mercilessly 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.590
 result the electric wins 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.090
 surprisingly confident 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.520
 nobody has with such a clear 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.340
 distance calculated the euphoria at 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:12.810
 technicians buyers and the investor 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:15.390
 big st ballen electric vehicle expert 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.080
 martin cook has 14 14 the exact technique 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.930
 watched 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.450
 his conclusion is the electric truck is still 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.440
 no option for long distance traffic for the 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.750
 fine distribution already worries her 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.790
 since dollar i would be in for the station 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.850
 regional fame skin over very much 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.420
 interesting is the emission-free heidi 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:39.330
 there and therefore poverty both factor where 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.640
 be short for a spread and 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:45.650
 touchpad or currently 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:48.240
 gifts like the last big eu 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.770
 in the future will be with the electric truck 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.920
 in the city of Zurich food 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.290
 Delivered second test we chase him 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.580
 laden the steep schÃ¶llenenschlucht 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.580
 up for the diesel in the neck 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.650
 the electric motor keeps the 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.120
 Extreme load was recently the in 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.800
 one of the two engines broke 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.800
 the second one was used 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.120
 what is the difference between that 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:29.840
 diesel and electric drive 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:32.580
 calm and beautiful form 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.660
 continue to have to be twice as careful 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.660
 quietly overtaken 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:45.490
 the co2 load in comparison of these 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:49.960
 pushes out 109 kilograms of co2 inclusive 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:52.090
 fuel production of electric trucks 24 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.979
 kilogram co2 inclusive 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.979
 Battery manufacturing and power production 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.450
 last slope before the gotthard 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.850
 passed 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:08.730
 the batteries are still half full 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:12.730
 Developer facilitates balance sheet xe two 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:15.090
 huge enthusiasm for the whole 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.770
 Team and material for the moment 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.570
 really supports the product where you are 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.840
 green spot where really 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.370
 economically I have 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.710
 economically, inter alia because of 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.520
 slow down and down the batteries 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.520
 charge
