00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.379
 nor is she blonde and brunette the wave is now to be 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.940
 redhead and today I came to talk to 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.980
 spout pink that will tell you everything 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:16.980
 you need to know before changing the color 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:19.289
 your hair tells me how you 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.330
 It's been a long time since this 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.880
 hair release all the information you 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:28.410
 We have two and a half years ago. 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.880
 street is not easy to get is so much 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.669
 difficult to score, I think one of the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.950
 most difficult things have and is a mixture 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.930
 of several different types 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.030
 so that 's why it 's so hard for you 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.460
 get it covered net or by my 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.260
 hair that you think a girl 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.879
 that was longer have to keep in mind is 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.960
 truth are two things 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.780
 It is from this that your government will 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.379
 second vote also has in mind that 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.440
 You need to take care of the shampoo hair. 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.449
 season hair with body so i use 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.760
 this network that it is one of 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.070
 favorite is collor ex take 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.710
 then it protects agreement 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.170
 inside the wire leaving me to vote 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.420
 Alternate step the hair accustom much 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.770
 People say it's silly but it's my give. 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.960
 Right, I do. 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.720
 I use this one here in the house that is the 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.850
 cap time program i'm opting for 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.729
 use mask prevents conditioner 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.520
 This mask is emma from my favorites 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.829
 so June changing makeup has color 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.170
 It gets better because it does not stay, I guess. 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.960
 that everything can, but there are things that 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.890
 They are even better for example colors 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.290
 hotter 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.750
 so let's put it instead of using a 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.610
 It 's a little grayish, that's a little 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.000
 Closer, I'm going to wear more clothes. 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.540
 reddish lips I love lipstick 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.049
 colorful then away pink love red 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.050
 orange and very like to do in 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.330
 colorful 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.490
 so when I do I always love running 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.560
 to do with spider so the orange step 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.990
 I do not know if I told you to talk 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.910
 orange story in the eye I found one 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.940
 used in recent orange pitch in the 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.160
 eye is the ideal look is more secure 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.340
 always use the trailer right? 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.400
 on the eyelid you will be able to avoid 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.890
 oiliness and also make your 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.800
 Shadow does not want Kelly 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.130
 then I will the potential to deposit 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.260
 shadow here is harder and he 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.360
 More intense, I'll use with 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.400
 this tone is more pearly here 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.980
 I like to pass that pearly tone there 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.230
 that more illuminating always in the corner 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.950
 Internal eye then takes some of 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:43.060
 from the outer corner of the 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.220
 moving eyelid and comes up 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.470
 stay that tick mark so I go 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.830
 get a brush that the chubby one here 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.230
 that is to disappear and then I'll do that 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.390
 movement as if it were an arc like that. 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.820
 neighborhood you come there you take all this 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.190
 excess of shadow that is in the field and there 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.709
 to mix the two colors to stay the 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.540
 divided things that is not cool you 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.560
 will make this move from above to 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.620
 low 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.720
 well this first part is easy then 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:15.610
 You can leave home already if you 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:18.040
 You want to leave it looking like this but it 's used 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.140
 I always like this color here, this one. 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.230
 color is cool to see and ice because it does not 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.230
 It gets so heavy so there you can 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.330
 here at the root at the root of the 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.520
 lashes think as if 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.370
 passing an eye pencil and a half to the 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.820
 means do not come in here not to close 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:40.450
 the eye and there you want you can pass 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:43.330
 this same color รณ narrar zinha of the eyelashes 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.150
 Just in the good corner, this is the base. 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.970
 Then for example, I'm going to get shade. 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.550
 black 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:53.930
 to meet if you are not dull 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:58.310
 and then you will come upon that color 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:00.380
 eggplant I used, see how 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.230
 it gets stronger as well as the orange it 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.540
 It exists but you do not get to see a 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.200
 orange you actually see a gradient 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.200
 pretty
