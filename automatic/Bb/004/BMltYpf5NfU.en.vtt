out a lot more it's not a natural type

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.220 
out a lot more it's not a natural type
of<00:03:48.500> setting<00:03:48.980> powder<00:03:49.370> it<00:03:49.940> kind<00:03:50.720> of<00:03:50.810> comes<00:03:51.080> off

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
of setting powder it kind of comes off

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.140 
of setting powder it kind of comes off
shimmering<00:03:51.860> and<00:03:51.920> in<00:03:52.070> pictures<00:03:52.610> as<00:03:52.790> well<00:03:53.000> it

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
shimmering and in pictures as well it

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.000 
shimmering and in pictures as well it
doesn't<00:03:53.330> look<00:03:53.540> too<00:03:53.720> shimmering<00:03:54.170> you<00:03:54.710> know<00:03:54.800> in

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
doesn't look too shimmering you know in

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.150 
doesn't look too shimmering you know in
person<00:03:55.400> but<00:03:56.300> even<00:03:56.750> as<00:03:56.870> you<00:03:57.290> saw<00:03:57.590> when<00:03:57.860> I<00:03:57.890> was

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
person but even as you saw when I was

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.460 
person but even as you saw when I was
dusting<00:03:58.700> off<00:03:58.910> the<00:03:59.120> powder<00:03:59.360> I<00:03:59.720> guess<00:04:00.140> it<00:04:00.260> got<00:04:00.440> a

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
dusting off the powder I guess it got a

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.730 
dusting off the powder I guess it got a
little<00:04:00.740> bit<00:04:01.010> of<00:04:01.280> blotchiness<00:04:02.440> some<00:04:03.440> of<00:04:03.560> it

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
little bit of blotchiness some of it

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.010

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
makeup yeah I could try using a

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.440 
makeup yeah I could try using a
different<00:04:15.140> technique<00:04:15.800> but<00:04:16.430> I<00:04:16.700> wanted<00:04:17.090> to<00:04:17.150> use

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
different technique but I wanted to use

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.060 
different technique but I wanted to use
it<00:04:17.570> the<00:04:17.690> same<00:04:17.870> way<00:04:18.049> I<00:04:18.080> use<00:04:18.410> my<00:04:18.440> Ben<00:04:18.799> Nye<00:04:19.040> banana

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
it the same way I use my Ben Nye banana

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.150 
it the same way I use my Ben Nye banana
powder<00:04:19.670> and<00:04:20.180> it<00:04:20.600> just<00:04:20.810> didn't<00:04:21.230> live<00:04:21.470> up<00:04:21.680> to<00:04:21.739> the

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
powder and it just didn't live up to the

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.880 
powder and it just didn't live up to the
hype<00:04:22.340> it<00:04:22.580> didn't<00:04:22.910> do<00:04:23.570> anything<00:04:23.990> for<00:04:24.260> me<00:04:24.530> at<00:04:24.710> all

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
hype it didn't do anything for me at all

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.680 
hype it didn't do anything for me at all
really<00:04:25.280> and<00:04:25.460> it<00:04:25.880> might<00:04:26.060> work<00:04:26.210> for<00:04:26.420> someone

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
really and it might work for someone

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.690 
really and it might work for someone
who's<00:04:26.870> not<00:04:27.080> my<00:04:27.350> skin<00:04:27.740> tone<00:04:27.980> or<00:04:28.220> if<00:04:28.340> you<00:04:28.460> use<00:04:28.670> a

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.360 
who's not my skin tone or if you use a
different<00:04:28.940> technique<00:04:29.450> but<00:04:30.080> I<00:04:30.410> wanted<00:04:31.040> to<00:04:31.100> try

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
different technique but I wanted to try
