00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.209
 the southern end of the city lived one of 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.490
 the great urban revolutions 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.349
 of the 20th century luis barragán promoted the 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.360
 creation of a fractionation in this 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:24.200
 area that would incorporate the same style 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.060
 from 1948 dozens were built 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.149
 of houses with architectural ideas 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.619
 practically unpublished in the gardens 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:32.390
 of the scree congregated the great 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.040
 architects of the era founded on 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.690
 volcanic rocks was a novelty 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.489
 fractionation of mansions and stars 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.879
 say welcome to the city of mexico 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.879
 in time 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.730
 the publicity of the time faced the 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.100
 challenge not to attract customers with old 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.930
 mansions but with homes that broke 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.629
 radically with the traditional concept 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.670
 of luxury in addition to having a pool 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.799
 these houses offered the privilege of 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.780
 privacy in family with different 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:03.879
 areas for both coexistence and 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.649
 for loneliness some designs 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.600
 they reflected the taste for technology 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:11.320
 like this structure in the form of 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.330
 television in these aerial photos it 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.429
 can see the beginnings of the scree with 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.350
 the streets barely traced on the rock 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:20.110
 a couple of houses were built 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.360
 shows the font 140 is the work of Luis 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.460
 barragán and max cetto while that of 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.190
 crater 115 was made by jaime 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.800
 ceballos other examples are found 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.229
 modified or the house has disappeared 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.799
 Chávez pawn in the street of Farallón was 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.929
 designed by artigas in 1950 few years 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.549
 later the architect himself projected 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:42.520
 the homes of jose alberto bustamante 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.500
 in water and stanley reason in the closed 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.240
 of the disc while manuel rose in 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.909
 built the residence of silvia pinal 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.460
 on Avenue of the sources for 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.850
 70s the inhabited area expanded towards 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.830
 the south near the new peripheral ring 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.600
 the characteristic functionalism is 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.610
 incorporated the petrified lava of 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.369
 hitler volcano that had changed the 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.259
 landscape almost two thousand years before the 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.899
 streets take us back to the origin with 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:11.200
 names like for jon crater frost 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:13.000
 water cliff or fire and its location offers 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.170
 a privileged view towards the southwest 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.170
 from the mexico valley 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.069
 to the Galvez house built by Antonio 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.629
 attolini in 1960 is an example of the 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.400
 characteristic architecture of 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:29.040
 gardens of the scree in addition to 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.870
 stay in very good condition to the south 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.750
 of the fractionation is the house 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.930
 pérezcano work by josemaría buendía was 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.090
 finished in 1968 and stands on a 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.130
 highest volcanic stone block 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.400
 that the surrounding land 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.960
 there are wide corridors and areas bathed 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.060
 intensely by light 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.630
 The house Buendia was built by the 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.340
 same architect in 1959 the circles of 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.800
 the entry that are repeated in others 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.840
 corners welcome visitors 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.240
 just like a large cantilevered balcony 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.340
 inside there was a small 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.330
 pond to the center of the lit room 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.520
 by a skylight 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.260
 the arturo quintana house was built 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.180
 in a field that had previously been 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.460
 used as recreational site the 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.260
 Quintana family was numerous so 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.100
 here we distinguish several areas for 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.140
 the daily coexistence was designed in 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.060
 1965 by augusto h álvarez the architect 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.350
 of the Latin American tower with a 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.350
 clear influence of le corbusier 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.930
 at number 240 of the street of the disc 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.180
 was the house of doctor federico gómez 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.690
 founder of the children's hospital of mexico 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.140
 had been built in 1952 on a 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.220
 land of almost 10,000 square meters 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.630
 characteristic that turned it into a 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.280
 of the most publicized of the 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.380
 division 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.690
 is remembered for having been the location 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.220
 from the innocent film of Roger to 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.520
 gonzález with a script by luis alcoriza 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.110
 shot in the mid- 50s was one 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.390
 of the last films of the idol of 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.209
 mexico pedro infant who shares 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.800
 credits with silvia pinal the sequence 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.260
 initial shows the welcome sign 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.360
 to the fractionation the house gómez was 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.760
 work of francisco artigas with elements 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.220
 of ceramic and mural painting and it was demolished 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.850
 in 2004 to lift in its place a 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.850
 condominium 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.820
 mathias goeritz very soon joined the 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.310
 plastic adventure of the gardens of the 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.410
 scree on behalf of his friend Luis 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.390
 barragán gates a version of 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.640
 his wounded animal that became the 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.110
 symbol of this modern neighborhood in 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.690
 the gardens of the scree of san angel 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.790
 it seems that there are still echoes of that 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.910
 idea a mixture of elegance and 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.170
 reactivity part of the heritage 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.970
 artistic of the scree has been 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.590
 replaced by house without identity but 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.480
 many neighbors have known how to preserve their 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.410
 home see you in the next capsule of 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.410
