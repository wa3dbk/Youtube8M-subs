begin this video with a look at another
watch

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
watch

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.749 
watch
on<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.650> channel<00:00:14.009> now<00:00:14.099> we've<00:00:14.280> covered<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.610> few

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
on the channel now we've covered a few

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.620 
on the channel now we've covered a few
watches<00:00:15.089> so<00:00:15.299> far<00:00:15.599> but<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:17.449> this<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:18.600> a

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
watches so far but this is this is a

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.580 
watches so far but this is this is a
different<00:00:19.140> watch

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
different watch

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.880 
different watch
it's<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.539> watch<00:00:21.539> that<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:22.080> classed<00:00:22.619> as<00:00:22.859> a

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
it's a watch that I classed as a

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.769 
it's a watch that I classed as a
connected<00:00:23.400> watch<00:00:23.580> so<00:00:23.789> at<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:23.970> moment<00:00:24.150> you

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
connected watch so at the moment you

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.089 
connected watch so at the moment you
know<00:00:24.900> broadly<00:00:25.170> speaking<00:00:25.560> there<00:00:25.890> are<00:00:25.980> two

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
know broadly speaking there are two

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.519 
know broadly speaking there are two
categories<00:00:26.420> and<00:00:27.420> what<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.599> mean<00:00:27.900> by<00:00:28.109> connected

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
categories and what I mean by connected

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.370 
categories and what I mean by connected
watch<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:29.119> it's<00:00:30.119> different<00:00:30.510> from<00:00:30.689> SmartWatch

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
watch is it's different from SmartWatch

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.100 
watch is it's different from SmartWatch
because<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:31.890> refers<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.340> watches<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.930> are

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
because it refers to watches that are

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.260 
because it refers to watches that are
limited<00:00:34.739> only<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.160> giving<00:00:35.550> notification

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
limited only to giving notification

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.780 
limited only to giving notification
functions<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.649> Kenneth<00:00:37.980> Cole<00:00:38.219> connect

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
functions and the Kenneth Cole connect

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.139 
functions and the Kenneth Cole connect
falls<00:00:39.180> precisely<00:00:40.079> into<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:41.040> category<00:00:41.280> now

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
falls precisely into this category now

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.850 
falls precisely into this category now
let's<00:00:42.329> start<00:00:42.570> off<00:00:42.660> talking<00:00:42.690> about<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.500> design

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
let's start off talking about the design

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.520 
let's start off talking about the design
so<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.579> connector<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.000> large<00:00:45.270> it's<00:00:45.719> very

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
so the connector is large it's very

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.639 
so the connector is large it's very
large<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:47.370> comes<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.879> at<00:00:48.120> 47<00:00:48.750> millimeters<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.530> a

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
large it comes in at 47 millimeters in a

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.740 
large it comes in at 47 millimeters in a
stainless<00:00:49.920> steel<00:00:50.070> case<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.820> then<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.539> have

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
stainless steel case and then you have

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.310 
stainless steel case and then you have
this<00:00:51.960> rubber<00:00:52.680> strap<00:00:53.070> option<00:00:53.579> with<00:00:54.000> an<00:00:54.329> inlay

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
a leather feature and it's comfortable

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.460 
a leather feature and it's comfortable
on<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.840> wrist<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.350> looks<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.250> feels<00:01:02.430> really

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
on the wrist it looks and feels really

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.660 
on the wrist it looks and feels really
comfortable<00:01:04.470> given<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.280> it's<00:01:05.400> quite<00:01:05.640> a

large<00:01:05.970> size<00:01:06.810> watch<00:01:07.200> on<00:01:08.040> my<00:01:08.280> wrist<00:01:08.340> which<00:01:08.700> is

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
large size watch on my wrist which is

Android or iPhone were completely

Android or iPhone were completely
different<00:02:39.750> there<00:02:40.740> were<00:02:40.860> many<00:02:41.520> more<00:02:41.820> options

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
different there were many more options

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.780

though<00:02:42.570> there<00:02:42.750> was<00:02:42.840> still<00:02:42.960> limited<00:02:43.790> with

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
though there was still limited with

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.250 
though there was still limited with
connecting<00:02:45.270> this<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.660> an<00:02:45.810> Android<00:02:46.200> smartphone

connecting this to an Android smartphone

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.160 
connecting this to an Android smartphone
but<00:02:47.220> with<00:02:47.340> an<00:02:47.460> iPhone<00:02:47.820> really<00:02:48.210> they<00:02:48.690> were<00:02:48.750> very

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
but with an iPhone really they were very

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.350 
but with an iPhone really they were very
very<00:02:49.260> limited<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:50.100> I<00:02:50.340> think<00:02:50.610> that's<00:02:50.790> down<00:02:51.030> to

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
very limited and I think that's down to

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.810 
very limited and I think that's down to
the<00:02:51.870> fact<00:02:52.170> that<00:02:52.320> you<00:02:52.500> know<00:02:52.650> apparently<00:02:53.460> there

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
the fact that you know apparently there

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.420 
the fact that you know apparently there
are<00:02:53.850> some<00:02:53.970> restrictions<00:02:54.630> from<00:02:54.870> Apple<00:02:55.430> so

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
are some restrictions from Apple so

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.880 
are some restrictions from Apple so
that's<00:02:56.700> something<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.060> be<00:02:57.240> aware<00:02:57.270> of<00:02:57.540> now<00:02:58.260> it

that's something to be aware of now it

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.860 
that's something to be aware of now it
