 but I have a fire like this 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.840
 so the fire looks like whom it fades away and 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:44.190
 so we just need to throw in it 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:48.360

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.490
 here are side by side we throw them and we already 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.950
 we can make a fair pit they are postponed 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.470
 pebbles the fire gets better he 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.100
 longer burning now so that we with you 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.470
 to make 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.320
 tripod for frying or we will need 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.689
 three sticks we also throw side by side on 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.450
 key button and throw one there 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.810
 rope to tie and press fairs peter 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.329
 we have a tripod like this 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.850
 you can hang her crabs and go there 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.159
 swim and then take away the crab he already 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.650
 will be fried but sometimes there are bugs 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.240
 This crab is not no shit there goes 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.549
 so I will not show it 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.070
 because it can all impose 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.740
 let's go look for a shark 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.930
 go to sea right on the belt 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.030
 it is advisable to swim somewhere far away 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.890
 the shark for some reason nailed the shore when 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.219
 she is dying 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.079
 it is done on purpose or not i'm a heather 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:00.869
 so we are sailing up to that moment 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.540
 swim around the shore until we hear 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.180
 scary sounds 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.720
 after we heard scary 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.649
 sounds 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.690
 we already see a shark at the moment and can be 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.000
 kill need to make it strike at 10 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.790
 the shark will try to swim away from us she 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.040
 maybe not one but I have never 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.220
 not because did not attack shark therefore 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.870
 die from shark chance probably 0 so far 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.520
 in this game because the update can 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.940
 some are here now so that's Makar 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.770
 uncomplicated its volume and do not forget 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.430
 swim out because all the same we can 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.519
 die 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:39.540
 about all my killed take to the right button 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:41.550
 mouse and swim out quickly up 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.750
 he swims with not very fast quite 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.150
 as well as without her 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.489
 I had to go around the whole coast to 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.170
 find this damn shark and so we 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.959
 now 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.970
 trophy with ours with our trophy go 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:59.850
 I will show you a fire 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:02.010
 and send pieces of food to the fire already 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.989
 strong enough burned out we set 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.850
 our shark in here that's not important where 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.739
 and just start sculpt she 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.390
 falling apart it turns out four equal 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.170
 pieces which fits us in 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.660
 inventory pieces stays for some reason on 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.489
 the gallows though they should do it they 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.440
 must go there but for some reason they donâ€™t 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.350
 lays down so if you have a piece not 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.910
 lies down court then you just take it here 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.829
 so put on a simple fire 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.320
 therefore, it is desirable to have two fires 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.720
 right click it can be put 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:34.079
 from above and it remains as if on fire 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.200
 it is not clear how and he is fried but 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:39.180
 on this crap you can just hang cancer 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:44.190
 have krabata day and so here it is 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:47.040
 kill take and hang here all 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.320
 then take another or this one 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.700
 remove it is not always also removed it 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:56.230
 The bugs are already quite dark and and so 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.000
 here is preparing meat 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.310
 fry them you can eat they will 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.200
