00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.009

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.260
 book at the fair is at the Feast of the 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.150
 usp that happened at the beginning of 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.210
 December then at the beginning of this month here 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.250
 and I really liked the interested party 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.290
 so the book not only that the seller 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.299
 stayed there and told me several stories 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.690
 about it too interested me but 

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:50.479
 account of the height of the acioli 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.549
 same writer of the head of the saint who 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:55.970
 I already did a video for her for this 

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:58.010
 I'll leave that little box to that book. 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.949
 writer then she already won a jabuti 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.170
 in children's literature with another book 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.020
 that is not the one here but I did not have the 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.610
 poem format so I was with 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.240
 I found the thread most interesting. 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.740
 get a book with a narrative same 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.360
 is to begin to know the work 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.920
 her juvenile child for a narrative 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.939
 itself 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:23.420
 then in prose and then there the book like that 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:25.490
 no longer delighted the recording 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.710
 him by the book graph anyway 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.670
 He is super colorful. 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.530
 right and in there 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.329
 his cover sheet is also very 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.280
 beautiful we have a good ear 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:41.539
 who is going to start putting this 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:45.380
 the other austral line should have 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:47.560
 the writer but does not look at the child alba 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.780
 alone about it really has a 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.350
 Marolinha but it all as you can. 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.650
 see that it's all a good leaf 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:02.050
 cute and full of illustrations 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:05.240
 he has a very nice job and there 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:08.240
 history begins and history split 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.930
 in acts as if it were a time then they are 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.820
 three acts without any and it is good it is not a 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.980
 theater as I have already said is a narrative 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.950
 prose, you do not have much of your 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.720
 little novel that he has short and more 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.370
 story takes place inside a theater in the 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.260
 theater in Brazil that is the 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.400
 josÃ© de alencar theater that is located there 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.320
 fortress 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.270
 So, how's the story going to happen? 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.430
 within this environment she decides to do 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.080
 a joke and share it here 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.150
 was a great opera is a great 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.570
 love story to be told on the ceiling 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.300
 So you get the first one out of 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.850
 new to advantage the good guys and here comes the 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.280
 title of the chapters in this line 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.490
 cute little you all show little tala 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:53.750
 Generation, it 's really cool, and no 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:56.870
 half of those in history will appear 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.030
 theater photos today so there are several 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.820
 photos and stronger than the other thing 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.769
 that made me so desperate the book 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.480
 it was because we wanted to stop reading the 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.060
 first plane that had frequencies and 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.700
 Because it's beautiful, there are some very pictures. 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.900
 about specific parts of the 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.640
 theater 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.040
 so when she begins to describe the 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.890
 theater you really go anyway he is 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.959
 so she goes giving a lot of photos a lot 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.459
 cool the very fast tuning because 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.080
 plus a book while you should know 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:28.930
 that language already facilitates 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:32.180
 she has a recording is very good as 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.730
 photos and with those cover pages of 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.160
 start of super colorful chapter 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.800
 by crafting your book as it flows 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.950
 Okay, he's going to tell the story of a 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.440
 young lady mec anabelas the character 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:49.400
 main story and her father the 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:52.790
 restorer of works of art and he 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.320
 is the researcher who made several 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.540
 studies on the theatrical joseph of 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.000
 and it is called to restore the 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.630
 theater then you will spend many hours there 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.360
 inside 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.750
 and on one of these visits 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.250
 I did theater she was a girl dressed 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.500
 of dancing blue that no one else 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.300
 can see and she realizes that this 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.880
 Afternoon is actually a fantasy of mine. 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.670
 who lives inside that clear and 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.010
 She will start to know the story. 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.359
 this dancer she and a friend you 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.790
 What is the theater? 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:25.600
 then the two will unveil a great 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:29.710
 mystery mech so in history itself no 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:32.650
 there is nothing of our that average innovation 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.180
 it's still very cool history 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.390
 municipality that works with that vision 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.220
 that all the old theater has a 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.260
 great ghost story in a 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.850
 mystery story happening and why 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.130
 who does not want the Brazilian could not 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.540
 because we are from europe deserve the 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.669
 phantom of the opera 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.860
 so our theater here we also 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:54.490
 went through a great love story is 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:57.010
 fiction is a legend of the region and that it 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:01.180
 will give here in the school that is so a 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:03.669
 kick then I guess the ghost's plan 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.760
 It's very cool the complexities of 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.770
 This girl's family is hers because she 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.680
 did not have a mother and did not die when 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:14.350
 child is only created by this father's daughter 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.990
 only then does she have this relationship 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.540
 with the father the question of the mother not having 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.729
 family around and have to take 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.260
 school and friends and having that at work 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:25.030
 father has a lot of conflicts 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.860
 that are real mixed with 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.650
 a supernatural story to be cute 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:33.160
 and the book is very cool because it has a 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:35.919
 very nice depth 100 compared to 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.900
 to discuss the issue of death because the 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.580
 girl had to face death from 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.479
 pequeninho by death account 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.950
 mother and she does what for example is a 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:47.470
 Of the things that I found very cute. 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.930
 book is that the mother did not like to 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.600
 a certain flower that sprouts in the garden 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.820
 of the house and what the girl does she thinks 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.750
 everybody dies when people do not 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.300
 they actually die only through 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.440
 This is a ticket to a better place. 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.840
 that's how she calls heaven for 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.630
 work with a better place and she 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.490
 believes that everything that dies can 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.550
 take a message to that other location 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:13.550
 be animals be plants human beings 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.500
 so every little flower that dies she 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.270
 buries and with her on the ground a 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.190
 to the mother because she thinks 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.870
 that these tickets will arrive in a place 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.460
 better and mother to be able to know what 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.010
 it's happening with her it would be so much 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.200
 try to communicate neon with the mother who 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:30.169
 was lost then she is going to have 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.660
 some some really nice descriptions 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:35.360
 the perception of a 15-year-old girl 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:37.790
 on the subject as tense as loss 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.500
 of a relative of a loved one and she 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.660
 will work just with the ghost 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.100
 is what she will learn to 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.950
 working with her mother she will be able to 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.330
 use as the other person to also 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.400
 help this other person because the 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.720
 Yes, ghost came to ask a favor 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.120
 For ana bela. 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.040
 so it's very cool the story one 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.560
 show that story to be spent 

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.510

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.280
 and I want to have a daughter now 

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.440
 People look very big in this line. 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.330
 with my daughter then you will not 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.600
 It's going to take a while, I'll go. 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:10.310
 is to use my goddaughter who will suffer 

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.200
 a little of my hand in the books 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.150
