00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:08.440
 was delivering Dominguez entered the 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.930
 criminal offense but the criminal for the 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.389
 central rosario the araujo pp came 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.250
 not taking the honey player 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.910
 the referee near the action did not hesitate 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:21.640
 and about 35 minutes there is criminal for the 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.999
 central rosary protests all the people 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.369
 of lanús but there is the decision of 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:29.630
 referee let's see the play comes the 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.290
 ball to the center 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:36.300
 has not taken from above 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.300
 there goes to rubén to 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.480
 rosariocentral 37 minutes of the second 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.480
 weather 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.440
 just the result 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.510
 and I think we did not make a big game 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.910
 but we were always looking good 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.440
 it always happens every one starts at this 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.730
 time always complains 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.230
 now it seems that light has also 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.390
 I have not bought a long time 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.800
 position in effort we made the effort 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.590
 we put everything we had to 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.710
 look it a shame but good we have 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.750
 what 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.119
 we have to try to speed up a 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.290
 little bit the game we are going but 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.720
 I think you also will not 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.550
 Each bow throw is 23 minutes per 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.680
 I'm lucky that he learned the light 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.270
 long ago I have to dial in the 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.009
 protest was almost always percent 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.869
 makes the ctv and active for that because the 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.960
 plane did not move the move 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.300
 let's find it seems to me that I already tell you 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.690
 We did not do the game we prepared 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:50.390
 It seems that it does not hurt to have a goal 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:52.640
 of bow is very very basic but good 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.159
 we did not break everything on the outside what 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.960
 we should have arrived and good 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.600
 let's go find it we throw everything 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.030
 that we had as I told you before everything 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.200
 that we had on offense 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.150
 although on river and independent that 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.970
 adjust those things that we mark that 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.160
 we keep working 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.849
 what are we going to continue to look for 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.849
 the results everywhere that sure 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.849
 the
