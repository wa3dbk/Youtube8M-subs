that's<00:00:16.379> possible<00:00:16.829> well<00:00:17.429> how<00:00:17.699> do<00:00:17.759> we<00:00:17.880> do<00:00:18.060> that

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
that's possible well how do we do that

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.390 
that's possible well how do we do that
we're<00:00:18.599> some<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.960> ways<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.980> problems

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
we're some of the ways and the problems

initially<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.470> the<00:00:37.500> booth<00:00:37.950> was<00:00:38.190> designed<00:00:38.580> to

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
initially the the booth was designed to

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.580 
initially the the booth was designed to
create<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.970> nice<00:00:39.150> clean<00:00:39.570> safe<00:00:39.930> place<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.440> pay

create a nice clean safe place to pay
car<00:00:41.000> unfortunately<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.090> doing<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.570> it

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
car unfortunately in doing that it

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.690 
car unfortunately in doing that it
created<00:00:43.140> some<00:00:43.350> things<00:00:43.380> that<00:00:44.220> when<00:00:44.400> we<00:00:44.520> move

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
created some things that when we move

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.550 
created some things that when we move
from<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.970> solvent<00:00:45.330> base<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.690> water<00:00:45.900> whatever

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.560 
from a solvent base to a water whatever

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.620 
from a solvent base to a water whatever
one<00:00:46.770> piece<00:00:46.920> paint<00:00:47.310> they<00:00:47.850> create<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.150> problem

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:48.630 
one piece paint they create a problem

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.510 
one piece paint they create a problem
and<00:00:48.750> allowing<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.350> happen<00:00:49.380> when<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.340> put

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
and allowing that to happen when you put

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.010 
and allowing that to happen when you put
a<00:00:50.550> car<00:00:50.820> instead<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.240> paint<00:00:51.480> booth<00:00:51.630> there's<00:00:51.960> a

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
a car instead of a paint booth there's a

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.840 
a car instead of a paint booth there's a
laminar<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.530> boundary<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.010> air<00:00:53.220> that

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
air that when waterborne paint the water

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.280 
air that when waterborne paint the water
that<00:01:02.280> escapes<00:01:02.700> from<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:02.960> transfers<00:01:03.960> into

that boundary layer the laminar air

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.110 
that boundary layer the laminar air
traps<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.230> now<00:01:07.980> you've<00:01:08.159> got<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.370> problem<00:01:08.640> once

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 
traps it now you've got a problem once

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.030 
traps it now you've got a problem once
that<00:01:09.360> becomes<00:01:09.570> completely<00:01:10.409> saturated

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
that becomes completely saturated

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.460 
that becomes completely saturated
there's<00:01:11.640> no<00:01:11.880> place<00:01:12.150> for<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.420> air<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:13.290> move

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
there's no place for that air to move

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.890 
there's no place for that air to move
it's<00:01:13.830> trapped<00:01:14.220> along<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.610> surface<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.240> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
it's trapped along the surface and the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.440 
it's trapped along the surface and the
paint<00:01:16.530> simply<00:01:16.830> slows<00:01:17.040> down<00:01:17.250> stops<00:01:17.460> drying<00:01:17.909> so

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
paint simply slows down stops drying so

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.540 
paint simply slows down stops drying so
take<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> long<00:01:18.990> period<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.350> time<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.400> we've

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
take a long period of time so we've

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.920 
take a long period of time so we've
developed<00:01:20.850> products<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.570> there's<00:01:21.690> a<00:01:21.750> number

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
developed products and there's a number

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.780 
developed products and there's a number
of<00:01:21.990> different<00:01:22.260> ways<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.500> do<00:01:22.620> that<00:01:22.830> either<00:01:23.430> to

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
of different ways to do that either to

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.490 
of different ways to do that either to
wash<00:01:24.060> or<00:01:24.420> interrupt<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.020> air<00:01:25.170> that's

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
wash or interrupt the air that's

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.410 
wash or interrupt the air that's
creating<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.010> laminar<00:01:26.430> boundary<00:01:26.820> here<00:01:27.030> so

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
creating that laminar boundary here so

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.000 
creating that laminar boundary here so
what<00:01:27.570> we've<00:01:27.750> done<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.020> we've<00:01:28.350> taken<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.710> look<00:01:28.830> at

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
what we've done is we've taken a look at

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.500 
what we've done is we've taken a look at
the<00:01:29.100> different<00:01:29.430> ways<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.760> methods<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.150> do<00:01:30.330> that

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
the different ways of methods to do that

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.149 
the different ways of methods to do that
and<00:01:30.900> we've<00:01:31.080> come<00:01:31.320> up<00:01:31.350> with<00:01:31.470> what<00:01:31.770> we<00:01:31.860> call<00:01:31.890> the

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
and we've come up with what we call the

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.219 
and we've come up with what we call the
advanced<00:01:32.430> cure<00:01:32.700> system<00:01:33.120> the<00:01:33.720> advanced<00:01:34.110> care

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320

look at with paints is somewhere between

minutes<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:09.990> flash<00:02:10.259> time<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:11.190> that's<00:02:11.910> the

minutes of flash time so that's the

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.520 
minutes of flash time so that's the
advantage<00:02:12.480> that<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.690> have<00:02:12.900> it's<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.230> speed

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
advantage that you have it's the speed

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.230 
advantage that you have it's the speed
of<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.710> process<00:02:14.130> itself<00:02:14.460> now<00:02:14.910> when<00:02:15.030> we<00:02:15.090> talk

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
of the process itself now when we talk

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.730 
of the process itself now when we talk
about<00:02:15.270> you<00:02:15.600> mentioned<00:02:15.720> just<00:02:16.170> like<00:02:16.320> the<00:02:16.500> wash

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
about you mentioned just like the wash

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.070 
about you mentioned just like the wash
of<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.040> air<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.550> that<00:02:18.330> what<00:02:18.540> we've<00:02:18.660> typically

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
of the air is that what we've typically

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.050 
of the air is that what we've typically

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
that yes think of it this way is is if

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.240 
that yes think of it this way is is if
you<00:02:24.900> were<00:02:24.990> out<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.290> go<00:02:25.380> wash<00:02:25.590> your<00:02:25.800> car<00:02:26.010> and

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
you were out and go wash your car and

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.250 
you were out and go wash your car and
you<00:02:26.640> took<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.850> hose<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.780> you're<00:02:27.930> sitting<00:02:28.140> there

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
you took a hose and you're sitting there

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.360 
you took a hose and you're sitting there
holding<00:02:28.470> that<00:02:28.650> hose<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.130> you're<00:02:29.220> going<00:02:29.340> to

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
holding that hose and you're going to

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.010 
holding that hose and you're going to
watch<00:02:29.520> that<00:02:29.730> car<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.240> can<00:02:30.360> only<00:02:30.480> hit<00:02:30.630> so<00:02:30.690> much

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
watch that car you can only hit so much

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.420 
watch that car you can only hit so much
of<00:02:31.170> that<00:02:31.290> car<00:02:31.500> at<00:02:31.590> any<00:02:31.680> one<00:02:31.890> period<00:02:32.070> of<00:02:32.250> time

of that car at any one period of time
when<00:02:32.940> you're<00:02:33.090> trying<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.390> do<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:34.320> even

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
when you're trying to do that and even

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.350 
when you're trying to do that and even
if<00:02:34.650> you<00:02:34.740> had<00:02:34.920> multiple<00:02:35.430> hoses<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:35.820> solve<00:02:36.209> the

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
if you had multiple hoses you solve the

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.740 
if you had multiple hoses you solve the
problem

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
problem

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.570 
problem
every<00:02:37.140> time<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.470> hose<00:02:37.620> water<00:02:38.070> would<00:02:38.310> hit<00:02:38.459> each

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
every time the hose water would hit each

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.100 
every time the hose water would hit each
other<00:02:38.790> it<00:02:39.180> would<00:02:39.270> create<00:02:39.510> an<00:02:39.570> area<00:02:39.750> where<00:02:39.990> it

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
other it would create an area where it

other it would create an area where it
doesn't<00:02:40.290> dry<00:02:40.560> correctly<00:02:40.860> that's<00:02:41.340> just<00:02:41.520> a<00:02:41.610> wash

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
doesn't dry correctly that's just a wash

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.360 
doesn't dry correctly that's just a wash
of<00:02:41.970> air<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:42.780> if<00:02:43.050> you<00:02:43.260> interrupt<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.890> air<00:02:44.010> don't

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
the way I sit yeah the payer would come

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.979 
the way I sit yeah the payer would come
aside<00:03:05.010> and<00:03:05.220> he<00:03:05.310> would<00:03:05.430> lay<00:03:05.670> down<00:03:05.700> a<00:03:05.850> base<00:03:06.750> layer

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
aside and he would lay down a base layer

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.900 
aside and he would lay down a base layer
of<00:03:07.140> paint<00:03:07.350> and<00:03:07.650> at<00:03:08.130> that<00:03:08.310> point<00:03:08.580> you<00:03:08.730> need<00:03:08.850> to

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
of paint and at that point you need to

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.580 
of paint and at that point you need to
flash<00:03:09.180> that<00:03:09.450> off<00:03:09.660> and<00:03:09.959> so<00:03:10.080> during<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.380> flash

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
flash that off and so during the flash

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.140 
flash that off and so during the flash
process<00:03:11.070> you<00:03:11.190> turn<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.489> advanced<00:03:11.760> skier<00:03:12.030> on

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
process you turn the advanced skier on

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.120 
process you turn the advanced skier on
the<00:03:12.510> boost<00:03:12.690> stays<00:03:12.900> running<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.590> air<00:03:13.860> that's

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
the boost stays running the air that's

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.710 
the boost stays running the air that's
moving<00:03:14.220> whether<00:03:14.640> it's<00:03:14.850> a<00:03:15.000> downdraft<00:03:15.390> or<00:03:15.690> a

cross draft or whatever airflow you have

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.979 
cross draft or whatever airflow you have
is<00:03:17.760> moving<00:03:18.150> in<00:03:18.239> a<00:03:18.300> direction<00:03:18.420> that<00:03:18.780> creates

that<00:03:19.050> laminar<00:03:19.440> boundary<00:03:19.739> air<00:03:19.950> we<00:03:20.430> simply<00:03:20.760> turn

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
that laminar boundary air we simply turn

on the advanced skier it's mounted high

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.490 
on the advanced skier it's mounted high
in<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.220> sprays<00:03:23.459> on<00:03:23.640> itself<00:03:23.940> that<00:03:24.209> air<00:03:25.019> flows

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.699 
in the sprays on itself that air flows
out<00:03:25.739> creates<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.580> wash<00:03:27.510> or<00:03:27.900> okay<00:03:28.260> it<00:03:28.440> creates

out creates a a wash or okay it creates

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.530 
out creates a a wash or okay it creates
a<00:03:28.799> an<00:03:29.040> interruption<00:03:29.459> of<00:03:29.700> that<00:03:29.880> air<00:03:30.090> as<00:03:30.269> it

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
a an interruption of that air as it

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.090 
a an interruption of that air as it
moves<00:03:30.570> across<00:03:30.810> and<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.560> laminar<00:03:31.830> boundary

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
moves across and the laminar boundary

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.160 
moves across and the laminar boundary
air<00:03:32.280> stops<00:03:32.549> stops<00:03:33.209> being<00:03:33.450> created<00:03:33.810> so<00:03:33.930> my

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
air stops stops being created so my

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.660 
air stops stops being created so my
system<00:03:34.590> looks<00:03:34.739> great<00:03:34.950> but<00:03:35.340> I<00:03:35.430> always<00:03:35.580> a

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
system looks great but I always a

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:36.620 
system looks great but I always a
painter<00:03:36.030> one<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.330> things<00:03:36.450> I've<00:03:36.600> been

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
painter one of the things I've been

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:37.910 
painter one of the things I've been
doing<00:03:36.989> over<00:03:37.080> the<00:03:37.230> last<00:03:37.260> couple<00:03:37.560> years<00:03:37.620> of<00:03:37.799> my

doing over the last couple years of my
waters<00:03:38.310> I've<00:03:38.549> been<00:03:38.670> getting<00:03:38.970> you<00:03:39.360> know<00:03:39.450> kind

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
waters I've been getting you know kind

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.970 
waters I've been getting you know kind
of<00:03:39.690> being<00:03:39.810> being<00:03:39.989> trained<00:03:40.350> for<00:03:40.620> my<00:03:40.739> air

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
of being being trained for my air

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.770 
of being being trained for my air
directly<00:03:41.370> on<00:03:41.700> what<00:03:41.910> I'm<00:03:42.000> doing<00:03:42.269> so<00:03:42.420> I<00:03:42.450> look<00:03:42.660> at

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
directly on what I'm doing so I look at

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.250 
directly on what I'm doing so I look at
my

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
my

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
three stands and I'm going low or high

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.429 
three stands and I'm going low or high
does<00:03:45.269> it<00:03:45.390> matter<00:03:45.540> if<00:03:45.659> you<00:03:45.780> wear<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.080> system<00:03:46.379> is

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:46.439 
does it matter if you wear the system is

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:47.869 
does it matter if you wear the system is
mounted<00:03:46.799> to<00:03:46.830> keep<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.099> air<00:03:47.220> moving<00:03:47.250> no<00:03:47.760> matter

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
mounted to keep the air moving no matter

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.819 
mounted to keep the air moving no matter
what<00:03:48.180> I'm<00:03:48.299> painting<00:03:48.569> a<00:03:48.780> rocker<00:03:49.049> or<00:03:49.409> even<00:03:49.680> up<00:03:49.799> to

what I'm painting a rocker or even up to

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.649 
what I'm painting a rocker or even up to
a<00:03:49.950> fender<00:03:50.280> no<00:03:50.700> it<00:03:50.849> doesn't<00:03:51.209> it<00:03:51.329> doesn't<00:03:51.450> make

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 
a fender no it doesn't it doesn't make

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:52.940 
a fender no it doesn't it doesn't make
any<00:03:51.750> difference<00:03:52.079> what<00:03:52.200> type<00:03:52.409> of<00:03:52.439> air<00:03:52.680> flow<00:03:52.890> you

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
any difference what type of air flow you

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.740 
any difference what type of air flow you
have<00:03:53.069> in<00:03:53.370> your<00:03:53.459> booth<00:03:53.610> as<00:03:53.819> well<00:03:53.970> all<00:03:54.510> we're

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
have in your booth as well all we're

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.360 
have in your booth as well all we're
trying<00:03:54.900> to<00:03:55.019> do<00:03:55.200> is<00:03:55.349> to<00:03:55.620> interrupt<00:03:55.860> the

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
trying to do is to interrupt the

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.610 
trying to do is to interrupt the
creation<00:03:56.879> of<00:03:57.060> laminar<00:03:57.569> and<00:03:57.659> boundary<00:03:57.900> air<00:03:58.110> so

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
creation of laminar and boundary air so

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.140 
creation of laminar and boundary air so
if<00:03:58.860> you're<00:03:59.069> painting<00:03:59.459> in<00:03:59.549> a<00:03:59.610> downdraft<00:03:59.909> for

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
if you're painting in a downdraft for

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.250 
if you're painting in a downdraft for
example<00:04:00.510> when<00:04:00.599> you're<00:04:00.720> painting<00:04:00.989> the<00:04:01.079> side

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
example when you're painting the side

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.289 
example when you're painting the side
the<00:04:01.470> belt<00:04:01.650> line<00:04:01.799> or<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:02.040> sill<00:04:02.250> of<00:04:02.430> that<00:04:03.060> car

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
the belt line or the sill of that car

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.569 
the belt line or the sill of that car
we're<00:04:03.810> going<00:04:03.930> to<00:04:04.019> aim<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.470> air<00:04:04.590> above<00:04:05.519> the

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
we're going to aim the air above the

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.509 
we're going to aim the air above the
just<00:04:06.299> above<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:06.720> top<00:04:06.900> of<00:04:07.049> the<00:04:07.110> car<00:04:07.319> that<00:04:07.950> from

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
just above the top of the car that from

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.280 
just above the top of the car that from
that<00:04:08.670> point<00:04:08.909> or<00:04:09.150> you<00:04:09.420> will<00:04:09.540> see<00:04:09.690> turbulent<00:04:10.200> air

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
that point or you will see turbulent air

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.630 
that point or you will see turbulent air
over<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.709> entire<00:04:10.950> surface<00:04:11.220> of<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.430> cover

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
over the entire surface of the cover

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.160 
over the entire surface of the cover
you'll<00:04:11.849> never<00:04:12.030> see<00:04:12.239> a<00:04:12.269> creation<00:04:12.750> of<00:04:12.870> laminar

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
you'll never see a creation of laminar

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.539 
you'll never see a creation of laminar
boundary<00:04:13.500> once<00:04:13.829> you<00:04:13.890> turn<00:04:14.040> you<00:04:14.159> advance<00:04:14.370> your

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
boundary once you turn you advance your

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.099 
boundary once you turn you advance your
system<00:04:14.849> on<00:04:14.970> that's<00:04:15.480> great<00:04:15.690> I<00:04:15.720> know<00:04:15.930> so

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
system on that's great I know so

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.599 
system on that's great I know so
basically<00:04:16.260> I<00:04:16.590> could<00:04:16.769> totally<00:04:16.919> eliminate<00:04:17.459> my

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
basically I could totally eliminate my

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.789 
basically I could totally eliminate my
swingarm<00:04:18.150> blowers<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:18.930> even<00:04:19.289> my<00:04:19.380> priests<00:04:19.620> and

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
swingarm blowers and even my priests and

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.170 
swingarm blowers and even my priests and
blowers<00:04:20.130> in<00:04:20.280> my<00:04:20.370> process<00:04:20.609> whether<00:04:21.000> we're

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
blowers in my process whether we're
