that HP just sold a ton of let's say had

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.070 
that HP just sold a ton of let's say had
some<00:00:23.220> print<00:00:23.789> quality<00:00:24.240> issues<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:24.810> weren't

some print quality issues that weren't

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.480 
some print quality issues that weren't
resolved<00:00:25.529> by<00:00:25.650> replacing<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.279> toner

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
resolved by replacing the toner

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.890 
resolved by replacing the toner
cartridge<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.119> were<00:00:27.240> coming<00:00:27.570> down<00:00:27.689> your

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
cartridge that were coming down your

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.019 
cartridge that were coming down your
paper<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:29.369> wanted<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.670> kind<00:00:29.939> of

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
paper and you wanted to kind of

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.060 
paper and you wanted to kind of
investigate<00:00:30.570> maybe<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.990> little<00:00:31.260> further<00:00:31.500> this

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
investigate maybe a little further this

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.610 
investigate maybe a little further this
is<00:00:32.250> something<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.579> can<00:00:32.759> do<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.870> most<00:00:34.350> likely

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
is something you can do and most likely

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.350 
is something you can do and most likely
it's<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.040> fusing<00:00:35.280> assembly<00:00:35.790> it's<00:00:35.940> actually

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
it's the fusing assembly it's actually

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.510 
it's the fusing assembly it's actually
the<00:00:36.570> sleeve<00:00:37.200> on<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.559> fuser<00:00:37.829> that's<00:00:38.129> probably

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
the sleeve on the fuser that's probably

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.280 
the sleeve on the fuser that's probably
got<00:00:38.730> some<00:00:38.940> wear<00:00:39.149> marks<00:00:39.510> or<00:00:39.660> maybe<00:00:39.809> it's<00:00:39.989> ripped

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
got some wear marks or maybe it's ripped

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.100 
got some wear marks or maybe it's ripped
or<00:00:40.500> torn<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:41.300> that<00:00:42.300> will<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.600> course<00:00:42.780> cause

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
or torn and that will of course cause

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.639 
or torn and that will of course cause
some<00:00:43.350> defects<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:45.079> will<00:00:46.079> require<00:00:46.379> the

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
some defects that will require the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.110 
some defects that will require the
fusing<00:00:46.950> assembly<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.370> be<00:00:47.399> replaced<00:00:47.850> let's

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
fusing assembly to be replaced let's

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.270 
fusing assembly to be replaced let's
let's<00:00:48.660> show<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:48.899> how<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.079> do<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.440> first

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
let's show you how to do this first

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.470 
let's show you how to do this first
thing<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.520> want<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.730> do<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.000> remove<00:00:51.300> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
thing you want to do is remove the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.410 
thing you want to do is remove the
connectivity<00:00:52.110> cables<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.710> power<00:00:53.149> cable<00:00:54.149> and

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
connectivity cables the power cable and

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.209 
connectivity cables the power cable and
let<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.110> Machine<00:00:55.379> sit<00:00:55.590> for<00:00:55.770> maybe<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.980> couple

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
let the Machine sit for maybe a couple

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.160 
let the Machine sit for maybe a couple
minutes<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:57.090> can<00:00:57.239> remove<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.660> paper<00:00:57.809> tray<00:00:57.960> if

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
minutes you can remove the paper tray if

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.130 
minutes you can remove the paper tray if
you'd<00:00:58.350> like<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:59.250> really<00:00:59.399> not<00:00:59.520> necessary<00:01:00.210> and

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
you'd like it's really not necessary and

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.139 
you'd like it's really not necessary and
all<00:01:01.890> we're<00:01:02.160> going<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.340> need<00:01:02.489> today<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.940> really

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
all we're going to need today is really

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.910 
all we're going to need today is really
just<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.510> number<00:01:03.539> two<00:01:03.930> phillips<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.739> can

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
just a number two phillips and you can

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.899 
just a number two phillips and you can
use<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.150> small<00:01:06.150> pair<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.450> needlenose<00:01:06.930> also<00:01:07.909> but

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
use a small pair of needlenose also but

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.609 
use a small pair of needlenose also but
this<00:01:09.150> procedure<00:01:09.540> really<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.930> takes<00:01:10.229> just<00:01:10.470> a

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
this procedure really it takes just a

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.620 
this procedure really it takes just a
few<00:01:10.799> minutes<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:12.030> we're<00:01:12.180> going<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.330> work<00:01:12.479> from

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
few minutes and we're going to work from

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.880 
few minutes and we're going to work from
the<00:01:12.780> back<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.170> machine<00:01:13.470> now<00:01:13.619> in<00:01:13.770> this

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
the back of the machine now in this

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.960 
the back of the machine now in this
machine<00:01:15.350> each<00:01:16.350> p<00:01:16.680> requires<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.369> front<00:01:17.670> door

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
machine each p requires the front door

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.410 
machine each p requires the front door
to<00:01:18.330> be<00:01:18.479> shut<00:01:18.930> when<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.530> remove<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.009> fuser

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
to be shut when you remove the fuser

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.789 
to be shut when you remove the fuser
reason<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.869> fuser<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.290> camming

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
reason is this the fuser is a camming

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.760 
reason is this the fuser is a camming
fuser<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.930> when<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.020> open<00:01:25.320> up<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.530> toner

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
fuser and when you open up the toner

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.520 
fuser and when you open up the toner
door<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.820> fuser<00:01:27.240> will<00:01:27.479> actually<00:01:27.840> come<00:01:28.170> apart

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
door the fuser will actually come apart

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.980 
door the fuser will actually come apart
a<00:01:28.560> little<00:01:28.650> bit<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:29.009> help<00:01:29.159> with<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> paper<00:01:29.729> jam<00:01:30.090> so

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
a little bit to help with a paper jam so

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.510 
a little bit to help with a paper jam so
we<00:01:31.290> have<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.619> have<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.860> front<00:01:32.100> door<00:01:32.250> shut

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
we have to have the front door shut

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.770 
we have to have the front door shut
where<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.790> toner<00:01:32.970> cartridge<00:01:33.299> goes<00:01:33.509> in<00:01:33.659> in

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
where the toner cartridge goes in in

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.719 
where the toner cartridge goes in in
order<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.020> remove<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.619> fusing<00:01:35.369> assembly

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
order to remove the fusing assembly

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.460 
order to remove the fusing assembly
reason<00:01:36.540> being<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.840> I'm<00:01:36.960> going<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.140> try<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.290> move

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
reason being is I'm going to try to move

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.719 
reason being is I'm going to try to move
the<00:01:37.560> camera<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.920> show<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.369> because

that kind of idles back and forth and
it'll<00:05:26.960> touch<00:05:27.139> a<00:05:27.169> cluster<00:05:27.680> on<00:05:27.800> each<00:05:27.919> side<00:05:28.190> and

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
it'll touch a cluster on each side and

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.760 
it'll touch a cluster on each side and
as<00:05:28.729> the<00:05:28.880> machine<00:05:29.180> changes<00:05:29.360> to<00:05:29.690> directions<00:05:30.380> the

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
as the machine changes to directions the

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.290 
as the machine changes to directions the
gear<00:05:30.950> will<00:05:31.099> actually<00:05:31.430> shift<00:05:31.639> to<00:05:31.849> the<00:05:31.940> left<00:05:32.150> to

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
gear will actually shift to the left to

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.810 
gear will actually shift to the left to
the<00:05:32.330> right<00:05:32.419> and<00:05:32.870> it's<00:05:33.470> actually<00:05:33.889> not<00:05:34.099> it's

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
the right and it's actually not it's

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.760 
the right and it's actually not it's
kind<00:05:35.419> of<00:05:35.450> seizing<00:05:35.810> up<00:05:35.930> a<00:05:36.020> little<00:05:36.169> bit<00:05:36.349> and<00:05:36.560> it

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
kind of seizing up a little bit and it

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.719 
kind of seizing up a little bit and it
needs<00:05:36.979> a<00:05:37.039> little<00:05:37.250> lubricant<00:05:37.639> up<00:05:37.760> at<00:05:37.880> the<00:05:37.970> top

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
needs a little lubricant up at the top

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:41.860 
needs a little lubricant up at the top
alright<00:05:40.729> let's<00:05:40.940> plug<00:05:41.150> in<00:05:41.270> all<00:05:41.419> these<00:05:41.510> wiring

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
alright let's plug in all these wiring

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.310 
alright let's plug in all these wiring
harnesses<00:05:43.120> as<00:05:44.120> I<00:05:44.330> said<00:05:44.539> before<00:05:44.690> you<00:05:44.990> could<00:05:45.110> use

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
harnesses as I said before you could use

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.020 
harnesses as I said before you could use
a<00:05:45.349> little<00:05:45.530> pair<00:05:45.770> of<00:05:45.800> needlenose<00:05:46.550> and<00:05:46.910> that's

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
a little pair of needlenose and that's

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.100 
a little pair of needlenose and that's
what<00:05:47.150> I'm<00:05:47.210> going<00:05:47.300> to<00:05:47.419> do<00:05:47.479> right<00:05:47.630> now<00:05:47.690> on<00:05:47.960> this

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
what I'm going to do right now on this

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.700 
what I'm going to do right now on this
little<00:05:48.260> guy<00:05:49.720> sometimes<00:05:50.720> it<00:05:50.900> just<00:05:51.080> helps<00:05:51.289> my

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
little guy sometimes it just helps my

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.710 
little guy sometimes it just helps my
fingers<00:05:52.039> are<00:05:52.190> too<00:05:52.220> big<00:05:52.580> so<00:05:53.300> I<00:05:53.330> always<00:05:53.450> have<00:05:53.660> a

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
fingers are too big so I always have a

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.050 
fingers are too big so I always have a
hard<00:05:53.780> time<00:05:54.050> with<00:05:54.229> these<00:05:54.349> smaller<00:05:54.620> wires<00:05:55.060> the

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
hard time with these smaller wires the

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.420 
hard time with these smaller wires the
wiring<00:05:56.479> harness<00:05:56.780> on<00:05:56.900> the<00:05:56.990> right<00:05:57.169> it<00:05:58.130> doesn't

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
wiring harness on the right it doesn't

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.770 
wiring harness on the right it doesn't
give<00:05:58.520> you<00:05:58.610> a<00:05:58.639> lot<00:05:58.820> of<00:05:58.849> room<00:05:59.030> but<00:05:59.240> you<00:05:59.389> can<00:05:59.419> hold

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
give you a lot of room but you can hold

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.510 
give you a lot of room but you can hold
it<00:05:59.930> and<00:06:00.080> plug<00:06:00.260> in<00:06:01.060> plug<00:06:02.060> it<00:06:02.210> back<00:06:02.240> in<00:06:03.520> and

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
it and plug in plug it back in and

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.920 
it and plug in plug it back in and
that's<00:06:04.669> it<00:06:04.849> just<00:06:04.880> make<00:06:05.240> sure<00:06:05.389> your<00:06:05.539> wires<00:06:05.750> are

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
that's it just make sure your wires are

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.529 
that's it just make sure your wires are
out<00:06:06.050> of<00:06:06.169> the<00:06:06.229> way<00:06:06.349> okay<00:06:06.979> pretty<00:06:07.580> easy<00:06:07.820> let's

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:08.539 
out of the way okay pretty easy let's

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:10.120 
out of the way okay pretty easy let's
put<00:06:08.990> the<00:06:09.080> little<00:06:09.229> cover<00:06:09.440> plate<00:06:09.680> back<00:06:09.860> on<00:06:10.010> the

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
put the little cover plate back on the

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.770 
put the little cover plate back on the
left<00:06:10.310> side<00:06:10.490> start<00:06:11.000> at<00:06:11.120> the<00:06:11.210> top<00:06:11.360> it's<00:06:11.599> got<00:06:11.720> a

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.780 
left side start at the top it's got a

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.379 
left side start at the top it's got a
little<00:06:11.960> notch<00:06:12.080> in<00:06:12.110> it<00:06:12.760> get<00:06:13.760> it<00:06:13.910> underneath<00:06:14.150> the

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:14.389 
little notch in it get it underneath the

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:18.219 
little notch in it get it underneath the
plastic<00:06:16.419> and<00:06:17.419> then<00:06:17.599> just<00:06:17.780> make<00:06:17.930> sure<00:06:18.080> it's

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:18.229 
plastic and then just make sure it's

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:21.670 
plastic and then just make sure it's
flush<00:06:19.479> and<00:06:20.479> now<00:06:20.630> we<00:06:20.690> put<00:06:21.050> on<00:06:21.139> the<00:06:21.260> back<00:06:21.410> cover

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
flush and now we put on the back cover

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.860 
flush and now we put on the back cover
plate<00:06:21.949> again<00:06:22.190> remember<00:06:22.940> start<00:06:23.210> off<00:06:23.330> at<00:06:23.510> an<00:06:23.630> up

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:23.870 
plate again remember start off at an up

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.930 
plate again remember start off at an up
angle<00:06:24.320> get<00:06:24.530> the<00:06:24.650> top<00:06:24.889> in<00:06:25.190> first<00:06:25.400> underneath

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940 
angle get the top in first underneath

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.600 
angle get the top in first underneath
the<00:06:26.090> plastic<00:06:26.300> and<00:06:26.750> then<00:06:26.870> roll<00:06:27.139> it<00:06:27.320> down<00:06:27.610> just

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610 
the plastic and then roll it down just

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.570 
the plastic and then roll it down just
like<00:06:28.820> that<00:06:29.060> nice<00:06:29.599> and<00:06:29.630> easy<00:06:30.190> so<00:06:31.190> you<00:06:31.280> can<00:06:31.400> see

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 
like that nice and easy so you can see

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.800 
like that nice and easy so you can see
this<00:06:31.729> whole<00:06:31.910> repair<00:06:32.330> if<00:06:32.449> you<00:06:32.570> were<00:06:32.660> just

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:32.810 
this whole repair if you were just

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.690 
this whole repair if you were just
replacing<00:06:33.380> the<00:06:33.470> fuser<00:06:33.770> you<00:06:34.340> could<00:06:34.460> probably

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:34.700 
replacing the fuser you could probably

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.760 
replacing the fuser you could probably
do<00:06:35.180> this<00:06:35.330> in<00:06:35.390> a<00:06:35.599> matter<00:06:35.750> of<00:06:35.840> about<00:06:35.960> five<00:06:36.409> to<00:06:36.590> ten

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:36.770 
do this in a matter of about five to ten

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.450 
do this in a matter of about five to ten
minutes<00:06:37.130> really<00:06:37.490> not

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
minutes really not

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:48.529 
minutes really not
not<00:06:38.820> a<00:06:38.850> difficult<00:06:39.030> repair<00:06:46.639> and<00:06:47.639> at<00:06:48.090> that<00:06:48.270> point

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:48.539 
not a difficult repair and at that point

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:49.909 
not a difficult repair and at that point
in<00:06:48.630> time<00:06:48.780> now<00:06:49.050> what<00:06:49.229> you<00:06:49.350> can<00:06:49.440> do<00:06:49.560> is<00:06:49.680> pull<00:06:49.889> back

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:49.919 
in time now what you can do is pull back

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:52.550 
in time now what you can do is pull back
on<00:06:50.280> this<00:06:50.400> little<00:06:50.580> white<00:06:50.820> clip<00:06:51.810> right<00:06:52.020> here<00:06:52.080> for

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 
on this little white clip right here for

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.420 
on this little white clip right here for
the<00:06:52.620> camming<00:06:53.009> mechanism<00:06:53.550> of<00:06:53.669> the<00:06:53.789> fuser<00:06:54.090> and

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:55.430 
the camming mechanism of the fuser and

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.610 
the camming mechanism of the fuser and
roll<00:06:56.430> it<00:06:56.550> forward<00:06:56.900> just<00:06:57.900> lock<00:06:58.110> it<00:06:58.139> back<00:06:58.410> into

00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:58.620 
roll it forward just lock it back into

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.520 
roll it forward just lock it back into
place<00:06:58.910> push<00:06:59.910> your<00:07:00.090> back<00:07:00.210> door<00:07:00.449> on<00:07:00.630> it's<00:07:01.229> done

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:01.530 
place push your back door on it's done

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.749 
place push your back door on it's done
see<00:07:02.370> that<00:07:02.520> wasn't<00:07:02.669> too<00:07:02.910> bad<00:07:03.090> I<00:07:04.280> don't<00:07:05.280> check<00:07:05.460> my

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 
see that wasn't too bad I don't check my

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:07.370 
see that wasn't too bad I don't check my
videos<00:07:06.150> they<00:07:06.389> are<00:07:06.419> what<00:07:06.690> they<00:07:06.780> are<00:07:06.900> I<00:07:06.930> forget

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:07.380 
videos they are what they are I forget

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.650 
videos they are what they are I forget
things<00:07:07.560> sometimes<00:07:08.070> and<00:07:08.280> I<00:07:08.699> think<00:07:09.060> that's<00:07:09.210> the

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:09.660 
things sometimes and I think that's the

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:10.939 
things sometimes and I think that's the
way<00:07:09.750> should<00:07:09.930> be<00:07:10.050> shown<00:07:10.259> you<00:07:10.620> know<00:07:10.710> because

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:10.949 
way should be shown you know because

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:12.140 
way should be shown you know because
sometimes<00:07:11.070> you<00:07:11.310> can<00:07:11.430> make<00:07:11.550> some<00:07:11.729> mistakes<00:07:12.060> and

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:12.150 
sometimes you can make some mistakes and

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:13.820 
sometimes you can make some mistakes and
it's<00:07:12.330> good<00:07:12.479> to<00:07:12.570> see<00:07:12.600> that<00:07:12.870> stuff<00:07:13.080> so<00:07:13.590> you<00:07:13.650> can

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:13.830 
it's good to see that stuff so you can
