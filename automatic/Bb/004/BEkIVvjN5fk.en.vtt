it<00:01:22.610> took<00:01:22.790> us<00:01:22.909> 10<00:01:23.090> years<00:01:23.360> to<00:01:23.510> get<00:01:23.630> it<00:01:23.780> running<00:01:23.960> we

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
it took us 10 years to get it running we

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.950 
it took us 10 years to get it running we
now<00:01:24.800> have<00:01:25.009> four<00:01:25.340> of<00:01:25.460> them<00:01:25.610> at<00:01:26.330> the<00:01:26.540> rate<00:01:26.750> we're

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
now have four of them at the rate we're

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.230 
now have four of them at the rate we're
going<00:01:26.990> dad's<00:01:27.799> 68<00:01:28.430> and<00:01:28.610> that<00:01:28.700> makes<00:01:28.880> him<00:01:29.030> about

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
going dad's 68 and that makes him about

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.060 
going dad's 68 and that makes him about
88<00:01:29.659> by<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:29.900> time<00:01:30.080> we<00:01:30.170> get<00:01:30.259> the<00:01:30.409> last<00:01:30.590> one<00:01:30.830> done

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
88 by the time we get the last one done

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.620 
88 by the time we get the last one done
so<00:01:31.310> I<00:01:31.369> think<00:01:31.700> the<00:01:31.850> primary<00:01:32.030> beginning

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
so I think the primary beginning

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.280 
so I think the primary beginning
finished<00:01:34.000> we've<00:01:35.000> had<00:01:35.240> it<00:01:35.360> running<00:01:35.570> all<00:01:36.110> across

finished we've had it running all across

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.870 
finished we've had it running all across
