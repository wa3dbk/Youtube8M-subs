can see behind me the weather's not
ideal<00:00:53.590> at<00:00:53.860> all<00:00:54.130> and<00:00:54.489> actually<00:00:55.120> the<00:00:55.450> water

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
ideal at all and actually the water

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.390 
ideal at all and actually the water
levels<00:00:56.050> are<00:00:56.170> really<00:00:56.530> really<00:00:56.800> high<00:00:56.980> so<00:00:57.250> there's

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
levels are really really high so there's

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.520 
levels are really really high so there's
certain<00:00:57.640> places<00:00:57.730> we<00:00:58.090> can't<00:00:58.300> go<00:00:58.450> to<00:00:58.510> it's<00:00:59.290> just

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
certain places we can't go to it's just

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.010 
certain places we can't go to it's just
been<00:00:59.650> raining<00:00:59.830> here<00:01:00.130> for<00:01:00.370> weeks<00:01:00.610> and<00:01:00.970> yeah<00:01:01.720> so

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
been raining here for weeks and yeah so

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.660 
been raining here for weeks and yeah so
hopefully<00:01:02.770> it's<00:01:02.890> still<00:01:02.950> really<00:01:03.250> cool<00:01:03.460> in

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
hopefully it's still really cool in

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.040 
hopefully it's still really cool in
there<00:01:03.879> and<00:01:04.059> I<00:01:04.390> guess<00:01:04.540> there's<00:01:04.750> really<00:01:04.960> only

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
there and I guess there's really only

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:20.050 
there and I guess there's really only
one<00:01:05.260> way<00:01:05.410> to<00:01:05.530> find<00:01:05.770> out

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.600
