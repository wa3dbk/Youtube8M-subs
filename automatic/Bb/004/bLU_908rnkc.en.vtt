inside the Bell and it was lowered
underwater<00:01:14.659> the<00:01:15.350> air<00:01:15.500> pressure<00:01:15.890> inside<00:01:16.190> the

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
underwater the air pressure inside the

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.340 
underwater the air pressure inside the
Bell<00:01:16.790> was<00:01:17.090> made<00:01:17.360> the<00:01:17.510> same<00:01:17.750> as<00:01:17.960> the<00:01:18.140> pressure

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
Bell was made the same as the pressure

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.130 
Bell was made the same as the pressure
on<00:01:18.680> land<00:01:18.980> letting<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:19.820> divers<00:01:20.210> stay<00:01:20.420> safe<00:01:20.720> yet

need is a larger Bell an engine and an
air<00:01:36.020> cylinder<00:01:36.440> for<00:01:36.620> the<00:01:36.650> oxygen<00:01:37.070> then<00:01:37.820> we

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
air cylinder for the oxygen then we

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.550 
air cylinder for the oxygen then we
could<00:01:38.659> even<00:01:38.810> make<00:01:39.080> our<00:01:39.290> own<00:01:39.500> diving<00:01:40.190> motorbike

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
could even make our own diving motorbike

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.830 
could even make our own diving motorbike
what<00:01:42.560> are<00:01:42.650> we<00:01:42.770> waiting<00:01:43.100> for<00:01:43.130> let's<00:01:43.690> do<00:01:44.690> it

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.740 

I<00:01:49.640> wish<00:01:50.640> we<00:01:50.820> could<00:01:51.000> have<00:01:51.060> made<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.479> thing

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
I wish we could have made this thing

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.899 
I wish we could have made this thing
bigger<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:52.350> we<00:01:52.469> could<00:01:52.649> all<00:01:52.859> go<00:01:53.039> underwater<00:01:53.310> but

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
bigger so we could all go underwater but

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.730 
bigger so we could all go underwater but
the<00:01:54.030> fridge<00:01:54.270> was<00:01:54.539> too<00:01:54.719> small<00:01:55.049> well<00:01:55.530> there

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
the fridge was too small well there

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.590 
the fridge was too small well there
would<00:01:55.979> have<00:01:56.100> been<00:01:56.159> room<00:01:56.549> in<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.759> fridge<00:01:57.060> but

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
would have been room in the fridge but

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.630 
would have been room in the fridge but
you<00:01:57.840> insisted<00:01:58.409> on<00:01:58.530> keeping<00:01:58.740> ice<00:01:59.069> cream<00:01:59.460> in

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
you insisted on keeping ice cream in

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.539 
you insisted on keeping ice cream in
there<00:01:59.880> ready<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.869> go<00:02:01.140> underwater<00:02:01.439> how<00:02:02.340> come

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549

easier<00:02:14.549> than<00:02:14.670> riding<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.299> bicycle<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.019> even

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
easier than riding a bicycle and even

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.550 
easier than riding a bicycle and even
safer<00:02:17.099> because<00:02:17.670> underwater<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.959> move<00:02:19.140> slower

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
safer because underwater you move slower

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.890 
safer because underwater you move slower
than<00:02:19.769> in<00:02:20.129> the<00:02:20.220> air<00:02:20.400> man<00:02:21.060> there's<00:02:21.420> no<00:02:21.569> trees<00:02:21.870> to

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
than in the air man there's no trees to

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.430 
than in the air man there's no trees to
bang<00:02:22.290> into<00:02:22.500> out<00:02:23.190> of<00:02:23.400> my<00:02:23.579> way<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.660> baby<00:02:25.019> Beach

doing<00:02:29.099> a<00:02:29.489> science<00:02:29.760> experiment<00:02:30.299> and<00:02:30.720> I'm

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
doing a science experiment and I'm

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.410
