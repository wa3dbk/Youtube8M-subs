00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.379 

hey<00:00:00.599> what's<00:00:00.810> going<00:00:01.050> on<00:00:01.110> guys<00:00:01.290> so<00:00:01.589> I<00:00:02.240> seen<00:00:03.240> this

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
hey what's going on guys so I seen this

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.210 
hey what's going on guys so I seen this
come<00:00:03.600> up<00:00:03.750> every<00:00:03.870> now<00:00:04.080> and<00:00:04.259> then<00:00:04.380> and<00:00:04.680> I<00:00:04.799> figured

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
come up every now and then and I figured

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.509 
come up every now and then and I figured
I<00:00:05.670> should<00:00:06.180> probably<00:00:06.390> give<00:00:06.810> my<00:00:06.960> take<00:00:07.259> on<00:00:07.440> it

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:07.519 
I should probably give my take on it

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:10.060 
I should probably give my take on it
since<00:00:08.519> I<00:00:08.670> don't<00:00:08.730> think<00:00:09.059> I<00:00:09.150> ever<00:00:09.179> really<00:00:09.420> have

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.070 
since I don't think I ever really have

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.470 
since I don't think I ever really have
as<00:00:11.070> you<00:00:11.580> can<00:00:11.639> tell<00:00:11.700> by<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.000> title<00:00:12.210> of<00:00:12.389> the

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
as you can tell by the title of the

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.049 
as you can tell by the title of the
video<00:00:12.830> this<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:13.950> about<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.190> pro<00:00:14.400> point<00:00:14.429> system

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
video this is about the pro point system

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.769 
video this is about the pro point system
now<00:00:15.960> when<00:00:16.710> this<00:00:16.830> was<00:00:17.070> implemented<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:17.910> think<00:00:18.720> a

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
now when this was implemented I think a

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.640 
now when this was implemented I think a
lot<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:18.990> people<00:00:19.140> were<00:00:19.529> kind<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:19.800> just<00:00:19.859> like

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
lot of people were kind of just like

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.609 
lot of people were kind of just like
what's<00:00:22.650> so<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:23.760> can<00:00:24.240> now<00:00:24.390> be<00:00:24.720> considered<00:00:25.019> pro

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
what's so you can now be considered pro

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.900 
what's so you can now be considered pro
by<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.130> amount<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.210> points<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.900> have<00:00:28.910> that's

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
by the amount of points you have that's

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.440 
by the amount of points you have that's
stupid<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.949> for<00:00:31.949> me<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.070> still<00:00:32.610> reigns<00:00:32.969> very

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
stupid and for me that still reigns very

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.970 
stupid and for me that still reigns very
true<00:00:33.840> because<00:00:34.910> it's<00:00:35.910> almost<00:00:36.530> like<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.559> slap<00:00:37.950> in

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
true because it's almost like a slap in

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.160 
true because it's almost like a slap in
the<00:00:38.160> face<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.850> lot<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.750> lot<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
the face to a lot of the a lot of the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.130 
the face to a lot of the a lot of the
like<00:00:40.410> really<00:00:40.800> dedicated<00:00:41.460> players<00:00:41.750> that<00:00:42.750> have

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140

duty for call duty to to me those people

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.560 
duty for call duty to to me those people
are<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.890> pros<00:00:50.160> those<00:00:50.789> people<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.420> have

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570

really established themselves other pros

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.970 
really established themselves other pros
I<00:00:53.750> the<00:00:54.750> thing<00:00:54.930> about<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.320> like<00:00:55.860> I

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
I the thing about this is like I

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.639 
I the thing about this is like I
understand<00:00:56.460> like<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.760> tries<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.000> bring

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
understand like it tries to bring

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.720 
understand like it tries to bring
different<00:00:58.649> players<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.280> we<00:00:59.340> haven't<00:00:59.579> heard

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
different players that we haven't heard

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.549 
different players that we haven't heard
of<00:00:59.910> or<00:01:00.149> amateur<00:01:00.480> players<00:01:00.840> into<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.350> pro

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
of or amateur players into the pro

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.530 
of or amateur players into the pro
bracket<00:01:02.010> but<00:01:02.840> when<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:04.470> can<00:01:04.710> grind<00:01:05.070> 1v1<00:01:05.850> gun

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
bracket but when you can grind 1v1 gun

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.020 
bracket but when you can grind 1v1 gun
games<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.320> win<00:01:07.680> money<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.220> when<00:01:08.310> pro<00:01:08.549> points

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
games and win money and when pro points

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.480 
games and win money and when pro points
and<00:01:09.890> you<00:01:10.890> know<00:01:11.010> hypothetically

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
and you know hypothetically

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.190 
and you know hypothetically
theoretically<00:01:12.479> whatever<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.900> want<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.080> call

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
theoretically whatever you want to call

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.200 
theoretically whatever you want to call
it<00:01:13.460> become<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> pro<00:01:15.030> based<00:01:15.689> on<00:01:15.900> your<00:01:16.049> pro<00:01:16.290> points

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
it become a pro based on your pro points

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.719 
it become a pro based on your pro points
that<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.420> me<00:01:18.450> seems<00:01:18.930> absolutely<00:01:19.729> just

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
that to me seems absolutely just

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.560 
that to me seems absolutely just
preposterous<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.990> stupid<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.710> mean<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:24.360> thing

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
preposterous and stupid I mean the thing

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.929 
preposterous and stupid I mean the thing
about<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.960> system<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.530> like<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.040> get<00:01:26.640> that

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
about the system is like I I get that

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.520 
about the system is like I I get that
it's<00:01:27.180> not<00:01:27.840> it's<00:01:28.740> very<00:01:29.040> very<00:01:29.610> difficult<00:01:29.700> to

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
it's not it's very very difficult to

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.740 
it's not it's very very difficult to
make<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.560> system<00:01:32.100> that's<00:01:32.369> perfect<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.270> works

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
make a system that's perfect and works

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.429 
make a system that's perfect and works
extremely<00:01:34.530> well<00:01:35.180> an<00:01:36.180> extremely<00:01:36.750> fair<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.200> get

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
extremely well an extremely fair I get

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.069 
extremely well an extremely fair I get
that<00:01:37.650> no<00:01:38.130> one<00:01:38.670> could<00:01:39.270> just<00:01:39.329> out<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.840> gate

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
that no one could just out of the gate

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.810 
that no one could just out of the gate
make<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.380> system<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.890> works<00:01:40.950> great<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.640> mean

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
make a system that works great I mean

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.030 
make a system that works great I mean
that's<00:01:42.000> like<00:01:42.320> it's<00:01:43.320> like<00:01:43.470> if<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.770> start<00:01:44.009> your

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
that's like it's like if you start your

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.850 
that's like it's like if you start your
own<00:01:44.220> business<00:01:45.320> you're<00:01:46.320> going<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.560> implement

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
own business you're going to implement

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.770 
own business you're going to implement
things<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.520> think<00:01:47.850> at<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.149> time<00:01:48.180> are

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
things that you think at the time are

things that you think at the time are
going<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.140> be<00:01:49.290> great<00:01:50.070> everything's<00:01:50.549> gonna

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
going to be great everything's gonna

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.280 
going to be great everything's gonna
work<00:01:50.759> perfect<00:01:51.270> there<00:01:51.390> won't<00:01:51.540> be<00:01:51.630> any<00:01:51.780> problems

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
work perfect there won't be any problems

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.490 
work perfect there won't be any problems
dis<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:53.189> whatever<00:01:53.659> but<00:01:54.659> then<00:01:54.810> when<00:01:55.079> you

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
dis that whatever but then when you

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.649 
dis that whatever but then when you
actually<00:01:56.430> implement<00:01:56.729> implement<00:01:57.570> these

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
actually implement implement these

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.120 
actually implement implement these
things<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.170> these<00:01:58.320> thoughts<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.710> ideas<00:01:59.009> that

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
things and these thoughts and ideas that

you had you're a tall man these things

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.990 
you had you're a tall man these things
don't<00:02:01.439> work<00:02:01.619> or<00:02:01.890> they<00:02:02.189> don't<00:02:02.310> make<00:02:02.520> sense<00:02:02.820> or

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000
