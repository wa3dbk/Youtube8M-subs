00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.459 
want the voice to be black then you're
gonna<00:00:50.430> create<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.700> new<00:00:50.879> one<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.270> middle<00:00:51.600> it

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
gonna create a new one in the middle it

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.479 
gonna create a new one in the middle it
doesn't<00:00:52.739> really<00:00:52.829> matter<00:00:53.010> if<00:00:53.190> it's<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.460> know

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
doesn't really matter if it's you know

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.740 
doesn't really matter if it's you know
not<00:00:53.730> quite<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.090> middle<00:00:54.239> but<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.570> know

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
not quite in the middle but you know

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.900 
not quite in the middle but you know
sort<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.170> around<00:00:55.500> there<00:00:55.710> you're<00:00:56.460> gonna<00:00:56.550> drag

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
sort of around there you're gonna drag

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.889 
sort of around there you're gonna drag
the<00:00:57.300> black<00:00:57.510> like<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:59.300> so<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.329> sort<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.719> gets

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
the black like this so that sort of gets

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.680 
the black like this so that sort of gets
rid<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.289> area<00:01:01.649> like<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:01.890> I'm<00:01:02.219> gonna<00:01:02.690> get

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
rid of the area like that I'm gonna get

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.780 
rid of the area like that I'm gonna get
a<00:01:03.750> bit<00:01:04.049> further<00:01:04.260> now<00:01:05.100> these<00:01:05.220> two<00:01:05.489> things<00:01:05.670> in

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
a bit further now these two things in

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.789 
a bit further now these two things in
the<00:01:05.850> middle<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.150> changes<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.930> line<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
the middle that changes the line in the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.340 
the middle that changes the line in the
middle<00:01:07.920> there<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.549> know<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.760> brightness

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
middle there the you know the brightness

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.600 
middle there the you know the brightness
you<00:01:10.350> don't<00:01:10.560> need<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.979> there<00:01:11.250> if<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.490> don't

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
you don't need that there if you don't

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.030 
you don't need that there if you don't
want<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.450> just<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:13.229> know<00:01:13.350> put<00:01:13.530> them<00:01:13.680> in

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
want to so you just you know put them in

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.609 
want to so you just you know put them in
exactly<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.610> same<00:01:14.790> spot<00:01:15.150> place<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.110> know<00:01:16.229> out

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
exactly the same spot place you know out

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.630 
exactly the same spot place you know out
like<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:18.259> but<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.320> kind<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.009> like<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.220> there<00:01:20.490> so

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
like that but I kind of like it there so

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.340 
like that but I kind of like it there so
I'm<00:01:20.729> going<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.909> do<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.270> down<00:01:21.960> here<00:01:22.020> and

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
I'm going to do that down here and

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.780 
I'm going to do that down here and
turbulence<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:22.950> want<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.189> set<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.610> about

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
turbulence you want to set that to about

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.480 
turbulence you want to set that to about
fifty<00:01:24.330> octaves<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.560> like<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.890> keep<00:01:26.070> at<00:01:26.280> about

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
fifty octaves I like to keep at about

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.060 
fifty octaves I like to keep at about
four<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.909> half<00:01:27.140> scale<00:01:28.140> that's<00:01:28.740> just<00:01:29.009> you

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
four and a half scale that's just you

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.499 
four and a half scale that's just you
know<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.310> scale<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.820> it

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
know the scale of it

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.499 
know the scale of it
frequency<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.770> probably<00:01:32.670> best<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.390> know

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
frequency is probably best you know

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.480 
frequency is probably best you know
around<00:01:33.689> 50<00:01:34.140> I'm<00:01:34.290> going<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.560> put<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.770> 48<00:01:35.189> and

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
around 50 I'm going to put that 48 and

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.550 
around 50 I'm going to put that 48 and
see<00:01:36.090> this<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.420> sort<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.689> roundness<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.170> it

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
see this is sort of the roundness of it

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.499 
see this is sort of the roundness of it
for<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> good<00:01:38.189> turnout<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.909> should<00:01:39.060> put<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.329> to

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
for a good turnout you should put it to

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.620 
for a good turnout you should put it to
negative<00:01:40.409> two<00:01:40.619> but<00:01:41.070> again<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.520> can<00:01:41.670> mess

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
negative two but again you can mess

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.510 
negative two but again you can mess
around<00:01:42.659> with<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:42.990> all<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.320> want<00:01:43.590> also<00:01:44.310> make

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
around with that all you want also make

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.749 
around with that all you want also make
sure<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.850> check<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.180> luminance<00:01:45.600> box<00:01:45.869> here<00:01:46.140> so

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
sure you check the luminance box here so

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.359 
sure you check the luminance box here so
next<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:47.939> want<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.390> disable<00:01:49.350> specular<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.310> a

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
next you want to disable specular and a

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.550 
next you want to disable specular and a
naval<00:01:50.640> alpha<00:01:51.149> now<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:51.990> want<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.229> get<00:01:52.409> this

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
naval alpha now you want to get this

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.980 
naval alpha now you want to get this
drag<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.280> over<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.729> alpha<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.390> put<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.840> right

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
drag it over to alpha and put it right

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.899 
drag it over to alpha and put it right
there<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:56.719> that's<00:01:57.719> almost<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.860> for<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.490> now

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
there and that's almost it for that now

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.330 
there and that's almost it for that now
you<00:01:59.969> want<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.270> go<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.420> editor<00:02:00.960> click<00:02:01.619> animated

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
you want to go to editor click animated

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.280 
you want to go to editor click animated
preview<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:03.630> when<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:03.869> play<00:02:04.170> it

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
preview that is so when you play it

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.719 
preview that is so when you play it
through<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.590> timeline<00:02:04.860> you'll<00:02:05.280> actually<00:02:05.520> be

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
through the timeline you'll actually be

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.359 
through the timeline you'll actually be
able<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.119> see<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.990> animation<00:02:07.380> now<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:08.220> want

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
able to see the animation now you want

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.170 
able to see the animation now you want
to<00:02:08.459> drag<00:02:08.670> this<00:02:08.789> onto<00:02:09.030> your<00:02:09.149> plane<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:11.000> as<00:02:12.000> you

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
to drag this onto your plane and as you

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.030 
to drag this onto your plane and as you
can<00:02:12.330> see<00:02:12.569> we<00:02:12.870> have<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.080> lighting<00:02:13.349> effect

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
can see we have a lighting effect

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.600 
can see we have a lighting effect
just<00:02:14.310> render<00:02:14.579> that<00:02:14.730> out<00:02:15.200> looks<00:02:16.200> pretty<00:02:16.409> nice

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
just render that out looks pretty nice

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.059 
just render that out looks pretty nice
so<00:02:17.610> that's<00:02:18.390> for<00:02:18.689> the<00:02:18.810> settings<00:02:19.379> if<00:02:19.799> you<00:02:19.890> go

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
so that's for the settings if you go

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.630 
so that's for the settings if you go
back<00:02:20.280> here<00:02:20.840> you<00:02:21.840> can<00:02:22.379> play<00:02:23.159> around<00:02:23.280> with<00:02:23.519> this

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
back here you can play around with this

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.640 
back here you can play around with this
turbulence<00:02:24.329> inside<00:02:24.480> if<00:02:24.719> you<00:02:24.810> know<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.109> you

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
turbulence inside if you know the you

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.030 
turbulence inside if you know the you
know<00:02:25.680> how<00:02:25.920> wide<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.519> is<00:02:26.549> sort<00:02:27.120> of<00:02:27.590> octaves<00:02:28.590> also

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
know how wide it is sort of octaves also

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.800 
know how wide it is sort of octaves also
helps<00:02:29.340> with<00:02:29.430> around<00:02:29.790> honest<00:02:30.090> of<00:02:30.299> it<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.629> can

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
helps with around honest of it you can

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.360 
helps with around honest of it you can
see<00:02:31.049> there<00:02:31.439> it<00:02:31.620> doesn't<00:02:31.859> make<00:02:31.980> too<00:02:32.220> much

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
see there it doesn't make too much

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.280 
see there it doesn't make too much
difference<00:02:32.629> but<00:02:33.629> if<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:33.810> put<00:02:34.019> it<00:02:34.109> down<00:02:34.230> to

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
difference but if I put it down to

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.679 
difference but if I put it down to
absolute<00:02:34.500> zero<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:35.159> look<00:02:35.310> completely<00:02:35.689> crap

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:36.689 
absolute zero it look completely crap

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.089 
absolute zero it look completely crap
I'm<00:02:37.290> going<00:02:37.439> to<00:02:37.530> keep<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:37.799> it<00:02:37.890> for<00:02:38.040> a

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
I'm going to keep that it for a

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.539 
I'm going to keep that it for a
half-scale<00:02:39.000> sort<00:02:39.659> of<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.810> know<00:02:40.099> scale<00:02:41.099> of<00:02:41.400> it

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
half-scale sort of you know scale of it

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.699 
half-scale sort of you know scale of it
you<00:02:41.909> can<00:02:42.030> see<00:02:42.239> it<00:02:42.299> changes<00:02:42.689> every<00:02:42.959> time<00:02:43.200> if<00:02:43.560> I

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
you can see it changes every time if I

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.490 
you can see it changes every time if I
put<00:02:43.889> it<00:02:43.980> down<00:02:44.159> to<00:02:44.219> you<00:02:44.489> say<00:02:45.180> three<00:02:45.599> you<00:02:46.139> can<00:02:46.290> see

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
put it down to you say three you can see

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.199 
put it down to you say three you can see
it's<00:02:46.829> not<00:02:47.069> very<00:02:47.129> you<00:02:47.549> know<00:02:47.579> random<00:02:48.090> or

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
it's not very you know random or

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.119 
it's not very you know random or
anything<00:02:48.480> it's<00:02:48.720> just<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:48.989> straight<00:02:49.769> line<00:02:49.799> so

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
anything it's just a straight line so

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.339 
anything it's just a straight line so
I'm<00:02:50.220> going<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.400> keep<00:02:50.549> that<00:02:50.670> a<00:02:50.730> hundred<00:02:51.030> percent

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
I'm going to keep that a hundred percent

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.479 
I'm going to keep that a hundred percent
another<00:02:52.349> good<00:02:52.650> way<00:02:52.799> of<00:02:52.829> doing<00:02:53.129> it<00:02:53.370> would<00:02:53.459> be

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
another good way of doing it would be

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.479 
another good way of doing it would be
85%<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.659> also<00:02:54.780> like<00:02:55.049> to<00:02:55.200> look<00:02:55.319> at<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.620> but<00:02:56.400> I'm

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
85% I also like to look at that but I'm

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.039 
85% I also like to look at that but I'm
just<00:02:56.609> gonna<00:02:56.790> keep<00:02:57.060> it<00:02:57.180> at<00:02:57.329> a<00:02:57.359> hundred<00:02:57.569> for<00:02:57.989> the

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
just gonna keep it at a hundred for the

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.379 
just gonna keep it at a hundred for the
sake<00:02:58.230> of<00:02:58.260> this<00:02:58.579> frequency<00:02:59.579> you<00:03:00.000> can<00:03:00.120> change

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389 
sake of this frequency you can change

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.030 
sake of this frequency you can change
that<00:03:00.689> it<00:03:00.900> really<00:03:01.109> doesn't<00:03:01.409> matter<00:03:01.620> what<00:03:01.859> it's

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
that it really doesn't matter what it's

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.089 
that it really doesn't matter what it's
like<00:03:02.540> seed<00:03:03.540> I<00:03:03.750> like<00:03:04.019> to<00:03:04.169> keep<00:03:04.319> it<00:03:04.500> at<00:03:04.590> minus<00:03:04.889> two

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
like seed I like to keep it at minus two

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.979 
like seed I like to keep it at minus two
because<00:03:05.250> if<00:03:05.459> I<00:03:05.730> go<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.060> minus<00:03:06.359> six<00:03:06.569> it<00:03:06.720> sort<00:03:06.930> of

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
because if I go to minus six it sort of

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.199 
because if I go to minus six it sort of
spreads<00:03:07.290> out<00:03:07.470> of<00:03:07.620> it<00:03:07.709> too<00:03:08.010> much<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:08.519> for<00:03:09.000> a<00:03:09.030> lot

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
spreads out of it too much and for a lot

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.640 
spreads out of it too much and for a lot
involved<00:03:09.540> that's<00:03:09.750> not<00:03:09.989> really<00:03:10.290> all<00:03:10.319> too

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
involved that's not really all too

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.280 
involved that's not really all too
realistic<00:03:11.209> now<00:03:12.209> something<00:03:12.599> to<00:03:12.629> note<00:03:12.720> is<00:03:13.019> if

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
realistic now something to note is if

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.020 
realistic now something to note is if
you<00:03:13.409> change<00:03:13.829> it<00:03:14.040> but<00:03:14.250> then<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.459> don't<00:03:14.639> track

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
you change it but then you don't track

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.830 
you change it but then you don't track
the<00:03:15.480> material<00:03:16.340> here<00:03:17.340> back<00:03:17.879> into<00:03:18.299> the<00:03:18.389> Alpha

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
the material here back into the Alpha

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.250 
the material here back into the Alpha
then<00:03:19.349> it<00:03:19.620> will<00:03:19.949> not<00:03:20.609> work<00:03:21.180> very<00:03:21.720> well<00:03:21.810> I'll

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
then it will not work very well I'll

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.719 
then it will not work very well I'll
just<00:03:22.470> render<00:03:22.859> this<00:03:22.949> out<00:03:23.159> you<00:03:23.250> can<00:03:23.280> see<00:03:23.519> there's

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:23.729 
just render this out you can see there's

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:25.729 
just render this out you can see there's
black<00:03:23.970> bits<00:03:24.209> everywhere<00:03:24.599> so<00:03:25.409> I'm<00:03:25.500> just<00:03:25.650> gonna

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
black bits everywhere so I'm just gonna

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.080 
black bits everywhere so I'm just gonna
render<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.220> out<00:03:26.250> you<00:03:26.519> can<00:03:26.639> see<00:03:26.819> you<00:03:26.970> know<00:03:27.060> a

lot of us cut off and you know in severe

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:31.430 
lot of us cut off and you know in severe
cases<00:03:29.879> you<00:03:30.209> can<00:03:30.329> even<00:03:30.569> be<00:03:30.900> left<00:03:31.109> with<00:03:31.290> nothing

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.830 
cases you can even be left with nothing
there<00:03:31.799> but<00:03:32.220> it's<00:03:32.370> an<00:03:32.489> easy<00:03:32.639> fix<00:03:32.819> you<00:03:33.510> just<00:03:33.720> go

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
there but it's an easy fix you just go

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.710 
there but it's an easy fix you just go
to<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.019> luminance<00:03:34.530> drag<00:03:35.159> it<00:03:35.310> over<00:03:35.690> drop<00:03:36.690> it

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
to the luminance drag it over drop it

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.479 
to the luminance drag it over drop it
there<00:03:37.049> and<00:03:37.229> you<00:03:37.290> can<00:03:37.470> see<00:03:37.680> up<00:03:37.979> here<00:03:38.040> it's

there and you can see up here it's
brightened<00:03:39.000> and<00:03:39.180> then<00:03:39.780> you<00:03:39.930> render<00:03:40.260> it<00:03:40.349> out

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
brightened and then you render it out

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.800 
brightened and then you render it out
and<00:03:40.769> it<00:03:40.949> looks<00:03:40.979> completely<00:03:41.519> fine<00:03:41.790> so<00:03:42.659> yeah

don't you know glowing effects if I

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.149 
don't you know glowing effects if I
render<00:03:51.959> it<00:03:52.049> out<00:03:52.139> now<00:03:52.319> you<00:03:52.379> can<00:03:52.530> see<00:03:52.799> it<00:03:52.859> glows<00:03:53.129> a

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
render it out now you can see it glows a

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.939 
render it out now you can see it glows a
bit<00:03:53.400> more<00:03:53.579> which<00:03:53.790> is<00:03:53.819> what<00:03:54.090> I<00:03:54.150> did<00:03:54.599> do<00:03:54.810> in<00:03:55.560> the

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:55.949

00:03:55.949 --> 00:04:00.439 
bit more which is what I did do in the
speed<00:03:56.639> up<00:03:57.379> as<00:03:58.379> you<00:03:58.500> can<00:03:58.650> see<00:03:58.889> and<00:03:59.519> that's<00:04:00.269> so
