00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
range 72 300 but it does pack a good

k<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:16.520> clean<00:01:17.520> ours<00:01:18.290> and<00:01:19.290> here<00:01:20.600> is<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> test<00:01:22.049> with

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
k to clean ours and here is a test with

see<00:01:34.200> if<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.440> can<00:01:35.030> see<00:01:36.030> how<00:01:36.180> hard<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.660> front

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
see if you can see how hard the front

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:50.450 
see if you can see how hard the front
ends<00:01:37.350> at<00:01:37.530> f/4<00:01:47.180> okay<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.380> this<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.980> sigma

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
ends at f/4 okay so this is the sigma

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.720 
ends at f/4 okay so this is the sigma

works on film and digital but it does

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.870 
works on film and digital but it does

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
have some focusing problems about 10 or

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.270 
have some focusing problems about 10 or
10<00:02:09.540> or<00:02:09.570> 11<00:02:09.930> months<00:02:10.050> after<00:02:10.560> buying<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.010> lens

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
10 or 11 months after buying the lens

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.680 
10 or 11 months after buying the lens
and<00:02:11.690> started<00:02:12.690> making<00:02:12.810> this<00:02:13.200> often<00:02:13.950> oyster

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
and started making this often oyster

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.840 
and started making this often oyster
when<00:02:15.690> he<00:02:15.780> get<00:02:16.020> within<00:02:16.860> about<00:02:17.010> six<00:02:17.490> feet<00:02:17.670> of

when he get within about six feet of

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.350 
when he get within about six feet of
something<00:02:22.040> don't<00:02:23.040> do<00:02:23.160> that<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.880> it<00:02:24.060> won't<00:02:24.210> go

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
something don't do that and it won't go

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.400 
something don't do that and it won't go
back<00:02:25.280> so<00:02:26.420> some<00:02:27.420> we're<00:02:27.570> all<00:02:27.660> pretty<00:02:27.930> nice<00:02:28.140> I

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
back so some we're all pretty nice I

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.410 
back so some we're all pretty nice I
think<00:02:28.560> I<00:02:28.680> just<00:02:28.710> worn<00:02:29.220> down<00:02:29.310> really<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.270> mean

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
think I just worn down really I mean

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.800 
think I just worn down really I mean
which<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:31.020> shouldn't<00:02:31.320> do<00:02:31.530> that<00:02:31.770> but<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.810> didn't

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
which it shouldn't do that but I didn't

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.750 
which it shouldn't do that but I didn't
I<00:02:33.900> don't<00:02:34.200> I<00:02:34.470> didn't<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:35.040> still<00:02:35.280> don't<00:02:35.520> have

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
I don't I didn't and I still don't have

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.940 
I don't I didn't and I still don't have
the<00:02:35.880> funds<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.240> replace<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.900> right<00:02:37.080> now<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:37.620> I

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
the funds to replace it right now so I

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.350 
the funds to replace it right now so I
have<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:39.060> live<00:02:39.239> with<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.600> just<00:02:39.630> manual<00:02:40.260> focus

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
have to live with it I just manual focus

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.449 
have to live with it I just manual focus
so<00:02:42.360> let's<00:02:43.080> review<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.620> Sigma<00:02:44.040> semi<00:02:44.250> my

that's<00:03:18.330> nice<00:03:18.709> but<00:03:19.709> um<00:03:19.950> I<00:03:21.290> recommend<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.320> sigma

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
that's nice but um I recommend the sigma

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.140 
that's nice but um I recommend the sigma
over<00:03:22.770> the<00:03:22.860> cannon<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.340> cannon<00:03:23.520> reviews<00:03:23.820> have

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.770 
over the cannon the cannon reviews have
been<00:03:24.209> much<00:03:24.480> worse<00:03:24.510> than<00:03:25.410> this<00:03:25.590> has<00:03:25.860> been

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
been much worse than this has been

been much worse than this has been
that's<00:03:27.780> just<00:03:27.900> Sigma<00:03:28.350> we're<00:03:28.890> going<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.070> be

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
that's just Sigma we're going to be

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.250 
that's just Sigma we're going to be
reviewing<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.760> TMO<00:03:30.300> and<00:03:30.330> sanity<00:03:30.870> by<00:03:30.989> 30

millimeter<00:03:32.010> want<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.430> be<00:03:32.489> comparing<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.239> two

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
millimeter want to be comparing the two

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.430 
millimeter want to be comparing the two
and<00:03:34.970> we're<00:03:35.970> also<00:03:36.150> going<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:36.600> be<00:03:36.750> comparing<00:03:37.230> the

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
and we're also going to be comparing the

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.600 
and we're also going to be comparing the
Canon<00:03:38.220> 18<00:03:38.580> x<00:03:38.790> 55<00:03:39.360> to<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.050> can<00:03:40.290> and<00:03:40.500> 28<00:03:40.920> x<00:03:41.100> 90

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
Canon 18 x 55 to the can and 28 x 90

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.640 
Canon 18 x 55 to the can and 28 x 90
their<00:03:42.270> equivalent<00:03:42.900> when<00:03:43.020> they're<00:03:43.140> when<00:03:43.500> the

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
their equivalent when they're when the

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.920 
their equivalent when they're when the
18<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.100> 55<00:03:44.400> is<00:03:44.730> crop<00:03:44.970> factor<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:45.540> on<00:03:45.630> a<00:03:45.660> digital

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
18 to 55 is crop factor and on a digital

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.380 
18 to 55 is crop factor and on a digital
so<00:03:46.470> they've<00:03:47.130> got<00:03:47.160> about<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.550> same<00:03:47.580> body<00:03:47.970> too

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
so they've got about the same body too

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.050 
so they've got about the same body too
but<00:03:48.750> we're<00:03:49.710> also<00:03:49.890> going<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.280> be<00:03:50.400> doing<00:03:50.550> review

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
but we're also going to be doing review
