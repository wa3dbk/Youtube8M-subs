00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.130 
checkerboard check the border a cobweb
yeah<00:01:25.549> and<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:26.939> when<00:01:27.299> it's<00:01:27.450> healing<00:01:27.900> like

massage it's not a large area it's
getting<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.170> smaller<00:01:58.560> area<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.219> you're

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
getting the smaller area and you're

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.880 
getting the smaller area and you're
breaking<00:02:00.060> up<00:02:00.149> those<00:02:00.329> adhesions<00:02:00.590> so<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.770> it

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
breaking up those adhesions so that it

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.950 
breaking up those adhesions so that it
heals<00:02:02.130> strong<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.880> also<00:02:03.240> gets<00:02:03.509> more<00:02:03.719> blood

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
heals strong it also gets more blood

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.340 
heals strong it also gets more blood
flow<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.439> area

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
flow to the area

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.660 
flow to the area
and<00:02:05.440> it's<00:02:05.830> it's<00:02:07.170> gets<00:02:08.170> more<00:02:08.740> nutrition<00:02:09.460> to<00:02:09.550> the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
and it's it's gets more nutrition to the

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
is the most real I think that would

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.930 
is the most real I think that would
probably<00:03:15.459> be<00:03:17.340> what<00:03:18.340> you're<00:03:18.459> gonna<00:03:18.549> do<00:03:18.760> though

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
probably be what you're gonna do though

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.630 
probably be what you're gonna do though
is<00:03:19.180> you're<00:03:19.360> gonna<00:03:19.450> push<00:03:19.750> hard<00:03:20.280> this<00:03:21.280> is<00:03:21.459> not

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
is you're gonna push hard this is not

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.550 
is you're gonna push hard this is not
something<00:03:22.120> I'm<00:03:22.239> just<00:03:22.269> moving<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.019> skin<00:03:23.290> I'm

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
something I'm just moving the skin I'm

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.080 
something I'm just moving the skin I'm
getting<00:03:23.829> down<00:03:23.950> into<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.400> fibers<00:03:24.940> of<00:03:25.030> the

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
getting down into the fibers of the

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.789 
getting down into the fibers of the
muscle<00:03:25.269> a<00:03:25.540> fishing<00:03:26.019> really<00:03:26.200> hard<00:03:26.500> you<00:03:26.650> feel

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
muscle a fishing really hard you feel

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.180 
muscle a fishing really hard you feel
that<00:03:27.010> right<00:03:27.450> now<00:03:28.450> if<00:03:28.690> if<00:03:29.320> Brad<00:03:29.620> would<00:03:29.950> say<00:03:30.130> you

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
that right now if if Brad would say you

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.650 
that right now if if Brad would say you
know<00:03:30.400> what<00:03:30.549> that's<00:03:30.790> just<00:03:30.880> too<00:03:31.180> much<00:03:31.329> and<00:03:31.510> it's

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
know what that's just too much and it's

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.030 
know what that's just too much and it's
getting<00:03:31.930> there<00:03:32.049> and<00:03:32.440> whether<00:03:32.680> there's<00:03:32.950> a

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
getting there and whether there's a

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.280 
getting there and whether there's a
little<00:03:33.459> too<00:03:33.610> much<00:03:33.640> there<00:03:33.820> but<00:03:34.170> well<00:03:35.170> this

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
little too much there but well this

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.720 
little too much there but well this
woody<00:03:35.590> this<00:03:35.890> probably<00:03:36.250> is<00:03:36.340> something<00:03:36.489> you

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
woody this probably is something you

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.000 
woody this probably is something you
need<00:03:36.910> uh<00:03:37.200> cuz<00:03:38.200> again<00:03:38.410> he<00:03:38.560> injured<00:03:38.860> this

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
need uh cuz again he injured this

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.190 
need uh cuz again he injured this
shoulder<00:03:39.220> out<00:03:39.640> a<00:03:39.670> little<00:03:39.910> bit<00:03:40.180> this<00:03:40.630> one<00:03:40.870> yeah

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
shoulder out a little bit this one yeah

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.380 
shoulder out a little bit this one yeah
not<00:03:41.500> that<00:03:41.739> part<00:03:41.950> right<00:03:42.700> that<00:03:42.910> grew<00:03:43.090> there<00:03:43.269> you

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
not that part right that grew there you

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.860 
not that part right that grew there you
go<00:03:43.980> okay<00:03:44.980> all<00:03:45.850> right<00:03:46.060> this<00:03:46.299> starts<00:03:46.630> getting

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
go okay all right this starts getting

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.020 
go okay all right this starts getting
worse<00:03:47.049> and<00:03:47.290> worse<00:03:47.350> it<00:03:47.799> might<00:03:48.040> be<00:03:48.280> too<00:03:48.489> much<00:03:48.670> to

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
worse and worse it might be too much to

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.509 
worse and worse it might be too much to
start<00:03:49.329> with<00:03:49.480> and<00:03:50.260> he<00:03:50.470> maybe<00:03:50.680> needs<00:03:50.920> to<00:03:51.070> ice<00:03:51.280> it

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
start with and he maybe needs to ice it

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.330 
start with and he maybe needs to ice it
to<00:03:51.640> start<00:03:51.880> off<00:03:52.060> with<00:03:52.560> and<00:03:53.560> let<00:03:53.739> it<00:03:53.890> calm<00:03:54.070> down

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
to start off with and let it calm down

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.920 
to start off with and let it calm down
and<00:03:54.549> actually<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:55.000> more<00:03:55.150> you<00:03:55.299> were<00:03:55.390> doing<00:03:55.750> it

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
and actually the more you were doing it

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.780 
and actually the more you were doing it
it<00:03:56.140> was<00:03:56.200> feeling<00:03:56.590> better<00:03:56.799> okay<00:03:57.100> so<00:03:57.370> that's<00:03:57.670> it

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
it was feeling better okay so that's it

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.180 
it was feeling better okay so that's it
that's<00:03:57.880> a<00:03:58.060> good<00:03:58.209> sign<00:03:58.510> more<00:03:58.930> fiber<00:03:59.320> yeah<00:03:59.980> you

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
that's a good sign more fiber yeah you

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.560 
that's a good sign more fiber yeah you
want<00:04:00.400> it<00:04:00.489> to<00:04:00.610> the<00:04:00.730> point<00:04:00.970> where<00:04:01.180> it<00:04:01.269> actually

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
want it to the point where it actually

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.000 
want it to the point where it actually
almost<00:04:01.690> starts<00:04:02.049> to<00:04:02.170> feel<00:04:02.350> numb<00:04:02.620> after<00:04:02.829> a

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
almost starts to feel numb after a

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.620 
almost starts to feel numb after a
minute<00:04:03.370> or<00:04:03.430> so<00:04:03.640> yeah<00:04:03.850> then<00:04:04.269> you're<00:04:04.420> probably

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
minute or so yeah then you're probably

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.770 
minute or so yeah then you're probably
right<00:04:04.989> on<00:04:05.260> the<00:04:05.829> correct<00:04:06.670> treatment<00:04:06.910> now<00:04:07.570> this

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
right on the correct treatment now this

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.900 
right on the correct treatment now this
can<00:04:08.019> be<00:04:08.049> pretty<00:04:08.440> dramatic<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:09.190> results<00:04:09.820> from

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
can be pretty dramatic the results from

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.110 
can be pretty dramatic the results from
this<00:04:10.120> this<00:04:10.329> earnest<00:04:11.049> can<00:04:11.400> get<00:04:12.400> really

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
this this earnest can get really

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.140 
this this earnest can get really
good<00:04:13.720> result<00:04:14.080> of<00:04:14.260> you<00:04:14.379> if<00:04:14.620> you<00:04:14.709> do<00:04:14.860> it<00:04:15.010> I<00:04:15.459> would

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
good result of you if you do it I would

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.509 
good result of you if you do it I would
say<00:04:16.329> probably<00:04:17.109> three<00:04:17.410> times<00:04:17.709> a<00:04:17.859> week<00:04:17.889> at<00:04:18.430> least

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
say probably three times a week at least

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.069 
say probably three times a week at least
sure<00:04:19.150> especially<00:04:19.570> if<00:04:19.630> you're<00:04:19.720> gonna<00:04:19.810> do<00:04:19.959> it

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
sure especially if you're gonna do it

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.990 
sure especially if you're gonna do it
you<00:04:20.440> can<00:04:20.590> do<00:04:20.709> a<00:04:20.739> long<00:04:20.980> time<00:04:21.280> you<00:04:21.729> can<00:04:21.880> do<00:04:21.940> it

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
you can do a long time you can do it

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000 
you can do a long time you can do it
five<00:04:22.270> minutes<00:04:22.479> up<00:04:22.750> to<00:04:22.780> 20<00:04:23.110> minutes<00:04:23.350> right

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
five minutes up to 20 minutes right

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.500 
five minutes up to 20 minutes right
yeah<00:04:24.190> after<00:04:24.370> you<00:04:24.400> could<00:04:24.580> figures<00:04:25.090> no<00:04:25.240> fans

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
yeah after you could figures no fans

yeah after you could figures no fans
could<00:04:25.720> hold<00:04:25.900> up<00:04:26.020> probably<00:04:26.260> won't<00:04:26.590> but<00:04:26.800> I<00:04:26.860> would

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
could hold up probably won't but I would

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.719 
could hold up probably won't but I would
probably<00:04:27.460> just<00:04:27.639> do<00:04:27.850> it<00:04:27.940> for<00:04:28.120> five<00:04:28.270> minutes

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
going to get too aggressive the height

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.350 
going to get too aggressive the height
of<00:05:07.630> my<00:05:07.810> arm<00:05:08.289> I<00:05:08.770> would<00:05:09.220> experiment<00:05:09.760> and<00:05:10.120> see

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
of my arm I would experiment and see

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.090 
of my arm I would experiment and see
what<00:05:10.389> feels<00:05:11.050> like<00:05:11.289> it's<00:05:11.440> stretching<00:05:11.710> better

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
what feels like it's stretching better

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.930 
what feels like it's stretching better
I'm<00:05:12.460> gonna<00:05:12.880> void<00:05:13.300> any<00:05:13.600> sharp<00:05:14.020> pain<00:05:14.139> and<00:05:14.410> just

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
I'm gonna void any sharp pain and just

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.700 
I'm gonna void any sharp pain and just
stretch<00:05:15.940> it<00:05:16.240> so<00:05:16.930> it<00:05:17.020> feels<00:05:17.169> like<00:05:17.260> a<00:05:17.380> good

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
stretch and I'm not getting too

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.170 
stretch and I'm not getting too
aggressive<00:05:20.020> with<00:05:20.050> it<00:05:20.520> if<00:05:21.520> I<00:05:21.669> didn't<00:05:21.940> have<00:05:22.060> an

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
event this weekend in my experiment I'm

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.600 
event this weekend in my experiment I'm
not<00:05:24.460> going<00:05:24.669> to<00:05:24.960> so<00:05:25.960> yeah<00:05:26.410> if<00:05:27.130> that<00:05:27.340> would<00:05:27.550> be

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
not going to so yeah if that would be

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:28.950 
not going to so yeah if that would be
feeling<00:05:27.789> more<00:05:28.000> relaxed<00:05:28.510> now<00:05:28.570> you<00:05:28.840> know<00:05:28.900> I'll

would be to stretch it like this right
this<00:05:32.650> stretch<00:05:32.889> of<00:05:32.919> the<00:05:33.190> pectoralis<00:05:33.610> major<00:05:34.150> -

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
this stretch of the pectoralis major -

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.260 
this stretch of the pectoralis major -
and<00:05:34.810> if<00:05:35.050> you<00:05:35.200> like<00:05:35.380> me<00:05:35.590> I<00:05:35.979> just<00:05:36.190> that<00:05:36.940> stretch

that<00:05:45.370> you<00:05:45.970> want<00:05:46.090> to<00:05:46.210> make<00:05:46.360> sure<00:05:46.389> that<00:05:46.720> you

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
that you want to make sure that you

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.300 
that you want to make sure that you
probably<00:05:46.990> don't<00:05:47.260> do<00:05:47.470> any<00:05:47.650> strengthening<00:05:48.190> with

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
probably don't do any strengthening with

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.100 
probably don't do any strengthening with
that<00:05:48.460> shoulder<00:05:48.700> while<00:05:49.000> it's<00:05:49.180> healing<00:05:49.360> yeah<00:05:49.840> so

that shoulder while it's healing yeah so

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.480 
that shoulder while it's healing yeah so
you<00:05:50.740> know<00:05:50.770> you<00:05:50.979> don't<00:05:51.070> want<00:05:51.220> to<00:05:51.280> avoid

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
you know you don't want to avoid

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.839 
you know you don't want to avoid
activities<00:05:52.090> that<00:05:52.630> muscle<00:05:53.220> brings<00:05:54.220> us<00:05:54.340> the<00:05:54.520> arm

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:54.849 
activities that muscle brings us the arm

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:57.360 
activities that muscle brings us the arm
across<00:05:55.120> like<00:05:55.570> this<00:05:55.840> it<00:05:56.440> also<00:05:56.650> brings<00:05:57.010> the<00:05:57.130> arm

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
across like this it also brings the arm

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.240 
across like this it also brings the arm
like<00:05:57.639> this<00:05:57.669> right<00:05:58.419> so<00:05:58.840> this<00:05:59.740> is<00:05:59.919> called<00:06:00.130> the

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
like this right so this is called the

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.129 
like this right so this is called the
internal<00:06:00.340> rotation<00:06:00.910> this<00:06:01.240> is<00:06:01.300> horizontal

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:02.139 
internal rotation this is horizontal

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:05.070 
internal rotation this is horizontal
adduction<00:06:02.789> so<00:06:03.789> you're<00:06:04.539> gonna<00:06:04.630> want<00:06:04.810> to<00:06:04.870> avoid

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
adduction so you're gonna want to avoid

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.080 
adduction so you're gonna want to avoid
those<00:06:05.380> type<00:06:05.710> of<00:06:05.740> things<00:06:05.889> no<00:06:06.250> bench<00:06:06.520> press<00:06:06.849> and

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
those type of things no bench press and

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.670 
those type of things no bench press and
you<00:06:07.419> Nabeel<00:06:07.750> tell<00:06:08.050> because<00:06:08.320> they're<00:06:08.470> the<00:06:08.530> ones

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
you Nabeel tell because they're the ones

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.930 
you Nabeel tell because they're the ones
are<00:06:08.770> gonna<00:06:08.860> be<00:06:09.039> feel<00:06:09.250> like<00:06:09.370> they<00:06:09.490> twing<00:06:09.789> it

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
are gonna be feel like they twing it

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.499 
are gonna be feel like they twing it
when<00:06:10.150> they're<00:06:10.360> trying<00:06:10.570> it<00:06:10.780> yeah

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:12.509 
when they're trying it yeah

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:15.739 
when they're trying it yeah
I<00:06:13.379> think<00:06:13.680> I<00:06:13.740> made<00:06:13.919> a<00:06:13.949> little<00:06:14.189> work<00:06:14.490> tween<00:06:14.819> all

00:06:15.739 --> 00:06:15.749 
I think I made a little work tween all

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:18.230 
I think I made a little work tween all
right<00:06:15.900> by<00:06:16.259> the<00:06:16.319> way<00:06:16.469> if<00:06:16.919> you<00:06:17.309> are<00:06:17.550> 40<00:06:18.029> and<00:06:18.150> over
