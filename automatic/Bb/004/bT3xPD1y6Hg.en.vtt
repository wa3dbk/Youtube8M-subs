may encourage the the pond owners to
double<00:00:51.000> his<00:00:51.239> right<00:00:51.750> maybe<00:00:52.079> put<00:00:52.289> out<00:00:52.410> 10<00:00:52.710> pounds

back<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.930> check<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.350> water<00:00:58.559> color<00:00:58.980> in<00:00:59.820> about

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
back and check the water color in about

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.290 
back and check the water color in about
two<00:01:01.260> weeks<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:02.160> if<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.399> had<00:01:02.520> knocked<00:01:02.760> up<00:01:02.969> then

two weeks and if it had knocked up then
you<00:01:03.420> drop<00:01:03.750> back<00:01:03.989> you'd<00:01:04.229> hit<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.409> with<00:01:04.589> five

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
you drop back you'd hit it with five

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.130 
you drop back you'd hit it with five
pounds<00:01:05.189> per<00:01:05.519> acre<00:01:05.689> the<00:01:06.689> way<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.930> determine

pounds per acre the way you determine
that<00:01:07.710> water<00:01:08.010> color<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:09.229> by<00:01:10.229> having<00:01:10.530> some<00:01:10.979> type

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
that water color is by having some type

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.899 
that water color is by having some type
of<00:01:11.750> visual<00:01:12.750> object<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:14.010> put<00:01:14.549> down<00:01:14.580> in

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
of visual object that you put down in

of visual object that you put down in
the<00:01:15.030> water<00:01:15.270> now<00:01:15.540> we<00:01:15.600> use<00:01:16.549> what's<00:01:17.549> called<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.909> sec

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
the water now we use what's called a sec

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
broom handle or a cane PO and you lower

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.510 
broom handle or a cane PO and you lower
it<00:01:30.630> down<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.049> water<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:32.040> look<00:01:32.400> and

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
it down in the water and you look and

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.030 
it down in the water and you look and
see<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.909> what<00:01:33.119> depth<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.630> disappears<00:01:34.320> as<00:01:34.979> a

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
see it what depth it disappears as a

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.300 
see it what depth it disappears as a
general<00:01:35.549> rule<00:01:36.020> it<00:01:37.020> should<00:01:37.079> disappear<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:38.189> the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
general rule it should disappear in the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.030 
general rule it should disappear in the
upper<00:01:38.640> 18<00:01:39.119> inches<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:39.840> if<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.619> can<00:01:40.740> see<00:01:40.890> that

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
upper 18 inches so if you can see that

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.950 
upper 18 inches so if you can see that
down<00:01:41.220> there<00:01:41.400> there's<00:01:41.610> three<00:01:41.850> then<00:01:42.540> water<00:01:42.840> is

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
down there there's three then water is

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.249 
down there there's three then water is
too<00:01:43.140> clear<00:01:43.460> sometimes<00:01:44.460> depending<00:01:45.329> on<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.479> it

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.709 
seen some people go every six or eight
weeks<00:01:54.840> but<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.920> key<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.250> again<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.969> it's

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
weeks but the key to that again is it's

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.530 
weeks but the key to that again is it's
measuring<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.710> plankton<00:01:59.549> bloom<00:01:59.850> by<00:02:00.240> having

measuring the plankton bloom by having

measuring the plankton bloom by having
some<00:02:00.780> type<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.020> place<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:02.130> you've<00:02:02.340> dropped

some type of place that you've dropped

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.690 
some type of place that you've dropped
into<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.000> water<00:02:04.040> we've<00:02:05.040> used<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.460> lot<00:02:05.670> of

it's<00:03:16.359> just<00:03:16.630> like<00:03:16.870> when<00:03:17.169> a<00:03:17.200> cattleman<00:03:17.980> tries<00:03:18.220> to

grow a lot of beat the thing down below

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.879 
grow a lot of beat the thing down below
that<00:03:21.940> it<00:03:22.060> will<00:03:22.150> grow<00:03:22.690> a<00:03:22.750> lot<00:03:22.959> of<00:03:23.079> grass<00:03:23.290> to<00:03:23.769> grow

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
that it will grow a lot of grass to grow

fertilizer<00:03:26.019> on<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.650> grass<00:03:26.859> so<00:03:27.160> the<00:03:27.250> same

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
fertilizer on the grass so the same

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
fertilization will really boost it up

fertilization will really boost it up
but<00:03:32.349> what<00:03:32.530> happens<00:03:32.950> is<00:03:33.250> when<00:03:33.880> you<00:03:34.000> when<00:03:34.299> you

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:34.419 
but what happens is when you when you

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:36.509 
but what happens is when you when you
fertilize<00:03:34.930> that<00:03:34.959> pond

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519

and<00:04:15.590> the<00:04:15.680> condition<00:04:16.190> of<00:04:16.280> those<00:04:16.400> bluegill<00:04:16.970> so<00:04:17.660> a

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
and the condition of those bluegill so a

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.690 
and the condition of those bluegill so a
fast-growing<00:04:18.290> bluegill<00:04:19.040> will<00:04:19.250> have<00:04:19.400> a<00:04:19.430> bigger

fast-growing bluegill will have a bigger
egg<00:04:19.940> capacity<00:04:20.630> and<00:04:20.840> it<00:04:20.930> turns<00:04:21.170> out<00:04:21.350> a<00:04:21.380> lot<00:04:21.709> of

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
egg capacity and it turns out a lot of

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.150
