00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
and then you have as mentions the

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.849 
and then you have as mentions the
standard<00:02:15.650> round<00:02:15.859> light<00:02:16.159> on<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.489> bottom

standard round light on the bottom

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:20.349 
standard round light on the bottom
that's<00:02:18.859> still<00:02:19.159> just<00:02:19.189> as<00:02:19.609> effective<00:02:20.120> but<00:02:20.239> you

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:20.359 
that's still just as effective but you

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:21.970 
that's still just as effective but you
see<00:02:20.569> it<00:02:20.659> has<00:02:20.840> half<00:02:21.109> the<00:02:21.140> number<00:02:21.680> of<00:02:21.769> lights

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
see it has half the number of lights

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.059 
see it has half the number of lights
it's<00:02:22.310> still<00:02:22.579> the<00:02:22.700> same<00:02:22.909> diameter<00:02:23.709> it<00:02:24.709> doesn't

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
it's still the same diameter it doesn't

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.300 
it's still the same diameter it doesn't
alter<00:02:25.189> the<00:02:25.370> runtime<00:02:26.060> very<00:02:26.329> much<00:02:26.569> but<00:02:27.260> it<00:02:27.980> does

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
alter the runtime very much but it does

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.649 
alter the runtime very much but it does
make<00:02:28.549> a<00:02:28.609> really<00:02:28.909> big<00:02:29.090> difference<00:02:29.150> while

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 
make a really big difference while

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.559 
make a really big difference while
flying<00:02:29.959> this<00:02:30.829> one<00:02:31.129> does<00:02:31.400> have<00:02:31.670> double<00:02:32.299> the

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
flying this one does have double the

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.780 
flying this one does have double the
amount<00:02:33.439> of<00:02:33.709> lights<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.250> doesn't<00:02:34.670> make<00:02:34.760> a

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
amount of lights and doesn't make a

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.660 
amount of lights and doesn't make a
really<00:02:35.120> big<00:02:35.269> difference<00:02:35.470> but<00:02:36.470> not<00:02:36.769> that<00:02:37.159> big

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
really big difference but not that big

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.339 
really big difference but not that big
they're<00:02:37.879> both<00:02:38.060> like<00:02:38.329> very<00:02:38.599> effective<00:02:39.109> and

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
they're both like very effective and

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.860 
they're both like very effective and
even<00:02:39.650> if<00:02:39.769> you<00:02:39.859> get<00:02:40.099> them<00:02:40.219> using<00:02:41.000> your<00:02:41.120> dx8<00:02:41.599> it's

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
even if you get them using your dx8 it's

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.349 
even if you get them using your dx8 it's
still<00:02:42.079> very<00:02:42.260> effective<00:02:42.470> well<00:02:42.980> up<00:02:43.159> over<00:02:43.549> you

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 
still very effective well up over you

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.500 
still very effective well up over you
know<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:44.510> thousand<00:02:45.019> feet<00:02:45.200> so<00:02:45.859> I<00:02:46.329> hope<00:02:47.329> this

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
know a thousand feet so I hope this

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.360 
know a thousand feet so I hope this

information helped you guys out I will

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.339 
information helped you guys out I will
have<00:02:49.639> I've<00:02:49.909> got<00:02:50.090> some<00:02:50.269> special<00:02:50.659> lights<00:02:51.019> coming

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
have I've got some special lights coming

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:56.140 
have I've got some special lights coming
in<00:02:51.560> that<00:02:51.739> will<00:02:51.859> fit<00:02:52.159> the<00:02:54.400> special<00:02:55.400> facets<00:02:56.030> of

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
in that will fit the special facets of

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.339 
in that will fit the special facets of
the<00:02:56.269> drone<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.629> way<00:02:56.750> you<00:02:56.810> go<00:02:56.989> around<00:02:57.109> with

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
the drone the way you go around with

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.259 
the drone the way you go around with
those<00:02:57.439> uneven<00:02:57.829> edges<00:02:57.950> it's<00:02:58.700> real<00:02:58.909> tough<00:02:59.120> to

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
those uneven edges it's real tough to

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:00.699 
those uneven edges it's real tough to
use<00:02:59.419> any<00:02:59.569> of<00:02:59.689> the<00:02:59.780> available<00:02:59.959> lights<00:03:00.379> that<00:03:00.590> are

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
use any of the available lights that are

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:01.990 
use any of the available lights that are
currently<00:03:01.040> out<00:03:01.129> because<00:03:01.519> they<00:03:01.609> just<00:03:01.790> don't

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
currently out because they just don't

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.640 
currently out because they just don't
bend<00:03:02.359> and<00:03:02.510> flex<00:03:02.599> enough<00:03:03.019> especially<00:03:03.319> the

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
bend and flex enough especially the

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.429 
bend and flex enough especially the
runway<00:03:03.950> lights<00:03:04.569> but<00:03:05.569> I<00:03:05.599> do<00:03:05.810> have<00:03:06.079> some<00:03:06.319> other

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:06.439 
runway lights but I do have some other

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:09.429 
runway lights but I do have some other
way<00:03:06.680> that<00:03:06.799> will<00:03:06.980> be<00:03:07.129> effective<00:03:07.549> and<00:03:08.079> as<00:03:09.079> far<00:03:09.319> as

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:09.439 
way that will be effective and as far as

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:12.250 
way that will be effective and as far as
the<00:03:09.560> upgrade<00:03:09.980> definitely<00:03:10.790> is<00:03:10.970> it<00:03:11.209> it's<00:03:12.019> one

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
the upgrade definitely is it it's one

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.710 
the upgrade definitely is it it's one
we've<00:03:12.470> all<00:03:12.620> been<00:03:12.769> waiting<00:03:12.919> for<00:03:13.099> and<00:03:13.659> I<00:03:14.659> think

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
we've all been waiting for and I think

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.300 
we've all been waiting for and I think
you'll<00:03:15.139> notice<00:03:15.560> some<00:03:15.590> improvements<00:03:16.190> as<00:03:16.280> well

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
you'll notice some improvements as well

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.640 
you'll notice some improvements as well
I<00:03:16.699> didn't<00:03:17.359> really<00:03:17.569> get<00:03:17.840> any<00:03:17.900> improvement<00:03:18.590> as

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650
