main<00:01:31.049> guitar<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.619> use<00:01:31.939> when<00:01:32.939> I'm<00:01:33.090> at

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
main guitar that I use when I'm at

sound<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.219> hell<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.520> lot<00:01:56.640> better<00:01:56.790> when<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.060> get

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
sound a hell of a lot better when I get

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.600 
sound a hell of a lot better when I get
the<00:01:57.329> new<00:01:57.420> pickup<00:01:57.780> in<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.860> only<00:01:59.280> bought<00:01:59.430> the

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
the new pickup in it I only bought the

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.760 
the new pickup in it I only bought the
bridge<00:01:59.820> event<00:02:00.149> by<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.329> neck<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.439> neck<00:02:01.560> I

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
bridge event by a neck the neck I

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.350 
bridge event by a neck the neck I
figured<00:02:02.250> would<00:02:02.399> sound<00:02:02.610> pretty<00:02:02.850> good<00:02:02.939> anyway

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
figured would sound pretty good anyway

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.480 
figured would sound pretty good anyway
it<00:02:03.479> might<00:02:03.630> not<00:02:03.810> match

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
it might not match

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.109 
it might not match
the<00:02:05.329> output<00:02:05.619> of<00:02:06.619> the<00:02:06.890> other<00:02:07.189> one<00:02:07.340> but<00:02:07.549> I<00:02:07.790> mean

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
the output of the other one but I mean

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.460 
the output of the other one but I mean
I'm<00:02:08.239> not<00:02:08.330> going<00:02:08.479> to<00:02:08.539> use<00:02:08.660> it<00:02:08.690> that<00:02:08.959> much<00:02:08.989> anyway

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
I'm not going to use it that much anyway

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.460 
I'm not going to use it that much anyway
so<00:02:09.619> it'll<00:02:10.310> be<00:02:10.399> fine<00:02:10.900> um<00:02:12.610> so<00:02:13.810> you<00:02:14.810> mean<00:02:14.959> here<00:02:15.380> it

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
so it'll be fine um so you mean here it

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:34.790 
so it'll be fine um so you mean here it
is

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.650 

another<00:02:35.800> thing<00:02:36.010> it<00:02:36.250> has<00:02:36.370> really<00:02:36.880> small<00:02:37.390> gauge

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
another thing it has really small gauge

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.030 
another thing it has really small gauge
strings<00:02:37.930> on<00:02:38.200> it's<00:02:38.380> probably<00:02:38.470> got<00:02:38.800> like<00:02:40.380> 99<00:02:41.380> 242

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
strings on it's probably got like 99 242

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.600 
strings on it's probably got like 99 242
we're<00:02:42.250> something<00:02:42.520> that's<00:02:42.640> pretty<00:02:42.760> standard<00:02:43.180> a

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
we're something that's pretty standard a

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.420 
we're something that's pretty standard a
pretty<00:02:45.610> standard<00:02:46.090> size<00:02:46.770> 44<00:02:47.770> Fender<00:02:48.100> guitars

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
pretty standard size 44 Fender guitars

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.559 
pretty standard size 44 Fender guitars
but<00:02:48.610> I<00:02:48.670> like<00:02:48.880> I'm<00:02:48.970> a<00:02:49.030> hell<00:02:49.180> of<00:02:49.209> a<00:02:49.330> lot<00:02:49.420> bigger

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
but I like I'm a hell of a lot bigger

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.220 
but I like I'm a hell of a lot bigger
and<00:02:49.690> I<00:02:49.870> usually<00:02:50.140> go<00:02:50.230> ten<00:02:50.560> to<00:02:50.740> fifty<00:02:51.130> two<00:02:52.110> so<00:02:53.110> it

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
and I usually go ten to fifty two so it

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.760 
and I usually go ten to fifty two so it
definitely<00:02:53.380> doesn't<00:02:53.650> sound<00:02:54.300> as<00:02:55.530> beefy<00:02:56.530> as<00:02:56.620> it

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
definitely doesn't sound as beefy as it

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.199 
definitely doesn't sound as beefy as it
would<00:02:56.860> if<00:02:56.950> I<00:02:57.040> had<00:02:57.069> like<00:02:57.310> some<00:02:57.520> thicker<00:02:57.850> strings

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
would if I had like some thicker strings

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:12.690 
would if I had like some thicker strings
on<00:02:58.390> it<00:03:10.709> it's<00:03:11.709> probably<00:03:11.950> falling<00:03:12.370> out<00:03:12.489> of<00:03:12.580> tune

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
on it it's probably falling out of tune

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.030 
on it it's probably falling out of tune
a<00:03:12.790> little<00:03:12.880> bit<00:03:13.090> too<00:03:13.209> because<00:03:13.390> it's<00:03:13.920> have<00:03:14.920> been

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
a little bit too because it's have been

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.360 
a little bit too because it's have been
 with<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.640> strings<00:03:16.120> a<00:03:16.239> bit<00:03:16.420> but<00:03:17.370> this

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
 with the strings a bit but this

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.190 
 with the strings a bit but this
is<00:03:18.519> like<00:03:18.700> my<00:03:18.850> main<00:03:19.060> heavy<00:03:19.390> channel<00:03:19.870> like<00:03:20.019> if

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
is like my main heavy channel like if

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.590 
is like my main heavy channel like if
you<00:03:20.350> watched<00:03:20.769> any<00:03:21.069> like<00:03:21.370> my<00:03:21.459> videos<00:03:21.819> with<00:03:22.450> like

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
you watched any like my videos with like

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.590 
you watched any like my videos with like
bling<00:03:22.870> covers<00:03:23.260> and<00:03:23.590> whatever<00:03:24.430> else<00:03:24.550> this<00:03:25.480> is

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
bling covers and whatever else this is

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.940 
bling covers and whatever else this is
the<00:03:25.720> channel<00:03:26.080> that<00:03:26.200> i'm<00:03:26.290> always<00:03:26.560> on<00:03:26.709> so<00:03:26.860> you

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
the channel that i'm always on so you

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.070 
the channel that i'm always on so you
could<00:03:27.100> tell<00:03:27.310> that<00:03:27.340> this<00:03:27.670> is<00:03:27.910> really<00:03:28.750> not<00:03:29.019> a

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
could tell that this is really not a

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.640 
could tell that this is really not a
high-output<00:03:29.319> pick<00:03:29.830> up<00:03:30.010> at<00:03:30.220> all<00:03:30.370> so<00:03:31.530> it's<00:03:32.530> not

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
high-output pick up at all so it's not

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.320 
high-output pick up at all so it's not
like<00:03:32.830> i<00:03:32.920> have<00:03:32.950> it<00:03:33.160> on<00:03:33.220> a<00:03:33.280> channel<00:03:33.700> where<00:03:33.819> it's

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
like i have it on a channel where it's

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.030 
like i have it on a channel where it's
like<00:03:34.510> lower<00:03:34.840> gain<00:03:35.140> or<00:03:35.319> anything<00:03:35.620> this<00:03:35.709> is<00:03:35.769> like

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
like lower gain or anything this is like

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:44.380 
like lower gain or anything this is like
as<00:03:36.220> high<00:03:36.819> gain<00:03:37.120> as<00:03:37.269> it's<00:03:37.420> gonna<00:03:37.480> get

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.390 

still<00:03:45.230> doesn't<00:03:45.410> sound<00:03:45.650> bad<00:03:45.800> at<00:03:45.860> all<00:03:46.100> it's<00:03:46.310> just

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
still doesn't sound bad at all it's just

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.809 
still doesn't sound bad at all it's just
it's<00:03:46.940> not<00:03:47.120> really<00:03:47.360> going<00:03:47.450> to<00:03:47.510> suit<00:03:48.550> the<00:03:49.550> band

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
it's not really going to suit the band

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.540 
it's not really going to suit the band
that<00:03:50.540> that<00:03:50.810> I'm<00:03:50.930> in<00:03:51.080> or<00:03:51.440> am<00:03:51.890> I<00:03:51.950> playing<00:03:52.190> in

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
that that I'm in or am I playing in

00:03:52.550 --> 00:04:29.360 
that that I'm in or am I playing in
general

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:53.110 

you

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.970 

hmm<00:04:54.120> got<00:04:54.450> some<00:04:54.600> really<00:04:54.930> nice<00:04:55.140> cleans<00:04:55.500> on<00:04:55.680> it<00:04:55.830> I

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
hmm got some really nice cleans on it I

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.630 
hmm got some really nice cleans on it I
don't<00:04:56.490> really<00:04:56.700> play<00:04:57.980> cleans<00:04:58.980> very<00:04:59.220> often<00:04:59.550> but

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
don't really play cleans very often but

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.210 
don't really play cleans very often but
if<00:04:59.730> I<00:04:59.820> did<00:05:00.030> this<00:05:00.150> would<00:05:00.330> be<00:05:00.530> really<00:05:01.530> ideal<00:05:01.800> for

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
if I did this would be really ideal for

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.610 
if I did this would be really ideal for
sure<00:05:02.340> especially<00:05:02.520> the<00:05:02.970> neck<00:05:03.120> pickup<00:05:03.350> so<00:05:04.350> I

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
sure especially the neck pickup so I

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.380 
sure especially the neck pickup so I
mean<00:05:04.980> keeping<00:05:05.670> the<00:05:05.760> neck<00:05:05.850> pickup<00:05:06.000> in<00:05:06.270> this

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
mean keeping the neck pickup in this

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:11.510 
mean keeping the neck pickup in this
would<00:05:06.570> definitely<00:05:09.770> definitely<00:05:10.770> be<00:05:11.070> a<00:05:11.100> good

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
would definitely definitely be a good

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.800 
would definitely definitely be a good
idea<00:05:11.820> so<00:05:13.220> I<00:05:14.220> have<00:05:14.820> no<00:05:14.970> real<00:05:15.150> reason<00:05:15.390> to<00:05:15.570> change

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
idea so I have no real reason to change

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.080 
idea so I have no real reason to change
it<00:05:16.050> to<00:05:16.200> like<00:05:16.770> another<00:05:17.130> the<00:05:17.610> matching

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
it to like another the matching

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:47.860 
it to like another the matching
piledriver<00:05:18.980> bare<00:05:19.980> knuckle<00:05:20.280> pickups

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.540 

so<00:05:48.870> um<00:05:49.470> that's<00:05:49.860> pretty<00:05:50.100> much<00:05:50.160> all<00:05:50.310> I'm<00:05:50.430> gonna

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
so um that's pretty much all I'm gonna

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.340 
so um that's pretty much all I'm gonna
really<00:05:51.000> have<00:05:51.300> to<00:05:51.330> talk<00:05:51.690> about<00:05:51.960> at<00:05:52.110> the<00:05:52.169> moment

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 
really have to talk about at the moment

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.090
