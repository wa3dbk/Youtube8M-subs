00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
do once and it saves it if I wanted to

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.990 
do once and it saves it if I wanted to
add<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.149> document<00:02:03.450> name<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:03.990> can<00:02:04.380> do<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:05.000> and

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
add a document name I can do that and

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.639 
add a document name I can do that and
that<00:02:06.299> would<00:02:06.450> probably<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:07.140> would<00:02:07.229> print<00:02:07.469> that

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
that would probably it would print that

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.130 
that would probably it would print that
on<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:07.979> page<00:02:08.190> as<00:02:08.399> well<00:02:08.450> so<00:02:09.450> i<00:02:09.479> would<00:02:09.750> type<00:02:09.929> in

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
on the page as well so i would type in

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.160 
on the page as well so i would type in
that<00:02:10.379> address<00:02:10.739> here<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.340> port<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:12.170> and

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
that address here and the port and and

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.490 
that address here and the port and and
then

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
then

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.070 
then
of<00:02:13.620> course<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.760> information<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:15.750> would<00:02:15.870> get

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
of course that information you would get

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.160 
of course that information you would get
from<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:17.480> application<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.600> installed<00:02:18.990> on

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
from the application you installed on

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.830 
from the application you installed on
the<00:02:19.290> computer<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:20.180> you'd<00:02:21.180> enter<00:02:21.420> that<00:02:21.600> in

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
the computer and you'd enter that in

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.470 
the computer and you'd enter that in
under<00:02:22.500> print<00:02:22.800> options<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.490> also<00:02:23.850> can<00:02:24.060> assess

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
under print options you also can assess

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.720 
under print options you also can assess
number<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:24.990> copies<00:02:25.370> portrait<00:02:26.370> or<00:02:26.490> landscape

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
number of copies portrait or landscape

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.300 
number of copies portrait or landscape
your<00:02:27.450> print<00:02:27.840> quality<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.620> color<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:29.100> black

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
your print quality and color and black

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.610 
your print quality and color and black
and<00:02:29.340> white<00:02:29.700> so<00:02:30.300> this<00:02:30.750> is<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.900> very<00:02:31.200> useful

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
and white so this is a very useful

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.060 
and white so this is a very useful
printing<00:02:32.400> tool<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.850> have<00:02:33.060> on<00:02:33.420> your<00:02:33.480> phone
