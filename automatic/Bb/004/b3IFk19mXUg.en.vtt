00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.920
 and you like it is very old 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.669
 lottery tickets if you're from the 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:24.439
 my grandfather's collection that I continue with 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:26.239
 the one that their father left them and the truth is 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.390
 that the first time I saw them I said what 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:30.180
 same 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.770
 that's why they had 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.829
 luckily grandpa found the way 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.769
 that I was interested 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.280
 for years he sent me mail one 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:43.320
 by one and next to each ticket I described 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.870
 the wonderful story of dreams 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:53.570
 who had fulfilled this is 250 years old 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.570
 from the first draw in 1763 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.210
 a fisherman of the time they touched him 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:04.690
 those five numbers changed his old boat 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.690
 by a large ship and became an explorer 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:15.370
 who got the one from 1837 he loved 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.670
 the animals and had them brought from the 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.140
 more remote places 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.140
 to mount a background 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.909
 1870 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.690
 This was a peasant in a year 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.690
 of great drought 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.780
 with the prize I buy an inn where 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.280
 invited everyone to eat 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.860
 literally 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.160
 to all the world 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.320
 with the 1911's the winner sent 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.730
 build a car to run the 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.730
 first race of Indianapolis 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.980
 and I think he won it 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:04.190
 if it's something I had heard 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.140
 with the award of this 86 a boy 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.720
 hint in his dream to create some 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.550
 revolutionary shoes and step 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.520
 he set up an amazing factory in which 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.870
 he worked all his people 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.450
 finally the letters stopped arriving 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.490
 in the last there was no story 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.490
 but if a ticket 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:40.740
 there is something bigger than turning 250 years 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.740
 do it fulfilling millions of dreams
