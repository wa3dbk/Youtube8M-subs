00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:09.510
 left ericeir 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.000
 and you watch the mouse review and test 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.590
 gaming mouse called blah i 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.020
 headshots in 3 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.270
 This mouse is interesting first of all 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.260
 whatever there is a specific software that 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.420
 allows you to compensate for returns 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.539
 automatic weapons and this and of course 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.570
 But check it out, but now 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.480
 look at the box as you see she 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.070
 framed very colorful with the mouse 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.090
 acts as a central element 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.730
 compositions as well as brand blady then 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.100
 plenty of red shouldn't be you 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.350
 surprise information on the packaging is not 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.340
 only allows optimal fast 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.800
 find out the main feature of this mouse but 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.640
 trying on a mouse without getting out of the box 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.920
 for this there is a special window 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.800
 the mouse is rich enough 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.530
 got unexpectedly rich for inexpensive 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.570
 mouse besides the mouse itself there and 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.150
 quick install guide 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.260
 and a cleaning rag and 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.909
 warranty card 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.810
 more nakleechki but this is not all 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.080
 separate software disk 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.170
 the provision and the fact that they do not even put 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.759
 every more expensive mouse spare 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.299
 teflon legs 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.030
 wired gaming mouse so the wire 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.090
 quite thick and protected special 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.619
 whip bends quite confidently does not interfere 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.909
 work and the mouse plug is not the usual 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.979
 gilded since it's a mouse 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.619
 focused primarily on shooters 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.850
 then a huge number of buttons for 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.659
 imam mice 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.220
 here you should not expect buttons moderately 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.009
 but actually they are quite 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.579
 enough as for normal office 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.399
 work so for work in various 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:02.000
 shooters and 100 such by the way say too 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.229
 this mouse is not installed the most 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.750
 highly sensitive sensor maximum 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.970
 Deepia 3200 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.860
 it is much lower than more 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.410
 advanced gaming mice 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.720
 but even this is not the highest 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.900
 now set it up for a comfortable game 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.750
 quite possible despite the presence of 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.480
 mouse backlight indicator de peau and on 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.920
 no mouse this is probably the main to 100 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.010
 wins for gamer 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.440
 but there is an indication of ultra core modes 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.680
 these are the modes that allow 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.330
 you get certain benefits in 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.000
 some categories 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.220
 games in this video review I will not 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.140
 dwell on the description 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.810
 software we already have 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.480
 there were reviews of these mice on the portal 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.489
 all fashion he will link to these reviews 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.190
 in the description there is a detailed description 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.980
 software 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:59.190
 here in the review I'll show you the same thing 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.340
 What are they buying mice with? 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:05.610
 functional ie show you what 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.250
 such an advantage of ultra core 3 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.220
 if used and correct 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.680
 configure yes yes exactly configure 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.019
 despite being bundled with higher 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.220
 there are certain profiles these profiles 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:22.470
 for a resolution of only 1024 by 768 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.280
 so even for a very limited circle 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.920
 of games 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.430
 that is, there is no such as the battle field of 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.840
 In general, well, we have proved that 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.070
 ultra core 3 advantage for shooters 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.600
 colossal 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.340
 using ultra core 3 and right 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.470
 setting it up your accuracy 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.320
 automatic weapons in various 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.170
 shooters will exceed all imaginable and 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.260
 unthinkable meanings you can say 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.900
 what is it cheat well basically yes it seems 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.870
 on cheat but here if it says cheat 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.880
 the main thing that it was not discovered hygiene 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.310
 for this for 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.190
 like this customized information 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.000
 already profiles for games sewn into memory 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.940
 mice 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.640
 as they say you are not undermining yourself 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.910
 time to sum up the floor blades headshots in 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.610
 3 mouse turned out interesting and stand 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.580
 the most important thing is not expensive even despite 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.709
 increased dollar she is excellent 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.970
 suitable for those players who love 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.210
 play shooters 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.760
 and also in other games where it is useful to him 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.370
 use macro well and in ordinary 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.250
 gaming and office muscle work is also not 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.170
 failing fails can be attributed not 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.360
 the most expensive materials that 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:38.060
 used in the design of this mouse and 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.970
 lack of dipyai indicator 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.700
 yet the rest of this mouse is beautiful and 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.550
