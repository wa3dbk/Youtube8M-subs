00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.240
 then there is a technique that we use 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.500
 at the pick called palm utah 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.570
 their palms it's the palm of the hand 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.790
 and better than that means blocked in 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.969
 actually it comes with the slice of the 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.730
 hand 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.669
 it's about blocking the resonance of 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.430
 ropes by putting it on the ya style of the 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:23.840
 horse like this and then with the 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.510
 picks we just play the strings 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.210
 no it allows to have one are slightly 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.300
 choked that gives another sound to 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.650
 the guitar we'll do that for example 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.379
 on 1 it was rare that if we 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.080
 make a friend in blues we will rather do 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.440
 friends like that to the day that the bodies of 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.870
 serious 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.440
 on the limit, but we only play 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.740
 the two graffiti bodies 5th and 6th string 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.950
 if I do not palm and miou chessa 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.540
 [Music] 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.820
 the notes continue to resonate he I have 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:58.460
 a lot of newt g1 are more deaf 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.650
 more clearer medium in the attacks 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.540
 so what we can do is play 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.540
 twice sown 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.880
 and then with the little finger you 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.799
 come and put your finger on the 4th 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.400
 box of the fifth string while 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:23.500
 keeping the first one here must of course 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:26.299
 [Music] 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.630
 you do that then we can very well 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:41.450
 to make a rhythm of blues a pump blot 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:43.700
 his call on the mit have can do the 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.979
 same thing by going down the finger of 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:53.479
 a rope and we attack years from 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:54.920
 of the fifth string it is 1 1 there 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.179
 this is the second agreement is the 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.539
 third agreement that we will do is 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:00.500
 1st must here then for beginners it 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:02.390
 is going to be a little bit like saying 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.349
 acrobatic that is to say we will do 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.360
 benoit 9th must see well so the 

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:11.329
 first must and on the fifth string 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:16.010
 second box the number two finger and 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:17.269
 on the 4th strings fourth box and the 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.900
 little finger so that's why he 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:22.880
 must be well positioned actually his thumb 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.700
 no i was showing this the camera the thumb 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.569
 ideas there in relation to 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.590
 fingers ie it's actually 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.900
 located between the first and the second 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.750
 must and the little finger that comes on the 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:40.640
 6th box of this fourth when that 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:42.590
 does it like that to my of course there 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.900
 [Music] 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.040
 or there can be used for for 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.959
 first and second positions I you 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.730
 showed either the fourth finger as 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:56.150
 me I do or third must if you 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.150
 who see
