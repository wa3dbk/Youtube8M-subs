jazz<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:15.540> was<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.690> large<00:00:16.020> case<00:00:16.320> with<00:00:16.680> you

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
jazz and I was a large case with you

tell<00:00:17.279> what<00:00:17.400> it<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:17.640> rather<00:00:17.880> than<00:00:18.029> what<00:00:18.150> could

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
tell what it is rather than what could

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.910 
tell what it is rather than what could
be<00:00:20.990> the<00:00:21.990> only<00:00:22.140> other<00:00:22.320> way<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.470> can<00:00:22.680> you<00:00:22.800> can

there's<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.410> couple<00:00:25.590> five<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.490> goes<00:00:26.640> to

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
there's a couple five of it goes to

there's a couple five of it goes to
harmonic<00:00:27.119> minor<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.449> guess<00:00:27.630> at<00:00:27.779> one<00:00:27.930> section<00:00:28.349> or

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
harmonic minor I guess at one section or

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.009 
harmonic minor I guess at one section or
look<00:00:28.619> at<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.830> belly<00:00:29.480> but<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.720> could<00:00:30.869> also

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
look at the belly but you could also

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.780 
look at the belly but you could also
think<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.560> as<00:00:31.650> your<00:00:31.800> an<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:32.099> minor<00:00:32.430> for<00:00:32.730> the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
think of it as your an a minor for the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.120 
think of it as your an a minor for the
first<00:00:33.059> date<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.750> modulates<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.440> see<00:00:34.800> you

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
first date and it modulates to see you

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.250 
first date and it modulates to see you
know<00:00:35.250> relative<00:00:35.670> minor<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:36.149> relative<00:00:36.780> minor<00:00:37.020> to

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
know relative minor a relative minor to

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.350

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
those I hear that almost feels more like

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.229 
those I hear that almost feels more like
one<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.289> six<00:00:49.559> but<00:00:50.309> what's<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.700> difference<00:00:50.820> one

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
one in six but what's the difference one

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.910 
one in six but what's the difference one
in<00:00:51.360> six<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.840> three<00:00:51.960> they're<00:00:52.110> all<00:00:52.260> tiny<00:00:52.469> chords

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
in six and three they're all tiny chords

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.560 
in six and three they're all tiny chords
it's<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.219> same<00:00:53.460> thing<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.059> it's<00:00:54.180> not<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.420> whole

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
it's the same thing so it's not a whole

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.889 
it's the same thing so it's not a whole
lot<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.719> difference<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.949> coughing<00:00:56.370> wise

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
lot of difference so coughing wise

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:16.850 
lot of difference so coughing wise
Aeolian<00:00:57.899> right

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.319

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329 
anytime I want to have a 5 chord go and

anytime I want to have a 5 chord go and
do<00:01:19.479> anything<00:01:19.780> I<00:01:20.079> always<00:01:20.110> alter<00:01:35.759> just<00:01:36.759> in<00:01:36.880> the

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939

Mele when you're playing the tune you

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:39.810 
Mele when you're playing the tune you
don't<00:01:38.140> have<00:01:38.259> to<00:01:38.350> stick<00:01:38.530> with<00:01:38.560> it<00:01:38.799> and<00:01:39.159> then

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
don't have to stick with it and then

00:01:39.820 --> 00:02:03.380 
don't have to stick with it and then
five<00:01:40.149> seven<00:01:40.600> of<00:01:40.689> two<00:01:40.960> rather<00:01:41.740> than<00:01:41.860> is<00:01:42.039> five

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.609 

looks<00:02:04.390> like<00:02:04.539> the<00:02:04.659> second<00:02:05.020> day<00:02:05.049> is<00:02:05.200> basically

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
looks like the second day is basically

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.400 
looks like the second day is basically
the<00:02:06.099> the<00:02:06.789> same<00:02:06.819> it<00:02:07.270> just<00:02:07.450> has<00:02:07.569> a<00:02:07.599> contiguous

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
the the same it just has a contiguous

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.100 
the the same it just has a contiguous
okay<00:02:08.950> come<00:02:09.130> to<00:02:09.610> five<00:02:09.819> so<00:02:10.720> let<00:02:10.840> me<00:02:10.899> do<00:02:11.019> it<00:02:11.080> again

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
okay come to five so let me do it again

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:45.569 
okay come to five so let me do it again
slow<00:02:11.440> so<00:02:40.950> there<00:02:41.950> was<00:02:42.130> a<00:02:42.600> minor<00:02:43.600> a<00:02:44.019> seven<00:02:44.579> 130

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
slow so there was a minor a seven 130

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.180 
slow so there was a minor a seven 130
and<00:02:45.880> I'm<00:02:46.030> actually<00:02:46.269> doing<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.750> sub<00:02:47.049> of<00:02:47.590> this

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
and I'm actually doing the sub of this

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.559 
and I'm actually doing the sub of this

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:31.559 
just slightly button which is flogging
minor<00:03:26.730> touch<00:03:27.730> that<00:03:27.969> usually<00:03:28.269> just<00:03:29.969> that's<00:03:30.969> in

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
minor touch that usually just that's in

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.420 
minor touch that usually just that's in
jazz<00:03:31.870> you<00:03:31.900> don't<00:03:32.290> do<00:03:32.379> that<00:03:32.560> very<00:03:32.590> often<00:03:32.919> it's

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
jazz you don't do that very often it's

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.509 
jazz you don't do that very often it's
usually<00:03:33.579> all<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:38.500> what<00:03:38.829> I<00:03:38.859> like<00:03:39.099> on<00:03:39.280> five
