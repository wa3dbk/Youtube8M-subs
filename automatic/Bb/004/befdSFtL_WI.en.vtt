would say that the declining use might

there has been a discussion about the

West Virginia School where they have an

omm student clinic and they actually

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.600 
omm student clinic and they actually
have<00:05:39.300> an<00:05:39.480> opportunity<00:05:39.720> to<00:05:40.260> have<00:05:40.590> their<00:05:40.620> skills

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
have an opportunity to have their skills

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.320 
have an opportunity to have their skills
supervised<00:05:42.710> before<00:05:43.710> their<00:05:44.330> clinical

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.390 
supervised before their clinical
rotation<00:05:45.900> so<00:05:46.050> this<00:05:46.200> builds<00:05:46.620> more<00:05:46.830> confidence
