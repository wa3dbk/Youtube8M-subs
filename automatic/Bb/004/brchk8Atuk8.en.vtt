shipping and this was delivered from

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.679 
shipping and this was delivered from
China<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.509> let's<00:01:27.840> go<00:01:27.990> ahead<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.710> install<00:01:29.369> this

China so let's go ahead and install this

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.539 
China so let's go ahead and install this
so<00:01:31.400> I've<00:01:32.400> actually<00:01:32.700> got<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.390> extender<00:01:34.049> out<00:01:34.200> or

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
so I've actually got the extender out or

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.660 
so I've actually got the extender out or
the<00:01:35.549> iPad<00:01:36.180> Mini<00:01:36.509> holder<00:01:37.110> or<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.680> FPV<00:01:38.070> holder

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.059 
view that's the back the rear the
left-hand<00:02:54.730> side<00:02:54.970> and<00:02:55.390> we<00:02:55.450> also<00:02:56.290> have<00:02:56.920> the

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
left-hand side and we also have the

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.360 
left-hand side and we also have the
right-hand<00:02:57.549> side<00:02:58.110> where<00:02:59.110> we<00:02:59.290> can<00:02:59.530> plug<00:02:59.980> our

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
right-hand side where we can plug our

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.330 
right-hand side where we can plug our
you<00:03:01.239> must<00:03:01.420> be<00:03:01.599> cabling<00:03:02.200> so<00:03:02.860> let's<00:03:03.040> go<00:03:03.190> ahead

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
you must be cabling so let's go ahead

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.830 
you must be cabling so let's go ahead
and<00:03:03.790> do<00:03:04.000> that<00:03:05.700> so<00:03:06.700> plugging<00:03:07.030> that<00:03:07.390> into<00:03:07.629> the

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
and do that so plugging that into the

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.100 
and do that so plugging that into the
iPad<00:03:08.260> and<00:03:08.950> we<00:03:09.340> plug<00:03:09.610> this<00:03:09.819> into<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.720> DJI

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
iPad and we plug this into the DJI

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:17.490 
iPad and we plug this into the DJI
phantom<00:03:11.709> 3<00:03:13.739> controller<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:16.420> this<00:03:17.019> is<00:03:17.200> what<00:03:17.380> it

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
phantom 3 controller and this is what it

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.940 
phantom 3 controller and this is what it
looks<00:03:17.709> like<00:03:18.040> ultimately<00:03:19.680> so<00:03:20.680> what<00:03:20.829> I'll

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
looks like ultimately so what I'll

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.280 
looks like ultimately so what I'll
probably<00:03:21.100> do<00:03:21.459> is<00:03:21.730> test<00:03:22.120> this<00:03:22.269> out<00:03:22.480> fully<00:03:22.870> when

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
probably do is test this out fully when

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.970 
probably do is test this out fully when
I'm<00:03:23.410> flying<00:03:23.769> and<00:03:24.569> see<00:03:25.569> how<00:03:25.959> well<00:03:26.709> this

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
I'm flying and see how well this

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.849 
I'm flying and see how well this
actually<00:03:27.250> holds<00:03:27.880> up<00:03:28.000> in<00:03:28.239> real<00:03:28.510> life<00:03:28.780> so<00:03:29.769> the

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
actually holds up in real life so the

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:33.199 
actually holds up in real life so the
concept<00:03:30.400> basically<00:03:31.030> is<00:03:31.269> to<00:03:31.720> take<00:03:32.349> away<00:03:32.709> glare

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
concept basically is to take away glare

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.789 
concept basically is to take away glare
while<00:03:34.209> you<00:03:34.389> actually<00:03:34.750> flying<00:03:35.139> the<00:03:35.319> device

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
while you actually flying the device

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:41.610 
while you actually flying the device
itself<00:03:37.920> let<00:03:38.920> me<00:03:39.040> take<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.430> case<00:03:40.230> so<00:03:41.230> you<00:03:41.290> can

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
itself let me take the case so you can

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.089 
itself let me take the case so you can
get<00:03:41.829> a<00:03:41.859> better<00:03:42.040> view<00:03:42.190> of<00:03:43.260> what<00:03:44.260> this<00:03:44.530> looks

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
get a better view of what this looks

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:52.530 
get a better view of what this looks
like<00:03:49.109> again<00:03:50.109> we<00:03:50.260> can<00:03:50.440> adjust<00:03:50.650> the<00:03:51.160> angle<00:03:51.540> like

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
like again we can adjust the angle like

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:05.080 
like again we can adjust the angle like
so<00:03:56.790> turn<00:03:57.790> around

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.879 

so<00:04:06.090> that<00:04:06.599> is<00:04:06.810> all<00:04:06.989> today<00:04:07.319> I'm<00:04:07.499> just<00:04:07.709> going<00:04:07.859> to

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
so that is all today I'm just going to

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:10.610 
so that is all today I'm just going to
do<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.129> unpackaging<00:04:08.819> and<00:04:09.060> again<00:04:09.810> give<00:04:10.260> me<00:04:10.290> a

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
do the unpackaging and again give me a

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.369 
do the unpackaging and again give me a
few<00:04:10.950> days<00:04:11.219> or<00:04:11.459> so<00:04:11.489> and<00:04:12.329> I'll<00:04:12.810> probably<00:04:13.079> do<00:04:13.349> a

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
few days or so and I'll probably do a

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.360 
few days or so and I'll probably do a
full<00:04:13.709> review<00:04:14.069> so<00:04:14.849> again<00:04:15.120> if<00:04:15.299> you<00:04:15.450> want<00:04:15.659> me<00:04:15.870> to

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
full review so again if you want me to

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.339 
full review so again if you want me to
put<00:04:17.370> a<00:04:17.400> link<00:04:17.579> in<00:04:17.729> the<00:04:17.759> description<00:04:18.079> to<00:04:19.079> where<00:04:19.320> I

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
put a link in the description to where I

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:22.460 
put a link in the description to where I
purchased<00:04:19.799> this<00:04:20.220> from<00:04:20.720> just<00:04:21.720> leave<00:04:22.199> some

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
purchased this from just leave some

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.409 
purchased this from just leave some
messages<00:04:22.979> and<00:04:23.250> if<00:04:23.310> I<00:04:23.430> get<00:04:23.639> enough<00:04:23.910> then<00:04:24.210> I

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
messages and if I get enough then I

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.420 
messages and if I get enough then I
would<00:04:24.960> do<00:04:25.110> that<00:04:25.289> okay

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
would do that okay

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.990 
would do that okay
destroy<00:04:26.849> random<00:04:27.210> and<00:04:27.389> amount<00:04:27.630> thanks
