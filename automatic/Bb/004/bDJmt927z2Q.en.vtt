00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.720
 good after the hip prosthesis 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.450
 it arose 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.520
 before the knee prosthesis and those 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.070
 10-15 years that takes advantage of it 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.900
 are noticing and lately the advances in 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.510
 the designs and materials of the 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.660
 hip prostheses far outweigh 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.390
 the results of the prostheses of 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.180
 knee and that makes patients 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.509
 young people we encourage more to put them 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.520
 Hip prosthesis is also true that 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.980
 thanks to the development of arthroscopy 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.800
 of hip which is a technique minimally 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:42.200
 invasive we are trying patients 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.570
 that have a femoroacetabular shock and 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.740
 precisely delay them putting a 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.840
 protein that degenerates in the 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.100
 articulation as to put a 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.660
 hip prosthesis 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.370
 but yes it is true that sometimes 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.710
 we are late and when the patient 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.900
 comes to see us your hip is no longer 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.390
 salvable and you have to put a prosthesis 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.730
 and this thing that 30 years ago was a drama 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.500
 because today it is not and the truth is that the 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.150
 patients have a very good quality 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.820
 of life makes a life practically 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.820
 normal even at recreational level and 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.580
 sport without without a strong intensity 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.920
 but they are patients who can recover 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.560
 his life just like we put implants 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.690
 dental a lot more than before and every time 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.400
 patients is more frequent than there 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.200
 an implant a lot of the people we see 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.290
 down the street he has a hip implant 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.540
 a prosthesis of bartenders to the yes is 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.460
 true that these patients are 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.590
 tributaries of different prostheses 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.840
 that is to say the prosthesis that we put to a 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.670
 70-year-old patient is not the same 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.850
 prosthesis that we put a patient's 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.340
 40 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.159
 first for the materials we use 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.049
 let's say they are titanium with 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.049
 an elasticity more similar to that of 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.090
 bone are not cemented are implants 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.540
 who seek to take advantage of the ability to 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.729
 Bone regeneration of the young patient are 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.800
 smaller implants that allow us 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.470
 conserve bone for tomorrow 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.780
 and the friction torque is usually ceramic 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.360
 pottery that allows us not to 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.710
 wear one of the pieces that used to be 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.400
 used with our that was plastic 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.350
 Well now it's a ceramic prosthesis 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.720
 that makes this not wear out this is 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.320
 a material that practically has 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.250
 zero wear and that makes the life of 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.830
 this prosthesis 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.290
 look at how long this prosthesis is going to 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:32.040
 last in the body is superior to that of 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:35.040
 before almost 20-25 years the patients by 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.550
 so young people taking advantage of 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.870
 advantages that your youth has and 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.390
 restricting certain activities of 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.480
 very high impact can have a life 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.120
 very normal with a hip prosthesis and 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.209
 practically not noticeable and have a 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.040
 recreational and recreational and sports life 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:56.000
 quite similar to what actions the 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.000
 patients of his age
