00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:41.020
 when we didn’t go 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.020

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.130

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.730
 but grade 5 is indicated 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:10.740
 and 95 there and I do not see why it is so still 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:16.549
 92 diesel 98 times and all this certificates 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.549
 95 I do not see here please see 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.820
 here's a copy is true what's good 95 3 class 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:39.280
 I did not confuse this next 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:42.580
 Look at the next view 1 and you do not know 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.860
 what is not just 3 classes and 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.110
 Russia is the thirteenth year was still 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.710
 the party made it 100 this is very old 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.290
 is between yes it is very no no you 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.920
 look in here is my course dear 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.560
 customers 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.070
 certificate of conformity goes further 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.030
 here 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.070
 application to the certificate here 92 here 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:08.009
 is empty 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:13.150
 99 flax and summer fuel here is empty 98 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:14.950
 is empty and all of us are looking for documents without 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.320
 dolemeter documents implement this 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.080
 type of fuel for the documents that we 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.970
 showed fuel does not match but also 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:27.450
 it is clear that the document is old and trying 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.450
 help in this matter is good here 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.750
 95 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.599
 if you take it he is he with us here 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:53.120
 then basically talked so I will do 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:57.140
 here and so even look at us it is available 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:01.200
 pure 98 on additives slightly 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:05.959
 stuffed with additives 95 and very strong 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:08.790
 parting his wife 92 here it is the color scale 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:13.340
 any color change suggests that 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:16.340
 there are prohibited additives opened them 92 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.340
 we charge 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.040
 we lower 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:30.349
 99 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:42.070
 99 we know this why it is because 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:48.580
 a lot of additives in this gasoline 99 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:48.580
 impossible next 95 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:05.390
 something like 93 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.760
 93 again 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.380
 minus three ie a decline of 95 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.380
 minimally 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.150
 93 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.240
 93 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:55.700
 93 aggressively 93 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:05:01.130
 my opinion in this case is 95 more 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:03.710
 complies with the regulations than the rest 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:08.870
 gasoline and octane are present here 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:10.490
 the number 92 is overpriced color incomprehensible want 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.710
 it is not known how it should be 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.690
 additives additive constant is very 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.850
 seriously and from there it is possible and 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:20.420
 economically interesting to the fifth 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:22.360
 relatively clean turned transplants 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:26.930
 practically no them noticed by 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:30.320
 the indicator octane number 93 of 95 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:32.270
 I recommend a small error 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:37.870
 that is, I'm not afraid to refuel 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:41.390
 such gasoline is true on 98 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:45.530
 showed the same with 95 drowned number 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:48.770
 there are enough additives to 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.890
 do not pour it into your tank and then decide 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.890
 yourself
