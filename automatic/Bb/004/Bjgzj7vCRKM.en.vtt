00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.010
 good morning everyone is like this we start with the report of in time 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.350
 currently the activity is quite active worth the redundancy is all the 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.599
 passion of the Atlantic we notice the next tropical wave which has a 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:19.390
 60% of the village development unit during the next 48 hours continues 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.239
 enough to be reviewed and we continue to take a look at this 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.419
 region meanwhile that a little more west katia 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.669
 it's a category four hurricane continues to move towards the northwest 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:35.230
 at a rate of 10 miles per hour and its winds are before 125 miles 

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:39.250
 per hour so pretty strong this hurricane will by now stay away 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.670
 of the entire coastal portion before the American nation thanks to a 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.159
 system of high pressure to which in catia will be fair tomorrow not all the 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:46.900
 periphery 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.550
 d this system of high pressure and also the remains also what was 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.920
 the tropical storm emily 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.660
 they are keeping katia quite far from the entire coastal population 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.930
 from the northeast of the country where the rains continue today 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.370
 and will continue in the course of the next days here of land is 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.790
 quite saturated yes you have to be very careful we can wait 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.870
 flash floods from passion in new england will the entire region 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:11.740
 of the Atlantic 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.450
 central for now we here the state of the sun we will continue low 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.530
 fairly stable conditions to the south of florida the remains 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.039
 of the stationary band 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:23.569
 will continue where noted from the central portion of the florida so therefore 

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:27.169
 we can expect that the commissions begin to enter little by little into the 

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:30.369
 This work week will be increasing the probability of 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.629
 squalls all over south florida currently temperatures enough 

00:01:33.629 --> 00:01:38.520
 central uniform bcu came down from the integrated cars the wind this time the south and 

00:01:38.519 --> 00:01:41.759
 will be maintained in this way yes we can expect that the downpours will be 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.899
 quite isolated one day very similar to what we had yesterday on Monday the 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.289
 wind from the extra maritime sector before the southwest basin that will be 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.349
 bringing their and pretty maeder hangovers across the regions and that 

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:57.819
 caution for the panistas this afternoon the maximum temperature reaches less 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:02.109
 about twenty-three sections and quite stable conditions also for this 

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:05.689
 Tuesday and at six ten in the morning we throw a magazine to the conditions 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.929
 of traffic we notice 6 75 in which he starts to narrate a little more than 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.200
 activity since many people return to work and also to the 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.530
 school today tuesday the prayer is loud and everything flows normally 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.489
 setbacks in the meantime construction work forget the 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:20.989
 closing 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.570
 d the right lanes 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.240
 in the northbound Palmetto and Northwest 36th Street an accident with injuries 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.630
 caused the closing of the sidewalk ramp streets the tenth the 9 northwest of 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.380
 zela and 95 days hours and that a lot of caution when driving lccu and happiness 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.410
 I tell you about the ide and zinc that there are not enough signs in that list 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:42.809
