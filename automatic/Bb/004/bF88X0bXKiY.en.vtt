this particular mold this is then a this
is<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.059> race<00:00:42.210> mode<00:00:42.570> at<00:00:42.870> high<00:00:43.050> boost<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.770> then

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
is the race mode at high boost and then

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.910 
is the race mode at high boost and then
we<00:00:45.360> are<00:00:45.480> also<00:00:45.660> going<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.200> turn<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.530> boost<00:00:46.710> down

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
we are also going to turn the boost down

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.360 
we are also going to turn the boost down
and<00:00:47.190> do<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.399> street<00:00:47.789> tune-up<00:00:48.690> for<00:00:48.930> him<00:00:49.219> and<00:00:50.219> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
and do a street tune-up for him and the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.790 
and do a street tune-up for him and the
1500<00:00:51.059> horsepower<00:00:51.180> range<00:00:51.870> right<00:00:52.320> around<00:00:52.500> there

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
1500 horsepower range right around there

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.930 
1500 horsepower range right around there
so<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:54.350> again<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.680> 526<00:00:56.579> cubic

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
this is all our dyno setup here so the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.760 
this is all our dyno setup here so the
tubing<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.180> whatnot<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.630> wiring<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.560> things

get<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.009> lot<00:01:41.159> cleaner<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:42.180> better<00:01:42.720> looking<00:01:42.990> but

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
get a lot cleaner and better looking but

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.399 
get a lot cleaner and better looking but
this<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> manifold<00:01:45.420> we<00:01:45.600> had<00:01:45.689> CFE<00:01:46.170> do<00:01:46.350> for<00:01:46.649> us

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
this is a manifold we had CFE do for us

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.469 
this is a manifold we had CFE do for us
and<00:01:48.530> so<00:01:49.490> far<00:01:49.700> this<00:01:49.850> has<00:01:49.999> been<00:01:50.030> a<00:01:50.119> real<00:01:50.329> good

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
and so far this has been a real good

the<00:01:58.819> tripod<00:01:58.909> and<00:01:59.390> then<00:02:00.140> we<00:02:00.350> will<00:02:00.530> come<00:02:00.710> back

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
the tripod and then we will come back

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:53.470 
the tripod and then we will come back
and<00:02:02.439> go<00:02:03.439> over<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:03.829> numbers

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.600 

all<00:02:54.480> right<00:02:54.689> now<00:02:54.900> we're<00:02:55.080> here<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.459> looking<00:02:56.459> at

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
all right now we're here and looking at

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.140 
all right now we're here and looking at
the<00:02:56.670> numbers<00:02:57.860> you'll<00:02:58.860> see<00:02:59.010> that<00:02:59.220> here<00:02:59.760> through

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
the numbers you'll see that here through

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.600 
the numbers you'll see that here through
here<00:03:00.360> it<00:03:00.510> kind<00:03:00.720> of<00:03:00.950> swept<00:03:01.950> a<00:03:02.040> little<00:03:02.250> fast

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
here it kind of swept a little fast

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.580 
here it kind of swept a little fast
anytime<00:03:02.939> my<00:03:03.090> Dino<00:03:03.269> sleeps<00:03:03.629> a<00:03:03.750> little<00:03:04.230> too<00:03:04.319> fast

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
anytime my Dino sleeps a little too fast

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.080 
anytime my Dino sleeps a little too fast
it<00:03:04.920> won't<00:03:05.040> collect<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.459> number<00:03:05.610> won't<00:03:05.909> give

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
it won't collect the number won't give

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.690 
it won't collect the number won't give
us<00:03:06.209> a<00:03:06.390> kind<00:03:06.989> of<00:03:07.110> reading<00:03:07.470> there<00:03:07.680> so<00:03:08.340> every<00:03:08.549> time

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
us a kind of reading there so every time

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
numbers there that means that it just

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.649

swept<00:03:15.480> a<00:03:15.599> little<00:03:15.810> too<00:03:15.900> fast<00:03:17.150> but<00:03:18.150> we<00:03:18.390> go<00:03:18.480> I'll

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:18.659 
swept a little too fast but we go I'll

to<00:04:08.010> continue<00:04:08.220> to<00:04:08.400> do<00:04:08.459> a<00:04:08.489> little<00:04:08.669> bit<00:04:08.790> of

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
to continue to do a little bit of

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:09.949 
to continue to do a little bit of
testing<00:04:08.970> on<00:04:09.209> this<00:04:09.389> but<00:04:09.510> like<00:04:09.599> I<00:04:09.660> said<00:04:09.810> we're

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
testing on this but like I said we're

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.720 
testing on this but like I said we're
gonna<00:04:10.049> actually<00:04:10.319> detune<00:04:10.859> this<00:04:11.129> just<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:11.489> little

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
gonna actually detune this just a little

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.259 
gonna actually detune this just a little
bit<00:04:12.290> and<00:04:13.290> not<00:04:14.190> quite<00:04:14.430> lean<00:04:14.609> on<00:04:14.760> it<00:04:14.879> quite<00:04:15.090> so

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
bit and not quite lean on it quite so

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.349 
bit and not quite lean on it quite so
hard<00:04:15.739> actually<00:04:16.739> you<00:04:17.250> know<00:04:17.340> 29<00:04:17.729> pounds<00:04:17.940> really

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
hard actually you know 29 pounds really

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.229 
hard actually you know 29 pounds really
isn't<00:04:18.479> all<00:04:18.660> that<00:04:18.720> hard<00:04:19.019> at<00:04:19.199> all<00:04:19.370> we<00:04:20.370> only<00:04:20.789> spent

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
isn't all that hard at all we only spent

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.339 
isn't all that hard at all we only spent
in<00:04:21.329> the<00:04:21.449> blower<00:04:21.660> with<00:04:21.989> a<00:04:22.019> 127<00:04:23.630> gear<00:04:24.630> set<00:04:24.900> ratio

gears<00:04:27.150> gear<00:04:27.599> ratios<00:04:29.419> but<00:04:30.419> a<00:04:30.750> pretty<00:04:31.169> good

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
gears gear ratios but a pretty good

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.350 
gears gear ratios but a pretty good
piece<00:04:31.560> we<00:04:32.400> could<00:04:32.550> make<00:04:32.699> some<00:04:32.820> more<00:04:32.880> horsepower

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
piece we could make some more horsepower

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.850
