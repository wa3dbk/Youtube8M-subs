foodist this was in 1993 so I went away

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.910 
foodist this was in 1993 so I went away
and<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.719> looked<00:00:39.840> into<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.559> realised<00:00:40.829> I

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
and I looked into it and I realised I

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.500 
and I looked into it and I realised I
was<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.100> real<00:00:41.340> food<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:41.969> made<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.270> conscious

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
was a real food and I made the conscious

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.240 
was a real food and I made the conscious
decision<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:43.350> become<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.649> raw<00:00:43.890> foodist

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
decision to become a raw foodist

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.279 
decision to become a raw foodist
probably<00:00:44.789> paradoxically<00:00:45.660> at<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.899> point<00:00:46.140> I

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
probably paradoxically at that point I

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.520 
probably paradoxically at that point I
started<00:00:46.440> eating<00:00:46.680> less<00:00:47.070> raw<00:00:47.309> foods<00:00:48.530> because

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
started eating less raw foods because

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.779 
started eating less raw foods because

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
doing it intuitively I was really kind

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.130 
doing it intuitively I was really kind
of<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.430> know<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.969> my<00:00:54.180> flow<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.750> then<00:00:54.930> when<00:00:55.050> I
