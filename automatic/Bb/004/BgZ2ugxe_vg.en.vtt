think about Sammy Watkins I think he's

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.350 
think about Sammy Watkins I think he's
probably<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.680> most<00:00:34.739> agile<00:00:35.160> player<00:00:35.910> in<00:00:36.120> the

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
probably the most agile player in the

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.030 
probably the most agile player in the
strap<00:00:36.600> he<00:00:36.780> may<00:00:36.989> not<00:00:37.110> be<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.380> strongest<00:00:37.770> but

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
strap he may not be the strongest but

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.650 
strap he may not be the strongest but
he's<00:00:38.280> definitely<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.940> quickest<00:00:39.270> most<00:00:39.420> agile

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
he's definitely the quickest most agile

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.220 
he's definitely the quickest most agile
he's<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> playmaker<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.670> speed<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.140> he<00:00:43.140> is

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
he's a playmaker and the speed is he is

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.380 
he's a playmaker and the speed is he is
probably<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.890> most<00:00:44.100> deceptive<00:00:44.640> speed<00:00:44.969> in

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
probably the most deceptive speed in

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.100 
probably the most deceptive speed in
this<00:00:45.570> dress<00:00:45.809> track<00:00:46.170> runner<00:00:47.090> yeah<00:00:48.090> he<00:00:48.180> was<00:00:48.360> I
