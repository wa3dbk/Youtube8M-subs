00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
was like oh my god what did i do like I

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.510 
was like oh my god what did i do like I
had<00:01:24.030> cut<00:01:24.360> four<00:01:24.869> inches<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:26.009> wasn't<00:01:26.369> until

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
had cut four inches and it wasn't until

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.780 
had cut four inches and it wasn't until
I<00:01:26.729> took<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.210> down<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.570> next<00:01:27.869> day<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.320> I

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
I took it down the next day that I

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.370 
I took it down the next day that I
really<00:01:29.790> could<00:01:30.000> see<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.540> amount<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:30.960> i<00:01:31.140> cut

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
really could see the amount that i cut

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.090 
really could see the amount that i cut
now<00:01:32.030> it<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.210> bittersweet<00:01:33.689> because<00:01:34.229> those<00:01:34.650> ends

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
now it is bittersweet because those ends

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.370 
now it is bittersweet because those ends
definitely<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.790> hundred<00:01:36.210> percent<00:01:36.360> needed<00:01:37.200> to

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
definitely a hundred percent needed to

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.580 
definitely a hundred percent needed to
go<00:01:37.880> if<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.060> was<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.540> go<00:01:39.689> back<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.049> do<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.409> again

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
go if I was to go back and do it again

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.520 
go if I was to go back and do it again
though<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.340> probably<00:01:41.759> would<00:01:42.509> have<00:01:42.659> done<00:01:42.990> a

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
though I probably would have done a

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.319 
though I probably would have done a
little<00:01:44.430> bit<00:01:44.670> less<00:01:45.090> just<00:01:46.049> for<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.829> shock<00:01:47.159> value

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
little bit less just for the shock value

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.770 
little bit less just for the shock value
that<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.479> had<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:49.140> know<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.439> me<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:50.780> probably

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
that it had you know on me I probably

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.590 
that it had you know on me I probably
would<00:01:52.200> have<00:01:52.290> stuck<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.009> two<00:01:53.939> inches<00:01:54.390> i

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
would have stuck to the two inches i

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.420 
would have stuck to the two inches i
think<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.930> was<00:01:55.200> what<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.560> was<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:56.399> know

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
think it was what I was you know

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.980 
think it was what I was you know
planning<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.119> do<00:01:57.270> every<00:01:57.540> time<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:57.719> got<00:01:57.960> a

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
planning to do every time I got a

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.830 
planning to do every time I got a
relaxer<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:58.920> um<00:01:59.420> like<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.450> said<00:02:00.540> it's

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
relaxer so um like I said it's

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.289 
relaxer so um like I said it's
bittersweet<00:02:01.140> I'm<00:02:01.649> glad<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.490> those<00:02:02.850> ends<00:02:03.180> are

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
bittersweet I'm glad that those ends are

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.860 
bittersweet I'm glad that those ends are
gone<00:02:03.509> but<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:04.469> did<00:02:04.950> feel<00:02:05.790> like<00:02:05.850> whoa

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
gone but I did feel like whoa

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.109 
gone but I did feel like whoa
maybe<00:02:07.050> I<00:02:07.200> didn't<00:02:07.680> have<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:08.040> cut<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.610> much<00:02:08.910> at

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
maybe I didn't have to cut so much at

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.710 
maybe I didn't have to cut so much at
