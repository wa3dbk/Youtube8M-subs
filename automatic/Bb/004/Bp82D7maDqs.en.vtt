00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.620
 now 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.850
 and wait until it loads it will take 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.850
 a little time 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.110
 it is worth a little wait 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.810
 Well, she booted 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.490
 after the program is complete 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:47.980
 plunged you need to open the super tab 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:49.660
 start then choose the java version here 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.790
 see you provide a few of her 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.340
 species if you don't know which one 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.480
 I will restore the statement then press 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.780
 lowest point 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.720
 Now open a window like this should be here 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.260
 specify the path to the folder with the location of java 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.720
 as a rule, it is on one path 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:12.610
 this is my computer local drive c 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.440
 java program files after this transition 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.700
 you will see what version you have 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.730
 my case is jerry and 7 is me 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.510
 close and here choose fats and style 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.720
 so those knowing that I have windows 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.610
 64-bit 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.440
 then i choose j7 them 54 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.440
 then we just need to define in with 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.940
 the build we want to put my 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.070
 case i want to put 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.260

 for maycroft version 172 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:50.829
 I know the order number in advance therefore 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.829
 just a bitumen download button 3020 and 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.459

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.880
 went loading bar you need to remember 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.040
 and wait for it to complete you can 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.620
 choose a different build for any 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.319
 another version accordingly she will have 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.730
 different order and need to find out the number and 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.830
 get acquainted with the assemblies 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.350
 you can on the official website bouquet 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.440
 link to it will be presented in 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.069
 description under the roller after the end 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.130
 downloads 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.690
 server folder should appear bright 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.569
 file 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.890
 craftbukkit and plug-ins folder making sure 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.970
 in their appearance 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:34.140
 go back to the program and click 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.140
 launch server 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.290
 You've got to wait a little while to be held 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:58.390
 full load it also does not take much 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:04:02.579
 Time is literally half a minute to a minute 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.579
 In general, the clock then loads the server 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:12.439
 we see that the percentage is okay 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.439
 girl error does not produce 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.609
 and so my server booted this one 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.370
 inscription 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:25.199
 indicates that the download is complete 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:28.110
 then you need to configure our server for 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:36.610
 press the stop button and go 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:41.270
 server option so here we find 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:44.290
 online mod value and true 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.290
 change to falls 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:55.030
 also we change the server name i will give 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.030
 name type ceilings 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.840
 basically everything 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.449
 Now you yourself can go to your 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:13.590
 server for this in the general tab 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:13.590
 We press start and open the game maincraft 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.020
 Of course, before the opening of minecraft 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.380
 you need to wait 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.180
 I have a full load of the sector 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.850
 booted up now i'll open minecraft 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:31.470
 so I loaded minecraft and for call 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:33.690
 on the server click the network game here I have 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.340
 appeared automatically server minecraft 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.560
 server and portal 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.810
 if you don't automatically have it 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:43.800
 then you can add it click dad 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:47.130
 add server ip address write 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:53.160

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:57.120

00:05:53.160 --> 00:06:00.860
 mikro for the portal also added let's go 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.860
 on any animal 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.070
 wait for loading 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.530
 Yes, it would be necessary to fly over the game world 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:17.710
 for this we give admin rights 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:22.870
 and 5 we go into the program and cap and 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:28.620
 and give admin for this we write a command 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:28.620
 about and flexible and fact so maniacs 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:38.469
 and now we will give strands in this window 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:40.989
 by the way shows the effect then present 

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:44.110
 you can kick all over him 

00:06:40.989 --> 00:06:50.189
 ban and here give creative and so on 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:50.189
 but more on that later so back in the game 

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:58.610

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:11.330
 there is only one single 

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:14.659
 problem you can't call people on 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:17.839
 your set and since they just donâ€™t 

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:20.989
 can bend so that they can 

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:24.080
 go you need to open ports like this 

00:07:20.989 --> 00:07:25.650
