00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
should be noted that obon Daley Thompson

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.870 
should be noted that obon Daley Thompson
969<00:01:36.780> down<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.590> albuquerque<00:01:38.100> new<00:01:38.130> mexico<00:01:38.250> and

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
969 down in albuquerque new mexico and

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.539 
969 down in albuquerque new mexico and
it<00:01:39.330> was<00:01:39.450> estimated<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.590> wind<00:01:41.070> speed<00:01:41.340> was

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
it was estimated that the wind speed was

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.420 
it was estimated that the wind speed was
over<00:01:42.119> five<00:01:42.330> meters<00:01:42.720> per<00:01:42.900> second<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.430> and

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
over five meters per second and and

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.859 
over five meters per second and and
that's<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.119> now<00:01:45.330> we're<00:01:45.510> looking<00:01:45.600> at<00:01:45.750> her

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
that's so now we're looking at her

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.880 
that's so now we're looking at her
fastest<00:01:46.290> conditions<00:01:46.740> ever<00:01:46.920> also<00:01:47.760> Tyson<00:01:48.689> Gay

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
fastest conditions ever also Tyson Gay

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.080 
fastest conditions ever also Tyson Gay
