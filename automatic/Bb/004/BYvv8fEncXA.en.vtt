00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
your dog is allergic to and you can do

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:41.020 
your dog is allergic to and you can do
that<00:02:36.920> as<00:02:37.250> a<00:02:37.280> skin<00:02:37.640> test<00:02:37.819> or<00:02:38.329> a<00:02:38.390> serm<00:02:39.290> test<00:02:40.030> from

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
those two tests and one other this we do

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.289 
those two tests and one other this we do
the<00:02:44.959> same<00:02:45.140> thing<00:02:45.379> we<00:02:45.890> essentially<00:02:46.340> then<00:02:47.030> make

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
the same thing we essentially then make

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.009 
the same thing we essentially then make
up<00:02:47.480> a<00:02:47.659> set<00:02:48.109> of<00:02:48.140> vaccines<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:50.120> for<00:02:50.690> your<00:02:50.780> dog<00:02:50.989> to

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
up a set of vaccines to for your dog to

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.940 
up a set of vaccines to for your dog to
desensitize<00:02:51.799> it<00:02:52.310> against<00:02:53.120> these<00:02:53.420> allergens

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
desensitize it against these allergens

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.379 
desensitize it against these allergens
so<00:02:54.950> H<00:02:55.010> dog<00:02:55.280> will<00:02:55.459> have<00:02:55.519> its<00:02:55.730> own<00:02:55.879> set<00:02:56.359> of

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:56.389 
so H dog will have its own set of

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:59.920 
so H dog will have its own set of
vaccines<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:58.010> that<00:02:58.909> is<00:02:59.090> what<00:02:59.599> is<00:02:59.690> truly

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
vaccines and that is what is truly

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.369 
vaccines and that is what is truly
called<00:03:00.230> an<00:03:00.379> allergy<00:03:00.799> shot<00:03:01.629> those<00:03:02.629> allergy

to usually about once a month after you

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
get about six months into it that way is

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:16.809 
get about six months into it that way is
probably<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.620> best<00:03:15.829> way<00:03:16.040> to<00:03:16.099> go<00:03:16.310> about<00:03:16.340> it<00:03:16.579> but

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
probably the best way to go about it but

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.520 
probably the best way to go about it but
does<00:03:16.970> take<00:03:17.209> time<00:03:17.389> it<00:03:17.569> may<00:03:17.690> take<00:03:17.930> four<00:03:18.199> to<00:03:18.319> six

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
does take time it may take four to six

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.129 
does take time it may take four to six
months<00:03:18.620> before<00:03:19.129> you<00:03:19.220> see<00:03:19.370> in<00:03:19.459> effect
