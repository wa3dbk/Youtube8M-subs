00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.849 
had it for like two days I've used it
twice<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.320> really<00:00:22.740> really<00:00:23.460> like<00:00:23.609> this<00:00:24.859> the

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
twice and I really really like this the

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.859 
twice and I really really like this the
coverage<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.609> really<00:00:26.939> good<00:00:27.150> at<00:00:27.269> it's<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.660> full

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
coverage is really good at it's a full

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.400 
coverage is really good at it's a full
coverage<00:00:28.080> foundation<00:00:29.269> or<00:00:30.269> powder<00:00:30.570> whenever

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
coverage foundation or powder whenever

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.959 
coverage foundation or powder whenever
you<00:00:31.560> call<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.160> powder<00:00:32.369> foundation<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:32.910> it

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
you call it the powder foundation so it

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.540 
you call it the powder foundation so it
is<00:00:33.059> full<00:00:33.239> coverage<00:00:33.469> so<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:35.130> would<00:00:35.340> have<00:00:35.489> that

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
is full coverage so you would have that

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.549 
is full coverage so you would have that
and<00:00:36.120> it's<00:00:36.300> really<00:00:36.540> good<00:00:36.750> like<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.110> go<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.410> for

never said a little baby Buki brush but

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.289 
never said a little baby Buki brush but
fancy<00:01:30.360> or<00:01:30.420> anything<00:01:31.220> but<00:01:32.220> because<00:01:32.909> with<00:01:33.180> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
fancy or anything but because with the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.940 
fancy or anything but because with the
sponge<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.750> found<00:01:33.990> like<00:01:34.110> if<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.439> were<00:01:34.590> can<00:01:34.770> use

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
sponge I found like if you were can use

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.429 
sponge I found like if you were can use
it<00:01:35.100> as<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> actual<00:01:35.939> foundation<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:37.290> would

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
it as a actual foundation you would

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.289 
it as a actual foundation you would
probably<00:01:37.770> want<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.009> use<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.250> sponge<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.970> get<00:01:39.090> the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
probably want to use a sponge to get the

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.109 
probably want to use a sponge to get the
fullest<00:01:39.869> coverage<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.590> could<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.340> like

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
fullest coverage that you could and like

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.969 
fullest coverage that you could and like
even<00:01:42.450> with<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.689> boot<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.110> baby<00:01:43.290> boot<00:01:43.530> but<00:01:43.829> she

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
even with the boot the baby boot but she

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.710 
even with the boot the baby boot but she
still<00:01:44.189> get<00:01:44.340> pretty<00:01:44.610> pretty<00:01:45.030> good<00:01:45.240> coverage<00:01:45.600> I

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
still get pretty pretty good coverage I

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.120 
still get pretty pretty good coverage I
don't<00:01:45.930> really<00:01:46.110> need<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.439> whole<00:01:46.680> ton<00:01:47.100> of

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
don't really need a whole ton of

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.499 
don't really need a whole ton of
coverage<00:01:47.450> like<00:01:48.450> on<00:01:48.600> normal<00:01:49.020> days<00:01:49.170> but<00:01:49.710> just

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
coverage like on normal days but just

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.760 
coverage like on normal days but just
enough<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.540> cover<00:01:51.810> everything<00:01:52.140> up<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.649> make

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
enough to cover everything up and make

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.679 
enough to cover everything up and make
sure<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.159> it's<00:01:53.310> not<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:54.509> know<00:01:54.630> insanely

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
sure that it's not you know insanely

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.249 
sure that it's not you know insanely
uncovered<00:01:57.689> up<00:01:58.850> but<00:01:59.850> this<00:02:00.509> really<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:00.990> really

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
uncovered up but this really is really

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.889

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
a little sample size of B it's a cool

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.080 
a little sample size of B it's a cool
like<00:02:39.739> it's<00:02:39.890> called<00:02:40.069> super<00:02:40.430> fit<00:02:40.609> so<00:02:40.790> then<00:02:40.970> it's

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
like it's called super fit so then it's

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.330 
like it's called super fit so then it's
a<00:02:41.239> little<00:02:41.359> mineral<00:02:41.659> makeup<00:02:42.049> it<00:02:42.260> in<00:02:42.829> a<00:02:42.950> big<00:02:43.129> tub

a little mineral makeup it in a big tub
and<00:02:43.549> like<00:02:43.640> you<00:02:43.790> grind<00:02:44.090> it<00:02:44.299> but<00:02:44.420> it<00:02:44.510> was<00:02:44.599> just<00:02:44.629> a

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
and like you grind it but it was just a

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.349 
and like you grind it but it was just a
little<00:02:45.049> tiny<00:02:45.349> sample<00:02:45.889> sizes<00:02:46.069> probably<00:02:46.549> this

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:47.359 
little tiny sample sizes probably this

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:50.349 
little tiny sample sizes probably this
big<00:02:47.629> maybe<00:02:48.400> wasn't<00:02:49.400> that<00:02:49.489> big<00:02:49.730> but<00:02:49.760> it<00:02:50.030> lasted

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
big maybe wasn't that big but it lasted

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.899 
big maybe wasn't that big but it lasted
like<00:02:50.389> for<00:02:50.659> 3-4<00:02:51.019> months<00:02:51.139> I<00:02:51.560> really<00:02:52.430> liked<00:02:52.670> it

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:52.909 
like for 3-4 months I really liked it

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:56.140 
like for 3-4 months I really liked it
and<00:02:54.040> I<00:02:55.040> was<00:02:55.370> gonna<00:02:55.489> thinking<00:02:55.849> about<00:02:56.000> getting

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
and I was gonna thinking about getting

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.879 
and I was gonna thinking about getting
that<00:02:56.420> again<00:02:56.750> but<00:02:57.019> I<00:02:57.049> really<00:02:57.319> kinda<00:02:57.590> want<00:02:57.769> it<00:02:57.799> in

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:57.889 
that again but I really kinda want it in

00:02:57.889 --> 00:02:59.710 
that again but I really kinda want it in
the<00:02:57.950> compact<00:02:58.370> because<00:02:58.819> then<00:02:59.060> like<00:02:59.090> it's<00:02:59.540> just

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
the compact because then like it's just

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.690 
the compact because then like it's just
so<00:02:59.870> easy<00:02:59.900> to<00:03:00.349> take<00:03:00.560> around<00:03:00.739> with<00:03:01.069> you<00:03:01.129> and<00:03:01.489> that

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
so easy to take around with you and that

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.149 
so easy to take around with you and that
one<00:03:01.879> you<00:03:01.970> had<00:03:02.150> to<00:03:02.180> take<00:03:02.329> around<00:03:02.540> a<00:03:02.659> brush<00:03:03.129> get<00:03:04.129> a

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 
one you had to take around a brush get a

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:06.009 
one you had to take around a brush get a
doll<00:03:04.400> later<00:03:04.609> and<00:03:04.819> it<00:03:04.879> kind<00:03:05.090> of<00:03:05.150> got<00:03:05.269> messy<00:03:05.750> I

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
doll later and it kind of got messy I

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.750 
doll later and it kind of got messy I
think<00:03:06.230> that's<00:03:06.409> like<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:06.739> guy<00:03:06.980> was<00:03:07.310> kind<00:03:07.700> of

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
think that's like the guy was kind of

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.849 
think that's like the guy was kind of
the<00:03:07.849> point<00:03:08.090> of<00:03:08.269> it<00:03:08.420> not<00:03:08.540> being<00:03:08.599> messy<00:03:08.930> but<00:03:09.769> it

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:09.859 
the point of it not being messy but it

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:15.309 
the point of it not being messy but it
was<00:03:10.010> messy<00:03:10.310> and<00:03:13.090> it<00:03:14.090> come<00:03:14.329> along<00:03:14.629> shimmer<00:03:15.139> to

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
was messy and it come along shimmer to

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.349 
was messy and it come along shimmer to
it<00:03:15.349> I<00:03:15.799> don't<00:03:16.430> really<00:03:16.549> like<00:03:16.849> that<00:03:17.030> because<00:03:17.150> it

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
it I don't really like that because it

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:18.610 
it I don't really like that because it
can<00:03:17.540> make<00:03:17.690> you<00:03:17.810> look<00:03:17.930> really<00:03:18.109> pale<00:03:18.410> in

can make you look really pale in

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.460 
can make you look really pale in

anyways this has a very matte finish
it's<00:03:29.569> not<00:03:29.840> extremely<00:03:30.470> Matt<00:03:30.739> but<00:03:30.919> it's<00:03:31.040> like<00:03:31.129> a

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
it on it looks flawless it controls the

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.860 
it on it looks flawless it controls the
oil<00:03:35.959> for<00:03:36.379> quite<00:03:36.970> you<00:03:37.970> know<00:03:38.000> like<00:03:38.419> all<00:03:38.690> day

controlling<00:03:39.470> oil<00:03:39.590> but<00:03:39.859> probably<00:03:40.129> I'd<00:03:40.310> say

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
controlling oil but probably I'd say

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.439 
controlling oil but probably I'd say
from<00:03:41.109> 4<00:03:42.109> to<00:03:42.260> 6<00:03:42.530> hours<00:03:42.799> maybe<00:03:43.310> and<00:03:44.150> that's<00:03:44.329> a

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:44.449 
from 4 to 6 hours maybe and that's a

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:46.119 
from 4 to 6 hours maybe and that's a
long<00:03:44.629> time<00:03:44.900> for<00:03:44.930> a<00:03:45.199> foundation<00:03:45.500> to<00:03:45.709> control
