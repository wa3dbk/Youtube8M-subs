 hello friends how are we on this occasion 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.000
 I bring you a tweet that I liked 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:20.150
 much or rather a theme and it's called 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.689
 ay smart picks and it's very good 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:27.050
 we find this topic for a price 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.850
 of 2 dollars 99 cents in the repo of 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.670
 alive but we can download it from the 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:35.120
 ajax power network from instant angy or from 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.550
 good iphone atsur can see the topic 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.360
 the color predominates completely 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.760
 black giving a style in I do not know is 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.860
 made the truth that has 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.560
 I really liked how this style gives us 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.329
 as elegant as if they were 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.610
 impregnated the buttons the truth that 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.100
 I like that a lot as it stands out 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.930
 nothing else the shore and well we can see 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.149
 in the upper part that changes the 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.820
 signal from our operator the bar 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.040
 wifi and our battery also we 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.259
 add a clock to what is ours 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.479
 pages or our polygons add a 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.009
 clock adds the climate of our 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.720
 city that we can change it still not 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.180
 I do it a kind of seeing that marks me 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.340
 london but then I still do not put my 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.790
 city gives us the weather gives us the time 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.070
 date 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.430
 and here it gives us day by day as a brand 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.170
 our good city creates us masks 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.760
 of layers that's something very very very 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.710
 well we can see for example here that 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.710
 create us the mask of facebook twitter 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.720
 and other and good only not me has not 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.030
 created three layer masks that 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.390
 would be those of activator eye 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.070
 bank and troy doctor pro ok those three 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.110
 layers are the only ones that I have not created 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.120
 from there on out if you created me the 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.470
 others the truth that I liked a lot 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.030
 for example if we enter the phone 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.360
 we can see that it changes us completely 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.610
 the day read and it gives us a black color 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.759
 super father if we enter for example to 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:59.390
 mail we can see that you redirect me 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.619
 what is our our mask of 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.840
 layer in black if we enter 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.910
 adjustments in the same way we will find what 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.520
 which are our settings in black 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.770
 the truth that I like so much you see 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.270
 quite well in fact up to our 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.060
 music player does not change them 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.610
 you can see that it does not change them 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.020
 any problem and good guys now 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.480

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.640
 blog screen we can see that little light 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.060
 little by little goes on with this topic and 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.390
 gives us 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.970
 a watch super father gives us the time 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.650

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.140

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.790
 good quick access to the camera 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.230
