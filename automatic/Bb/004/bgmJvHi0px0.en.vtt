the cars that were manufactured were
sold<00:03:21.250> in<00:03:21.400> America<00:03:21.880> I<00:03:22.060> reckon<00:03:22.720> if<00:03:22.810> you<00:03:22.900> take<00:03:23.110> a

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
sold in America I reckon if you take a

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.830 
sold in America I reckon if you take a
rover<00:03:23.500> 75<00:03:23.680> put<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:24.790> mg<00:03:25.060> octagons<00:03:25.450> on<00:03:25.600> it<00:03:25.690> and

making<00:03:25.990> sporty<00:03:26.530> well<00:03:26.710> I<00:03:26.920> reckon<00:03:27.340> they'll<00:03:27.490> sell

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
making sporty well I reckon they'll sell
