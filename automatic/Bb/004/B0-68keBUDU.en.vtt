00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
this the code so you got to change this

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.450 
this the code so you got to change this
to<00:00:44.969> view<00:00:45.590> background<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.770> then<00:00:47.219> make<00:00:47.430> sure

all right now let's go quickly under
very<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.309> IB<00:00:59.730> action<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.239> didn't<00:01:00.510> down<00:01:01.260> this

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
very the IB action I didn't down this

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.530 
very the IB action I didn't down this
thing<00:01:01.829> here<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.309> now<00:01:03.000> quickly<00:01:03.449> as<00:01:03.809> DUI<00:01:05.840> image

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.530 
thing here and now quickly as DUI image
speaker<00:01:09.540> controller<00:01:10.939> and<00:01:11.939> let's<00:01:12.330> go<00:01:12.479> ahead

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
speaker controller and let's go ahead

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.700 
speaker controller and let's go ahead
and<00:01:12.659> declare<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.350> as<00:01:14.000> thicker<00:01:15.200> then<00:01:16.200> equal<00:01:18.710> you

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
and declare it as thicker then equal you

and declare it as thicker then equal you
why<00:01:20.520> image<00:01:23.150> picker<00:01:24.150> controller<00:01:25.040> all<00:01:26.040> walks

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
why image picker controller all walks

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.460 
why image picker controller all walks
and<00:01:28.909> then<00:01:29.909> in<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.979> there<00:01:31.979> now<00:01:32.970> let's<00:01:33.270> do<00:01:34.049> picker

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
and then in it there now let's do picker

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.920 
and then in it there now let's do picker
got<00:01:35.540> delegate<00:01:36.540> April's<00:01:37.259> cells<00:01:38.570> and<00:01:39.570> then

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
got delegate April's cells and then

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.399 
got delegate April's cells and then
close<00:01:40.229> right<00:01:40.530> there<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.759> now<00:01:42.000> let's<00:01:42.390> do<00:01:43.280> cell

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
close right there and now let's do cell

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.179 
close right there and now let's do cell
and<00:01:46.409> then<00:01:46.740> present<00:01:47.670> omoto<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.750> present<00:01:49.740> movie

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.800 
that same image it's because it's said
to<00:05:19.980> the<00:05:20.250> image<00:05:20.460> so<00:05:21.030> if<00:05:21.210> you<00:05:21.360> want<00:05:21.540> to<00:05:21.630> get<00:05:21.750> a

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
to the image so if you want to get a

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.260 
to the image so if you want to get a
blank<00:05:22.200> again<00:05:22.410> you<00:05:22.830> will<00:05:22.950> have<00:05:23.130> to<00:05:23.460> delete<00:05:24.030> the

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
blank again you will have to delete the

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:30.230 
blank again you will have to delete the
app<00:05:24.510> and<00:05:25.130> then<00:05:26.450> build<00:05:27.450> again<00:05:28.880> all<00:05:29.880> right<00:05:30.060> there

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
app and then build again all right there

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.970 
app and then build again all right there
you<00:05:30.270> gotta<00:05:30.510> block<00:05:30.690> that's<00:05:31.350> the<00:05:31.590> only<00:05:31.800> way<00:05:31.920> you

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980
