up of the DJI fpv hub just this little

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.640 
up of the DJI fpv hub just this little
board<00:00:20.070> here<00:00:20.359> but<00:00:21.359> obviously<00:00:21.720> certain<00:00:22.320> rituals

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
right so this is the fpv hub which is

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.709 
right so this is the fpv hub which is
designed<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.270> make<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.950> solderless

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
designed to make a solderless

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.770 
designed to make a solderless
plug-and-play<00:00:52.430> connection<00:00:53.430> between<00:00:53.820> DJI

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780

actually just this little this little

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.380 
actually just this little this little
bit<00:01:00.300> here<00:01:00.350> and<00:01:01.350> I've<00:01:01.500> actually<00:01:01.620> got<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.579> fixed

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
bit here and I've actually got it fixed

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.200 
bit here and I've actually got it fixed
onto<00:01:03.899> my<00:01:04.019> iOS<00:01:04.409> D<00:01:04.680> it's<00:01:05.549> piggybacking<00:01:06.000> on<00:01:06.180> that

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
onto my iOS D it's piggybacking on that

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.630 
onto my iOS D it's piggybacking on that
with<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.420> bit<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.570> sticky<00:01:07.020> pad<00:01:07.229> it's<00:01:07.979> tiny<00:01:08.250> it's

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
with a bit of sticky pad it's tiny it's

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.520 
with a bit of sticky pad it's tiny it's
very<00:01:08.880> inexpensive<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.900> comes<00:01:10.140> with<00:01:10.320> all

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
very inexpensive and it comes with all

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.859 
very inexpensive and it comes with all
the<00:01:10.799> cables<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.369> need<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.479> if<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.689> have

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
the cables you need so that if you have

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.249 
the cables you need so that if you have
a<00:01:12.979> DJI<00:01:13.979> ABL<00:01:14.820> 58<00:01:15.360> video<00:01:15.960> transmitter<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:17.600> an<00:01:18.600> h3

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
a DJI ABL 58 video transmitter and an h3

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.109 
a DJI ABL 58 video transmitter and an h3
2d<00:01:19.680> or<00:01:19.799> 3d<00:01:19.830> gimbal<00:01:20.520> there<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:20.909> no<00:01:21.180> soul<00:01:21.509> ring<00:01:23.119> so

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
2d or 3d gimbal there is no soul ring so

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.399 
2d or 3d gimbal there is no soul ring so
we'll<00:01:24.240> have<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.390> look<00:01:24.509> at<00:01:24.659> exactly<00:01:24.930> how<00:01:25.140> it

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
we'll have a look at exactly how it

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.910 
we'll have a look at exactly how it
wires<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.180> main<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:28.350> main<00:01:28.380> wire

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
wires in this is the main the main wire

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.800 
wires in this is the main the main wire
out<00:01:29.310> from<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.700> phantom<00:01:30.150> internals<00:01:30.689> which

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
out from the phantom internals which

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.749 
out from the phantom internals which
I've<00:01:30.930> just<00:01:31.079> pulled<00:01:31.350> away<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.829> can<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.579> can

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
I've just pulled away so you can you can

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.910 
I've just pulled away so you can you can
see<00:01:33.000> there's<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.930> little<00:01:34.140> micro<00:01:34.439> switch<00:01:34.650> here

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
see there's a little micro switch here

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.730 
see there's a little micro switch here
which<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.250> labeled<00:01:35.640> OSD<00:01:36.509> or<00:01:36.750> video<00:01:37.140> if<00:01:37.560> you

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
which is labeled OSD or video if you

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.590 
which is labeled OSD or video if you
have<00:01:37.890> an<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.100> screen<00:01:38.369> display<00:01:38.640> which

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
have an on screen display which

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.420 
have an on screen display which
obviously<00:01:40.079> I'll<00:01:40.290> have<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.650> do<00:01:40.710> here<00:01:41.040> there<00:01:41.310> like

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
obviously I'll have I do here there like

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.280 
obviously I'll have I do here there like
you<00:01:41.640> flick<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.360> if<00:01:43.020> you're<00:01:43.259> just

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
you flick it to that if you're just

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.980 
you flick it to that if you're just
wanting<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.950> pass<00:01:44.189> video<00:01:44.579> through<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.479> forget

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
wanting to pass video through you forget

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.889 
wanting to pass video through you forget

the video here it marked v TX you run a

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.340 
the video here it marked v TX you run a
cable<00:01:52.229> which<00:01:52.530> goes<00:01:52.799> into<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.460> ABL<00:01:53.880> 58<00:01:54.420> if<00:01:55.049> you

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
cable which goes into the ABL 58 if you

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.170 
cable which goes into the ABL 58 if you
don't<00:01:55.740> have<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.280> if<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.490> have<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.640> different

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
this end and then a series of

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.330 
this end and then a series of
color-coded<00:02:03.540> wires<00:02:03.770> which<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:04.979> can<00:02:05.189> then

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
color-coded wires which you can then

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.570 
color-coded wires which you can then
solder<00:02:05.909> on<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.329> relevant<00:02:06.719> wires<00:02:07.710> on<00:02:08.160> your

video transmitter so you have to use it
with<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.430> ABL<00:02:12.120> 58

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
with a ABL 58

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.120 
with a ABL 58
if<00:02:13.360> you<00:02:13.570> use<00:02:14.380> it<00:02:14.530> with<00:02:14.590> something<00:02:14.800> else<00:02:14.950> that

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
if you use it with something else that

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.710 
if you use it with something else that
you<00:02:15.370> will<00:02:15.610> have<00:02:15.820> to<00:02:15.910> do<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.060> bit<00:02:16.210> of<00:02:16.240> soldiering

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
you will have to do a bit of soldiering

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.110 
you will have to do a bit of soldiering
but<00:02:17.440> as<00:02:17.530> I<00:02:17.650> say<00:02:17.860> you<00:02:18.280> know<00:02:18.610> they<00:02:18.730> provide<00:02:19.090> a

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
but as I say you know they provide a

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.630 
but as I say you know they provide a
special<00:02:19.960> table<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:20.680> instructions<00:02:21.340> in<00:02:21.550> the

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
special table and instructions in the

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.640 
special table and instructions in the
manual<00:02:21.670> as<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.150> which<00:02:22.360> color-coded<00:02:23.170> wine<00:02:23.410> is

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
manual as to which color-coded wine is

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.130 
manual as to which color-coded wine is
to<00:02:23.800> be<00:02:23.950> attached<00:02:24.460> to<00:02:24.640> which<00:02:24.850> wire<00:02:25.690> on<00:02:25.990> your<00:02:26.260> VTX

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
to be attached to which wire on your VTX

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.960 
to be attached to which wire on your VTX
then<00:02:29.140> there's<00:02:29.770> two<00:02:30.010> more<00:02:30.280> sockets<00:02:30.790> for<00:02:30.850> your

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
then there's two more sockets for your

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.910 
then there's two more sockets for your
hand<00:02:31.360> by<00:02:31.480> height<00:02:31.660> behind<00:02:32.050> here<00:02:32.290> one<00:02:32.560> is<00:02:32.740> for

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
hand by height behind here one is for

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.950 
hand by height behind here one is for
the<00:02:32.980> iOS<00:02:33.340> deep<00:02:33.520> mini<00:02:33.760> one<00:02:34.120> is<00:02:34.270> for<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.510> iOS

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
the iOS deep mini one is for the iOS

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.530 
the iOS deep mini one is for the iOS
Demark<00:02:35.620> two<00:02:35.980> they're<00:02:36.940> two<00:02:37.090> different<00:02:37.450> ones

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
Demark two they're two different ones

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.180 
Demark two they're two different ones
and<00:02:37.780> this<00:02:37.840> obviously<00:02:38.050> just<00:02:38.410> runs<00:02:38.680> in<00:02:38.920> it's<00:02:39.100> a

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
and this obviously just runs in it's a

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.790 
and this obviously just runs in it's a
split<00:02:39.460> cable<00:02:39.880> you've<00:02:40.150> got<00:02:40.330> two<00:02:40.990> pins<00:02:41.380> here<00:02:41.500> the

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
split cable you've got two pins here the

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.320 
split cable you've got two pins here the
mini<00:02:42.010> has<00:02:42.220> one<00:02:42.460> I<00:02:42.490> believe<00:02:42.850> and<00:02:42.970> it<00:02:43.030> just<00:02:43.180> will

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
mini has one I believe and it just will

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.740 
mini has one I believe and it just will
run<00:02:43.510> through<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:43.960> the<00:02:44.050> mini<00:02:45.450> here's<00:02:46.450> where<00:02:46.660> you

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
run through to the mini here's where you

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.170 
run through to the mini here's where you
plug<00:02:46.990> the<00:02:47.140> main<00:02:47.320> the<00:02:48.190> main<00:02:48.220> cable<00:02:48.760> coming<00:02:49.060> out

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
plug the main the main cable coming out

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.820 
plug the main the main cable coming out
from<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.540> inside<00:02:49.960> of<00:02:49.990> the<00:02:50.110> phantom<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:50.740> then

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
from the inside of the phantom and then

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.610 
from the inside of the phantom and then
here<00:02:51.100> is<00:02:51.280> where<00:02:51.460> you<00:02:51.820> plug<00:02:52.090> into<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.960> back<00:02:53.560> of

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
here is where you plug into the back of

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.550 
here is where you plug into the back of
the<00:02:53.800> gimbal<00:02:54.570> and<00:02:55.570> it's<00:02:55.810> that<00:02:55.990> simple<00:02:56.760> it's

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
the gimbal and it's that simple it's

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.790 
the gimbal and it's that simple it's
pretty<00:02:59.560> foolproof<00:03:00.990> as<00:03:01.990> I<00:03:02.050> say<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.440> only

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
pretty foolproof as I say the only

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.380 
pretty foolproof as I say the only
difficulty<00:03:03.550> would<00:03:03.610> be<00:03:03.760> if<00:03:03.850> you<00:03:03.940> weren't<00:03:04.150> using

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
difficulty would be if you weren't using

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.540 
difficulty would be if you weren't using
a<00:03:04.600> DJI<00:03:05.260> video<00:03:05.620> transmitter<00:03:06.010> you<00:03:06.280> would<00:03:06.400> have

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
a DJI video transmitter you would have

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.290 
a DJI video transmitter you would have
to<00:03:06.730> solder<00:03:07.570> these<00:03:07.720> wires<00:03:08.220> but<00:03:09.220> we<00:03:09.640> know<00:03:09.820> with<00:03:10.270> a

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
to solder these wires but we know with a

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.020 
to solder these wires but we know with a
bit<00:03:10.540> of<00:03:10.570> practice<00:03:11.320> and<00:03:11.490> bit<00:03:12.490> of<00:03:12.640> patience

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
bit of practice and bit of patience

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.729 
bit of practice and bit of patience
that's<00:03:13.270> not<00:03:13.720> a<00:03:13.930> difficult<00:03:14.920> economy<00:03:15.250> to<00:03:16.620> and<00:03:17.620> I

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
that's not a difficult economy to and I

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.130 
that's not a difficult economy to and I
think<00:03:17.950> that's<00:03:18.100> just<00:03:18.310> a<00:03:18.459> great<00:03:18.970> bit<00:03:19.540> of<00:03:19.570> kit<00:03:19.660> you

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
think that's just a great bit of kit you

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.270 
think that's just a great bit of kit you
could<00:03:20.380> there's<00:03:20.739> nothing<00:03:20.950> to<00:03:21.040> stop<00:03:21.220> you

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
could there's nothing to stop you

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.840 
could there's nothing to stop you
mounting<00:03:21.820> it<00:03:21.940> internally<00:03:22.540> I<00:03:23.400> guess<00:03:24.400> you<00:03:24.670> could

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
mounting it internally I guess you could

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.420 
mounting it internally I guess you could
easily<00:03:25.000> a<00:03:25.209> fix<00:03:25.750> it<00:03:25.900> and<00:03:26.080> run<00:03:26.709> these<00:03:26.830> wires<00:03:26.890> in<00:03:27.340> a

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
easily a fix it and run these wires in a

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.490 
easily a fix it and run these wires in a
more<00:03:29.340> subtle<00:03:30.340> way<00:03:30.540> but<00:03:31.540> for<00:03:31.959> me<00:03:32.080> having

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
more subtle way but for me having

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.380 
more subtle way but for me having
everything<00:03:32.680> out<00:03:32.890> here<00:03:33.190> I<00:03:33.550> can't<00:03:33.760> see<00:03:34.000> it<00:03:34.150> it's

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
everything out here I can't see it it's

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.610 
everything out here I can't see it it's
easy<00:03:34.570> to<00:03:34.780> know<00:03:34.930> that<00:03:35.080> everything's<00:03:35.410> plugged

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
easy to know that everything's plugged

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.110 
easy to know that everything's plugged
in<00:03:35.860> it's<00:03:36.100> easy<00:03:36.280> to<00:03:36.489> do<00:03:36.610> a<00:03:36.640> bit<00:03:36.820> of<00:03:36.850> maintenance

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
in it's easy to do a bit of maintenance

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.229 
in it's easy to do a bit of maintenance
and<00:03:37.450> it's<00:03:37.630> also<00:03:37.900> easy<00:03:38.290> to<00:03:38.459> quickly<00:03:39.459> replace<00:03:40.030> it

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
and it's also easy to quickly replace it

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:41.880 
and it's also easy to quickly replace it
if<00:03:40.360> I<00:03:40.510> ever<00:03:40.690> want<00:03:40.900> to<00:03:40.930> change<00:03:41.170> this<00:03:41.440> out<00:03:41.650> for<00:03:41.860> a

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
if I ever want to change this out for a

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.680 
if I ever want to change this out for a
mini<00:03:42.160> or<00:03:42.430> change<00:03:43.090> to<00:03:43.150> different<00:03:43.330> video

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
mini or change to different video

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.350 
mini or change to different video
transmitter<00:03:44.220> so<00:03:45.220> I<00:03:45.250> think<00:03:45.370> and<00:03:45.940> for<00:03:46.090> the<00:03:46.150> price

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
transmitter so I think and for the price

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.990 
transmitter so I think and for the price
as<00:03:46.570> well<00:03:46.720> it's<00:03:47.340> it's<00:03:48.340> something<00:03:48.550> like<00:03:48.610> 11

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
as well it's it's something like 11

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.800 
as well it's it's something like 11
pounds<00:03:49.530> sterling<00:03:51.150> aquiver<00:03:52.150> so<00:03:52.390> it's<00:03:52.540> gonna<00:03:52.630> be

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
pounds sterling aquiver so it's gonna be

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.160 
pounds sterling aquiver so it's gonna be
under<00:03:52.959> $20<00:03:54.090> and<00:03:55.090> that<00:03:55.450> was<00:03:55.600> just<00:03:55.810> a<00:03:55.900> great

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
under $20 and that was just a great

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.930 
under $20 and that was just a great
great<00:03:57.040> way<00:03:57.190> especially<00:03:57.670> if<00:03:57.760> you<00:03:57.850> all

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
great way especially if you all

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.570 
great way especially if you all
relatively<00:03:58.330> new<00:03:58.660> to<00:03:58.930> doing<00:03:59.110> the<00:03:59.430> putting<00:04:00.430> an

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
relatively new to doing the putting an

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.810 
relatively new to doing the putting an
fpv<00:04:00.970> system<00:04:01.300> together<00:04:01.570> I<00:04:02.400> really<00:04:03.400> recommend

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
fpv system together I really recommend

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.150 
fpv system together I really recommend
that<00:04:03.880> it<00:04:04.209> makes<00:04:04.390> things<00:04:04.510> very<00:04:04.660> very<00:04:04.900> easy<00:04:05.320> so

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
that it makes things very very easy so
