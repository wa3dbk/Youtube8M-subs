I also use the element defense because I

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.830 
I also use the element defense because I
did<00:00:45.900> get<00:00:46.079> hit<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.350> few<00:00:46.650> times<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.840> importantly

I've got immediately a full magic meter

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:15.169 
I've got immediately a full magic meter
and<00:01:12.149> I<00:01:12.899> use<00:01:13.109> the<00:01:13.289> fries<00:01:13.590> magic<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.399> as<00:01:14.789> I<00:01:14.819> say

that combined up to 80% Titan speed gem

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.499 
that combined up to 80% Titan speed gem
it<00:01:18.990> means<00:01:19.289> that<00:01:19.499> he's<00:01:19.649> really<00:01:19.979> slow<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.789> I<00:01:21.270> can

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
it means that he's really slow and I can

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.109 
it means that he's really slow and I can
get<00:01:21.719> anything<00:01:22.079> up<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.590> four<00:01:22.950> hits<00:01:23.249> between<00:01:23.639> his

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
get anything up to four hits between his

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.889 
get anything up to four hits between his
attack<00:01:24.469> but<00:01:25.469> I<00:01:25.799> do<00:01:26.039> try<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:26.759> block<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.630> dodge

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
attack but I do try and block and dodge

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.039 
attack but I do try and block and dodge
his<00:01:28.289> hips<00:01:28.619> rather<00:01:29.189> than<00:01:29.520> getting<00:01:29.819> hit<00:01:30.060> because

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
his hips rather than getting hit because

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.429 
his hips rather than getting hit because
if<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.530> get<00:01:31.740> hit<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.459> do<00:01:32.729> have<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.149> apply<00:01:33.569> live

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
if you get hit and do have it apply live

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.149 
if you get hit and do have it apply live
the<00:01:34.590> next<00:01:34.740> hit<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:36.389> to<00:01:36.450> avoid<00:01:36.749> that<00:01:37.079> delay

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
the next hit and so to avoid that delay

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.120 
the next hit and so to avoid that delay
make<00:01:38.670> sure<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.479> block<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.289> dodge<00:01:40.590> his

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
make sure that I block and dodge his

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.779 
make sure that I block and dodge his
hips<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.380> can't<00:01:43.680> block<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:44.490> she'll

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
hips and you can't block this she'll

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.719 
hips and you can't block this she'll
fastest<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.780> need<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.200> dodge<00:01:46.439> those<00:01:46.799> but<00:01:47.579> you

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
fastest you need to dodge those but you

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.990 
fastest you need to dodge those but you
can<00:01:48.060> block<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.780> kicks<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:50.189> if<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.520> time<00:01:50.789> it

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
can block the kicks so if you time it

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.450 
can block the kicks so if you time it
just<00:01:51.030> right<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.899> will<00:01:52.140> be<00:01:52.289> able<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.799> get<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.159> lot

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
just right you will be able to get a lot

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.090 
just right you will be able to get a lot
of<00:01:53.579> scratches<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.329> between<00:01:54.840> two<00:01:55.320> attacks<00:01:55.740> as

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
of scratches in between two attacks as

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.660 
of scratches in between two attacks as
well<00:01:56.549> as<00:01:56.880> block<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.689> dodge<00:01:58.229> now<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:58.920> do<00:01:59.069> get<00:01:59.429> hit

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
well as block and dodge now I do get hit

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.779 
well as block and dodge now I do get hit
a<00:01:59.700> few<00:02:00.060> times<00:02:00.090> because<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.929> is<00:02:01.079> hard<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:02.220> time

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
a few times because it is hard to a time

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.789 
a few times because it is hard to a time
that<00:02:02.970> just<00:02:03.149> right<00:02:03.479> every<00:02:03.899> goes<00:02:04.110> but<00:02:04.590> it

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
that just right every goes but it

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.830 
that just right every goes but it
doesn't<00:02:05.220> really<00:02:05.369> matter<00:02:05.640> because<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.569> not

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
doesn't really matter because it is not

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.559 
doesn't really matter because it is not
a<00:02:06.869> one-hit<00:02:07.470> kill<00:02:07.829> but<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.700> recommend<00:02:09.360> is<00:02:09.539> that

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
a one-hit kill but I recommend is that

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.130 
a one-hit kill but I recommend is that
if<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.440> damage<00:02:10.860> is<00:02:11.130> high<00:02:11.459> for<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:11.940> then<00:02:12.630> there

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
if the damage is high for you then there

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.470 
if the damage is high for you then there
is<00:02:13.319> a<00:02:13.349> heal<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:14.010> reasoning<00:02:14.640> that<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:15.060> can<00:02:15.299> use

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
is a heal and reasoning that you can use

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.130 
is a heal and reasoning that you can use
so<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.680> can<00:02:16.799> heal<00:02:17.280> from<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.849> damage<00:02:18.180> so<00:02:18.930> I

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
so you can heal from the damage so I

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.500 
so you can heal from the damage so I
tried<00:02:19.470> numbers<00:02:20.130> methods<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.910> see<00:02:21.090> which<00:02:21.239> work

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
tried numbers methods to see which work

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.729 
tried numbers methods to see which work
best<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:23.069> tried<00:02:23.580> Julie<00:02:24.330> weapons<00:02:25.049> we've

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
best and I tried Julie weapons we've

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.910 
best and I tried Julie weapons we've
been<00:02:26.190> hit<00:02:26.519> the<00:02:26.730> whole<00:02:26.910> time<00:02:27.209> as<00:02:27.510> well<00:02:28.200> as<00:02:28.410> not

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
been hit the whole time as well as not

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.319 
been hit the whole time as well as not
being<00:02:29.130> hit<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.549> whole<00:02:29.760> time

being hit the whole time

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.720 
being hit the whole time
but<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:30.930> still<00:02:31.319> found<00:02:31.590> light<00:02:32.130> with<00:02:32.430> more

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
but I still found light with more

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.500 
but I still found light with more
strategies<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:34.799> tried<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.370> stylist<00:02:36.000> with

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
strategies and I tried it stylist with

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.930 
strategies and I tried it stylist with
both<00:02:36.780> light<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.410> drill<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.280> it's<00:02:38.519> basically

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
both light and drill and it's basically

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.599 
both light and drill and it's basically
the<00:02:39.239> same<00:02:39.269> as<00:02:39.840> ISA<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:42.239> try<00:02:42.569> different<00:02:42.810> hits

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:43.609 
the same as ISA and I try different hits

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:47.840 
the same as ISA and I try different hits
directions<00:02:44.609> for<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.299> scratches<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.850> like

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
directions for the scratches and like

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.039 
directions for the scratches and like
horizontal<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:49.100> up<00:02:50.100> but<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.239> found<00:02:51.600> that<00:02:51.870> the

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
horizontal and up but I found that the

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.220 
horizontal and up but I found that the
downwards<00:02:52.590> hit<00:02:52.829> was<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.489> fastest<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.389> I<00:02:54.989> did

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
downwards hit was the fastest and I did

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.190 
downwards hit was the fastest and I did
try<00:02:55.440> being<00:02:56.220> hit<00:02:56.519> with<00:02:56.819> light<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.480> using<00:02:58.109> a

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
try being hit with light and using a

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.220 
try being hit with light and using a
heel<00:02:58.470> ring<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:59.090> ignoring<00:03:00.090> blocking<00:03:01.079> and

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
heel ring and ignoring blocking and

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.300 
heel ring and ignoring blocking and
dodging<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:01.889> just

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
dodging and just

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.420 
dodging and just
keep<00:03:02.760> scratching<00:03:03.180> whilst<00:03:03.750> being<00:03:04.080> hit<00:03:04.380> but<00:03:05.160> as

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
keep scratching whilst being hit but as

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.089 
keep scratching whilst being hit but as
I<00:03:05.459> say<00:03:05.790> but<00:03:06.180> it's<00:03:06.420> quite<00:03:06.720> a<00:03:06.750> lot<00:03:06.989> of<00:03:07.020> delay<00:03:07.530> that

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
I say but it's quite a lot of delay that

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.270 
I say but it's quite a lot of delay that
method<00:03:08.640> so<00:03:09.300> I<00:03:09.569> don't<00:03:09.900> recommend<00:03:10.080> it<00:03:10.650> I<00:03:10.860> found

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
method so I don't recommend it I found

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.540 
method so I don't recommend it I found
that<00:03:11.819> it<00:03:12.000> is<00:03:12.030> best<00:03:12.150> from<00:03:12.870> my<00:03:13.319> claimant<00:03:14.220> at<00:03:14.370> any
