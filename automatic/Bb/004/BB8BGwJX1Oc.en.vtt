00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
significant in Peters life so that he

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.510 
significant in Peters life so that he
could<00:00:45.989> understand<00:00:46.500> I'm<00:00:46.739> establishing

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
could understand I'm establishing

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.310 
could understand I'm establishing
something<00:00:47.969> new<00:00:48.120> I'm<00:00:48.570> going<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.840> do<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:48.989> complete

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
something new I'm going to do a complete

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.619 
something new I'm going to do a complete
180<00:00:50.039> from<00:00:50.160> how<00:00:50.460> you've<00:00:50.610> done<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:51.059> now

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
180 from how you've done it to now

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.010 
180 from how you've done it to now
because<00:00:52.289> essentially<00:00:52.860> Peter<00:00:53.250> was<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.670> first

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
because essentially Peter was the first

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.069 
because essentially Peter was the first
missionary<00:00:55.100> so<00:00:56.100> Peter<00:00:56.640> goes<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.270> Cornelius's

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
missionary so Peter goes to Cornelius's

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.040 
missionary so Peter goes to Cornelius's
house<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:59.149> preaches<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.180> gospel<00:01:00.690> in<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.899> new

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
house and preaches the gospel in a new

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.650 
house and preaches the gospel in a new
way<00:01:01.289> not<00:01:02.010> just<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.609> Jew<00:01:02.910> but<00:01:03.239> now<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
way not just to the Jew but now to the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.370 
way not just to the Jew but now to the
Gentile<00:01:04.220> because<00:01:05.220> in<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:06.150> vision<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:07.170> Lord

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
Gentile because in that vision the Lord

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.289 
Gentile because in that vision the Lord
is<00:01:07.470> essentially<00:01:08.010> saying<00:01:08.280> everyone<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.119> now

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
is essentially saying everyone is now

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.170 
is essentially saying everyone is now

the earth and why that significant is

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.109 
the earth and why that significant is
because<00:01:20.970> Rome<00:01:21.840> was<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.680> biggest<00:01:23.310> largest

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
because Rome was the biggest largest

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.810
