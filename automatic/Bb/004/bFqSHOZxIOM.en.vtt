00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.240
 Speaks personal beauty, I 'm here with more 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.820
 a video and this time bringing you 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.310
 the second match the second round of the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.050
 gangster squad brazil campaign 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.390
 you should already know what it is but if 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.830
 You do not know, you just have to look at it in years. 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.360
 earlier I'll leave here at 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.550
 end of this video for you 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.890
 understand and it is the following personal 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.469
 In this game we were playing the 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.110
 counter-strike global offensive was the 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.239
 Brazil team composed by brk is early 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.329
 colonist rocks jones 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.210
 and I clear against the team from France that 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.460
 were the commitment of France and three more 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.680
 guys who were invited and one of them 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.649
 missed and ended up having to put more 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.629
 One person I indicated the dinosaur game 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.699
 and she readily accepted what went well 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.860
 cool we can play one against 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.290
 another or unfortunately could be the same 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.870
 Time but I wanted to bring it to you. 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.780
 also a little bit there of this gameplay 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.030
 for you to see is the game against 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.000
 extra offensive balloon I told you 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.230
 in the running mode of guns I never 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.180
 He had played okay 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.490
 I played only on that day and to be able to record 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.170
 with the people as I told you 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.200
 This gangster squad is a movie that goes 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.270
 to launch on February 1, 2013 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.180
 It's good to check out the trailer yet. 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.950
 end of the video too and the most 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.200
 legal of all this is that people 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.470
 can play with expensive people from France and 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.540
 it was a really nice joke the staff 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.440
 some knew how to play others never played 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.240
 in life 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.430
 That's why you see that 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.040
 the weapons running mode works more 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.300
 less like the game call of duty 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.430
 black ops or else mw3 even is e 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.920
 You kill two people, you just died. 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.350
 up there in our time you kill two 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.320
 people and change weapons as you can. 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.780
 see this gameplay good I decided to put 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.789
 he I know some of my friends 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.370
 must have placed a normal match 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.090
 to deactivate the pump and active 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.940
 bomb, I preferred to put this 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.410
 The game because I did very well despite 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.330
 to have died a lot 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.870
 I was the first of the Brazilian team. 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.690
 What a rarity for me and another 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.819
 team that ended up winning is won propose 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.970
 one more death than I was good 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:35.200
 design that is the first day of france and 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.810
 It was well disputed that I found the game is 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:42.230
 global offensive cs it's cool because 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.299
 is a lot of nostalgia remembered quite the 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.489
 counter strike at the time I played in a 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.860
 house with my friends and I ended up 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.579
 living this experience again 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.290
 play 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:56.630
 the strike route there is again with friends and 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.329
 in multiplayer which is quite cool nÃ© 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.099
 Good people, just reminding you 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.329
 a lot of people were wondering why 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.910
 that other people do not 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.549
 participated other good opportunities 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.640
 it will be clear this is an invitation 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:13.370
 The one machine for these people there is 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.650
 Of course as already said edu in the divx video 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.230
 is everyone who is participating here 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.120
 they did not have a special participation 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.609
 other people like I said to you 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.440
 They will have opportunities of these is also 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:25.579
 a very cool thing because besides you 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.400
 can play 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.380
 yes yes that's that game of you stay 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.630
 scolding you keep fighting you stay 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.239
 brave because Brazil asked for I do not know 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.769
 who and such that there is kid stuff right 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.200
 the people that are already more adult the people 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:42.440
 know that youtube is made of 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.780
 also clear fun, and also of course 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.160
 interaction with other people in the 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.680
 that's what we want to promote 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.370
 also that other Brazilian clubs 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:55.220
 also be able to meet and 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:59.769
 youtube channels are all good world 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:03.109
 In this campaign I knew the channel of the 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:05.239
 now it's the hit that's the first team 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:07.430
 It is the duty of Germany as you well know 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.260
 I am the number of Brazilian beggars and 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.930
 I ended up knowing these average numbers 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.450
 throughout the world on account of meetings 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.780
 We do it, then I found out, man. 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.030
 that this guy hit him he's a pro guy in 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.919
 black ops 2 I'm going to leave what she 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.680
 I would say here in the description for you 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.700
 accompanying the ex-gay told me that he 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.710
 already knew 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.110
 even knowing the gringo team of 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.090
 Germany as I have said and have the channel 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.390
 I'll call if I'm not mistaken, youtube.com. 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:38.690
 I'll leave it to you. 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.940
 you in the description give a check that 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.040
 the guy is really very proof 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.330
 Ok, so it's personal, I hope 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.660
 Did you like my performance? 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.850
 then the overall offensive 133 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.620
 miss the round I'm the love to 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.520
 argentina for rest of the staff in the mouth 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.550
 nobody else 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.700
 argentina is the good dinosaur then 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:01.370
 follow the gameplay as it was in the 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:04.100
 view of our colleagues from Brazil here 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:07.400
 I'll leave it here on the final card to 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.320
 that you can click and see right and what 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.600
 I found it very cool too is that 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.350
 although we are promoting a 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.480
 movie 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.370
 we can make a lot of friends that I 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.870
 I think this is what the team needs to 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.410
 people who know how to evaluate good content 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:24.200
 people who know is to see not only if the game 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:27.410
 It's good, it's not staying at lic dislike. 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.780
 baby thing but it's also to see 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:33.290
 this cool interaction that youtube 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:36.740
 world can have in this friendship can 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:38.870
 It's really cool , it's cool, too. 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.910
 here is my tip for you 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.880
 I highly recommend against global strike 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:47.060
 offensive and the next round do not miss it 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.830
 bera of the son of three with only cuts 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.140
 I'm dying of silver dinosaur so it's 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.750
 This is what you liked about my performance there. 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.640
 God I read favorite ke and help in 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.250
 disclosure because if you help me 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:00.800
 quite so, that's it, folks 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:03.650
 Okay, and that's it. 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.990
 I lost the match 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.240
 France he will win by a death to 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.670
 more than I do, but it does not stop 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.620
 been detained well right now because I 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:16.330
 in first team beauty then this 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.330
 paid and went 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:32.110
 urban areas have a clue that the 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:32.110
 Flamengo
