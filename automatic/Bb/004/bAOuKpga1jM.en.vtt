00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.809
 hi everyone again i am hab today 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.240
 I want to talk about the new asus xerez 8 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:18.810
 within the rock range republic of 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.169
 gamers of asus which is a model of 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.140
 compact desktop computers where that 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:29.369
 has combined with an ultra processor 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:34.920
 low voltage with a graphic chip type 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:38.179
 of stop as is the force 750 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.920
 to achieve a silent team 

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:45.359
 efficient and having a power 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:50.170
 graphics suitable for 1080p games and 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:51.850
 with medium high quality levels 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.059
 as you can see is everything that was estimated 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.339
 entered are more or less the guts of the 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.699
 apparatus although behind and you have to 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:02.469
 disassemble almost the entire device 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.479
 we would also find other others 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.270
 important elements such as the processor 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:11.530
 or the graphics card but it gives us a 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:14.200
 idea of ​​how is this model of your design 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.720
 interior that is practically a design 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.170
 of laptop motherboard that is 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:23.480
 has given a more desktop character 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:27.230
 but in a very very compact format and 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.340
 and very efficient at the energy level this 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.530
 that is what I wanted 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.220
 show you with him 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:38.299
 this open is an added module that I have 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:41.180
 integrated to their in this in this unit and 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:44.560
 which is quite curious because it combines 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:48.380
 the wireless engine of this device 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.810
 with a receiver looks at home or from 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.640
 wireless screen that we can 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.170
 use from your mobile from any 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.299
 another device windows 8 8.1 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.250
 or any mobile as I say compatible 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:05.790
 with mira cast 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.130
 I'll show you for being the cover 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.570
 we retired to see inside what 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.970
 let's ride quickly because you 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.090
 I want 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.420
 show in this video also one of the 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.210
 elements that make this table top 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.560
 well an interesting part especially 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:26.510
 so you do not want to complicate life 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.800
 as you see until the stage put that we 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.650
 gave access to the gas plate and other 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.200
 components and we have here a module 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.540
 accessible for 2.5 hard drive 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.420
 inches up to 9 millimeters in height 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.000
 and access to the two memory banks that 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:45.010
 we had already seen inside this 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.010
 stage goes covered 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:52.160
 we slide it and as you can see we already make 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.290
 the complete device we can access 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.560
 that hard drive does not go to the internal one 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.410
 installed that you can see in our 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.240
 review that has a total of one 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.670
 terabyte is mechanical type 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.940
 but if you let us add our disk if 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:12.270
 we want another mechanical disk or ssd without 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.250
 more minimum problem 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.620
 this device holds up to 16 gigs of 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.540
 ram comes in 8 comes standard with 8 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.880
 gigas this model that we have received 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.700
 us from asus and as you see in the 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.220
 front we find two usb 3.0 ports 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.840
 one of them with a loading mode and 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:33.350
 even with the pc finished off sorry 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.540
 the power button that we see here 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.150
 and this is the button that gives us access to 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.790
 wireless screen mode we can 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.290
 have the PC on press it access 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.170
 to wireless screen mode do what 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.330
 that we want and go back to the PC without having 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.310
 what to restart turn off 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.080
 or any of these things 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.150
 over here we have the expulsion of air 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.970
 which is the upper part of the apparatus 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.569
 can work both vertically and in 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:03.299
 horizontal has legs for both 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.519
 modes of use and this is the back panel 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.940
 of connectors that is very very complete 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:10.880
 to have 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:13.460
 the audio output jacks 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:17.390
 hdmi optical audio output and 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:22.160
 displayport supports 4k GB screens 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:25.430
 ethernet with package management with the 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.430
 software that adds to your in your last 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:32.540
 rock models that is the game first 3 of 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:36.560
 own creation plus usb ports all from 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.430
 them of type 3.0 this is the tab that 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.280
 it blocks us 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:45.100
 access to expandable modules and that 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.680
 at the same time it serves as a kensington lock slot 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.450
 this is where we will connect the socket 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.639
 power that carries a transformer 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.800
 120 Watt 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:56.749
 that is not too big but yes that 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.469
 it is an external power source and 

00:04:56.749 --> 00:05:04.340
 you have to keep it in mind as you see it is 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:07.699
 a very compact format boss just 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.009
 a hand is a little and as you will see in 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:11.980
 our review the behavior of 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:15.130
 general performance 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.560
 and really graphic is pretty good and 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.350
 above all it 's very very silent is a 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.990
 Energy efficient processor with combined 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.360
 with a nvidia maxwell chip they get 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.160
 a spectacular result in this 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.010
 meaning and highly recommended for which 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.830
 want to have a htc or a compact pc 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:35.689
 to play and work that is silent 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.950
 and at the same time combine size 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:39.980
 and benefits 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.300
 this is all for now I invite you to 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.790
 read our full review there 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.070
 performance gameplay tests on 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.740
 real time and that I think it can 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.720
 be interesting greetings to all 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.890
 I am a hab and see you in a next 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.890
 occasion until later
