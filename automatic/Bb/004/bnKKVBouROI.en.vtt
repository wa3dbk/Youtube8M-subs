now<00:00:00.750> more<00:00:01.050> than<00:00:01.140> ever<00:00:01.290> we<00:00:01.410> really<00:00:01.860> need<00:00:02.100> to

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
now more than ever we really need to

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.360 
now more than ever we really need to
humanize<00:00:03.030> the<00:00:03.629> whole<00:00:03.810> immigration<00:00:04.370> dilemma

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
humanize the whole immigration dilemma

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.089 
humanize the whole immigration dilemma
and<00:00:05.700> I<00:00:06.359> don't<00:00:06.569> think<00:00:06.779> it's<00:00:06.960> humanized<00:00:07.470> as<00:00:07.859> much

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
and I don't think it's humanized as much

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.250 
and I don't think it's humanized as much
as<00:00:08.429> it<00:00:08.730> used<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:09.090> be<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:09.300> think<00:00:09.420> it's<00:00:09.719> become<00:00:10.050> so

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
as it used to be I think it's become so

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.280 
as it used to be I think it's become so
polarized<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:11.070> so<00:00:11.219> divisive<00:00:11.490> in<00:00:12.000> our<00:00:12.750> country

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
polarized and so divisive in our country

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.770 
polarized and so divisive in our country
that<00:00:13.590> we<00:00:13.769> don't<00:00:14.250> see<00:00:14.670> immigrants<00:00:15.330> as<00:00:15.450> human

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
that we don't see immigrants as human

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.810 
that we don't see immigrants as human
beings<00:00:15.809> anymore

while i was in reynosa a woman called
from<00:00:29.850> florida<00:00:30.390> just<00:00:30.810> incredibly<00:00:31.700> freaked<00:00:32.700> out

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
from florida just incredibly freaked out

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.970 
from florida just incredibly freaked out
because<00:00:33.270> she<00:00:33.660> had<00:00:33.780> paid<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.080> smuggler<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.770> bring

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
because she had paid a smuggler to bring

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.970 
because she had paid a smuggler to bring
her<00:00:35.100> three-year-old<00:00:35.670> across<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.720> she<00:00:37.710> hadn't

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
her three-year-old across and she hadn't

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.260 
her three-year-old across and she hadn't
heard<00:00:38.010> from<00:00:38.130> the<00:00:38.370> smuggler<00:00:38.790> in<00:00:38.880> more<00:00:39.059> than<00:00:39.210> a

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
heard from the smuggler in more than a

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.180 
heard from the smuggler in more than a
week<00:00:39.330> so<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:39.989> can't<00:00:40.320> imagine<00:00:40.800> having<00:00:40.950> a

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
week so I can't imagine having a

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.040 
week so I can't imagine having a
three-year-old<00:00:41.730> just<00:00:42.030> being<00:00:42.270> out<00:00:42.720> there

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
three-year-old just being out there

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.540 
three-year-old just being out there
floating<00:00:43.320> around<00:00:43.620> somewhere<00:00:43.890> with<00:00:44.370> some

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
floating around somewhere with some

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.670 
floating around somewhere with some
smuggler<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.270> mean<00:00:45.840> these<00:00:45.930> people<00:00:45.989> are<00:00:46.290> under

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
smuggler I mean these people are under

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.990 
smuggler I mean these people are under
incredibly<00:00:47.430> stressful<00:00:49.129> situations<00:00:50.129> they

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
incredibly stressful situations they

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.270 
incredibly stressful situations they
come<00:00:51.210> from<00:00:51.360> extreme<00:00:51.780> poverty<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.590> many<00:00:52.739> cases

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
come from extreme poverty in many cases

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.430 
come from extreme poverty in many cases
and<00:00:53.550> when<00:00:54.239> you're<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.420> desperate<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.230> think

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
and when you're that desperate I think

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.830 
and when you're that desperate I think
you<00:00:55.559> make<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.769> lot<00:00:56.040> of<00:00:56.070> really<00:00:56.670> poor<00:00:57.570> choices

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
you make a lot of really poor choices

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.170 
you make a lot of really poor choices
because<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.680> really<00:00:58.860> aren't<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.399> many

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
because it really aren't that many

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.640 
because it really aren't that many
choices<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.840> make<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.230> way<00:01:01.320> they<00:01:01.440> look<00:01:01.470> at<00:01:01.800> it

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.490 

the<00:01:06.190> entire<00:01:06.490> river<00:01:06.850> is<00:01:07.150> run<00:01:07.480> by<00:01:07.690> the<00:01:07.810> Gulf

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
to the social services in Mexico I mean

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.640 
to the social services in Mexico I mean
even<00:01:30.910> adults<00:01:31.300> are<00:01:31.600> afraid<00:01:31.930> to<00:01:31.960> speak<00:01:32.290> on<00:01:32.500> the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
even adults are afraid to speak on the

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.770 
even adults are afraid to speak on the
record<00:01:32.800> so<00:01:33.340> it<00:01:33.430> was<00:01:33.550> even<00:01:33.670> more<00:01:33.910> difficult<00:01:34.150> to

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
record so it was even more difficult to

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.880 
record so it was even more difficult to
get<00:01:34.960> children<00:01:35.500> to<00:01:35.910> speak<00:01:36.910> about<00:01:37.710> about<00:01:38.710> these

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
get children to speak about about these

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.500 
get children to speak about about these
issues<00:01:39.040> to<00:01:39.220> even<00:01:39.670> say<00:01:39.880> whether<00:01:40.150> they<00:01:40.450> were

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
issues to even say whether they were

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.900 
issues to even say whether they were
scared<00:01:41.080> or<00:01:41.260> not<00:01:41.410> but<00:01:41.680> it<00:01:41.830> was<00:01:42.040> an<00:01:42.310> incredibly

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
scared or not but it was an incredibly

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.160 
scared or not but it was an incredibly
sort<00:01:43.869> of<00:01:43.960> delicate<00:01:45.210> situation<00:01:46.210> and<00:01:46.690> probably

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
sort of delicate situation and probably

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.020 
sort of delicate situation and probably
one<00:01:47.380> of<00:01:47.410> the<00:01:47.590> hardest<00:01:47.950> stories<00:01:48.550> I<00:01:48.700> think<00:01:48.910> I've
