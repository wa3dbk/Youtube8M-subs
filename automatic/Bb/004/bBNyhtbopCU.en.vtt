I think the only thing that's different
about<00:01:21.810> them<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.200> if<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.380> don't<00:01:22.619> get<00:01:22.740> manual<00:01:23.220> in

about them is if you don't get manual in

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.010 
about them is if you don't get manual in
them<00:01:23.490> but<00:01:23.670> i'm<00:01:24.090> sure<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.450> guys<00:01:24.509> will<00:01:24.869> figure
