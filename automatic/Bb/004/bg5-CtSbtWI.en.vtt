00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:07.800
 very good people here we are in departure 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.510
 started value is a confirmed low the 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.019
 I wanted to cut myself and I played it from a 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.110
 principle is worth the only thing for those who 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.570
 I wanted to teach you not because the truth 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.949
 with six minutes in minutes and a half already 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.170
 verbal and now if you do not do a little bit 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.689
 long and the confirmed trip is already 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.670
 in what you have to put it to 100 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.119
 here, mister jefazo 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.010
 100 sheets then put it clear you 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.670
 you have to swallow practically all 10 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:41.280
 minutes and well the reason for this 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:44.940
 video there I go the theme of the slices 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.250
 we always have the idea that you have to 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.430
 put it on dogs and swarm 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.430
 to kill an egg for example then 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.100
 besides, someone was thinking that 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.239
 I can go up but you have to think what 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.339
 to climb from the typical you will not go up 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.170
 a game so I do not have much 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.750
 sometimes felt if not if you do 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.540
 a good streak or something like that 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.229
 I say but in truth that thinking I say 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.200
 fuck 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.229
 I told frank today I have come up with 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.159
 turrets or something like that and 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.770
 then I started because these three are 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.380
 as I say the paper bird or the 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.179
 little paper plane then the turret 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.810
 what you have seen that he has moved from 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:32.909
 site in the right aisle and the agr and 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.509
 today what is ethical let's see how 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.610
 no no I never put me down so these 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.069
 streaks the first time I put it on 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.550
 from hoyocasero let's see let's see 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:46.710
 how it kills we are not going to see how to kill and 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.880
 honestly I was surprised I was surprised 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.299
 enough now 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.549
 seeing as I'm talking already from 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.960
 the first moment that changed the turret 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.990
 that you have seen that I put in the other 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.929
 side I do not stop killing with the turret is 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.909
 awesome soul with that of 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:03.719
 absolutely compose a good turret 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.659
 put 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.250
 can be it the question is that the 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.039
 put it in a place I do not know 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.709
 happens to anyone or that you can break it 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.430
 behind alone and for example neighborhood 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.230
 quite not for what enough because 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.239
 can do on the other side the only thing 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.830
 that like piquÃ© where my team then it 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.260
 move a little 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.540
 little by little, so do not say another 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.090
 word 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.129
 and I said I say here is alive is 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.590
 triumphs like chocolate and here you see 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.480
 example that threw people I put the this 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.790
 that now for example they are going to kill me 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.299
 but good 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:45.079
 one up there and good that tower 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:48.049
 It also lasts less but honestly I 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:51.370
 surprised I was surprised because the 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:53.299
 turret and agr 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.180
 obviously the angels and I have 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:59.120
 put and they kill pretty well then by 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.010
 example yes if you control it the truth 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.609
 is that it's a no-no, but there 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.040
 you have to see that you do not kill 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:10.790
 you not that for example I know that you 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.579
 for example you can see it for example in 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.739
 I repeat more than garlic can choose and 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:18.439
 you can kill at the same time as the cr but if 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.620
 you control it, you see as you are limited 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:25.069
 little as it limits you and a little bit and 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.769
 Well, I wanted to go up , I said it 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:30.409
 little bit because all this is the subject of 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.990
 range to this I will be trying more 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:35.510
 things more streaks like that 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:38.960
 triumph is not of course now 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.360
 you will see the end I'll put it you know 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.360
 that the squares come out have not killed 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.420
 so many times with this with this streak and 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.870
 so many revenges there are such I do not know what or 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.800
 everything appears and you will see 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.100
 I do not need to quietly 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.770
 you count of novelis and good that is in 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:01.520
 country so you know that I have pending 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:04.670
 about the comments but about the 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.280
 assault rifles is worth it I was 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.110
 watching and thank you very much for all 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.380
 those comments I'm going to put a 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.720
 piles of weapons you've put 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.489
 to you not to look too I saw a 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.950
 management lot that scj us at 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.910
 counted is very well is very good 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.770
 I want to try new things 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.010
 and good is the only thing that yesterday for example 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:30.190
 he said I'm going to do something a little bit for 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.820
 the theme of the streak and the truth that I 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.620
 taste 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:37.660
 Anyway, I'm with the most 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:41.410
 kill with a demon I put the scavenger 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.390
 and I do not just put it on almost and take it away from me 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.790
 remove ghosts I put myself in hard line 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:49.630
 I say what I know to have a little knife 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:52.270
 less cancer and that what already seems that 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.970
 people do not know about you but I think that 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:59.020
 people have already started to get less 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:01.900
 the one that is seen already because to think that the 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.690
 easier things you already have a practice 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.060
 with the game and then you become a 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:10.240
 little bit more ambitious does not welcome 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:13.449
 you want to put on and something a sugar cane no longer 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:16.029
 the typical place goes 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:17.949
 and man does a lot because you can kill 

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:20.449
 to people and you can know where they are and 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:22.279
 the whole story and 2 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:24.559
 physically it will not kill you with a 

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:26.539
 turret nor with a grna like that 

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:29.150
 then man look here for example 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.650
 you see that you do that you do not do it when 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.020
 a turret is firing and you 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.599
 they instructed you crosses and if it does not happen what 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.849
 what happens and well then we arrived at 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:40.099
 end look almost 60 low enough me 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:44.719
 little but good for what he wanted 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:46.669
 Video is fine or whether I kill it 

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:49.610
 some last with the gusts but 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:53.479
 very much very much here you have the 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:56.029
 last low puts with the turret and good 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:58.320
 Well now I put a little bit the 

00:05:56.029 --> 00:06:00.870
 east east theme 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.550
 how much has been killed have been a 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.650
 little in putting it has seen that it is high 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.780
 the only higher part of the update 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:11.100
 which is the truth that I have no idea 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:14.700
 what is it going to put in I do not know what it is for but 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:16.590
 good and then before it appears 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.660
 I wanted to thank you for everything 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.140
 as usual 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:25.320
 I'm going to try more little things look here is 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:29.160
 15 with the agr 12 with the turret 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:32.640
 which is a pass or 27 plus 2 of 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.930
 small plane 28-29 or almost 30 with the 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.270
 It's so good that I hope you have 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:39.740
 liked that I have informed you enough and 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.740
 you know until tomorrow
