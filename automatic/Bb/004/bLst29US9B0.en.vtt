 you are all fine but in everything 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.910
 case I have the form and we are 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.380
 today for the launch of a 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.200
 new little series this just before the 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.329
 exit of this long-awaited fifa 14 that I 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.180
 think we're all waiting with a lot 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.940
 of impatience and so so this series 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:43.450
 will consist of presenting you with top 10 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.730
 on on several styles two players and 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.870
 you will see that throughout 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.489
 next episodes 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.949
 in any case I hope this series is going 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.260
 to please you and we are no more afraid of 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.579
 tents and we will start by donating with 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.620
 the player who is 10th in this ranking 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.719
 if ezequiel the Nigerian of the standard of 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.239
 cork that had 67 2 general year 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:04.239
 last and who is now at 72 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.940
 let's talk about it so it's super fast 92 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.229
 legal he's 66 years old pulling over so that's it 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.610
 it is really a very very card 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.200
 interesting why not integrate it 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.430
 in a Belgian d1 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.229
 it could be really great 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.280
 interesting and it's a player who was 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.810
 already very good this year 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.210
 so why he would not be so refusal 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.980
 from 14 in ninth place to majeed 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.930
 waris playing related spartak moscow 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.970
 so as the year of the last addresses 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.170
 by which he had 70 of general play by 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.000
 against last year then as 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.140
 language 1.71 so that's it apparently 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.940
 cast a very very good player 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.100
 so that's if you loved her on this 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.800
 the was 13 beats test it simply 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.880
 on the wire 14 years 8th position in renty 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.830
 which has 92 speed 58 years draws according to 62 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.090
 head 74 in dribbling so here I am 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.470
 a little questionable about the fact that he 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.210
 is 58 years old almost pulls it really 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.800
 not much at all but that's it 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.780
 maybe who maybe he will be good 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.330
 but in any case I saw that I on the 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.710
 stadiums of two players that it's not his 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.720
 strong point the finish but in any case 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.040
 he goes very fast and a little bit like 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.200
 all players from elsewhere in this top 10 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.030
 in seventh position naive barbeau who 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.520
 it was already very fast the year 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.210
 last year that year 93 speed 73 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.129
 years shot 75 in the lead and 85 in dribbling he 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.390
 really has a very very good map and 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.849
 I really advise you to use it 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.080
 in your first teams on foot 14 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.909
 because I had used in 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.620
 first teams on was 13 he had 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:20.170
 been simply monstrous with 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.879
 Muriel in tip in a 4 2 3 1 I had 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.900
 enacted and and muriel in b usa 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.310
 had really done a lot of 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.560
 ravages so many years that makes a meter 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.330
 88 with such speed it's just 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.290
 impassable it's a real tank and I you 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.420
 strongly advise 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.490
 in sixth position in africa is so 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.990
 cricket it's a Canadian who is in 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.640
 bronze and in addition he has no void then 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.220
 I do not know why in any case he has 93 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.930
 speed 50 87 63 dribbles and 52 years 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.700
 so why not pull it into 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.080
 a Canadian team that's so ever 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.940
 you want to make a team 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.470
 Canadian do not know if it would come to 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.180
 the idea of ​​someone why not eh bah 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.770
 if you want to know who you are 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.500
 could buy by bus and ballet gold 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.440
 american in fifth position on lamb 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.340
 an Argentinian who he's 93 speed by 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.870
 against what is a pity that it is 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.670
 only one meter sixty 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.950
 two flaps a very very card 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.520
 interesting with 66 years old pulls 70 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.930
 sandrine and 70 in the lead a day that who 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.450
 will surely be very very good and 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.910
 really cheap in fourth position 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.310
 we have martins guys so martin he 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.990
 evolves in mls to fc sounders 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.940
 he still has these terrifying five 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.880
 star of bad foot and so here it is 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.650
 was already really out of the year 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.590
 last and well now on wire 14 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.200
 that's where the guys are at his big 93 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.630
 8 aces 70 in head encircled 75 in dribble 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.280
 pardon and 72 whole it's going to be very 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.360
 very badly and if you want a player you 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.250
 have very quickly in mls 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.250
 you have martin in third 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.989
 position one in shelton the jamaican one 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.720
 jamaican pardon who is evolving in russia to 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:47.380
 the ig 94 legal speed is one meter 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.209
 83 71 in dribble 67 in the lead and 64 in 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.160
 pulling over he's 66 years old so go on he 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.840
 can he possibly integrate a role 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.790
 of smuggler in your team why 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.739
 not but there are very very nice stats and 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.989
 why not integrate it into a russia 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.970
 in league or in money or in a hive 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.790
 miku just because he's going 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.379
 super fast 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.930
 a little all players russian 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:10.219
 league in second place on now douro 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:12.230
 65.2 overall speed 94 66 66 years 

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:13.310
 60r dribbler in the lead since it's more 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.689
 one meter eighty so here is ya 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.880
 not too many problems at the 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:18.530
 physical that will not be thrown in the shoulder 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.109
 against shoulder a player who was already 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.030
 good on was 13 and surely there was 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.389
 help on 14 with his big 94's 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.430
 speed 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.620
 it's going to hurt very badly that your 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.930
 defenders remain on their guard in 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.860
 first position is the first player 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.590
 of this top 10 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.360
 it's stone emerick aubameyang the gala 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.340
 new recruit from borussia dortmund who 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.099
 last year but 93 speed is going 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.979
 this year he has 95 and in addition he took 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:46.190
 one more in general 78 dribbling 76 into 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:49.520
 head 76 years old pulls and 73 years pass 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:52.130
 more than interesting stats is a player 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.330
 which will surely be very much used on 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.610
 it was 14 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.900
 simply because of his speed 1 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.419
 I think a little bit like every year 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.400
 is to do very very badly 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.539
 it would be a little bit the new design 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.160
 given that this year is vain and 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:06.680
 1mg it is silver and in addition it 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.690
 at 71.2 general and so that's so refusal to 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.909
 14 in Spain 2.0 it's aubameyang the 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.770
 guy the worst coach that this little top 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:14.659

 central fast of the game on the 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.110
 I have already prepared the pilots of the ten 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.510
 best goalkeepers in any case 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.909
