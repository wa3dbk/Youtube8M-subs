your peers in your organization for

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.910 
your peers in your organization for
example<00:00:24.300> calendar<00:00:24.900> server<00:00:25.109> allows<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.710> to

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
example calendar server allows you to

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.210 
example calendar server allows you to
have<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.340> personal<00:00:27.000> shared<00:00:28.010> calendar<00:00:29.010> on<00:00:29.189> the

other calendars with other people it
allows<00:00:33.660> for<00:00:33.690> delegation<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:35.070> allows<00:00:35.370> for

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
allows for delegation it allows for

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.000 
allows for delegation it allows for
shared<00:00:35.880> resources<00:00:36.540> all<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.649> these<00:00:37.800> are

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
shared resources all of these are

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.160 
shared resources all of these are
available<00:00:38.180> through<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.360> web<00:00:39.540> interface<00:00:39.570> as

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
available through the web interface as

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.780 
available through the web interface as
well<00:00:40.410> for<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.710> calendar<00:00:41.010> server<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.640> this

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
well for the calendar server so this

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.150 
well for the calendar server so this
becomes<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.180> very<00:00:42.360> flexible<00:00:42.690> solution<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.980> can

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
becomes a very flexible solution you can

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.069 
becomes a very flexible solution you can
access<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.610> from<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.850> mac<00:00:45.059> from<00:00:45.570> an<00:00:45.719> iOS<00:00:46.050> device

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
access it from a mac from an iOS device

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.920 
access it from a mac from an iOS device
even<00:00:47.039> from<00:00:47.219> windows<00:00:47.579> all<00:00:47.910> right<00:00:48.450> now<00:00:48.570> address

chat server works a little bit
differently<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.450> ichat<00:01:33.810> server<00:01:33.869> sits<00:01:34.650> there

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
differently the ichat server sits there

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.819 
differently the ichat server sits there
on<00:01:34.979> your<00:01:35.100> server<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.640> acts<00:01:35.880> as<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.479> host<00:01:36.900> for

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
on your server and acts as a host for

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.010 
on your server and acts as a host for
instant<00:01:38.579> messaging<00:01:39.119> conversations<00:01:39.840> between

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
people who are on that server so for

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.859 
people who are on that server so for
example<00:01:43.979> if<00:01:44.399> you've<00:01:44.579> got<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:45.060> small<00:01:45.420> work<00:01:45.630> group

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
example if you've got a small work group

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.100 
example if you've got a small work group
of<00:01:46.049> say<00:01:46.229> 10<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.740> 15<00:01:47.130> people<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.759> they<00:01:48.689> all<00:01:48.720> want

to be able to instant message each other

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.130 
to be able to instant message each other
but<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.210> don't<00:01:51.390> want<00:01:51.570> those<00:01:51.750> instant

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
but you don't want those instant
