and define their shape after that the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.260 
and define their shape after that the
branches<00:00:52.620> will<00:00:52.800> be<00:00:52.920> strong<00:00:53.250> enough<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:54.120> that

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
branches will be strong enough so that

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.180 
branches will be strong enough so that
they<00:00:54.360> don't<00:00:54.510> snap<00:00:54.930> under<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.739> weight<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:56.100> the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.090 
fruit as a golden rule apple and pear
trees<00:01:00.629> should<00:01:00.899> be<00:01:00.930> pruned<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.440> winter<00:01:01.829> and

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
trees should be pruned in winter and

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.539 
trees should be pruned in winter and
stone<00:01:02.460> fruit<00:01:02.789> trees<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.359> spring<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:05.040> overall

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
stone fruit trees in spring the overall

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.760 
stone fruit trees in spring the overall
idea<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.450> create<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.810> balanced<00:01:07.409> goblet

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
idea is to create a balanced goblet

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.340 
idea is to create a balanced goblet
style<00:01:08.040> shape<00:01:08.330> this<00:01:09.330> allows<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.900> air<00:01:10.020> and

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
style shape this allows the air and

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.710 
style shape this allows the air and
sunlight<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.920> come<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:12.030> trees<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.510> stay

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
sunlight to come in the trees to stay

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.140 
sunlight to come in the trees to stay
healthy<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.890> can<00:01:14.040> produce<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.490> really<00:01:14.909> good

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
healthy so it can produce a really good

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.230 
healthy so it can produce a really good
crop<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.509> fruit<00:01:16.430> don't<00:01:17.430> be<00:01:17.670> alarmed<00:01:17.880> by<00:01:18.180> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
crop of fruit don't be alarmed by the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.670 
crop of fruit don't be alarmed by the
severity<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.930> pruning<00:01:19.170> we'll<00:01:19.409> show<00:01:19.650> you

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
severity of the pruning we'll show you

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.399 
severity of the pruning we'll show you
just<00:01:20.040> think<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.030> as<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.240> pride<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.750> decent

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
just think of it as a pride in a decent

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.260 
just think of it as a pride in a decent
haircut<00:01:24.740> first<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.920> all<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.700> really

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
haircut first of all it is really

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.670 
haircut first of all it is really
important<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.810> have<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.049> sharp<00:01:28.350> pair<00:01:28.619> of

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
important to have a sharp pair of

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.460 
important to have a sharp pair of
secateurs<00:01:29.270> blunt<00:01:30.270> tools<00:01:30.570> can<00:01:30.840> create<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.140> tear

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
secateurs blunt tools can create a tear

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.600 
secateurs blunt tools can create a tear
in<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.650> branch<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.159> will<00:01:32.250> encourage

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
in the branch that will encourage

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.020 
in the branch that will encourage
disease<00:01:33.799> it<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:35.009> also<00:01:35.189> essential<00:01:36.000> to

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
disease it is also essential to

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.789 
disease it is also essential to
sterilize<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.780> secretary<00:01:37.290> at<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.500> beginning

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
sterilize the secretary at the beginning

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.859 
sterilize the secretary at the beginning
of<00:01:37.890> each<00:01:38.100> pruning<00:01:38.579> session<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.150> between

of each pruning session and between

of each pruning session and between
trees<00:01:40.259> again<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:41.130> avoid<00:01:41.340> spreading<00:01:41.729> disease

trees again to avoid spreading disease

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.880 
trees again to avoid spreading disease
this<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.790> classic<00:01:45.299> example<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.560> fruit

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
this is a classic example of a fruit

this is a classic example of a fruit
tree<00:01:47.159> h2<00:01:48.350> it<00:01:49.350> should<00:01:49.530> show<00:01:49.770> signs<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.430> three<00:01:50.729> to

become<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.420> primary<00:02:06.810> branches<00:02:08.569> it<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:10.410> better

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
become the primary branches it is better

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.770 
become the primary branches it is better
to<00:02:10.860> avoid<00:02:10.950> those<00:02:11.459> rising<00:02:11.819> straight<00:02:12.330> up<00:02:12.569> from

so you can keep the ideal goblet shaped

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.920 
so you can keep the ideal goblet shaped

so<00:03:04.280> you<00:03:04.340> can<00:03:04.579> encourage<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:05.239> tree<00:03:05.510> to<00:03:05.690> branch

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
so you can encourage the tree to branch

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:12.280 
so you can encourage the tree to branch
away<00:03:06.290> from<00:03:06.560> its<00:03:06.680> center<00:03:10.420> it<00:03:11.420> is<00:03:11.629> important<00:03:12.260> to
