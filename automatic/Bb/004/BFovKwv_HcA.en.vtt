course so take your time for the course
and<00:00:39.870> keep<00:00:40.260> your<00:00:40.470> energy<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.160> start<00:00:42.060> maybe<00:00:42.900> a

and keep your energy and start maybe a

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.610 
and keep your energy and start maybe a
little<00:00:43.170> bit<00:00:43.380> easier<00:00:44.390> because<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.470> end

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
little bit easier because in the end

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.830 
little bit easier because in the end
it's<00:00:46.770> getting<00:00:47.010> pretty<00:00:47.580> hard<00:00:47.850> with<00:00:48.150> that<00:00:48.420> you

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
it's getting pretty hard with that you

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.070 
it's getting pretty hard with that you
subscribe<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.260> minute<00:00:49.740> all<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.980> real<00:00:50.220> and

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
subscribe to minute all the real and

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.370 
subscribe to minute all the real and
threw<00:00:52.080> him<00:00:52.650> on<00:00:52.770> fire<00:00:52.980> nation<00:00:53.460> parks<00:00:53.850> oh<00:00:54.380> yeah

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
threw him on fire nation parks oh yeah

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.920 
threw him on fire nation parks oh yeah
and<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.740> think<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.460> first<00:00:56.760> half<00:00:57.540> of<00:00:57.750> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
and I think in the first half of the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.220 
and I think in the first half of the
race<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.440> have<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.640> stay<00:00:59.640> cool<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.750> focus<00:01:01.110> on

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
race you have to stay cool to focus on

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.469 
race you have to stay cool to focus on
nutrition<00:01:01.470> and<00:01:02.540> on<00:01:03.540> the<00:01:03.720> climbs<00:01:04.700> try<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.759> be

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
nutrition and on the climbs try to be

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.539 
nutrition and on the climbs try to be
steady<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.899> not<00:01:07.320> not<00:01:07.890> going<00:01:08.130> too<00:01:08.399> hard

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
steady and not not going too hard

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.660 
steady and not not going too hard
because<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:09.060> will<00:01:09.299> be<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.479> long<00:01:10.159> but<00:01:11.159> beautiful

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
because it will be a long but beautiful

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.940 
because it will be a long but beautiful
day<00:01:11.820> when<00:01:12.780> people<00:01:13.170> talk<00:01:13.350> about<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.710> bike

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
day when people talk about this bike

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.349 
day when people talk about this bike
course<00:01:14.189> they<00:01:14.460> all<00:01:14.579> say<00:01:14.789> you<00:01:14.820> have<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.210> be<00:01:15.329> a

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:15.359 
course they all say you have to be a

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:18.020 
course they all say you have to be a
good<00:01:15.659> climber<00:01:16.079> but<00:01:16.530> how<00:01:17.039> important<00:01:17.579> is<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.759> to

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
good climber but how important is it to

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.569 
good climber but how important is it to
be<00:01:18.270> able<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.719> keep<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.439> power<00:01:19.679> downhill<00:01:20.399> and

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579 
be able to keep the power downhill and

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:24.200 
be able to keep the power downhill and
in<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.880> flats<00:01:21.149> oh<00:01:21.299> yeah<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.409> think<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:23.210> this

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
in the flats oh yeah I think this this

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.889 
in the flats oh yeah I think this this
is<00:01:24.329> the<00:01:24.509> main<00:01:24.929> key<00:01:25.499> for<00:01:25.859> that<00:01:26.039> horse<00:01:26.899> keeping

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
is the main key for that horse keeping

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.660 
is the main key for that horse keeping
the<00:01:28.999> power<00:01:29.999> steady<00:01:30.450> not<00:01:31.409> going<00:01:31.679> too<00:01:31.950> fast<00:01:32.189> and

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
the power steady not going too fast and

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.239 
the power steady not going too fast and
that's<00:01:32.939> going<00:01:33.149> to<00:01:33.329> slow<00:01:33.689> but<00:01:34.619> keeping<00:01:34.979> the

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:35.249 
that's going to slow but keeping the

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:39.080 
that's going to slow but keeping the
power<00:01:35.729> steady<00:01:36.119> also<00:01:36.569> not<00:01:36.719> flat<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.740> can<00:01:37.950> go<00:01:38.159> go

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
power steady also not flat you can go go

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.179 
power steady also not flat you can go go
up<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.450> climbs<00:01:39.689> not<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.679> fast

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
up the climbs not so fast

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.370 
up the climbs not so fast
but<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.520> have<00:01:41.639> to<00:01:41.909> push<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.780> gear<00:01:43.020> thoughts

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
but you have to push the gear thoughts

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.199 
but you have to push the gear thoughts
on<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.619> downhill<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.280> mean<00:01:44.490> on<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.759> steep<00:01:44.969> down

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:45.209 
on the downhill I mean on the steep down

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:46.249 
on the downhill I mean on the steep down
earth<00:01:45.389> be<00:01:45.569> careful

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
earth be careful

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.569 
earth be careful
but<00:01:47.630> yeah<00:01:48.630> keeping<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.469> wattage<00:01:50.100> steady

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
but yeah keeping the the wattage steady

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.109 
but yeah keeping the the wattage steady
that's<00:01:50.999> the<00:01:51.240> main<00:01:51.450> goal

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
that's the main goal

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.469 
that's the main goal
so<00:01:52.990> in<00:01:53.350> terms<00:01:53.679> of<00:01:53.859> gear<00:01:54.399> on<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:54.939> bike<00:01:55.179> then

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
so in terms of gear on the bike then

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.080 
so in terms of gear on the bike then
it's<00:01:55.810> rough<00:01:56.469> road<00:01:56.740> conditions<00:01:57.310> partially<00:01:57.880> and

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
it's rough road conditions partially and

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.209 
it's rough road conditions partially and
so<00:01:58.299> on<00:01:58.420> any<00:01:58.899> tips<00:01:59.289> there<00:01:59.530> what<00:01:59.799> do<00:01:59.920> you<00:01:59.979> get<00:02:00.100> out

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
so on any tips there what do you get out

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:02.690 
so on any tips there what do you get out
for<00:02:00.490> yeah<00:02:00.880> I<00:02:00.909> would<00:02:01.299> choose<00:02:01.539> not<00:02:01.899> the<00:02:02.079> lightest

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
for yeah I would choose not the lightest

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.690 
for yeah I would choose not the lightest
tubes<00:02:03.700> so<00:02:04.469> think<00:02:05.469> about<00:02:05.560> that<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:06.929> speeds

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
tubes so think about that the speeds

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.210 
tubes so think about that the speeds
Sampath<00:02:09.700> made<00:02:09.970> a<00:02:10.000> little<00:02:10.360> bit<00:02:10.479> rough<00:02:10.769> so<00:02:11.769> and

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
Sampath made a little bit rough so and

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.270 
Sampath made a little bit rough so and
take<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.700> cube<00:02:13.030> with<00:02:13.440> some<00:02:14.440> kind<00:02:14.739> of<00:02:14.830> protection

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
take a cube with some kind of protection

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.650 
take a cube with some kind of protection
yeah<00:02:15.819> and<00:02:17.069> with<00:02:18.069> this<00:02:18.280> kind<00:02:18.610> of<00:02:18.790> race<00:02:19.239> with

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
yeah and with this kind of race with

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.650 
yeah and with this kind of race with
this<00:02:20.319> wind<00:02:20.769> and<00:02:21.040> looking<00:02:21.310> climbs<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:22.000> little

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
this wind and looking climbs and little

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.660 
this wind and looking climbs and little
bit<00:02:22.750> slower<00:02:23.049> times<00:02:23.470> it's<00:02:23.860> more<00:02:24.099> important<00:02:24.640> to

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
bit slower times it's more important to

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.530 
bit slower times it's more important to
be<00:02:24.819> safe<00:02:25.090> on<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.390> on<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.840> bikes<00:02:26.079> so<00:02:26.790> yeah<00:02:27.790> just
