alright<00:00:39.719> number<00:00:39.899> two<00:00:40.200> use<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.800> for<00:00:41.010> speed<00:00:41.370> now

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:41.789 
alright number two use it for speed now

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:43.700 
alright number two use it for speed now
most<00:00:42.059> people<00:00:42.239> know<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.929> use<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.199> rage<00:00:43.530> spell

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
most people know and use a rage spell

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.979 
most people know and use a rage spell
for<00:00:44.100> its<00:00:44.219> damage<00:00:44.609> increase<00:00:45.030> but<00:00:45.329> rarely<00:00:45.749> do

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
for its damage increase but rarely do

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.110 
for its damage increase but rarely do
people<00:00:46.289> use<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.589> primarily<00:00:47.070> as<00:00:47.339> a<00:00:47.370> speed<00:00:47.850> boost

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.599 
people use it primarily as a speed boost
now<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.140> particularly<00:00:49.530> helpful<00:00:50.069> for

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:50.609 
now this is particularly helpful for

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:53.000 
now this is particularly helpful for
slower<00:00:50.969> units<00:00:51.390> such<00:00:51.539> as<00:00:51.569> balloons<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.649> get

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
slower units such as balloons to get

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.099 
slower units such as balloons to get
them<00:00:53.159> to<00:00:53.280> their<00:00:53.370> destination<00:00:53.659> but<00:00:54.659> this<00:00:54.929> can

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:55.109 
them to their destination but this can

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:56.809 
them to their destination but this can
also<00:00:55.260> apply<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.589> other<00:00:55.710> slower<00:00:56.219> units<00:00:56.640> such<00:00:56.789> as

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:56.819 
also apply to other slower units such as

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:58.819 
also apply to other slower units such as
giants<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.569> you<00:00:58.079> want<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.350> get<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.559> boost

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829

spells because the rage spells do not

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.510 
spells because the rage spells do not
stack<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:40.230> just<00:01:40.440> keep<00:01:40.620> in<00:01:40.740> mind<00:01:40.770> double<00:01:41.340> rage

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
stack so just keep in mind double rage

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.120 
stack so just keep in mind double rage
does<00:01:41.850> not<00:01:42.030> equal<00:01:42.360> double<00:01:42.840> effective<00:01:43.440> but

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
does not equal double effective but

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.590 
does not equal double effective but
that's<00:01:44.400> about<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.670> guys<00:01:44.820> if<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.300> haven't
