00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
because there's three different modes to

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.580 
because there's three different modes to
stick<00:01:21.409> doesn't<00:01:22.409> like<00:01:22.710> my<00:01:22.920> finger<00:01:23.280> okay<00:01:23.850> so

stick doesn't like my finger okay so
let's<00:01:25.590> see<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:26.040> its<00:01:26.340> own<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.549> mode<00:01:26.900> and

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
let's see on its own you mode and

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.590 
let's see on its own you mode and
there's<00:01:28.200> no<00:01:28.290> flare<00:01:29.009> at<00:01:29.130> all<00:01:29.280> but<00:01:30.240> if<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.450> then

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
there's no flare at all but if you then

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.990 
there's no flare at all but if you then
pop<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.079> end<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.409> another<00:01:31.560> one<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.850> get

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
pop it on the end of another one you get

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.380 
pop it on the end of another one you get
a<00:01:33.030> completely<00:01:33.479> different<00:01:33.930> look<00:01:34.020> as<00:01:34.200> well

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
a completely different look as well

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.460 
a completely different look as well

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
have Flaming end pieces all over your

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.109 
have Flaming end pieces all over your
base<00:01:46.159> many<00:01:47.159> way<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.520> don't<00:01:47.790> think<00:01:47.940> I'll<00:01:48.030> be

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
base many way I don't think I'll be

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.609 
base many way I don't think I'll be
getting<00:01:48.240> out<00:01:48.450> anywhere<00:01:48.810> soon<00:01:49.080> naturally<00:01:49.470> it's

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
getting out anywhere soon naturally it's

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.400 
getting out anywhere soon naturally it's
that<00:01:49.830> expensive<00:01:50.990> so<00:01:51.990> I'm<00:01:52.080> going<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.260> put<00:01:52.380> that

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
that expensive so I'm going to put that

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.890 
that expensive so I'm going to put that
back<00:01:52.940> at<00:01:53.940> least<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.270> serve<00:01:54.450> some<00:01:54.720> purpose

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
back at least it serve some purpose

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.650 
back at least it serve some purpose

but look at total annihilation total

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.860 
but look at total annihilation total
annihilation<00:03:16.910> okay<00:03:17.910> right<00:03:18.330> so<00:03:18.480> that's<00:03:18.720> that

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
annihilation okay right so that's that

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.080 
annihilation okay right so that's that
right<00:03:19.170> what<00:03:19.440> you<00:03:19.530> always<00:03:19.710> see<00:03:20.160> is<00:03:20.370> what<00:03:20.970> the

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
max that maxed out level peckers look

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.570 
max that maxed out level peckers look
like<00:03:25.080> they're<00:03:25.320> attacking<00:03:25.620> so<00:03:25.950> let's<00:03:26.280> go<00:03:26.400> this

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580

where I'm going to be any up but still
we<00:03:30.570> might<00:03:30.720> flip<00:03:30.990> through<00:03:31.230> a<00:03:31.260> few<00:03:31.530> total<00:03:31.950> noob

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
we might flip through a few total noob

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.780 
we might flip through a few total noob
basis<00:03:32.580> of<00:03:33.120> which<00:03:33.510> that<00:03:33.780> is<00:03:33.930> one<00:03:37.490> so<00:03:38.490> as<00:03:38.580> you<00:03:38.640> can

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
basis of which that is one so as you can

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.620 
basis of which that is one so as you can
see<00:03:39.000> by<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.240> way<00:03:39.420> I<00:03:39.600> got<00:03:40.730> 55<00:03:41.730> max<00:03:42.030> that<00:03:42.270> wizards

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
see by the way I got 55 max that wizards

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.420 
see by the way I got 55 max that wizards
and<00:03:43.050> amex<00:03:43.620> out<00:03:43.830> Becker's<00:03:44.250> also<00:03:45.209> got<00:03:45.330> to<00:03:45.510> rage

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
and amex out Becker's also got to rage

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.650 
and amex out Becker's also got to rage
so<00:03:47.430> we're<00:03:47.580> going<00:03:47.670> to<00:03:47.790> try<00:03:47.880> to<00:03:47.940> find<00:03:48.180> a<00:03:48.330> basis

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
so we're going to try to find a basis

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:56.570 
so we're going to try to find a basis
