00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
I'm definitely not an expert and the OB

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.130 
I'm definitely not an expert and the OB
that<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.369> have<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.939> much<00:00:30.240> much<00:00:30.449> much<00:00:30.689> simpler

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
that I have is a much much much simpler

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.370 
that I have is a much much much simpler
type<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.650> OB<00:00:31.969> like<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.120> traditional<00:00:33.780> OB<00:00:34.260> you

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
type of OB like a traditional OB you

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.650 
type of OB like a traditional OB you
would<00:00:34.530> be<00:00:34.620> like<00:00:34.860> tying<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.700> bow<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.390> stuff

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
would be like tying the bow and stuff

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.729 
would be like tying the bow and stuff
like<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:37.020> but<00:00:37.260> yeah<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.520> don't<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:39.590> didn't<00:00:40.590> want

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
like that but yeah I don't I didn't want

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.470 
like that but yeah I don't I didn't want
to<00:00:40.800> try<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.160> this<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.670> much<00:00:41.910> much<00:00:42.090> much<00:00:42.300> much

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
to try that this is much much much much

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.760 
to try that this is much much much much
easier<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:44.870> yeah<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:45.989> comes<00:00:46.260> with<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.649> bow

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
easier and yeah it comes with the bow

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.220 
easier and yeah it comes with the bow
that<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.190> stick<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.640> back<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.210> much<00:00:48.960> much

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
that you stick in the back so much much

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.270 
that you stick in the back so much much
much<00:00:49.410> much<00:00:49.620> simpler<00:00:50.010> but<00:00:51.260> yeah<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.590> wanted<00:00:53.129> to

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
much much simpler but yeah I wanted to

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.180 
much much simpler but yeah I wanted to
show<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:55.020> guys<00:00:55.350> were<00:00:55.530> curious<00:00:55.949> about

yukata
so<00:01:03.719> here<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:05.519> really<00:01:05.939> really<00:01:06.570> really

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
so here it is I really really really

00:01:06.720 --> 00:03:36.800 
so here it is I really really really
like<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.260> it's<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:07.650> cool<00:01:09.560> so<00:01:12.200> putting<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.350> on

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.400 

so<00:03:38.370> that's<00:03:39.370> basically<00:03:40.120> how<00:03:40.510> you<00:03:40.540> put<00:03:41.290> on

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
so that's basically how you put on

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.340 
so that's basically how you put on
yukata<00:03:41.830> so<00:03:42.610> this<00:03:43.000> is<00:03:43.150> really<00:03:43.480> like<00:03:43.630> my<00:03:43.989> third

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
yukata so this is really like my third

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.340 
yukata so this is really like my third
time<00:03:44.799> do<00:03:45.100> you<00:03:45.250> um<00:03:45.580> and<00:03:46.209> then<00:03:46.959> you<00:03:47.019> cut<00:03:47.230> though

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
time do you um and then you cut though

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.670 
time do you um and then you cut though
that<00:03:47.500> I<00:03:47.530> had<00:03:47.830> this<00:03:48.720> like<00:03:49.720> an<00:03:49.870> easier<00:03:50.260> sort<00:03:50.590> of

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
that I had this like an easier sort of

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.850 
that I had this like an easier sort of
style<00:03:50.950> then<00:03:51.549> like<00:03:51.910> a<00:03:51.959> more<00:03:52.959> traditional<00:03:53.500> one<00:03:53.650> I

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
style then like a more traditional one I

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.070 
style then like a more traditional one I
mean<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.549> actual<00:03:54.910> putting<00:03:55.239> on<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.900> does

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
exactly the same with any yukata but the

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.410 
exactly the same with any yukata but the
OB<00:04:01.810> that<00:04:01.989> I<00:04:02.049> have<00:04:02.380> it's<00:04:02.620> not<00:04:02.799> like<00:04:03.220> like<00:04:03.970> of<00:04:04.180> you

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
strings that you tie the Front's and

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.880 
strings that you tie the Front's and
then<00:04:09.820> hide<00:04:10.060> underneath<00:04:10.420> like<00:04:10.810> real<00:04:11.019> ones<00:04:11.230> you

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
then hide underneath like real ones you

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.110 
then hide underneath like real ones you
tie<00:04:12.130> yourself<00:04:12.250> they're<00:04:12.790> much<00:04:12.940> more

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
tie yourself they're much more

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.370 
tie yourself they're much more
complicated<00:04:14.160> but<00:04:15.160> this<00:04:15.579> this<00:04:16.479> type<00:04:16.810> of<00:04:16.840> OB<00:04:17.169> was

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
complicated but this this type of OB was

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.650 
complicated but this this type of OB was
mostly<00:04:18.100> what<00:04:18.340> I<00:04:18.370> found<00:04:18.579> in<00:04:18.789> the<00:04:18.880> store<00:04:19.180> and<00:04:19.450> I

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
mostly what I found in the store and I

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.330 
mostly what I found in the store and I
was<00:04:19.750> like<00:04:19.930> cool<00:04:20.169> why<00:04:20.440> would<00:04:20.680> I<00:04:20.799> want<00:04:21.070> the

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
was like cool why would I want the

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.670 
was like cool why would I want the
really<00:04:21.579> difficult<00:04:21.760> one<00:04:22.289> and<00:04:23.289> the<00:04:23.440> really

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
really difficult one and the really

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.960 
really difficult one and the really
difficult<00:04:23.860> one<00:04:24.280> well<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.300> more<00:04:25.479> difficult

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
difficult one well the more difficult

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.270 
difficult one well the more difficult
you<00:04:27.970> would<00:04:28.120> be<00:04:28.240> basically<00:04:28.570> making<00:04:29.289> this<00:04:29.650> bow

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
you would be basically making this bow

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.300 
you would be basically making this bow
we're<00:04:30.490> very<00:04:30.729> similar<00:04:31.210> though<00:04:32.039> so<00:04:33.039> because

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
we're very similar though so because

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.330 
we're very similar though so because
mine's<00:04:33.520> work<00:04:33.840> much<00:04:34.840> more<00:04:34.990> simple<00:04:35.410> mine<00:04:36.100> you

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
mine's work much more simple mine you

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.260 
mine's work much more simple mine you
sort<00:04:36.700> of<00:04:36.789> slip<00:04:37.260> underneath<00:04:38.260> the<00:04:38.530> OB<00:04:40.380> um<00:04:41.380> so

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
sort of slip underneath the OB um so

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.390 
sort of slip underneath the OB um so
yeah<00:04:43.270> I<00:04:43.570> hope<00:04:43.930> you<00:04:44.110> like<00:04:44.350> I<00:04:44.590> really<00:04:45.039> really

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
yeah I hope you like I really really

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.680 
yeah I hope you like I really really
like<00:04:45.580> this<00:04:45.789> you<00:04:45.940> cut<00:04:46.150> that<00:04:46.300> I<00:04:46.360> think<00:04:46.570> it's

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
like this you cut that I think it's

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.200 
like this you cut that I think it's
