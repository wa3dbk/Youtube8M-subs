to<00:03:54.620> my<00:03:54.829> playing<00:03:55.069> and<00:03:55.750> what<00:03:56.750> this<00:03:56.900> does<00:03:57.140> for<00:03:57.170> me

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
to my playing and what this does for me

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.440 
to my playing and what this does for me
is<00:03:58.129> making<00:03:58.430> what<00:03:58.640> I<00:03:58.670> continue<00:03:58.849> to<00:03:59.030> play<00:03:59.180> more

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
is making what I continue to play more

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.099 
is making what I continue to play more
and<00:03:59.720> it<00:03:59.900> also<00:04:00.069> whatever<00:04:01.069> setting<00:04:01.430> you<00:04:01.489> use

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
and it also whatever setting you use

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:04.539 
and it also whatever setting you use
takes<00:04:03.109> my<00:04:03.260> playing<00:04:03.500> in<00:04:03.680> that<00:04:03.739> direction<00:04:03.950> so<00:04:04.400> if

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
takes my playing in that direction so if

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.550
