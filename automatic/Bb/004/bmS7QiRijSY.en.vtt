00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.040
 50 meters here we go through 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.140

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.489
 stuntmen their bac 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.370

 is going to the height of how much 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.880
 6.7 m it'll be pretty good 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.070
 and then if you feel comfortable and 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.590
 if I see you're doing well we're going 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.320

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.730
 we appoint manager from the portal he 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.590
 must you press so far this 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.570
 activity was developed by jérôme and 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.130
 by thomert fight the mayor if that's the 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.410
 comedian that you all know and who 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.800
 So you expect the rise to 7 m 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.800
 let's go 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.030

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.860
 three and a half meters of water so to seven 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.430
 meters finally you jump that of 3 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.320
 meters 50 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.730
 finally he was still this 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.680
 same heading 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.140

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.150
 in the fridge because jérôme jérôme and 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.770
 stuntman and one day he tells me come I 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.300
 will make you discover the jumps in 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.620
 the airbags the airbags we use that 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.340
 in the cinema since it's for 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.440
 cushion the falls 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.240
 I loved that I found that the 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.680
 feeling was amazing ok so for 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.030
 you it's a way to help each other too 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.040
 to develop new figures for 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.140
 me it's a way it's a way 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:50.140
 who makes my race simple pleasures 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.540
 so do you remember what to do 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.310
 so like on the thing but like that 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.570
 like that and as I bring back my leg and 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.570
 I count on a sofa 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.540
 starwood think you think 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.740
 really at the beginning when you 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.720
 lances that you pass your legs forward 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.310
 what you did is quite 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.310
 a step forward and you let yourself go 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.550
 fall straight as happens this is 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.550
 because we 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.030
 wes 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.780
 it was better but it was not yet 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:43.340
 quite that she still landed on 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:50.170
 this good it's good that's very very 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:50.170
 vivid 3 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.490
 cavalli 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.490
 sega 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.680
 thank you then your impressions 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.420
 my impressions well listen the lady g 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.770
 I am I'm dizzy on a 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.000
 swing at the origin so I'm 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.910
 somebody c for that i spend i was talking 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.740
 of this fear I really physically 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.110
 I feel the speed very very strong 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.790
 what's that then that's what I know 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.810
 in extra terrestrial I understand you 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.640
 so much you imagine that when I 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.470
 did this plh the final penny it was at 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.280
 10 meters precisely where you are 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.420
 returned so I sympathize so much and 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.980
 then when we look because I at 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.420
 early I was down I watched jumping 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.670
 everyone I do not know but no matter 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.380
 what they do fuss but once 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.180
 that we are at the top but everything is 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.550
 launch that it would serve this 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.990
 invention of tomer sisley I think that 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.410
 to jump their eiffel tower is low 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.700
 vallon here is airbag system it's 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.020
 what has been coming for years what 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.970
 is what is good is that thomert the 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.010
 but in a way where young people 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.540
 can train somehow to 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.540
 to become a stuntman that's cool
