them to fit I just hit a button I like
it<00:01:47.790> I'm<00:01:48.030> keeping<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.750> way<00:01:48.899> that's<00:01:49.560> how

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
it I'm keeping it that way that's how

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.840 
it I'm keeping it that way that's how
I'm<00:01:49.799> going<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.950> gain<00:01:50.130> for<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.430> rest<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.729> the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
I'm going to gain for the rest of the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.569 
I'm going to gain for the rest of the
time<00:01:51.380> with<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.500> train<00:01:52.710> takes<00:01:52.890> pros<00:01:53.250> however

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
time with the train takes pros however

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.760 
time with the train takes pros however
you<00:01:54.060> do<00:01:54.240> have<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.450> opportunity<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.140> switch<00:01:55.560> up

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
you do have the opportunity to switch up

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.569 
you do have the opportunity to switch up
to<00:01:56.520> let's<00:01:57.090> see<00:01:57.240> here<00:01:57.740> you<00:01:58.740> have<00:01:58.770> four<00:01:59.219> speakers

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
to let's see here you have four speakers

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.300 
to let's see here you have four speakers
in<00:02:00.000> each<00:02:00.329> ear<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.960> it's<00:02:01.439> Dolby<00:02:01.740> Digital<00:02:01.770> so

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
in each ear and it's Dolby Digital so

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.649 
in each ear and it's Dolby Digital so
you<00:02:02.430> get<00:02:02.549> surround<00:02:02.820> sound<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.240> hear<00:02:03.450> people

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
you get surround sound you hear people

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.840 
you get surround sound you hear people
from<00:02:03.930> corners<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.469> diagonal<00:02:05.219> up<00:02:05.460> down<00:02:05.820> left

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
from corners a diagonal up down left

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.119 
from corners a diagonal up down left
right<00:02:06.210> anyway<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.020> can<00:02:07.350> possibly<00:02:07.590> think<00:02:07.860> of

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
right anyway you can possibly think of

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.070 
right anyway you can possibly think of
that<00:02:08.640> they<00:02:09.000> have<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.149> speaker<00:02:09.509> built<00:02:09.690> inside

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
that they have a speaker built inside

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
your headset de esas and there's six

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.470 
your headset de esas and there's six
different<00:02:49.770> ways<00:02:49.920> different<00:02:50.580> angles<00:02:51.090> for<00:02:51.360> each

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
different ways different angles for each

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.770 
different ways different angles for each
behind<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.709> in<00:02:52.800> front<00:02:52.860> as<00:02:53.430> for<00:02:54.060> me<00:02:54.180> I<00:02:54.209> use<00:02:54.480> more

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
behind and in front as for me I use more

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.930 
behind and in front as for me I use more
of<00:02:54.810> my<00:02:54.989> peripheral<00:02:55.500> in<00:02:55.830> front<00:02:56.340> I<00:02:56.520> like<00:02:56.820> the

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
of my peripheral in front I like the

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.190 
of my peripheral in front I like the
angles<00:02:57.270> because<00:02:57.360> I<00:02:57.480> can<00:02:57.630> see<00:02:57.780> what's<00:02:57.959> in<00:02:58.080> front

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
angles because I can see what's in front

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.410 
angles because I can see what's in front
of<00:02:58.320> me<00:02:58.440> hotel<00:02:59.250> if<00:02:59.459> I'm<00:02:59.610> in<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.820> back<00:02:59.970> I<00:03:00.180> want<00:03:00.360> a

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
of me hotel if I'm in the back I want a

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.120 
of me hotel if I'm in the back I want a
little<00:03:00.750> bit<00:03:00.900> wider<00:03:01.140> but<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.530> little<00:03:01.860> bit<00:03:01.950> longer

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
little bit wider but a little bit longer

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.920 
little bit wider but a little bit longer
so<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:02.760> usually<00:03:03.090> go<00:03:03.209> like<00:03:03.420> right<00:03:03.630> in<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.780> middle

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
so I usually go like right in the middle

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.810 
so I usually go like right in the middle
and<00:03:04.200> that<00:03:04.770> allows<00:03:04.980> me<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.190> here<00:03:05.459> behind<00:03:05.580> me

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
and that allows me to here behind me

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.510 
and that allows me to here behind me
perfectly<00:03:06.209> fine<00:03:06.480> and<00:03:06.950> two<00:03:07.950> sides<00:03:08.250> of<00:03:08.430> me

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
perfectly fine and two sides of me

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.040 
perfectly fine and two sides of me
perfectly<00:03:08.880> fine<00:03:09.060> so<00:03:09.300> i<00:03:09.360> can<00:03:09.510> see<00:03:09.690> people<00:03:09.989> in

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
perfectly fine so i can see people in

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.720 
perfectly fine so i can see people in
front<00:03:10.260> of<00:03:10.350> me<00:03:10.470> as<00:03:10.620> you<00:03:11.070> can<00:03:11.160> see<00:03:11.370> there<00:03:11.550> i<00:03:11.580> just

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
front of me as you can see there i just

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.550 
front of me as you can see there i just
shot<00:03:12.000> that<00:03:12.209> guy<00:03:13.880> but<00:03:14.880> uh<00:03:14.910> yeah<00:03:15.750> then<00:03:16.110> also<00:03:16.410> a

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
shot that guy but uh yeah then also a

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.170 
shot that guy but uh yeah then also a
plus<00:03:16.770> side<00:03:16.980> is<00:03:17.100> it's<00:03:17.280> not<00:03:17.400> that<00:03:17.610> bulky<00:03:17.910> it's<00:03:18.090> a

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
plus side is it's not that bulky it's a

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.600 
plus side is it's not that bulky it's a
lot<00:03:18.360> lighter<00:03:18.989> than<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.440> ax<00:03:19.830> pro<00:03:20.130> and<00:03:21.060> um

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
lot lighter than the ax pro and um

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.550 
lot lighter than the ax pro and um
overall<00:03:23.610> it's<00:03:24.090> not<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:24.870> doesn't<00:03:24.900> take<00:03:25.290> up<00:03:25.320> as

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
overall it's not it doesn't take up as

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.650 
overall it's not it doesn't take up as
much<00:03:25.590> space<00:03:25.769> now<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.700> downside<00:03:26.880> of<00:03:27.180> that<00:03:27.269> if<00:03:27.540> i

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
much space now the downside of that if i

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.560 
much space now the downside of that if i

for<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.290> users<00:05:07.590> such<00:05:07.830> as<00:05:07.860> us<00:05:08.130> and<00:05:08.430> uh<00:05:08.810> you<00:05:09.810> know

for the users such as us and uh you know
without<00:05:11.910> them<00:05:12.300> I'm<00:05:12.690> pretty<00:05:13.140> sure<00:05:13.290> that<00:05:13.470> when

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
without them I'm pretty sure that when

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.950 
without them I'm pretty sure that when
be<00:05:13.800> MLG<00:05:14.220> is<00:05:14.550> stuff<00:05:14.820> like<00:05:15.000> that<00:05:15.030> well<00:05:15.840> there

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
be MLG is stuff like that well there

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.030 
be MLG is stuff like that well there
