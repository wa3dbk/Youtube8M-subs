get all sorts of different ways of
learning<00:00:56.329> information<00:00:56.859> but<00:00:57.859> definitely<00:00:58.749> know

00:00:59.739 --> 00:00:59.749 
learning information but definitely know

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:02.680 
learning information but definitely know
for<00:00:59.989> now<00:01:00.170> let's<00:01:00.559> look<00:01:00.799> at<00:01:00.920> this<00:01:01.069> problem<00:01:01.690> if

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
for now let's look at this problem if

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.450 
for now let's look at this problem if
you've<00:01:03.019> been<00:01:03.139> watching<00:01:03.559> these<00:01:03.679> videos<00:01:04.129> I<00:01:04.280> want

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
you've been watching these videos I want

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.980 
you've been watching these videos I want
you<00:01:04.610> to<00:01:04.699> apply<00:01:04.970> as<00:01:05.030> many<00:01:05.330> different<00:01:05.720> stripes

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
you to apply as many different stripes

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.219 
you to apply as many different stripes
as<00:01:06.530> you<00:01:06.740> can<00:01:06.979> but<00:01:07.820> let's<00:01:08.060> start<00:01:08.479> I<00:01:08.720> always<00:01:09.020> want

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
as you can but let's start I always want

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.210 
as you can but let's start I always want
to<00:01:09.290> start<00:01:09.619> and<00:01:11.290> by<00:01:12.290> looking<00:01:12.740> at<00:01:12.890> the<00:01:13.040> big

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
to start and by looking at the big

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.130 
to start and by looking at the big
picture<00:01:13.250> what<00:01:14.000> do<00:01:14.120> I<00:01:14.180> see<00:01:14.540> in<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:14.720> big<00:01:14.900> picture

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
picture what do I see in the big picture

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.950 
picture what do I see in the big picture
now<00:01:16.040> even<00:01:16.670> before<00:01:16.820> I<00:01:17.000> get<00:01:17.240> to<00:01:17.360> this<00:01:17.450> problem

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
now even before I get to this problem

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.690 
now even before I get to this problem
I'm<00:01:18.110> thinking<00:01:18.800> it's<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.100> end<00:01:19.250> of<00:01:19.370> the<00:01:19.460> test

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
I'm thinking it's the end of the test

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.730 
I'm thinking it's the end of the test
this<00:01:20.420> is<00:01:20.630> where<00:01:20.810> they're<00:01:20.990> gonna<00:01:21.050> ask<00:01:21.470> me

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
this is where they're gonna ask me

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.630 
this is where they're gonna ask me
probability<00:01:22.550> and<00:01:22.760> data<00:01:23.360> analysis<00:01:24.020> questions

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
probability and data analysis questions

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.340 
probability and data analysis questions
so<00:01:25.640> I<00:01:25.670> shouldn't<00:01:26.060> be<00:01:26.210> surprised<00:01:26.690> if<00:01:26.960> I<00:01:27.110> see

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
so I shouldn't be surprised if I see

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.640 
so I shouldn't be surprised if I see
something<00:01:27.650> like<00:01:28.070> a<00:01:28.910> pie<00:01:29.450> chart<00:01:29.780> here<00:01:29.840> which

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
something like a pie chart here which

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.300 
something like a pie chart here which
presents<00:01:30.950> information<00:01:32.380> either<00:01:33.380> in<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:33.800> table

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
presents information either in the table

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.900 
presents information either in the table
a<00:01:34.460> chart<00:01:34.820> of<00:01:35.090> graph<00:01:35.950> it<00:01:36.950> presents<00:01:37.400> an<00:01:37.730> ad

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
a chart of graph it presents an ad

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.390 
a chart of graph it presents an ad
specific<00:01:38.810> information<00:01:39.050> in<00:01:39.530> a<00:01:39.620> certain<00:01:39.980> way<00:01:40.130> so

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
specific information in a certain way so

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.950 
specific information in a certain way so
this<00:01:40.940> is<00:01:41.150> that<00:01:41.300> sort<00:01:41.630> of<00:01:41.780> data<00:01:42.020> analysis<00:01:42.860> and

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
this is that sort of data analysis and

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.750 
this is that sort of data analysis and
you<00:01:44.960> know<00:01:45.110> portion<00:01:45.620> of<00:01:45.770> that<00:01:45.920> test<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.640> I'm

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
you know portion of that test and I'm

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.460 
you know portion of that test and I'm
studying<00:01:47.030> that<00:01:47.360> skill<00:01:47.720> and<00:01:47.750> I<00:01:47.960> already<00:01:48.320> know

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
studying that skill and I already know

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.380 
studying that skill and I already know
I'm<00:01:48.590> gonna<00:01:48.680> see<00:01:49.040> that<00:01:49.250> on<00:01:49.640> these<00:01:50.000> problems

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
I'm gonna see that on these problems

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.240 
I'm gonna see that on these problems
towards<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.110> end<00:01:51.260> of<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:51.440> tests<00:01:51.800> up<00:01:51.950> I

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
towards the end of the tests up I

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.149 
towards the end of the tests up I
already<00:01:52.730> prepared<00:01:53.420> prepared<00:01:53.960> for<00:01:54.740> a<00:01:54.770> scene

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
already prepared prepared for a scene

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.399 
already prepared prepared for a scene
that's<00:01:55.430> on<00:01:55.640> my<00:01:55.909> my<00:01:56.270> brains<00:01:56.600> already<00:01:56.870> warmed<00:01:57.290> up

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
that's on my my brains already warmed up

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.070 
that's on my my brains already warmed up
for<00:01:57.650> it<00:01:57.770> at<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:58.760> same<00:01:58.790> time<00:01:59.210> this<00:01:59.630> is<00:01:59.840> also

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
for it at the same time this is also

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.410 
for it at the same time this is also
where<00:02:00.380> probability<00:02:01.100> comes<00:02:01.340> in<00:02:01.520> so<00:02:02.030> I'm<00:02:02.240> not

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
where probability comes in so I'm not

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.320 
where probability comes in so I'm not
going<00:02:02.570> to<00:02:02.659> be<00:02:02.720> surprised<00:02:03.170> if<00:02:03.440> I<00:02:03.530> read<00:02:03.770> this<00:02:03.979> if

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
going to be surprised if I read this if

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.280 
going to be surprised if I read this if
part<00:02:05.330> of<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.450> question<00:02:05.780> has<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.140> word

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
part of the question has the word

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.040 
part of the question has the word
probability<00:02:07.010> so<00:02:07.940> let's<00:02:08.209> say<00:02:08.360> let's<00:02:08.690> read<00:02:08.899> this

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
probability so let's say let's read this

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.649 
probability so let's say let's read this

gonna go home very lucky with a fruit
basket<00:03:03.770> and<00:03:04.630> let's<00:03:05.630> figure<00:03:05.810> out<00:03:05.930> how<00:03:06.140> when<00:03:06.350> you

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
basket and let's figure out how when you

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.850 
basket and let's figure out how when you
do<00:03:06.590> this<00:03:06.790> first<00:03:07.790> of<00:03:07.970> all<00:03:08.200> what<00:03:09.200> is<00:03:09.320> how<00:03:09.680> many

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
do this first of all what is how many

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.200 
do this first of all what is how many
people<00:03:10.190> what's<00:03:10.490> up<00:03:10.640> when<00:03:10.820> we<00:03:10.910> think<00:03:11.060> about

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
people what's up when we think about

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.150 
people what's up when we think about
probability<00:03:11.900> even<00:03:12.530> though<00:03:12.590> it<00:03:12.680> doesn't<00:03:12.860> say

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
probability even though it doesn't say

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.950 
probability even though it doesn't say
here<00:03:13.520> this<00:03:13.670> is<00:03:13.730> very<00:03:14.090> much<00:03:14.270> a<00:03:14.300> probability

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
here this is very much a probability

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.140 
here this is very much a probability
question<00:03:16.780> what<00:03:17.780> is<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:17.990> probability<00:03:18.470> that

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
question what is the probability that

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.240 
question what is the probability that
someone's<00:03:20.150> gonna<00:03:20.300> spin<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:21.110> spinner<00:03:21.320> you

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
someone's gonna spin the spinner you

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.040 
someone's gonna spin the spinner you
might<00:03:22.430> say<00:03:22.640> that's<00:03:22.850> all<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.480> people<00:03:23.870> cuz

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
might say that's all the people cuz

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.990 
might say that's all the people cuz
everyone<00:03:24.440> coming<00:03:24.740> in<00:03:24.860> is<00:03:24.980> going<00:03:25.160> to<00:03:25.220> do<00:03:25.340> it<00:03:25.490> so

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
everyone coming in is going to do it so

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.400 
everyone coming in is going to do it so
there's<00:03:26.180> a<00:03:26.240> hundred<00:03:26.630> and<00:03:26.720> eighty<00:03:26.840> people<00:03:27.080> that

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
there's a hundred and eighty people that

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.550 
there's a hundred and eighty people that
are<00:03:27.470> going<00:03:27.590> to<00:03:27.650> be<00:03:27.770> spinning<00:03:28.010> this<00:03:28.280> spinner

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
are going to be spinning this spinner

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.380 
are going to be spinning this spinner
now<00:03:30.560> what<00:03:30.860> portion<00:03:31.340> of<00:03:31.490> them<00:03:31.760> are<00:03:32.000> actually

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
now what portion of them are actually

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.820 
now what portion of them are actually
going<00:03:32.480> to<00:03:32.660> get<00:03:32.810> that<00:03:33.020> fruit<00:03:33.290> basket<00:03:34.480> well<00:03:35.830> out

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
going to get that fruit basket well out

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.110 
going to get that fruit basket well out
of<00:03:37.280> this<00:03:38.230> spinner<00:03:39.230> here<00:03:39.560> if<00:03:39.650> its<00:03:39.830> spins<00:03:40.550> fairly

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
of this spinner here if its spins fairly

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.690 
of this spinner here if its spins fairly
evenly

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
evenly

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.300 
evenly
it<00:03:43.700> looks<00:03:43.940> like<00:03:44.240> one-fifth<00:03:45.050> of<00:03:45.290> everyone<00:03:46.160> that

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
it looks like one-fifth of everyone that

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.390 
it looks like one-fifth of everyone that
comes<00:03:46.520> in<00:03:47.050> its<00:03:48.050> going<00:03:48.260> to<00:03:48.350> land<00:03:48.650> on<00:03:48.800> that<00:03:48.860> fruit

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
comes in its going to land on that fruit

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.490 
comes in its going to land on that fruit
basket<00:03:49.550> based<00:03:50.030> on<00:03:50.270> the<00:03:50.540> proportions<00:03:51.230> of<00:03:51.350> the

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
basket based on the proportions of the

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.400 
basket based on the proportions of the
spinner<00:03:52.510> so<00:03:53.620> it's<00:03:54.620> gonna<00:03:54.830> be<00:03:55.040> one-fifth<00:03:55.760> of

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
spinner so it's gonna be one-fifth of

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.570 
spinner so it's gonna be one-fifth of
180<00:03:58.540> okay<00:03:59.710> well<00:04:00.710> how<00:04:00.860> do<00:04:00.920> I<00:04:01.010> find<00:04:01.250> out<00:04:01.400> one

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
180 okay well how do I find out one

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.370 
180 okay well how do I find out one
fifth<00:04:01.850> of<00:04:01.970> on<00:04:02.120> turn<00:04:02.330> 80<00:04:02.480> I<00:04:02.690> just<00:04:02.990> made<00:04:03.170> two

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
fifth of on turn 80 I just made two

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.640 
fifth of on turn 80 I just made two
equivalent<00:04:03.890> fractions<00:04:05.140> that's<00:04:06.140> one<00:04:06.470> way<00:04:06.620> of

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
equivalent fractions that's one way of

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:07.360 
equivalent fractions that's one way of
doing<00:04:06.920> it

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
doing it

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.150 
doing it
I<00:04:07.400> could<00:04:08.360> have<00:04:08.450> said<00:04:08.690> one-fifth<00:04:09.320> is<00:04:09.560> equal<00:04:10.040> to

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
I could have said one-fifth is equal to

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.280 
I could have said one-fifth is equal to
20%<00:04:10.520> and<00:04:11.120> then<00:04:12.050> like<00:04:12.350> what's<00:04:12.620> 20%<00:04:13.460> of<00:04:14.020> 180<00:04:15.020> and

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
20% and then like what's 20% of 180 and

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.410 
20% and then like what's 20% of 180 and
then<00:04:16.250> I<00:04:16.340> would<00:04:16.489> have<00:04:16.609> had<00:04:16.760> to<00:04:16.940> do<00:04:17.180> some

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 
then I would have had to do some

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.560 
then I would have had to do some
multiplication<00:04:17.540> I<00:04:18.370> could<00:04:19.370> be<00:04:19.489> like<00:04:19.670> hey<00:04:19.940> if

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
multiplication I could be like hey if

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.320 
multiplication I could be like hey if
I'm<00:04:20.780> trying<00:04:20.960> to<00:04:21.080> find<00:04:21.230> out<00:04:21.320> 20%<00:04:21.980> of<00:04:22.040> 180<00:04:22.610> well<00:04:23.300> I

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
I'm trying to find out 20% of 180 well I

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.130 
I'm trying to find out 20% of 180 well I
know<00:04:23.780> that<00:04:23.930> 10%<00:04:24.920> 10%<00:04:25.580> of<00:04:26.030> 180<00:04:26.510> is<00:04:26.720> like<00:04:26.900> just

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
know that 10% 10% of 180 is like just

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.890 
know that 10% 10% of 180 is like just
moving<00:04:27.260> a<00:04:27.530> decimal<00:04:27.920> over<00:04:28.040> so<00:04:28.850> 10%<00:04:29.090> is<00:04:29.510> equal<00:04:29.810> to

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
moving a decimal over so 10% is equal to

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.780 
moving a decimal over so 10% is equal to
18<00:04:30.669> so<00:04:31.669> 20%<00:04:32.090> would

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
18 so 20% would

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.970 
18 so 20% would
double<00:04:33.210> that<00:04:33.360> right<00:04:34.370> so<00:04:35.370> double<00:04:36.120> 18<00:04:36.770> would<00:04:37.770> get

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
double that right so double 18 would get

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.460 
double that right so double 18 would get
me<00:04:38.130> the<00:04:38.280> answer<00:04:38.640> or<00:04:39.420> I<00:04:39.450> could<00:04:40.230> have<00:04:40.350> been<00:04:40.410> like

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
me the answer or I could have been like

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.390 
me the answer or I could have been like
I'm<00:04:41.070> trying<00:04:41.610> to<00:04:41.670> find<00:04:41.820> out<00:04:42.000> 20%<00:04:42.470> of<00:04:43.470> 180<00:04:44.100> so<00:04:44.340> I'm

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
I'm trying to find out 20% of 180 so I'm

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.510 
I'm trying to find out 20% of 180 so I'm
going<00:04:44.550> to<00:04:44.580> multiply<00:04:44.700> that<00:04:45.150> by<00:04:45.210> a<00:04:45.690> decimal<00:04:46.520> 20%

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
going to multiply that by a decimal 20%

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.570 
going to multiply that by a decimal 20%
is<00:04:47.640> equal<00:04:47.970> to<00:04:48.060> 0.2<00:04:48.660> and<00:04:49.130> I<00:04:50.130> would<00:04:50.310> get<00:04:50.460> an

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
is equal to 0.2 and I would get an

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.270 
is equal to 0.2 and I would get an
answer<00:04:50.970> or<00:04:51.900> I<00:04:52.500> could<00:04:52.710> do<00:04:52.800> it<00:04:52.890> the<00:04:52.980> way<00:04:53.100> that<00:04:53.250> I

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
answer or I could do it the way that I

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.850 
answer or I could do it the way that I
set<00:04:53.550> it<00:04:53.700> up<00:04:53.790> here<00:04:54.120> which<00:04:54.390> is<00:04:54.530> something<00:04:55.530> over

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
set it up here which is something over

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.600 
set it up here which is something over
180<00:04:56.430> it's<00:04:57.030> going<00:04:57.240> to<00:04:57.300> be<00:04:57.390> equal<00:04:57.480> to<00:04:57.720> 1/5<00:04:58.460> 1/5<00:04:59.460> of

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
180 it's going to be equal to 1/5 1/5 of

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.860 
180 it's going to be equal to 1/5 1/5 of
my<00:04:59.790> whole<00:05:00.030> now<00:05:01.020> how<00:05:01.770> do<00:05:01.830> I<00:05:01.980> do<00:05:02.040> it<00:05:02.160> this<00:05:02.370> way

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
my whole now how do I do it this way

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:08.180 
my whole now how do I do it this way
well<00:05:03.870> how<00:05:04.620> do<00:05:04.680> I<00:05:04.800> get<00:05:04.890> from<00:05:05.040> 5<00:05:05.810> 285<00:05:06.810> times<00:05:07.290> and

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
well how do I get from 5 285 times and

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.750 
well how do I get from 5 285 times and
this<00:05:08.310> is<00:05:08.490> where<00:05:08.670> you<00:05:08.790> might<00:05:08.940> want<00:05:09.150> to<00:05:09.240> do<00:05:09.740> 180

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
this is where you might want to do 180

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.350 
this is where you might want to do 180
right<00:05:11.760> divided<00:05:12.720> by<00:05:12.810> 5<00:05:13.110> goes<00:05:14.100> in<00:05:14.310> 1<00:05:14.490> 3<00:05:14.730> times

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
right divided by 5 goes in 1 3 times

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.230 
right divided by 5 goes in 1 3 times
carry<00:05:16.260> the<00:05:16.500> 15<00:05:17.030> bring<00:05:18.030> down<00:05:18.180> the<00:05:18.390> 3<00:05:18.750> makes<00:05:19.530> a<00:05:20.240> 36

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
carry the 15 bring down the 3 makes a 36

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.940 
carry the 15 bring down the 3 makes a 36
times<00:05:21.540> so<00:05:22.380> I<00:05:22.410> got<00:05:22.710> a<00:05:22.740> tote<00:05:23.360> 5,280<00:05:24.360> 36<00:05:24.960> times<00:05:25.230> so

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
times so I got a tote 5,280 36 times so

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.900 
times so I got a tote 5,280 36 times so
5<00:05:26.220> times<00:05:26.520> 36<00:05:27.270> equals<00:05:27.450> 180<00:05:28.110> so<00:05:28.920> 1<00:05:29.160> times<00:05:29.490> 36

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
5 times 36 equals 180 so 1 times 36

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.650 
5 times 36 equals 180 so 1 times 36
equals<00:05:30.840> 180<00:05:31.680> or<00:05:32.550> I<00:05:32.580> could<00:05:33.090> go<00:05:33.210> back<00:05:33.330> to<00:05:33.540> my

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
equals 180 or I could go back to my

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.900 
equals 180 or I could go back to my
other<00:05:33.810> two<00:05:34.110> ways<00:05:34.290> you<00:05:35.190> know<00:05:35.340> 10%<00:05:36.090> of<00:05:36.180> 20<00:05:36.600> is<00:05:36.720> 18

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:37.910 
other two ways you know 10% of 20 is 18

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.830 
other two ways you know 10% of 20 is 18
so<00:05:38.910> that<00:05:39.210> means<00:05:39.450> 20%<00:05:40.230> is<00:05:40.380> twice<00:05:40.920> 10%<00:05:41.760> and<00:05:42.660> that

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
so that means 20% is twice 10% and that

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.130 
so that means 20% is twice 10% and that
gets<00:05:43.080> me<00:05:43.230> to<00:05:43.260> my<00:05:43.410> 36<00:05:44.390> or<00:05:45.390> I<00:05:45.450> could<00:05:45.930> have<00:05:46.020> done

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
gets me to my 36 or I could have done

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.300 
gets me to my 36 or I could have done
this<00:05:46.290> multiplication<00:05:46.860> out<00:05:47.190> here<00:05:48.140> multiplying

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
this multiplication out here multiplying

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.510 
this multiplication out here multiplying
118<00:05:50.310> 180<00:05:51.030> by<00:05:51.320> 0.2<00:05:52.320> because<00:05:53.100> that's<00:05:53.340> the

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
118 180 by 0.2 because that's the

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.780 
118 180 by 0.2 because that's the
represent<00:05:54.110> representation<00:05:55.110> of<00:05:55.230> 20<00:05:55.470> percent

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:55.790 
represent representation of 20 percent

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
represent representation of 20 percent
well<00:05:56.790> 2<00:05:57.330> times<00:05:57.600> 0<00:05:57.960> 0<00:05:58.440> 2<00:05:58.980> times<00:05:59.310> 18<00:05:59.550> is<00:05:59.820> 6<00:06:00.060> carry

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
well 2 times 0 0 2 times 18 is 6 carry

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.780 
well 2 times 0 0 2 times 18 is 6 carry
the<00:06:00.930> 1<00:06:01.170> 2<00:06:02.040> times<00:06:02.280> 1<00:06:02.400> is<00:06:02.550> 2<00:06:02.670> plus<00:06:02.910> the<00:06:03.510> 1<00:06:03.660> is<00:06:03.840> a<00:06:03.870> 3

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:04.790 
the 1 2 times 1 is 2 plus the 1 is a 3

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.450 
the 1 2 times 1 is 2 plus the 1 is a 3
now<00:06:05.930> 360<00:06:06.930> you<00:06:07.560> got<00:06:07.710> to<00:06:07.830> remember<00:06:08.040> I<00:06:08.220> got<00:06:08.430> a

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
now 360 you got to remember I got a

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.310 
now 360 you got to remember I got a
factor<00:06:09.060> in<00:06:09.150> that<00:06:09.270> decimal<00:06:09.810> which<00:06:09.960> means<00:06:10.200> I

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
factor in that decimal which means I

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.170 
factor in that decimal which means I
moved<00:06:10.530> it<00:06:10.710> answer<00:06:11.070> the<00:06:11.250> decimal<00:06:11.670> over<00:06:11.700> here

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
moved it answer the decimal over here

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.590 
moved it answer the decimal over here
one<00:06:12.390> space<00:06:12.690> and<00:06:13.230> I<00:06:13.320> get<00:06:13.500> 36<00:06:14.060> 3<00:06:15.060> different<00:06:15.420> ways

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 
one space and I get 36 3 different ways

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.390 
one space and I get 36 3 different ways
to<00:06:16.080> approach<00:06:16.260> this<00:06:16.590> problem<00:06:16.890> but<00:06:17.160> they<00:06:17.250> all
