00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.840
 yes hello to all room on the other hand 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.820
 no new tutorial play there I you 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.330
 explained that my concert with the 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.969
 champion 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.789
 so that's simple you take 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.900
 wooden planks 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:25.260
 so here you are a gateway a 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.699
 floor and you already have your little 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.039
 village so here now I'm going to you 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.390
 show how to build and simply 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.550
 we take money in europe in 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.829
 fir tree boards and 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:44.370
 birch so you see here cube you 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:48.000
 like here here there is the base 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.750
 of a pleasure that minecraft so on these 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.420
 3 of 3 1 and 3 so you leave a 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:01:05.809
 space for the door 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:05.809
 then you climb the walls here you go 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.020
 it makes you little wooden huts 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:16.640
 very nice and expensive in materials what 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.640
 whatever it is feasible and the beginning 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:26.729
 that's it so now we're going 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:33.110
 take care of the roof or add as if 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:34.320
 if any cubes all along your 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:40.710
 House 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.280
 here and that's perfect so now 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.110
 we will add 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.920
 so that makes you a little bit of a kid 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:51.439
 circle no to mannschaft sauce so we 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:58.799
 we add and over your wall 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:02:02.430
 then you're going to do it no 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:06.119
 here we remove cellular in order to 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:09.660
 what the interior is on the ceiling and 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.300
 not just rectangle so here is where 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.630
 continue to ride wildlife voting 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:21.990
 jesse until the moment in there we have 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:24.330
 a perfect square so these are small 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.090
 houses it's simple to do but who 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.410
 are rather jury here and so with 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.240
 now we will take a torch but 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:36.390
 that she has all this on each side of the 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.070
 because and here we go down again 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.360
 houses that are fairly simple and which 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.680
 requires few resources so this is 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.250
 simple as well as do it so here you go 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.480
 and there is no need to take a step 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.850
 need to make a door between enough 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.360
 just put a cut is 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.720
 precisely tuna or putting 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.700
 barriers 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.010
 so if you do if you do 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.900
 many give something 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.600
 nice but you do not have any more 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.740
 to put torches on each subject 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.570
 I have a hole on Sheikh Barrier 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.740
 so here I hope it is we support 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.740
 on 30 other hits for a next
