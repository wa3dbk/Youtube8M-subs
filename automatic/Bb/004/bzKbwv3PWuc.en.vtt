00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
map pack still but you can call it

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.909 
map pack still but you can call it
whatever<00:00:22.759> you<00:00:22.910> want<00:00:23.000> and<00:00:23.590> a<00:00:24.590> lot<00:00:24.650> of<00:00:24.830> people

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:24.919 
whatever you want and a lot of people

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:26.859 
whatever you want and a lot of people
are<00:00:25.160> saying<00:00:25.310> well<00:00:25.550> that's<00:00:25.730> clearly<00:00:26.180> German

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
are saying well that's clearly German

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:28.749 
are saying well that's clearly German
and<00:00:27.020> it's<00:00:27.140> gonna<00:00:27.290> be<00:00:27.380> Therese<00:00:27.860> well<00:00:28.189> I<00:00:28.430> think

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:28.759 
and it's gonna be Therese well I think

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:30.549 
and it's gonna be Therese well I think
if<00:00:29.059> it<00:00:29.180> was<00:00:29.300> German<00:00:29.809> and<00:00:29.869> if<00:00:30.020> it<00:00:30.140> was<00:00:30.290> going<00:00:30.470> to

00:00:30.549 --> 00:00:30.559 
if it was German and if it was going to

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:32.560 
if it was German and if it was going to
be<00:00:30.649> Teresa<00:00:31.009> it<00:00:31.220> would<00:00:31.399> be<00:00:31.579> gem<00:00:31.910> and<00:00:32.210> and<00:00:32.419> it

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
be Teresa it would be gem and and it

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.650 
be Teresa it would be gem and and it
would<00:00:32.750> be<00:00:32.780> correctly<00:00:33.470> spelled<00:00:34.540> you<00:00:35.540> know

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
would be correctly spelled you know

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.900 
would be correctly spelled you know
otherwise<00:00:36.020> I<00:00:36.170> think<00:00:36.350> maybe<00:00:36.829> it's<00:00:37.100> just<00:00:37.190> I<00:00:37.670> rise

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
otherwise I think maybe it's just I rise

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.069 
otherwise I think maybe it's just I rise
in<00:00:38.649> which<00:00:39.649> case<00:00:39.980> it's<00:00:40.370> quite<00:00:40.940> a<00:00:40.969> big<00:00:41.420> step<00:00:41.780> to

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
in which case it's quite a big step to

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:43.630 
in which case it's quite a big step to
say<00:00:42.289> that<00:00:42.500> it's<00:00:42.649> going<00:00:42.829> to<00:00:42.920> be<00:00:43.070> high-rise

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
say that it's going to be high-rise

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.579 
say that it's going to be high-rise
remade<00:00:44.269> because<00:00:44.719> you<00:00:44.870> have<00:00:44.989> to<00:00:45.140> remember<00:00:45.320> the

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:45.589 
remade because you have to remember the

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:47.560 
remade because you have to remember the
high<00:00:45.800> rise<00:00:46.010> wasn't<00:00:46.399> that<00:00:46.519> route<00:00:46.940> map<00:00:47.300> and

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
high rise wasn't that route map and

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.900 
high rise wasn't that route map and
there<00:00:47.719> is<00:00:47.839> still<00:00:48.140> this<00:00:48.579> Infinity<00:00:49.579> Ward<00:00:49.789> and

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
there is still this Infinity Ward and

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.540 
there is still this Infinity Ward and
Activision<00:00:50.559> thing<00:00:51.559> going<00:00:51.890> on<00:00:51.980> I<00:00:52.039> really<00:00:52.339> don't

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
Activision thing going on I really don't

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.360 
Activision thing going on I really don't
think<00:00:52.640> that<00:00:53.120> they<00:00:53.300> were<00:00:53.359> them<00:00:53.749> i<00:00:54.159> want<00:00:55.159> to<00:00:55.219> say

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
think that they were them i want to say

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.250 
think that they were them i want to say
stoop<00:00:55.789> to<00:00:55.820> the<00:00:56.269> level<00:00:56.420> of<00:00:56.719> using<00:00:57.140> and

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
stoop to the level of using and

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.200 
stoop to the level of using and
activision<00:00:57.800> map<00:00:58.460> although<00:00:58.699> I<00:00:58.850> loved

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
activision map although I loved

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.849 
activision map although I loved
high-rise<00:00:59.659> I<00:00:59.690> think<00:01:00.019> a<00:01:00.079> lot<00:01:00.199> of<00:01:00.230> people<00:01:00.319> did<00:01:00.679> I

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
high-rise I think a lot of people did I

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.000 
high-rise I think a lot of people did I
think<00:01:01.309> rock<00:01:01.609> would<00:01:01.789> do<00:01:01.909> that<00:01:02.089> and<00:01:02.530> so<00:01:03.530> if<00:01:03.649> it<00:01:03.800> is

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
think rock would do that and so if it is

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.010 
think rock would do that and so if it is
real<00:01:04.280> if<00:01:04.550> this<00:01:04.699> league<00:01:04.970> is<00:01:05.210> real<00:01:05.449> and<00:01:05.659> this<00:01:05.810> is

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
real if this league is real and this is

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.950 
real if this league is real and this is
a<00:01:06.230> legitimate<00:01:06.920> map<00:01:07.400> then<00:01:08.150> what<00:01:08.750> do<00:01:08.810> I<00:01:08.870> think

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
a legitimate map then what do I think

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.520 
a legitimate map then what do I think
it's<00:01:09.470> going<00:01:09.680> to<00:01:09.740> be<00:01:09.800> well<00:01:10.750> I'm<00:01:11.750> not<00:01:11.930> sure<00:01:11.990> to<00:01:12.500> be

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
it's going to be well I'm not sure to be

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.530 
it's going to be well I'm not sure to be
honest<00:01:12.860> but<00:01:13.280> I<00:01:13.340> think<00:01:13.520> one<00:01:13.700> thing<00:01:13.730> I<00:01:14.090> hope<00:01:14.360> it

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
honest but I think one thing I hope it

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.920 
honest but I think one thing I hope it
isn't<00:01:14.960> is<00:01:15.200> a<00:01:15.460> transit<00:01:16.460> mode<00:01:16.640> map<00:01:16.910> a<00:01:17.180> map<00:01:17.510> in

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
isn't is a transit mode map a map in

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.380 
isn't is a transit mode map a map in
which<00:01:18.110> there<00:01:18.560> is<00:01:18.710> some<00:01:19.460> forms<00:01:19.790> form<00:01:20.270> of

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
which there is some forms form of

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.930 
which there is some forms form of
transport<00:01:21.040> under<00:01:22.040> which<00:01:22.190> you<00:01:22.220> can<00:01:22.550> be<00:01:22.670> trapped

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
transport under which you can be trapped

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.980 
transport under which you can be trapped
inside<00:01:23.120> and<00:01:23.600> zombies<00:01:24.320> can<00:01:25.480> attack<00:01:26.480> you<00:01:26.750> from

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
inside and zombies can attack you from

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.520 
inside and zombies can attack you from
exterior<00:01:27.590> to<00:01:27.920> interior<00:01:28.130> I<00:01:29.320> see<00:01:30.320> I<00:01:30.350> think

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
exterior to interior I see I think

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.440 
exterior to interior I see I think
transit<00:01:31.190> served<00:01:31.430> its<00:01:31.610> purpose<00:01:31.640> now<00:01:32.150> let's

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
transit served its purpose now let's

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.230 
transit served its purpose now let's
just<00:01:32.660> get<00:01:32.780> on<00:01:32.930> with<00:01:33.220> more<00:01:34.220> inventive<00:01:34.520> ways<00:01:34.940> of

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
just get on with more inventive ways of

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.640 
just get on with more inventive ways of
slaying<00:01:35.510> zombies<00:01:35.630> and<00:01:36.110> I<00:01:36.140> think<00:01:36.380> that<00:01:36.500> was<00:01:36.620> the

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
slaying zombies and I think that was the

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.680 
slaying zombies and I think that was the
least<00:01:36.890> inventive<00:01:37.460> way<00:01:37.910> to<00:01:38.660> do<00:01:39.200> that<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:41.060> I

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
least inventive way to do that and I

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.540 
least inventive way to do that and I
mean<00:01:41.840> I<00:01:41.960> don't<00:01:42.140> even<00:01:42.260> use<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.800> bus<00:01:42.950> anymore<00:01:43.190> it

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
mean I don't even use the bus anymore it

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.370 
mean I don't even use the bus anymore it
just<00:01:43.580> seemed<00:01:43.970> ridiculous<00:01:44.750> to<00:01:44.930> even<00:01:44.960> bother

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
just seemed ridiculous to even bother

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.040 
just seemed ridiculous to even bother
using<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.520> bus<00:01:46.700> so<00:01:46.940> i<00:01:46.970> think<00:01:47.240> immediately<00:01:47.600> you

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
using the bus so i think immediately you

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.330 
using the bus so i think immediately you
just<00:01:48.230> realize<00:01:48.530> well<00:01:48.710> this<00:01:48.830> is<00:01:48.950> a<00:01:48.980> waste<00:01:49.190> of

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
just realize well this is a waste of

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.690 
just realize well this is a waste of
time<00:01:50.500> but<00:01:51.500> still<00:01:51.650> you<00:01:52.010> know<00:01:52.100> I<00:01:52.130> know<00:01:52.460> what

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
time but still you know I know what

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.030 
time but still you know I know what
trains<00:01:52.910> it<00:01:53.060> happened<00:01:53.420> I<00:01:53.770> think<00:01:54.770> a<00:01:54.830> lot<00:01:54.860> of<00:01:54.980> the

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
trains it happened I think a lot of the

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.220 
trains it happened I think a lot of the
community<00:01:55.460> a<00:01:55.490> disillusioned<00:01:56.240> by<00:01:56.390> black<00:01:56.870> ops<00:01:57.080> 2

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
no stretch of the imagination difficult

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.700 
no stretch of the imagination difficult
whereas<00:02:04.160> if<00:02:04.190> we<00:02:04.370> think<00:02:04.490> back<00:02:04.580> to<00:02:05.260> black<00:02:06.260> ops<00:02:06.530> we

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
whereas if we think back to black ops we

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.699 
whereas if we think back to black ops we
had<00:02:06.740> kino<00:02:07.610> der<00:02:07.640> toten<00:02:07.790> and<00:02:08.450> five<00:02:08.780> don't<00:02:09.470> think

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
had kino der toten and five don't think

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:10.869 
had kino der toten and five don't think
back<00:02:09.860> to<00:02:09.979> all<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.190> walks<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:10.459> no<00:02:10.550> we<00:02:10.670> had<00:02:10.789> an

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
back to all the walks and no we had an

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.130 
back to all the walks and no we had an
axe<00:02:11.060> but<00:02:11.269> I<00:02:11.330> think<00:02:11.510> that<00:02:11.629> that<00:02:11.660> was<00:02:11.870> just<00:02:11.989> a

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
axe but I think that that was just a

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.160 
axe but I think that that was just a
trial-and-error<00:02:12.620> con

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
trial-and-error con

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.330 
trial-and-error con
thing<00:02:13.319> I<00:02:13.500> think<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:14.130> they<00:02:14.220> were<00:02:14.310> just

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
thing I think that they were just

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.370 
thing I think that they were just
testing<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.849> waters<00:02:15.150> with<00:02:15.300> nacked<00:02:15.540> but<00:02:16.170> if<00:02:16.260> we

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
testing the waters with nacked but if we

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.920 
testing the waters with nacked but if we
had<00:02:16.470> keno<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:16.890> keno<00:02:17.700> was<00:02:17.819> an<00:02:17.910> extremely<00:02:18.300> easy

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
had keno and keno was an extremely easy

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.540 
had keno and keno was an extremely easy
map<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.470> very<00:02:19.620> easy<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:19.980> sink<00:02:20.310> your<00:02:20.400> teeth

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
map and very easy to sink your teeth

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.300 
map and very easy to sink your teeth
into<00:02:20.819> when<00:02:21.120> you're<00:02:21.270> a<00:02:21.300> newbie<00:02:21.780> player<00:02:22.280> but<00:02:23.280> I

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
into when you're a newbie player but I

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.650 
into when you're a newbie player but I
don't<00:02:23.640> think<00:02:23.790> transit<00:02:24.270> have<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.480> same

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
don't think transit have the same

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.390 
don't think transit have the same
effective<00:02:25.140> in<00:02:25.349> fact<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.739> know<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:26.130> had<00:02:26.250> the

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
effective in fact I know it had the

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.770 
effective in fact I know it had the

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
see in the next map packs I've a video

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.809 
see in the next map packs I've a video
going<00:04:41.110> up<00:04:41.229> very<00:04:41.259> soon<00:04:41.650> called<00:04:42.190> them<00:04:42.460> I'm<00:04:42.699> not

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:42.819 
going up very soon called them I'm not

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:44.339 
going up very soon called them I'm not
gonna<00:04:42.940> sell<00:04:43.120> this<00:04:43.210> called<00:04:43.449> actually<00:04:43.720> it's<00:04:44.289> a

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349 
gonna sell this called actually it's a

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:45.629 
gonna sell this called actually it's a
map<00:04:44.530> idea<00:04:44.949> and<00:04:45.099> I'll<00:04:45.159> just<00:04:45.340> say<00:04:45.490> it's

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
map idea and I'll just say it's

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.710 
map idea and I'll just say it's
basically<00:04:45.940> like<00:04:46.120> an<00:04:46.270> elevator<00:04:46.800> but<00:04:47.800> um<00:04:48.509> if<00:04:49.509> at

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
basically like an elevator but um if at

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.879 
basically like an elevator but um if at
the<00:04:49.780> next<00:04:49.990> video<00:04:50.050> I'm<00:04:50.259> good<00:04:50.409> literature<00:04:50.650> and

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
the next video I'm good literature and

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:52.589 
the next video I'm good literature and
call<00:04:51.039> the<00:04:51.159> audio<00:04:51.400> for<00:04:51.610> after<00:04:52.060> this<00:04:52.180> so<00:04:52.419> I'm

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:52.599 
call the audio for after this so I'm

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:55.170 
call the audio for after this so I'm
that<00:04:53.470> should<00:04:53.740> be<00:04:53.919> a<00:04:54.190> really<00:04:54.490> good<00:04:54.580> idea<00:04:54.699> and<00:04:55.120> I

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
that should be a really good idea and I

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.830 
that should be a really good idea and I
think<00:04:56.099> that<00:04:57.099> it<00:04:57.340> would<00:04:57.490> extend<00:04:58.090> the

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
think that it would extend the

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.860 
think that it would extend the
creativity<00:04:59.319> of<00:04:59.970> our<00:05:00.970> community<00:05:01.479> in<00:05:01.569> this<00:05:01.659> map

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
creativity of our community in this map

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.320 
creativity of our community in this map
that's<00:05:02.110> feasible<00:05:02.979> in<00:05:03.370> every<00:05:03.669> light<00:05:03.849> like<00:05:04.090> it's

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
that's feasible in every light like it's

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.159 
that's feasible in every light like it's
really<00:05:04.930> light<00:05:05.259> on<00:05:06.240> power<00:05:07.240> units<00:05:07.750> and<00:05:07.960> it<00:05:08.050> would

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
really light on power units and it would

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.589 
really light on power units and it would
be<00:05:08.199> light<00:05:08.530> in<00:05:08.560> terms<00:05:09.039> of<00:05:09.250> so<00:05:09.909> I<00:05:09.940> processing

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:10.599 
be light in terms of so I processing

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:11.879 
be light in terms of so I processing
units<00:05:10.990> and<00:05:11.199> stuff<00:05:11.319> like<00:05:11.440> that<00:05:11.500> so<00:05:11.620> be

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
units and stuff like that so be

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.999 
units and stuff like that so be
available<00:05:12.250> on<00:05:12.340> all<00:05:12.990> all<00:05:13.990> consoles<00:05:14.440> and<00:05:14.680> PCs

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:15.009 
available on all all consoles and PCs

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:16.320 
available on all all consoles and PCs
and<00:05:15.039> stuff<00:05:15.340> like<00:05:15.460> that<00:05:15.520> you<00:05:15.669> know<00:05:15.699> it's<00:05:15.880> gonna

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
and stuff like that you know it's gonna

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.629 
and stuff like that you know it's gonna
be<00:05:16.449> a<00:05:16.509> map<00:05:16.719> which<00:05:16.930> everyone<00:05:17.380> can<00:05:17.409> enjoy<00:05:17.710> but
