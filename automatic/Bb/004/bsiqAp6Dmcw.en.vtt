00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
things like that a little bit confusing

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.090 
things like that a little bit confusing
at<00:01:54.149> first<00:01:54.210> I'll<00:01:55.110> probably<00:01:55.380> just<00:01:55.560> end<00:01:55.799> up<00:01:55.950> using

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
at first I'll probably just end up using

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.510 
at first I'll probably just end up using
the<00:01:56.369> traditional<00:01:57.110> keyboard<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.590> this<00:01:59.340> is

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
the traditional keyboard is this is

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.520 
the traditional keyboard is this is
maybe<00:02:00.329> it's<00:02:00.540> just<00:02:00.600> me<00:02:00.869> not<00:02:01.049> knowing<00:02:01.229> how<00:02:01.469> to

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
maybe it's just me not knowing how to

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.499 
maybe it's just me not knowing how to
use<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.920> but<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.700> little<00:02:02.850> bit<00:02:03.030> confusing

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
use it but it is a little bit confusing

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.569 
use it but it is a little bit confusing
and<00:02:03.750> we'll<00:02:04.200> take<00:02:04.380> some<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.860> little<00:02:05.280> bit<00:02:05.490> of

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
and we'll take some a little bit of

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.999 
and we'll take some a little bit of
learning<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.149> use<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.869> there's<00:02:07.439> also<00:02:07.619> some

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
learning to use that there's also some

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.859 
learning to use that there's also some
improved<00:02:08.550> word<00:02:08.819> selection<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.629> copy

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
improved word selection and copy

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.320 
improved word selection and copy
functionality<00:02:10.739> there's<00:02:11.580> also<00:02:11.790> new<00:02:12.120> user

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
functionality there's also new user

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.670 
functionality there's also new user
interface<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:13.080> colors

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680

interface and colors
teams<00:02:13.829> for<00:02:14.099> things<00:02:14.420> there's<00:02:15.420> these<00:02:15.599> icons<00:02:16.049> now

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
teams for things there's these icons now

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.199 
teams for things there's these icons now
down<00:02:16.590> at<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:16.829> bottom<00:02:16.980> that<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:17.819> can<00:02:18.000> change

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
down at the bottom that you can change

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.509 
down at the bottom that you can change
around<00:02:18.450> they<00:02:19.349> kind<00:02:19.560> of<00:02:19.620> stay<00:02:19.829> right<00:02:20.040> here<00:02:20.400> and

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
around they kind of stay right here and

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.009 
around they kind of stay right here and
we<00:02:20.579> can<00:02:20.730> change<00:02:20.939> them<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.209> whatever<00:02:21.599> we<00:02:21.780> want

applications<00:02:58.799> which<00:02:58.980> i<00:02:59.189> guess<00:02:59.430> isn't<00:02:59.669> really

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
applications which i guess isn't really

a<00:02:59.939> little<00:03:00.209> thing<00:03:00.419> to<00:03:00.569> me<00:03:00.689> it's<00:03:00.810> pretty<00:03:00.989> big<00:03:01.230> I

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
a little thing to me it's pretty big I

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.550 
a little thing to me it's pretty big I
do<00:03:01.829> like<00:03:02.219> the<00:03:02.250> geo<00:03:02.669> tagging<00:03:03.150> stuff<00:03:03.419> that<00:03:04.349> means

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
do like the geo tagging stuff that means

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.339 
do like the geo tagging stuff that means
when<00:03:04.919> you<00:03:05.040> take<00:03:05.189> a<00:03:05.219> picture<00:03:05.519> it'll<00:03:05.909> actually

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
when you take a picture it'll actually

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.069 
when you take a picture it'll actually
pinpoint<00:03:07.349> on<00:03:07.790> using<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:08.969> GPS<00:03:09.419> antenna<00:03:09.810> where

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
pinpoint on using the GPS antenna where

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.289 
pinpoint on using the GPS antenna where
you<00:03:10.230> are<00:03:10.290> where<00:03:10.799> you<00:03:11.069> are<00:03:11.099> at<00:03:11.459> and<00:03:11.760> it<00:03:12.209> will

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
you are where you are at and it will

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.420 
you are where you are at and it will
actually<00:03:12.530> record<00:03:13.530> that<00:03:13.709> data<00:03:13.950> so<00:03:14.189> when<00:03:14.310> you

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
actually record that data so when you

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.429 
actually record that data so when you

sorts<00:03:27.870> of<00:03:27.930> different<00:03:27.989> things<00:03:28.500> I<00:03:29.069> guess<00:03:29.699> a

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:29.729 
sorts of different things I guess a

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:32.390 
sorts of different things I guess a
redesigned<00:03:30.359> camera<00:03:30.780> app<00:03:30.930> as<00:03:31.169> well<00:03:31.199> in<00:03:32.069> here

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
redesigned camera app as well in here

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.449 
redesigned camera app as well in here
let's<00:03:32.669> go<00:03:32.849> into<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.299> camera<00:03:33.739> the<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:35.099> camera

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
let's go into the camera the the camera

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:36.819 
let's go into the camera the the camera
options<00:03:35.849> I<00:03:35.939> guess<00:03:36.120> are<00:03:36.269> slightly<00:03:36.540> different

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
options I guess are slightly different

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.199 
options I guess are slightly different
yeah<00:03:37.829> see<00:03:38.069> it's<00:03:38.189> saying<00:03:38.400> it<00:03:38.549> wants<00:03:38.790> to<00:03:38.909> photo

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
yeah see it's saying it wants to photo

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
looks a little bit better you get some

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.509 
looks a little bit better you get some
more<00:04:02.699> options<00:04:02.879> and<00:04:03.590> it's<00:04:04.590> all<00:04:04.799> built<00:04:05.069> right<00:04:05.340> in

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
more options and it's all built right in

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:07.229 
so there are some other things but

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:09.589 
so there are some other things but
that's<00:04:07.500> basically<00:04:07.709> it<00:04:08.099> it<00:04:08.489> adds<00:04:09.090> a<00:04:09.359> lot<00:04:09.449> of

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
that's basically it it adds a lot of

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.229 
that's basically it it adds a lot of
speed<00:04:09.840> improvements<00:04:10.500> things<00:04:10.739> are<00:04:10.889> snappy<00:04:11.340> and

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
speed improvements things are snappy and

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.089 
speed improvements things are snappy and
work<00:04:12.509> great<00:04:12.810> so<00:04:13.500> that's<00:04:13.709> pretty<00:04:13.889> much<00:04:13.979> it

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
work great so that's pretty much it

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.349 
work great so that's pretty much it
