00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.500
 a beautiful friend today 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:09.730
 new video but this time it does not work 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.860
 my gameplay but a type and 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.320
 Although how to open war yes 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.240
 but with long researched unfortunately 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.710
 So nobody found anything with it 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.770
 we could explain in detail 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.420
 a google or youtube nobody i have 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.670
 that got me halfway out of it 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.770
 I wanted to show how that really works 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.869
 easy is really very easy 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.400
 you will not see that now 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.579
 it will take two minutes three minutes 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.109
 but it does not take that long and he has 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.969
 the Ã¼beream simply I do not know any 

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:39.159
 which can be so easy now anyway 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.879
 first off you go even if you 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:41.649
 stop then internet 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.839
 its connection settings in it 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.300
 Settings network settings 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:48.850
 Connection settings just right 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.350
 here on custom goes on 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.149
 Network cable depending on what he uses 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.579
 in that of network cable he goes up 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:58.420
 then search automatically then goes on 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:02.049
 ppp after her transition out for a very 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.600
 important here is the point and if I 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:07.689
 here since here simply your 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.630
 telephone number with area code 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:13.390
 So I find hamburg so 040 and on 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.890
 your phone number very important the good 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.359
 That's because I'm down to nothing down here 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.909
 we still need to enter password or password 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:21.549
 what do not I know something yours simply 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:25.210
 telephone number with area code in hamburg 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:28.479
 so 0 40 so with preselection so half 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.289
 before because phone number together easy 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.170
 I have to go here 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:36.130
 40 0 and I have to mine once 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.560
 phone number then enter after you 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.759
 did that because I can just 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.579
 now here 0 4 0 1 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.850
 allowed to enter this formula one you go 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:49.119
 here goes here automatically 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.920
 automatically that often shit then 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.719
 so have two phone number not 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.609
 that's why it does not work 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:56.079
 after you need your phone number 

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:58.479
 have given what was not done now 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.850
 have since then just stop here 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.219
 phone number inside then there is synonymous 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.840

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.770
 phone number and area code I have now 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.920
 done it before against time 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.240
 then you push fix and connection 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.700
 test or do you have type 1 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.320
 And it works out to 90 percent at each 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.660

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.430
