 where will the course be 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.860

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:25.530
 hands 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.050
 so 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.560
 the meat is completely clove garlic 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.950
 expert center first option 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.820
 now we need 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.590
 a mixture of dry herbs 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.250
 it could be parsley dill 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.240
 alarm clock but usually not used 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.690
 dry ProvenÃ§al French rights 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.550
 so rub injuries 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.320
 then sprinkle with salt 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.420
 ap 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.650
 ap penalty times we turn a piece 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.570
 and do the same thing another country 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.229
 disable I will not because pepper already 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.870
 is inside neatly so 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.550
 she blanks leave him bye 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.209
 side apt 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.049
 considering that marinate stage we 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.209
 let's do the cooking 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.959
 garnish garnish form I will not do 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.570
 because the most basic is soft 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.809
 at this location 

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:23.949
 so as a side dish, I suggest 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:26.939
 take carrot and onion potatoes 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.349
 hike which we will also be with meat 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.129

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:33.729
 cut potatoes 

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:36.729
 But on such slices 

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:39.599

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.019
 place 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.269
 with skin 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.759
 not yet we cut 

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:51.149
 the potatoes will need to turn on the stove 

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:53.259
 so that it is already heated to one hundred 

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:54.869
 eighty degrees because 

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:57.409
 meat should be put on the skin warmed 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.219
 oven streams ready now take carrots 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:04.300
 and cut into circles 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.300
 not very thin 

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:10.879
 about half a centimeter 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.060
 so during the teleconference we cook from 

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:16.019
 simple products 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.459
 in order not to raise 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.359
 cost price 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.359
 plow with four parts 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:28.589
 so vegetables are ready 

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:31.589
 odds supplies side 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.689
 and now we take the package 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:36.839

 bell pepper 

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:49.500
 stock city plaza 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.430
 high 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.430
 then the same products vegetables 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:57.569
 as you noticed everyone is preparing very much 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.469
 fast and easy 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:04.109
 then the chosen ones the head of global no longer hurts 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:05.859
 how is sport there 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.439
 and already after we put the package 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:09.229
 meat 

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:10.280
 and vegetables 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.349
 the package needs to be very tightly closed 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:15.269
 so that hot air is not 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.199
 got out of there 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:19.529

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.000
 Now we send what this oven 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.949
 baking temperature 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:27.590
 180 degrees 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.590
 for half an hour 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.770
 but for now I will bake meat 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.729
 I propose to cook the sauce thousand 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.729
 philadelphia cheese indignation soprano 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.020
 for this I will need 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.879
 cream cheese 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:44.990
 milk 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.909
 honey for artists and safran 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:51.029
 what first of all we do 

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:54.199
 there is one tablespoon of honey in it 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.229
 from the lat 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:59.370
 its steel on the slab st 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.850
 Prime warm up after honey 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.530
 we melted quietly 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.620
 add milk here 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.210
 because even we add one teahouse 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.509
 spoon as a result 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:14.089
 Artek need to boil well 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:16.339
 trying flavor 

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:19.229
 Nevada mustard 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.759
 and then gradually start adding 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.800
 how personally is philadelphia 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.689
 one tablespoon will be enough 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:28.819
 for cold you will need to mix 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:30.650
 so that there are no lumps 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.580
 look it melts 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.580
 pestovo so it turns out 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:40.479
 less than a minute as demand 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:44.689
 and at the very end I propose to add 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.409
 several thousand years soprano 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:49.839
 saffron is 

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:51.229
 natural 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:54.409
 maggots 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:57.589
 he gives Kiev dish an unforgettable taste 

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:59.589
 respectively color 

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:02.319
 dollars ready give him the opportunity to 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:05.550
 Transcarpathia but to bring a number of Kiev to 

00:06:05.549 --> 00:06:07.279
 preparedness sauce 

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:09.490
 either at the very end 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:10.509
 a little bit 

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:12.509
 so how is honey here 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:13.889
 sweet ambassador 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:16.529
 but you need more historian 

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:18.900
 instead of regular pepper 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.550
 I suggest 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.479
 sprinkle with pepper and cost 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:25.699
 if you do not have this you can 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:28.050
 do the usual 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.409
 tracks 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:31.789
 give opportunity 

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:33.139
 sauce st 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:34.659
 stand 

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:37.469
 no pick yourself aspect of flavors from 

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:40.360
 of our countries, the meat is ready to reach any 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.360
 the oven 

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:49.490
 but her little 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.790
 for reference and then we will be 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.790
 serve in car racing 

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:02.389
 revealing meat 

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:04.400
 I think that first of all it will be necessary 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.539
 lay out a side dish 

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:09.139
 baked potatoes with carrots 

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:12.139
 you can also rely give south 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.330
 never found 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.740
 oriental fragrant 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.860
 now take protein binos 

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.430
 special for meat 

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.199
 and begin to impose 

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:26.669
 into pieces 

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:29.669
 look pork straight scene 

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:31.830
 exactly 

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.059
 aromatic 

00:07:33.059 --> 00:07:35.180
 soaked with garlic 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.710
 rosemary 

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.699
 I think that two pieces will be 

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:41.229
 enough on the floor 

00:07:41.229 --> 00:07:44.550
 and now we sing 

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:45.789
 so can not 

00:07:45.789 --> 00:07:47.909
 philadelphia cheese sauce 

00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:49.520
 never mind 

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.849
 and that is gratifying 

00:07:50.849 --> 00:07:53.020
 look table turned out 

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.020
