00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.320
 good gentlemen 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:07.880
 here we are 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.413
 they told me that below 

00:00:09.413 --> 00:00:11.128
 there should be a secret dragon 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.420
 so let's check ... 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.420
 personally... 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.420
 I personally don't believe it so ... 

00:00:43.044 --> 00:00:45.044
 the goal is to reach Blackreach 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.080
 now we have arrived at the tower of Mzark 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.620
 and now we're getting down to it 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.120
 here you find the Ancient Parchment 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.927
 and let's see .... 

00:00:56.842 --> 00:00:58.842
 well 

00:01:01.373 --> 00:01:03.373
 here we are 

00:01:05.807 --> 00:01:07.807
 they told us 

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:10.319
 a fortress 

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:11.341
 Let's check... 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.040
 considering that.... 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.780
 they are the ... 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:42.819
 let's go bow 

00:01:46.269 --> 00:01:48.269
 here we have 

00:01:49.204 --> 00:01:51.204
 of humans ...... actually servants 

00:01:51.462 --> 00:01:53.462
 of the Falmers 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.160
 obviously 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.119
 these will certainly not stop us ... 

00:02:16.535 --> 00:02:18.535
 let's free let's say the place ... 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.660
 well 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.364
 therefore 

00:02:39.081 --> 00:02:41.081
 they told us that .... 

00:02:41.081 --> 00:02:42.309
 once arrived here 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:43.804
 there will be a huge chandelier 

00:02:45.313 --> 00:02:47.313
 and we will have to launch a Fus Ro Dah 

00:02:47.313 --> 00:02:49.034
 to bring down a dragon 

00:02:50.672 --> 00:02:52.672
 let's kill this nuisance 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.800
 and let's see if this thing is true .... 

00:02:57.205 --> 00:02:59.205
 get ready .... 

00:02:59.205 --> 00:03:00.531
 the fus ro dah in short 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.959
 Let's point it at the chandelier 

00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:05.182
 and let's see .... 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.900
 Well 

00:03:09.735 --> 00:03:11.735
 I would say that nothing happened 

00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:41.161
 mmmmm .... no ..... 

00:03:41.161 --> 00:03:41.992
 in reality..... 

00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:44.421
 ..... this is not a chandelier but it is a bell ..... 

00:03:44.947 --> 00:03:46.947
 something big is coming ...... 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.360
 here it is.... 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.689
 gentlemen... 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.099
 already 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:59.802
 I would say that .... 

00:03:59.802 --> 00:04:01.726
 we found it .... 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.220
 Vulthuryol .... 

00:04:16.254 --> 00:04:18.254
 well we prepare ourselves ... 

00:04:18.254 --> 00:04:19.589
 at the fight .... 

00:04:25.137 --> 00:04:27.137
 I have no idea how this dragon fights .... it seems ... 

00:04:27.359 --> 00:04:29.359
 looks different from the others ... 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.580
 ... no, fortunately he too leans .... 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.811
 let's get down ... 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.740
 also because I would never want someone else to make it out of me .... 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.280
 then ..... Dragon's Gash ... 

00:04:51.513 --> 00:04:53.513
 no ... I would say they can't steal it ... 

00:04:53.513 --> 00:04:54.746
 because he waits for me so .... 

00:04:54.756 --> 00:04:56.756
 well i would say ... 

00:04:56.756 --> 00:04:58.280
 at this point of ... 

00:04:59.398 --> 00:05:01.398
 we put a potion in it if ... 

00:05:01.398 --> 00:05:02.325
 if we have it ... 

00:05:03.043 --> 00:05:05.043
 of fire resistance .... 

00:05:08.461 --> 00:05:10.461
 let's make a Fus Ro Dah to block it and .... 

00:05:10.461 --> 00:05:12.168
 and we hurl ourselves 

00:05:12.168 --> 00:05:13.161
 the Dragon 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.680
 I have to thank my armor probably ... 

00:05:31.596 --> 00:05:33.596
 being that of the dragon's plates ... 

00:05:38.716 --> 00:05:40.716
 I'm sorry but.... 

00:05:41.652 --> 00:05:43.652
 you are too weird to let you live .... 

00:05:46.873 --> 00:05:48.873
 we killed him gentlemen! here it is ! 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.420
 let's take an eye ... ancient dragon scales .... 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.551
 gentlemen 

00:06:22.561 --> 00:06:24.561
 we take them ... 

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:28.886
 these look like the classic ones, so ... 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.100
 well 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.447
 here are gentlemen .... 

00:06:34.447 --> 00:06:35.656
 the secret dragon ... 

00:06:35.664 --> 00:06:37.664
 apparently the rumors were true ... 

00:06:37.793 --> 00:06:39.793
 of this .... let's say .... 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.620
 chandelier .... actually a bell .... 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.834
 ... who calls this dragon ... 

00:06:43.858 --> 00:06:45.858
 Now... 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.260
 we will find out what these strange ones are for .... 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.098
 flakes ... 

00:06:52.098 --> 00:06:53.223
 but anyway ... 

00:06:54.222 --> 00:06:56.222
 see you next time...
