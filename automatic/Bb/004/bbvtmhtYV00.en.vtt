tried yet it's the Wizards kind of

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.320 
tried yet it's the Wizards kind of
almost<00:02:13.860> reminds<00:02:14.250> me<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.459> blood<00:02:14.730> wizard<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.180> way

almost reminds me a blood wizard and way

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.059 
almost reminds me a blood wizard and way
but<00:02:15.510> not<00:02:15.630> quite<00:02:15.870> but<00:02:16.580> anyhow<00:02:18.709> get<00:02:19.709> some<00:02:19.890> hot

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
but not quite but anyhow get some hot

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:27.229 
but not quite but anyhow get some hot
sauce<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:21.410> put<00:02:22.410> on<00:02:22.530> about<00:02:23.480> come<00:02:24.480> on<00:02:26.239> probably

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
sauce I put on about come on probably

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:35.090 
sauce I put on about come on probably
enough<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.600> make<00:02:27.720> it<00:02:27.750> kind<00:02:28.050> of<00:02:28.170> spicy

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.140 

there<00:02:35.850> you<00:02:35.940> go<00:02:36.030> it's<00:02:36.930> not<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.140> whole<00:02:37.350> lot

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
there you go it's not a whole lot

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.340 
there you go it's not a whole lot
because<00:02:39.150> this<00:02:39.330> hot<00:02:39.480> sauce<00:02:39.720> isn't<00:02:39.990> really<00:02:40.290> even

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
because this hot sauce isn't really even
