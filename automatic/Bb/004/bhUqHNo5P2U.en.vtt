00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:13.079
 hello everyone and again with you i'm a super dog and 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:15.009
 I play a card duel today 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:18.580
 plays against me 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.660
 ricochet title is the same we play 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.460
 in baht balcony 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.460
 that is, call the lieutenant colonel 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:36.870
 lost and you so against the cafe 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.870
 it's generally difficult to play but she 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:48.000
 managed 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.000
 play up to 100 deaths 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.000
 guys at the moment I'm wrong now 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.420
 often play tanks with you why 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.690
 that at the moment I am very much 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:07.049
 work and he debian 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:11.600
 work and therefore I don't always have 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.600
 it turns out to play with you 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.110
 computer games 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.130
 my opponent got tricky enough 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:27.119
 he 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.840
 that I myself here here here 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:34.240
 destroys and therefore incorrectly desires 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:39.179
 score more points I do not understand why 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.179
 but ricochet to destroy himself 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.590
 yayaya 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:54.330
 and killed killed killed no first time playing 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:57.150
 duel do not know what would happen and 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.760
 here is my opponent told me that 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.790
 in a duel should fall a golden box 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.670
 I understand he should probably fall 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.600
 in the middle here somewhere here we will 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.600
 I will give a look 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.299
 so glad of him 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.299
 where is he 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.940
 she won 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.670
 generally play rails against 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.620
 bounce is quite difficult and therefore 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.890
 if you play rails bounce stump 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.210
 first thing you need to do 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.160
 keep their gums 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:44.750
 because if there is no distance 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:49.300
 You must be killed so well, look 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:53.430
 Now try ah like that again and go 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.430
 our task is to leave as soon as possible 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.379
 like this 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.930
 here's the bill today i killed him 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.930
 5 he killed me i am not on from qatar 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.530
 ahhhhhhhhhhhhh 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:12.739
 depart from but did not have time to drink and drink kill 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:18.510
 here they will kill by spell 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:20.370
 so here's the game why there is not 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.140
 slows down probably due to 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.680
 that I still have a weak internet 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.010
 will be 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.010
 go around 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.900
 I do not even know what to comment on in the game 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:42.510
 duel here I went I vessel 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.510
 spontaneously and therefore 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.629
 video on what can be slowed down 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.069
 because I have 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:53.870
 Kaspersky antivirus should be necessary 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:58.510
 its certainly true 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.510
 with the check but I did not do it therefore 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:11.370
 I missed but it becomes interesting here. 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:13.379
 because our work and suddenly plays with 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.889
 I will finish the reinforced armor 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:19.970
 without her and so my task is how can 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.970
 hide faster 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.730
 that's how i do it i will tell you that 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:29.850
 all the same if you play on rails well 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.740
 probably more interest more more 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:36.050
 get from what you play exactly 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.050
 rails and because play 

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:42.919
 ricochet play here in this here it is in 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.889
 This map is not very interesting and 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:50.360
 so I do not understand will be rebound 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:52.580
 made the decision to play well though in 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.590
 In principle, he did not know he would go against him 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.210
 so 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:00.020
 quite real that the guy just doesn't 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.020
 expected so 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:08.989
 in this he won't go over there yes 

00:05:05.989 --> 00:05:08.989
 we take away 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:15.160
 that got 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.840
 fine here I will not see 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.520
 that's how he would just kill himself 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:23.100
 why did he not understand 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.100
 probably there is some 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.060
 his secret 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.310
 me he make too 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:38.900
 I urge all those guys who and 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:41.680
 are my friends followers if 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.249
 I'm not in the game you can go to skype 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.789
 waiting and the queen 

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:49.669
 And in Skopje very many we already friends for 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:51.229
 Subscribers who can, in principle, you 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:52.879
 make a company in order to 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:54.969
 play the game tanks online 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:56.229
 please be friends and difficult 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:58.720
 choose i think it is too 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:00.160
 interestingly enough because 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.900
 seeing 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.520
 what kind of work is a busy person and a bit 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:07.960
 older than you and therefore not always 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:10.030
 manages to play a game with you every 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.580
 evening because adjusting eliminating from 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:15.449
 their duty work therefore 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.449
 like this 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.550

 you will support me in every possible way 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.990
 try as soon as i have 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.410
 free 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:35.390
 take your time playing the game and you 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.420
 probably yes to play with 

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.420
 you 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:45.310
 take with you here 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:45.310
 eat food this video posted on youtube 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:50.810
 here is how will be my recommendations 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:56.120
 abilities not knowing how so not 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:57.360
 it turns out because probably because 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.409
 what 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.400
 he battle saw three crystal balde 

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:07.580
 because here in general it is not interesting 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.580
 we play a duel here 

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:15.669
 in this duel do n't even know what 

00:07:09.249 --> 00:07:17.409
 comment here the most important thing well and 

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:20.440
 that that is, the man asked me not 

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:23.460
 shoot he has the most important thing 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.460
 be more 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:30.220
 nothing match on alcohol tanks with my 

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:33.000
 gave up and understand because it is easier 

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.000
 that they were not shot at 

00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:41.099
 plays will stop interesting but here 

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:44.600
 first time playing the duel after seeing the photo 

00:07:41.099 --> 00:07:47.320
 thin so trust me I liked 

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.320
 under the sailors 

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:50.550
 so 

00:07:55.470 --> 00:08:03.500
 so I probably finish my 

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.500
 catch your mouth 

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:10.910
 this is a game yes my opponent in Kiev 

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:12.770
 pain so thank you all for watching 

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:15.530
 Like this video Like it 

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:18.880
