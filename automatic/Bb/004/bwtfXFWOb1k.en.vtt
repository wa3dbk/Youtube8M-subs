00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:03.409 
in this lesson we'll learn how to use

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:05.440 
in this lesson we'll learn how to use
real-world<00:00:04.130> lighting<00:00:04.550> data<00:00:04.760> inside<00:00:05.420> of

purple tint that's been applied this is
just<00:00:14.269> coming<00:00:14.450> from<00:00:14.750> a<00:00:15.049> simple<00:00:15.740> light<00:00:16.219> that

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
just coming from a simple light that

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.380 
just coming from a simple light that
I've<00:00:16.490> dropped<00:00:16.730> in<00:00:16.910> here<00:00:17.090> a<00:00:17.119> basic

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
I've dropped in here a basic

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.060 
I've dropped in here a basic

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
omnidirectional light

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.800 
omnidirectional light
I've<00:00:19.400> tinted<00:00:19.820> this<00:00:19.940> sort<00:00:20.150> of<00:00:20.210> a<00:00:20.300> purple<00:00:20.630> color

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
I've tinted this sort of a purple color

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.529 
I've tinted this sort of a purple color
and<00:00:21.020> I've<00:00:22.010> enabled<00:00:22.760> this<00:00:22.910> ambient

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
and I've enabled this ambient

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.529 
and I've enabled this ambient
illumination<00:00:23.990> option<00:00:24.740> so<00:00:25.609> with<00:00:25.970> the<00:00:26.119> ambient

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
illumination option so with the ambient

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.750 
illumination option so with the ambient
illumination<00:00:26.810> turned<00:00:27.380> on<00:00:27.529> instead<00:00:28.160> of<00:00:28.250> making

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
illumination turned on instead of making

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.220 
illumination turned on instead of making
the<00:00:28.880> light<00:00:29.060> feel<00:00:29.330> like<00:00:29.480> it's<00:00:29.660> coming<00:00:29.930> from<00:00:30.019> one

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
the light feel like it's coming from one

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.070 
the light feel like it's coming from one
particular<00:00:30.439> point<00:00:30.980> in<00:00:31.220> space<00:00:32.050> with<00:00:33.050> the

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:33.080 
particular point in space with the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.200 
particular point in space with the
ambient<00:00:33.440> turned<00:00:33.739> on<00:00:33.950> it's<00:00:34.579> really<00:00:34.850> making<00:00:35.000> the

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
ambient turned on it's really making the

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.729 
ambient turned on it's really making the
light<00:00:35.390> feel<00:00:35.630> like<00:00:35.780> it's<00:00:35.960> coming<00:00:36.260> from<00:00:36.290> all

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
light feel like it's coming from all

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.920 
light feel like it's coming from all
directions<00:00:37.070> sort<00:00:37.610> of<00:00:37.700> tinting<00:00:38.149> my<00:00:38.329> entire

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
directions sort of tinting my entire

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.380 
directions sort of tinting my entire
scene<00:00:39.410> and<00:00:39.890> I'm<00:00:40.309> doing<00:00:40.579> this<00:00:40.760> to<00:00:40.820> sort<00:00:41.090> of<00:00:41.149> just

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
scene and I'm doing this to sort of just

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.840 
scene and I'm doing this to sort of just
simulates<00:00:41.719> where<00:00:41.899> the<00:00:41.989> ambient<00:00:42.850> nighttime

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
simulates where the ambient nighttime

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.410 
simulates where the ambient nighttime
sky<00:00:44.980> okay<00:00:45.980> so<00:00:46.489> let's<00:00:46.700> go<00:00:46.789> ahead<00:00:46.820> and<00:00:46.969> drop<00:00:47.180> in

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.969 
of refraction patterns in that light
it's<00:01:58.729> all<00:01:58.969> very<00:01:59.600> very<00:01:59.780> detailed<00:02:00.259> and<00:02:00.439> it's<00:02:00.799> all

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
it's all very very detailed and it's all

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.310 
it's all very very detailed and it's all
based<00:02:01.310> on<00:02:01.549> real-world<00:02:02.450> lighting<00:02:03.200> information

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
based on real-world lighting information

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.969 
based on real-world lighting information
so<00:02:03.920> these<00:02:04.040> are<00:02:04.369> very<00:02:04.729> very<00:02:04.969> accurate<00:02:05.270> lights

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
so these are very very accurate lights

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.949 
so these are very very accurate lights
so<00:02:06.979> here<00:02:07.340> I<00:02:07.369> have<00:02:07.790> a<00:02:08.000> light<00:02:08.390> type<00:02:08.690> that<00:02:08.869> I've

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
so here I have a light type that I've

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.600 
so here I have a light type that I've
created<00:02:09.910> or<00:02:10.910> an<00:02:11.120> IES<00:02:11.540> file<00:02:12.099> and<00:02:13.099> if<00:02:13.220> we<00:02:13.340> pop

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
created or an IES file and if we pop

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.950 
created or an IES file and if we pop
this<00:02:13.790> in<00:02:14.060> we

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
this in we

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.530 
this in we
should<00:02:15.080> see<00:02:15.350> that<00:02:15.650> in<00:02:16.400> my<00:02:16.820> case<00:02:17.030> we<00:02:17.180> get<00:02:17.300> sort

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
should see that in my case we get sort

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.230 
should see that in my case we get sort
of<00:02:17.600> this<00:02:17.720> odd<00:02:17.900> little<00:02:18.740> circle<00:02:19.250> of<00:02:19.310> light<00:02:19.370> but

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
of this odd little circle of light but

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.330 
of this odd little circle of light but
what<00:02:20.360> this<00:02:20.480> is<00:02:20.630> actually<00:02:20.780> showing<00:02:21.350> me<00:02:21.470> is<00:02:21.800> the

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
what this is actually showing me is the

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.410 
what this is actually showing me is the
pattern<00:02:22.790> that's<00:02:23.570> generated<00:02:24.110> by<00:02:24.490> this<00:02:25.490> light

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
pattern that's generated by this light

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.230 
pattern that's generated by this light
and<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:27.380> lens<00:02:28.010> pattern<00:02:28.430> that's<00:02:28.640> inside<00:02:29.210> of

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
and the lens pattern that's inside of

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.840 
and the lens pattern that's inside of
that<00:02:29.390> so<00:02:29.690> let<00:02:30.350> me<00:02:30.410> go<00:02:30.530> ahead<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:30.800> click<00:02:31.670> away

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
that so let me go ahead and click away

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.880 
that so let me go ahead and click away
from<00:02:32.000> my<00:02:32.360> render<00:02:32.690> camera<00:02:33.020> right<00:02:33.320> now<00:02:33.350> if<00:02:33.590> I<00:02:33.650> try

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
from my render camera right now if I try

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.710 
from my render camera right now if I try
to<00:02:33.950> orbit<00:02:34.280> around<00:02:34.370> it's<00:02:35.090> not<00:02:35.270> actually<00:02:35.690> going

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
to orbit around it's not actually going

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.540 
to orbit around it's not actually going
to<00:02:35.900> let<00:02:36.080> me<00:02:36.170> do<00:02:36.260> that<00:02:36.380> because<00:02:36.590> I<00:02:36.890> am<00:02:37.160> looking

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
to let me do that because I am looking

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.010 
to let me do that because I am looking
through<00:02:37.700> this<00:02:37.880> render<00:02:38.150> camera<00:02:38.480> which<00:02:38.870> is

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
through this render camera which is

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.890 
through this render camera which is
locked<00:02:39.260> down<00:02:39.350> so<00:02:40.250> let<00:02:40.340> me<00:02:40.400> go<00:02:40.520> ahead<00:02:40.550> and<00:02:40.760> just

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
locked down so let me go ahead and just

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.870 
locked down so let me go ahead and just
click<00:02:41.900> off<00:02:42.140> of<00:02:42.170> that<00:02:43.420> there<00:02:44.420> we<00:02:44.540> go<00:02:44.750> and<00:02:44.930> now<00:02:45.560> I

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
click off of that there we go and now I

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.790 
click off of that there we go and now I
pull<00:02:46.880> this<00:02:47.030> up<00:02:47.240> we<00:02:47.900> can<00:02:48.050> actually<00:02:48.170> see<00:02:48.530> what

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
pull this up we can actually see what

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.150 
pull this up we can actually see what
this<00:02:49.120> IES<00:02:50.120> file<00:02:50.780> looks<00:02:51.140> like<00:02:51.350> and<00:02:51.590> we<00:02:52.040> can

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
this IES file looks like and we can

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.410 
this IES file looks like and we can
actually<00:02:52.280> see<00:02:52.550> the<00:02:52.670> light<00:02:52.790> distribution

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
actually see the light distribution

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.960 
actually see the light distribution
pattern<00:02:53.690> from<00:02:53.870> this<00:02:54.460> so<00:02:55.460> if<00:02:55.550> I<00:02:55.640> choose<00:02:55.910> my

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
pattern from this so if I choose my

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.420 
pattern from this so if I choose my
light<00:02:56.360> and<00:02:56.600> go<00:02:57.230> down<00:02:57.560> into<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:58.040> photometric

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
light and go down into the photometric

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.240 
light and go down into the photometric
tab<00:02:58.900> this<00:02:59.900> will<00:02:59.960> actually<00:03:00.500> allow<00:03:00.680> us<00:03:00.710> to<00:03:01.010> see

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
tab this will actually allow us to see

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.760 
tab this will actually allow us to see
that<00:03:01.490> light<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:02.030> what<00:03:02.390> its<00:03:02.660> pattern<00:03:03.530> looks

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
that light and what its pattern looks

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.710 
that light and what its pattern looks
like<00:03:03.940> here<00:03:04.940> we<00:03:05.060> can<00:03:05.180> actually<00:03:05.330> start<00:03:05.600> to

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
like here we can actually start to

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.620 
like here we can actually start to
control<00:03:06.080> the<00:03:06.380> intensity<00:03:07.310> of<00:03:07.490> the<00:03:07.610> light<00:03:07.760> so<00:03:08.480> if

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
control the intensity of the light so if

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.860 
control the intensity of the light so if
we<00:03:08.780> want<00:03:08.990> to<00:03:09.050> use<00:03:09.830> any<00:03:10.040> photometric

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
we want to use any photometric

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.270 
we want to use any photometric
illumination<00:03:11.870> we<00:03:12.290> can<00:03:12.440> adjust<00:03:12.530> this<00:03:12.800> based<00:03:13.100> on

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
illumination we can adjust this based on

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.640 
illumination we can adjust this based on
a<00:03:13.550> particular<00:03:14.060> number<00:03:14.210> of<00:03:14.420> candelas<00:03:14.930> or<00:03:15.140> we

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
a particular number of candelas or we

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.420 
a particular number of candelas or we
could<00:03:15.770> base<00:03:15.950> it<00:03:15.980> on<00:03:16.310> lumens<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:19.010> adjust<00:03:19.340> our

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
could base it on lumens and adjust our

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.320 
could base it on lumens and adjust our
light<00:03:19.610> intensity<00:03:20.060> that<00:03:20.180> way<00:03:20.890> so<00:03:22.090> let's<00:03:23.090> come

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
light intensity that way so let's come

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.720 
light intensity that way so let's come
in<00:03:23.980> we'll<00:03:24.980> take<00:03:25.010> our<00:03:25.340> light<00:03:25.690> and<00:03:27.490> just<00:03:28.490> sort<00:03:28.640> of

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
in we'll take our light and just sort of

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.160 
in we'll take our light and just sort of
position<00:03:29.150> this<00:03:29.620> where<00:03:30.620> we<00:03:30.830> would<00:03:31.040> want<00:03:31.310> that

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
position this where we would want that

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.200 
position this where we would want that
sort<00:03:33.170> of<00:03:33.200> underneath<00:03:33.680> here<00:03:33.950> we<00:03:34.730> want<00:03:34.940> maybe<00:03:35.060> we

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.210 
sort of underneath here we want maybe we

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.390 
sort of underneath here we want maybe we
could<00:03:35.360> just<00:03:35.480> angle<00:03:35.900> that<00:03:36.020> out<00:03:36.200> a<00:03:36.410> little<00:03:37.130> bit

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
could just angle that out a little bit

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.810 
could just angle that out a little bit
more<00:03:38.080> that<00:03:39.080> way<00:03:39.140> we<00:03:39.350> get<00:03:39.470> a<00:03:39.500> little<00:03:39.650> bit<00:03:39.830> better

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
more that way we get a little bit better

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.960 
more that way we get a little bit better
illumination<00:03:42.160> but<00:03:43.160> there<00:03:43.370> we<00:03:43.490> can<00:03:43.640> start<00:03:43.790> to

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
illumination but there we can start to

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.630 
illumination but there we can start to
see<00:03:44.200> this<00:03:45.200> light<00:03:45.530> pattern<00:03:45.980> that<00:03:46.160> is<00:03:46.370> being

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
see this light pattern that is being

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.550 
see this light pattern that is being
generated<00:03:46.820> and<00:03:47.210> this<00:03:47.750> is<00:03:47.930> all<00:03:48.140> coming<00:03:48.440> from

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
generated and this is all coming from

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.750 
generated and this is all coming from
real<00:03:49.340> world<00:03:49.640> light<00:03:50.180> manufacturer<00:03:50.870> data<00:03:51.760> so

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
real world light manufacturer data so

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.630 
real world light manufacturer data so
they<00:03:53.420> can<00:03:53.600> come<00:03:53.750> in<00:03:53.870> here<00:03:53.900> and<00:03:54.370> let's<00:03:55.370> maybe

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
they can come in here and let's maybe

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.630 
they can come in here and let's maybe
just<00:03:55.810> ctrl<00:03:56.810> click<00:03:57.020> on<00:03:57.320> that<00:03:57.800> light<00:03:58.070> and<00:03:58.490> I'll

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
just ctrl click on that light and I'll

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.260 
just ctrl click on that light and I'll
duplicate<00:03:59.120> that<00:04:00.520> there<00:04:01.520> we<00:04:01.640> go<00:04:01.670> now<00:04:02.000> I<00:04:02.030> can

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
duplicate that there we go now I can

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.370 
duplicate that there we go now I can
pull<00:04:02.480> that<00:04:02.510> light<00:04:02.840> up<00:04:03.680> here<00:04:04.900> let<00:04:05.900> me<00:04:05.990> come<00:04:06.200> in

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
pull that light up here let me come in

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.580 
pull that light up here let me come in
and<00:04:07.420> rotate<00:04:08.420> that<00:04:08.600> light<00:04:08.810> straight<00:04:09.200> back<00:04:09.410> down

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.530 

there<00:04:12.590> we<00:04:12.740> go<00:04:12.860> very<00:04:13.130> nice<00:04:13.310> we<00:04:14.150> can<00:04:14.240> come<00:04:14.420> in

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
there we go very nice we can come in

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.920 
there we go very nice we can come in
here<00:04:14.570> and<00:04:14.890> give<00:04:15.890> these<00:04:16.070> lights<00:04:16.370> some<00:04:17.150> basic

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
here and give these lights some basic

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.910 
here and give these lights some basic
shadows<00:04:19.960> so<00:04:20.960> let's<00:04:21.200> see<00:04:21.320> if<00:04:21.380> we<00:04:21.470> can't<00:04:21.710> come<00:04:21.830> in

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
shadows so let's see if we can't come in

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.570 
shadows so let's see if we can't come in
here<00:04:21.950> and<00:04:22.250> give<00:04:22.400> these<00:04:22.550> some<00:04:22.850> area<00:04:23.720> shadows

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
here and give these some area shadows

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.350 
here and give these some area shadows
let's<00:04:25.580> see<00:04:25.760> what<00:04:25.850> that<00:04:25.970> looks<00:04:26.150> like

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
let's see what that looks like

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.760 
let's see what that looks like
so<00:04:27.110> press<00:04:27.380> alt<00:04:27.650> R<00:04:27.919> on<00:04:28.250> my

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
so press alt R on my

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.950 
so press alt R on my
keyboard<00:04:29.160> there<00:04:29.879> we<00:04:30.060> go<00:04:30.210> now<00:04:30.479> we<00:04:30.660> can<00:04:30.810> actually

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
keyboard there we go now we can actually

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.320 
keyboard there we go now we can actually
start<00:04:31.139> to<00:04:31.349> see<00:04:31.500> some<00:04:31.680> shadows<00:04:32.039> coming<00:04:32.849> from

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
start to see some shadows coming from

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.629 
start to see some shadows coming from
this<00:04:33.509> light<00:04:33.919> I'll<00:04:34.919> do<00:04:35.069> the<00:04:35.190> same<00:04:35.340> over<00:04:35.610> here

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
this light I'll do the same over here

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:41.180 
this light I'll do the same over here
give<00:04:36.509> that<00:04:36.690> some<00:04:36.990> nice<00:04:37.710> shadows<00:04:39.620> right<00:04:40.620> now<00:04:40.770> my

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
give that some nice shadows right now my

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.670 
give that some nice shadows right now my
area<00:04:41.699> lights<00:04:41.970> if<00:04:42.840> I<00:04:42.930> come<00:04:43.110> in<00:04:43.199> and<00:04:43.319> render<00:04:43.560> this

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
area lights if I come in and render this

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.670 
area lights if I come in and render this
they're<00:04:44.310> not<00:04:44.550> really<00:04:44.879> giving<00:04:45.150> me<00:04:45.500> really<00:04:46.500> some

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
they're not really giving me really some

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.399 
they're not really giving me really some
soft<00:04:46.979> shadows<00:04:47.479> so<00:04:48.479> what<00:04:48.750> I<00:04:48.780> might<00:04:49.020> need<00:04:49.229> to<00:04:49.289> do

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:49.409 
soft shadows so what I might need to do

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:52.249 
soft shadows so what I might need to do
is<00:04:49.620> go<00:04:50.099> to<00:04:50.159> my<00:04:50.310> lights<00:04:50.550> go<00:04:51.150> to<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.330> details<00:04:51.690> tab

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 
is go to my lights go to the details tab

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:54.379 
is go to my lights go to the details tab
and<00:04:52.590> right<00:04:53.310> now<00:04:53.520> we<00:04:53.580> do<00:04:53.849> have<00:04:53.879> it<00:04:54.030> set<00:04:54.270> to<00:04:54.300> a

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
and right now we do have it set to a

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:56.540 
and right now we do have it set to a
rectangle<00:04:54.960> but<00:04:55.110> the<00:04:55.259> size<00:04:55.440> is<00:04:55.470> zero<00:04:55.889> by<00:04:56.520> zero

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
rectangle but the size is zero by zero

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.490 
rectangle but the size is zero by zero
which<00:04:57.210> essentially<00:04:57.900> is<00:04:57.960> going<00:04:58.169> to<00:04:58.259> give<00:04:58.379> me

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
which essentially is going to give me

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.029 
which essentially is going to give me
completely<00:04:58.919> sharp<00:04:59.550> shadows<00:05:00.000> so<00:05:00.990> I<00:05:01.289> could

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
completely sharp shadows so I could

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:04.879 
completely sharp shadows so I could
maybe<00:05:02.449> come<00:05:03.449> in<00:05:03.479> and<00:05:03.810> dial<00:05:04.169> that<00:05:04.380> up<00:05:04.560> just<00:05:04.740> a

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
maybe come in and dial that up just a

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.040 
maybe come in and dial that up just a
little<00:05:04.919> bit<00:05:05.220> let's<00:05:06.000> start<00:05:06.180> with<00:05:06.270> maybe<00:05:06.419> two<00:05:06.870> by

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
little bit let's start with maybe two by

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.420 
little bit let's start with maybe two by
two<00:05:08.810> it<00:05:09.810> looks<00:05:10.080> like<00:05:10.229> that's<00:05:10.380> not<00:05:10.560> quite

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
two it looks like that's not quite

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.320 
two it looks like that's not quite
working<00:05:11.759> out<00:05:12.030> let's<00:05:12.840> go<00:05:13.020> back<00:05:13.169> to<00:05:13.289> my<00:05:13.409> light

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
working out let's go back to my light

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.719 
working out let's go back to my light
there<00:05:15.330> we<00:05:15.449> go<00:05:16.069> well<00:05:17.069> let's<00:05:17.190> maybe<00:05:17.340> start<00:05:17.460> to

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:17.729 
there we go well let's maybe start to

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.469 
there we go well let's maybe start to
bump<00:05:17.849> that<00:05:17.970> up<00:05:18.030> a<00:05:18.180> little<00:05:18.270> bit<00:05:18.449> higher<00:05:20.479> it's

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
bump that up a little bit higher it's

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:22.670 
bump that up a little bit higher it's
probably<00:05:21.719> gonna<00:05:21.810> be<00:05:21.960> a<00:05:21.990> little<00:05:22.229> bit<00:05:22.319> too<00:05:22.500> high

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
probably gonna be a little bit too high

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.659 
probably gonna be a little bit too high
so<00:05:24.229> there<00:05:25.229> we<00:05:25.349> go<00:05:25.380> try<00:05:25.740> something<00:05:26.039> like<00:05:26.130> 50<00:05:26.550> by

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
so there we go try something like 50 by

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:31.129 
so there we go try something like 50 by
50<00:05:27.710> and<00:05:28.710> render<00:05:29.639> that<00:05:29.669> out<00:05:29.819> again<00:05:30.060> there<00:05:30.690> we<00:05:30.870> go

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
50 and render that out again there we go

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:32.499 
50 and render that out again there we go
that's<00:05:31.349> starting<00:05:31.500> to<00:05:31.650> now<00:05:31.800> give<00:05:32.009> us<00:05:32.129> some

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:32.509 
that's starting to now give us some

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:36.589 
that's starting to now give us some
softer<00:05:33.509> shadows<00:05:33.719> in<00:05:34.080> here<00:05:35.120> so<00:05:36.120> we<00:05:36.300> can<00:05:36.419> do<00:05:36.509> the

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:36.599 
softer shadows in here so we can do the

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:38.719 
softer shadows in here so we can do the
same<00:05:36.750> over<00:05:36.930> here<00:05:36.960> for<00:05:37.650> this<00:05:37.770> light<00:05:37.949> you<00:05:38.610> can

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
same over here for this light you can

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:41.510 
same over here for this light you can
start<00:05:38.940> to<00:05:39.030> see<00:05:39.180> where<00:05:39.360> these<00:05:39.569> are<00:05:40.500> very<00:05:41.250> very

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
start to see where these are very very

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.180 
start to see where these are very very
useful<00:05:41.759> for<00:05:42.030> a<00:05:42.630> number<00:05:43.319> of<00:05:43.349> situations<00:05:43.949> so

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
useful for a number of situations so

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.379 
useful for a number of situations so
like<00:05:44.669> I<00:05:44.699> said<00:05:44.909> you<00:05:45.029> can<00:05:45.180> come<00:05:45.210> in<00:05:45.509> and<00:05:46.279> download

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389 
like I said you can come in and download

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.790 
like I said you can come in and download
IES<00:05:48.389> files<00:05:48.690> from<00:05:49.020> a<00:05:49.169> number<00:05:49.469> of<00:05:49.500> light

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
IES files from a number of light

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.420 
IES files from a number of light
manufacturers<00:05:50.639> and<00:05:51.349> by<00:05:52.349> utilizing<00:05:52.949> this<00:05:53.069> real

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
manufacturers and by utilizing this real

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.330 
manufacturers and by utilizing this real
world<00:05:53.669> light<00:05:54.060> data<00:05:54.509> you<00:05:55.349> can<00:05:55.500> see<00:05:55.680> how<00:05:55.919> you<00:05:55.979> can

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
world light data you can see how you can

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.969 
world light data you can see how you can
very<00:05:56.940> very<00:05:57.029> quickly<00:05:57.270> come<00:05:57.690> in<00:05:57.810> and<00:05:58.020> simulate

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
very very quickly come in and simulate

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.249 
very very quickly come in and simulate
lights<00:05:59.370> and<00:05:59.729> other<00:06:00.000> lighting<00:06:00.330> effects<00:06:00.779> that

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:01.259 
lights and other lighting effects that

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:03.110 
lights and other lighting effects that
are<00:06:01.380> very<00:06:01.740> very<00:06:02.009> realistic<00:06:02.250> because<00:06:02.729> again

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
are very very realistic because again

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.640 
are very very realistic because again
they're<00:06:03.569> based<00:06:03.930> on<00:06:04.169> real<00:06:04.860> light<00:06:05.430> information

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
they're based on real light information

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.959 
they're based on real light information
so<00:06:07.650> from<00:06:07.919> this<00:06:08.039> point<00:06:08.219> if<00:06:08.400> we<00:06:08.490> wanted<00:06:08.759> to

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:08.969 
so from this point if we wanted to

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:10.909 
so from this point if we wanted to
change<00:06:09.779> a<00:06:09.960> few<00:06:10.110> things<00:06:10.139> about<00:06:10.409> these<00:06:10.680> lights

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 
change a few things about these lights

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:13.040 
change a few things about these lights
we<00:06:11.099> could<00:06:11.310> certainly<00:06:11.669> do<00:06:11.909> that<00:06:12.090> so<00:06:12.810> we<00:06:12.930> could

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
we could certainly do that so we could

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.559 
we could certainly do that so we could
maybe<00:06:13.259> take<00:06:13.529> this<00:06:13.710> light<00:06:13.979> over<00:06:14.279> here<00:06:14.569> and

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:15.569 
maybe take this light over here and

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:18.170 
maybe take this light over here and
maybe<00:06:15.960> if<00:06:16.080> we<00:06:16.169> wanted<00:06:16.409> this<00:06:16.529> to<00:06:16.740> be<00:06:17.090> maybe<00:06:18.090> a

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
maybe if we wanted this to be maybe a

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.189 
maybe if we wanted this to be maybe a
little<00:06:18.240> bit<00:06:18.449> more<00:06:18.719> yellow<00:06:18.930> in<00:06:19.229> color<00:06:20.900> we<00:06:21.900> come

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:22.199 
little bit more yellow in color we come

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:23.959 
little bit more yellow in color we come
in<00:06:22.319> here<00:06:22.469> change<00:06:22.830> that<00:06:23.039> and<00:06:23.250> now<00:06:23.310> we<00:06:23.759> get<00:06:23.909> a

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:23.969 
in here change that and now we get a

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:26.749 
in here change that and now we get a
little<00:06:24.210> bit<00:06:24.300> more<00:06:24.419> of<00:06:24.539> a<00:06:24.630> yellowish<00:06:25.490> light<00:06:26.490> off

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759 
little bit more of a yellowish light off

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:29.870 
little bit more of a yellowish light off
of<00:06:26.969> here<00:06:27.229> sort<00:06:28.229> of<00:06:28.289> a<00:06:28.380> warmer<00:06:28.710> light<00:06:28.919> maybe<00:06:29.669> to

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 
of here sort of a warmer light maybe to

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.730 
of here sort of a warmer light maybe to
just<00:06:30.060> differentiate<00:06:30.690> these<00:06:30.900> we<00:06:31.409> could<00:06:31.590> take

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
just differentiate these we could take

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.120 
just differentiate these we could take
this<00:06:31.860> light<00:06:32.099> back<00:06:32.310> here<00:06:32.340> and<00:06:33.110> maybe<00:06:34.110> give<00:06:34.979> it<00:06:35.099> a

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.130 
this light back here and maybe give it a

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.279 
this light back here and maybe give it a
little<00:06:35.250> bit<00:06:35.400> of<00:06:35.520> a<00:06:35.580> cooler<00:06:35.940> color<00:06:36.210> just<00:06:37.080> that

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:37.289 
little bit of a cooler color just that

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:42.200 
little bit of a cooler color just that
they<00:06:37.380> don't<00:06:37.589> look<00:06:37.800> exactly<00:06:38.639> the<00:06:38.880> same

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.210 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.080 

here<00:06:42.330> we<00:06:42.419> go<00:06:43.130> so<00:06:44.130> we<00:06:44.250> still<00:06:44.430> have<00:06:44.610> full<00:06:44.819> control

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.090 
here we go so we still have full control

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.150 
here we go so we still have full control
over<00:06:45.180> that<00:06:45.419> we<00:06:46.080> can<00:06:46.229> come<00:06:46.410> back<00:06:46.530> here<00:06:46.830> to<00:06:47.039> the

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.160 
over that we can come back here to the

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.990 
over that we can come back here to the
photometric<00:06:47.720> options<00:06:49.340> and<00:06:50.340> if<00:06:50.580> we<00:06:50.699> wanted<00:06:50.940> to

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 
photometric options and if we wanted to

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.240 
photometric options and if we wanted to
maybe<00:06:51.870> adjust<00:06:52.289> the<00:06:52.349> intensity<00:06:52.650> for<00:06:53.039> one<00:06:53.160> of

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.250 
maybe adjust the intensity for one of

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.100 
maybe adjust the intensity for one of
these<00:06:53.310> lights<00:06:53.580> were<00:06:53.819> dim<00:06:54.569> one<00:06:54.780> of<00:06:54.870> them<00:06:54.960> down

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.110 
these lights were dim one of them down

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.460 
these lights were dim one of them down
we<00:06:55.740> have<00:06:55.889> full<00:06:56.130> control<00:06:56.280> over<00:06:56.669> that<00:06:56.759> as<00:06:57.090> well

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:57.470 
we have full control over that as well

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.020 
we have full control over that as well
now<00:06:58.470> as<00:06:58.500> far<00:06:58.800> as<00:06:58.889> changing<00:06:59.069> the<00:06:59.340> pattern<00:06:59.819> of

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.030 
now as far as changing the pattern of

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.400 
now as far as changing the pattern of
this<00:07:00.389> light<00:07:00.569> we<00:07:00.780> really<00:07:01.050> don't<00:07:01.139> have<00:07:01.259> any

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:01.410 
this light we really don't have any

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.290 
this light we really don't have any
control<00:07:01.889> over<00:07:01.919> that<00:07:02.160> that<00:07:02.490> is<00:07:02.759> defined

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.300 
control over that that is defined

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.860 
control over that that is defined
internally<00:07:04.139> by<00:07:04.710> the<00:07:04.740> IES<00:07:05.669> file<00:07:05.940> itself<00:07:06.419> so<00:07:06.720> we

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:06.870 
internally by the IES file itself so we

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.930 
internally by the IES file itself so we
really<00:07:07.169> don't<00:07:07.259> have<00:07:07.380> any<00:07:07.560> control<00:07:08.099> over<00:07:08.340> the

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:08.940 
really don't have any control over the

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.610 
really don't have any control over the
actual<00:07:09.270> pattern<00:07:09.690> of<00:07:09.810> light<00:07:09.990> that<00:07:10.169> is<00:07:10.380> being

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:10.620 
actual pattern of light that is being

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.550 
actual pattern of light that is being
generated<00:07:11.240> but<00:07:12.240> looking<00:07:12.539> at<00:07:12.630> this<00:07:12.780> you<00:07:13.530> can

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:13.560 
generated but looking at this you can

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.219 
generated but looking at this you can
see<00:07:14.520> where<00:07:14.729> this<00:07:15.000> becomes<00:07:15.330> again<00:07:16.080> an

00:07:16.219 --> 00:07:16.229 
see where this becomes again an

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:18.409 
see where this becomes again an
incredibly<00:07:16.889> useful<00:07:17.130> feature<00:07:17.550> for<00:07:18.210> being<00:07:18.330> able

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:18.419 
incredibly useful feature for being able

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:20.270 
incredibly useful feature for being able
to<00:07:18.539> bring<00:07:18.750> in<00:07:18.870> real-world<00:07:19.199> illumination<00:07:20.070> data

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 
to bring in real-world illumination data

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.029 
to bring in real-world illumination data
and<00:07:20.580> then<00:07:20.880> use<00:07:21.030> that<00:07:21.060> directly<00:07:21.780> inside<00:07:22.440> of<00:07:22.680> our

00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 
and then use that directly inside of our

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:25.550 
and then use that directly inside of our
cinema<00:07:23.370> 4d<00:07:23.550> renders<00:07:24.000> so<00:07:24.960> that's<00:07:25.139> a<00:07:25.259> look<00:07:25.410> at

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:25.560 
cinema 4d renders so that's a look at

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.070 
cinema 4d renders so that's a look at
how<00:07:25.620> we<00:07:25.830> can<00:07:26.009> utilize<00:07:26.460> this<00:07:26.729> IES<00:07:27.509> light<00:07:27.810> data

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080 
how we can utilize this IES light data

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.250 
how we can utilize this IES light data
inside<00:07:28.800> of<00:07:28.830> cinema<00:07:29.220> 4d
