if you're a person who wants to have

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.959 
if you're a person who wants to have
just<00:02:00.030> one<00:02:00.210> bottle<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:01.369> like<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.399> specific

just one bottle and like a specific
number<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.420> would<00:02:03.659> definitely<00:02:04.079> recommend<00:02:04.170> just

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
number I would definitely recommend just

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.469

buying<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.040> bottle<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.520> like<00:02:05.729> better

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
buying the bottle that you like better

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.139 
buying the bottle that you like better
than<00:02:06.570> buying<00:02:06.869> all<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.469> four<00:02:08.429> small<00:02:08.700> bottles

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
than buying all the four small bottles

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.339 
than buying all the four small bottles
because<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.539> might<00:02:09.690> not<00:02:09.869> like<00:02:10.080> daughter

twenty dollars you can't go wrong with

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.880 
twenty dollars you can't go wrong with
that<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.580> plus<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.660> balls<00:02:54.870> are<00:02:55.140> small

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
actually they're not big show you how

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.310 
actually they're not big show you how
big<00:02:59.280> they<00:02:59.460> are<00:02:59.490> so<00:03:00.480> it's<00:03:00.660> really<00:03:00.810> small<00:03:01.110> it's

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
big they are so it's really small it's

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.310

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
not so big at all I don't think putting

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.350 
not so big at all I don't think putting
a<00:03:04.650> spray<00:03:05.070> cap<00:03:05.340> on<00:03:05.550> it<00:03:05.700> would<00:03:05.880> be<00:03:05.910> worth<00:03:06.210> it

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
a spray cap on it would be worth it

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.440 
a spray cap on it would be worth it
otherwise<00:03:06.780> it<00:03:06.990> will<00:03:07.080> drive<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.470> cost<00:03:07.680> higher

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
otherwise it will drive the cost higher

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.060 
otherwise it will drive the cost higher
and<00:03:09.450> that's<00:03:09.810> one<00:03:10.080> thing<00:03:10.230> that<00:03:10.290> I<00:03:10.620> don't<00:03:10.680> like
