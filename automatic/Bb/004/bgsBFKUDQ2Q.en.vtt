they were announced but to be honest I

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.190 
which is this one with the Ben Riley
costume<00:00:52.150> because<00:00:52.240> there's<00:00:52.450> a<00:00:52.510> lot<00:00:52.690> more<00:00:52.720> to<00:00:53.170> it

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.540 
costume because there's a lot more to it
I<00:00:53.410> think<00:00:53.620> it<00:00:53.680> has<00:00:53.770> a<00:00:53.830> little<00:00:54.100> bit<00:00:54.190> more<00:00:54.340> new

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
I think it has a little bit more new

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.640 
I think it has a little bit more new
parts<00:00:54.850> than<00:00:55.060> this<00:00:55.210> one<00:00:55.450> over<00:00:55.690> here<00:00:55.720> I<00:00:56.170> do

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 
parts than this one over here I do

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.050 
parts than this one over here I do
appreciate<00:00:56.920> the<00:00:57.250> new<00:00:57.340> scope<00:00:57.610> that<00:00:57.730> they<00:00:57.850> gave

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.060 
appreciate the new scope that they gave

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.150 
appreciate the new scope that they gave
us<00:00:58.240> each<00:00:58.390> of<00:00:58.540> them<00:00:58.660> have<00:00:58.870> the<00:00:59.440> new<00:00:59.590> head<00:00:59.770> sculpt

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
us each of them have the new head sculpt

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.370 
us each of them have the new head sculpt
and<00:01:00.340> I<00:01:00.910> think<00:01:01.180> the<00:01:01.300> hands<00:01:01.570> may<00:01:01.750> be<00:01:01.780> exactly<00:01:02.230> the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
and I think the hands may be exactly the

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.200 
and I think the hands may be exactly the
same<00:01:02.410> as<00:01:02.560> anacortes<00:01:03.070> own<00:01:03.250> and<00:01:03.579> some<00:01:04.059> of<00:01:04.119> the

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
same as anacortes own and some of the

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.420 
same as anacortes own and some of the
articulation<00:01:04.750> was<00:01:04.869> changed<00:01:05.229> again<00:01:05.350> from<00:01:06.280> the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
articulation was changed again from the

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.679 
articulation was changed again from the
prototype<00:01:06.790> pictures<00:01:07.119> they<00:01:07.299> were<00:01:07.390> supposed<00:01:07.630> to

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:07.689 
prototype pictures they were supposed to

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:09.600 
prototype pictures they were supposed to
have<00:01:07.780> em<00:01:07.930> waist<00:01:08.799> articulation<00:01:09.369> but<00:01:09.520> they

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
have em waist articulation but they

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.580 
have em waist articulation but they
don't<00:01:09.880> so<00:01:10.869> I'm<00:01:10.930> going<00:01:11.079> to<00:01:11.110> go<00:01:11.229> over<00:01:11.259> the<00:01:11.439> review

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
don't so I'm going to go over the review

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.350 
don't so I'm going to go over the review
might<00:01:11.890> be<00:01:11.979> a<00:01:12.009> little<00:01:12.159> bit<00:01:12.340> too<00:01:12.430> quick<00:01:12.729> because

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
might be a little bit too quick because

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.330 
might be a little bit too quick because
there<00:01:13.509> are<00:01:13.600> both<00:01:13.780> the<00:01:13.960> exact<00:01:14.259> same<00:01:14.470> figure<00:01:14.860> so

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
there are both the exact same figure so

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.469 
there are both the exact same figure so
we're<00:01:15.490> starting<00:01:15.729> off<00:01:15.820> with<00:01:16.000> the<00:01:16.180> ultimate

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
we're starting off with the ultimate

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.420 
we're starting off with the ultimate
spider<00:01:16.780> woman<00:01:17.110> I<00:01:17.290> think<00:01:17.799> no<00:01:17.950> doubt<00:01:18.159> the<00:01:18.310> best

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
spider woman I think no doubt the best

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.770 
spider woman I think no doubt the best
part<00:01:18.670> about<00:01:18.700> this<00:01:18.850> figure<00:01:19.180> is<00:01:19.329> the<00:01:19.570> head

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
part about this figure is the head

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.899 
part about this figure is the head
sculpt<00:01:20.229> besides<00:01:20.590> having<00:01:20.979> these<00:01:21.100> outlines<00:01:21.580> of

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
sculpt besides having these outlines of

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.060 
sculpt besides having these outlines of
a<00:01:22.030> really<00:01:22.300> cool<00:01:22.479> eyes<00:01:22.659> around<00:01:23.080> with<00:01:23.620> President

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
a really cool eyes around with President

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.770 
a really cool eyes around with President
white<00:01:24.190> between<00:01:24.580> them<00:01:24.729> is<00:01:24.850> impressions<00:01:25.540> of<00:01:25.630> her

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
white between them is impressions of her

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.690 
white between them is impressions of her
mouth<00:01:25.930> and<00:01:26.170> a<00:01:26.200> nose<00:01:26.229> in<00:01:26.560> between<00:01:26.650> the<00:01:27.070> mask<00:01:27.310> I

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
mouth and a nose in between the mask I

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.250 
mouth and a nose in between the mask I
think<00:01:28.270> it<00:01:28.330> looks<00:01:28.479> really<00:01:28.540> cool<00:01:28.900> and<00:01:28.930> kind<00:01:29.229> of

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
think it looks really cool and kind of

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.110 
think it looks really cool and kind of
unique<00:01:29.530> because<00:01:29.740> we<00:01:30.010> regularly<00:01:30.370> do<00:01:30.670> not<00:01:30.880> see

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 
unique because we regularly do not see

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.120 
unique because we regularly do not see
that<00:01:31.299> on<00:01:31.450> mass<00:01:31.659> heroes<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:32.380> actually<00:01:32.950> pick<00:01:33.100> a

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
that on mass heroes and actually pick a

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.880 
that on mass heroes and actually pick a
form<00:01:33.460> and<00:01:33.880> then<00:01:34.479> the<00:01:34.600> other<00:01:34.630> part<00:01:35.110> is<00:01:35.320> her<00:01:35.560> hair

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
form and then the other part is her hair

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.620

which<00:01:36.520> I<00:01:36.640> google<00:01:36.970> search<00:01:37.150> and<00:01:37.299> most<00:01:37.479> of<00:01:37.570> the

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
which I google search and most of the

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
mix is coming to series where it kind of

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.050 
mix is coming to series where it kind of
just<00:03:29.350> um<00:03:29.560> look<00:03:30.160> at<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.400> White<00:03:30.520> was<00:03:30.640> fading<00:03:30.970> and

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
just um look at the White was fading and

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.090 
just um look at the White was fading and
it<00:03:31.150> just<00:03:31.300> turned<00:03:31.420> into<00:03:31.540> a<00:03:31.690> pink<00:03:31.990> he'll<00:03:32.800> going

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
it just turned into a pink he'll going

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.220 
it just turned into a pink he'll going
across<00:03:33.340> and<00:03:33.760> then<00:03:34.270> we<00:03:34.360> get<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:34.540> traditional

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
across and then we get the traditional

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.540 
across and then we get the traditional
spidering<00:03:35.380> looking<00:03:35.800> master<00:03:36.130> cross<00:03:36.370> so<00:03:36.490> I

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
spidering looking master cross so I

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.500 
spidering looking master cross so I
don't<00:03:36.700> know<00:03:36.760> if<00:03:36.790> you<00:03:36.880> can<00:03:37.000> use<00:03:37.150> this<00:03:37.270> for<00:03:37.450> a

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
don't know if you can use this for a

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.940 
don't know if you can use this for a
customer<00:03:37.900> or<00:03:37.930> not<00:03:38.050> it<00:03:38.200> is<00:03:38.230> just<00:03:38.530> a<00:03:38.590> ball<00:03:38.800> joint

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
customer or not it is just a ball joint

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.010 
customer or not it is just a ball joint
and<00:03:39.160> it's<00:03:39.280> very<00:03:39.490> tiny<00:03:39.790> ball<00:03:40.150> joints<00:03:40.540> actually

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
and it's very tiny ball joints actually

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.230 
and it's very tiny ball joints actually
so<00:03:41.860> yeah<00:03:42.040> and<00:03:42.430> this<00:03:42.610> actually<00:03:42.820> does<00:03:43.030> allow<00:03:43.209> for

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
so yeah and this actually does allow for

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.730 
so yeah and this actually does allow for
a<00:03:43.450> lot<00:03:43.480> more<00:03:43.600> articulation<00:03:44.170> that<00:03:44.410> goes<00:03:44.530> all

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
a lot more articulation that goes all

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:45.840 
a lot more articulation that goes all
the<00:03:44.770> way<00:03:44.980> up<00:03:45.100> like<00:03:45.190> that<00:03:45.490> so<00:03:45.610> that's<00:03:45.670> really

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
the way up like that so that's really

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.090 
the way up like that so that's really
nice<00:03:46.120> and<00:03:46.360> we<00:03:46.780> do<00:03:46.900> get<00:03:47.080> this<00:03:47.230> painted<00:03:47.920> on

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
nice and we do get this painted on

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.740 
nice and we do get this painted on
webbing<00:03:48.640> in<00:03:48.790> between<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:49.240> hinges<00:03:49.570> which

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
webbing in between the hinges which

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.880 
webbing in between the hinges which
actually<00:03:49.930> does<00:03:50.200> make<00:03:50.230> a<00:03:50.380> little<00:03:50.680> bit<00:03:50.800> of<00:03:50.830> a

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
actually does make a little bit of a

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.220 
actually does make a little bit of a
difference<00:03:51.280> makes<00:03:52.270> it<00:03:52.450> like<00:03:52.930> when<00:03:53.050> you<00:03:53.080> move

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
difference makes it like when you move

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.420 
difference makes it like when you move
there<00:03:53.380> at<00:03:53.500> the<00:03:53.590> head<00:03:53.740> all<00:03:53.860> the<00:03:53.890> way<00:03:53.950> up<00:03:54.190> or<00:03:54.400> even

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
there at the head all the way up or even

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.730 
there at the head all the way up or even
to<00:03:54.670> the<00:03:54.790> back<00:03:55.030> it<00:03:55.330> makes<00:03:55.990> it<00:03:56.170> like<00:03:56.380> look<00:03:56.650> a

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740 
to the back it makes it like look a

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.840 
to the back it makes it like look a
little<00:03:56.860> bit<00:03:57.010> more<00:03:57.100> consistent<00:03:57.640> and<00:03:57.730> more

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
little bit more consistent and more

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.430 
little bit more consistent and more
clean<00:03:58.150> I've<00:03:58.360> rather<00:03:58.570> than<00:03:58.720> it<00:03:58.840> just<00:03:58.870> stopping

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
clean I've rather than it just stopping

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.650 
clean I've rather than it just stopping
into<00:03:59.590> red<00:03:59.800> plastic<00:04:00.190> what<00:04:01.030> you<00:04:01.120> do<00:04:01.239> like<00:04:01.420> a<00:04:01.450> lot

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
into red plastic what you do like a lot

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.840 
into red plastic what you do like a lot
maybe<00:04:02.320> get<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:02.620> Ben<00:04:02.890> Reilly<00:04:03.220> constant<00:04:03.700> going

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
maybe get the Ben Reilly constant going

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.600 
maybe get the Ben Reilly constant going
across<00:04:04.150> her<00:04:04.420> looks<00:04:04.690> really<00:04:04.989> cool<00:04:05.400> yeah<00:04:06.400> really

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
across her looks really cool yeah really

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.460 
across her looks really cool yeah really
unique<00:04:07.000> I<00:04:07.300> kind<00:04:07.810> of<00:04:07.840> would<00:04:07.959> like<00:04:08.020> for<00:04:08.320> them<00:04:08.350> to

unique I kind of would like for them to

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.900 
unique I kind of would like for them to

not too big of a fan of the mold that
they<00:04:11.680> first<00:04:12.160> used<00:04:12.489> on<00:04:12.760> the<00:04:12.940> on<00:04:13.180> the<00:04:13.209> figure

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
and it comes to a point and then we get

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.010
