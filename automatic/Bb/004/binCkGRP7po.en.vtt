00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.870

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.570

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.809
 Facebook 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.950
 so I thought it was nice to me I you 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.229
 present how does it go if you 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.440
 do not know so firstly it takes 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.899
 you go into the solo mode you go 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.270
 go in you go do start after 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:14.350
 I believe that these games you go in 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.119
 activity or at pkoi you are replay 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.649
 the missions you do you replay the 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.670
 mission prologue you do the mission 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:25.800
 actually just the beginning of the mission 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.800
 you're it 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.870
 in fact 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.310
 to fast the invitation of a people to 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:41.890
 a part you will join his 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:42.870
 part like this and then it's going to make a 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.510
 stutter 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:50.620
 like what will there be the mark of de 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.120
 the rohff uden on the gta map at 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.430
 less there I hope it's normal I was 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.480
 already I was already in departure I had 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.920
 my first appearances last 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:02.260
 position where it would have fucked me would say that in 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.770
 but here it is here so you will be 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.430
 in the city 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.750
 you have to go back to the city 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.580
 wanted to put a point where we take 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.920
 the show the show the cars of 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.690
 saimone said you're going here pretty much 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.680
 to there and that's where the map goes 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.700
 appear you can not miss from 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.700
 way to the gigantic and then you 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.430
 can you walk everywhere in the 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.990
 world solo mode facing columbus 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.680
 was limited since with the mission there 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.240
 you can walk everywhere 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.950
 lower because there are a lot of 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.510
 black holes also for black holes 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.950
 you just want to underneath the 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.600
 map counts in the water but now avoid 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.220
 to get out of the fish it shows when 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.900
 even 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.530
 these black holes the texture are not 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.120
 loaded but it's really nice 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.010
 change a little desert or city 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:54.300
 etc. 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:59.630
 it's nice more like there are ya 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:02.970
 meerdael to say that all these goals 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.800
 well, there are also the cops 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.870
 against I do not know I have not tested if we 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.760
 draws there is I do not know if they come 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.050
 to eat it's called at 911 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.270
 I carbide called the cops I have 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:17.100
 smashed a car I'm amused 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:19.610
 French but you can treat it well 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.060
 delusions it skips a channel well 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.540
 I think so 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.950
 will do it 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.000
 and that's it 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.640
 rockstar is wounded bastards 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.819
 he suffered but we think we wanted 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.819
 enjoy 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.670
 it's Christmas wood in the snow play down 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:37.470
 at the eye 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.940
 I also showed you the south as a 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.630
 sport i think 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.930
 most familiar with in lienne 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.930
 under the ice 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.340
 as cholera between friends can 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.850
 go to the taunt that fucker here is the 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.400
 lienne 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.440
 and well freaked out anyway I hope he 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.030
 there may be a little con this house 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.830
 but now I hope there will be a day 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.040
 an extension we are alienating it would not be 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.380
 wrong 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.820
 it's funny but have done well for 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:10.620
 red dead with zombies so I know 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:14.120
 not to be hungry here I say to myself I'll be 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:17.900
 to have a good laugh here is the little part of fashion 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.900
 the mascot we will say 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.300
 so here I hope these videos will have you 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.190
 more and then have fun in the snow 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.229
 makes snowballs and 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.160
 snow battles ego battles 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:32.300
 it's the same 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:38.410
 you do not slip west car asshole 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:38.410

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.580
