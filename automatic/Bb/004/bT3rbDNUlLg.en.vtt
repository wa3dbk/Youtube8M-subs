did<00:00:00.890> you<00:00:01.010> some<00:00:01.189> operating<00:00:01.550> instructions<00:00:01.790> this

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:02.389 
did you some operating instructions this

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:06.539 
did you some operating instructions this
is<00:00:02.510> a<00:00:02.560> standard<00:00:03.819> h<00:00:04.819> AC<00:00:05.089> mental<00:00:05.900> striking<00:00:06.290> clock

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:06.549 
is a standard h AC mental striking clock

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:09.609 
is a standard h AC mental striking clock
approximately<00:00:07.549> 1920s<00:00:08.149> 30s<00:00:08.299> vintage<00:00:08.809> this

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:09.619 
approximately 1920s 30s vintage this

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:13.329 
approximately 1920s 30s vintage this
thing<00:00:09.860> we<00:00:09.980> need<00:00:10.129> to<00:00:10.249> do<00:00:10.419> is<00:00:11.419> one<00:00:11.989> clock<00:00:12.320> up<00:00:12.499> in

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:13.339 
thing we need to do is one clock up in

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:16.150 
thing we need to do is one clock up in
this<00:00:13.519> example<00:00:13.879> the<00:00:14.379> strike<00:00:15.379> and<00:00:15.799> the<00:00:15.949> time

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
this example the strike and the time

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.439 
this example the strike and the time
both<00:00:16.490> wind<00:00:16.990> clockwise<00:00:18.339> yeah<00:00:19.369> that's<00:00:20.240> these

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:20.449 
both wind clockwise yeah that's these

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:21.909 
both wind clockwise yeah that's these
earlier<00:00:20.810> sorts<00:00:21.109> of<00:00:21.169> clocks<00:00:21.439> this<00:00:21.679> particular

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:21.919 
earlier sorts of clocks this particular

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:24.700 
earlier sorts of clocks this particular
model<00:00:22.279> included<00:00:23.050> don't<00:00:24.050> have<00:00:24.199> any<00:00:24.380> form<00:00:24.619> of

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
model included don't have any form of

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.470 
model included don't have any form of
self-correcting<00:00:25.310> system<00:00:25.339> so<00:00:25.970> you<00:00:26.060> don't<00:00:26.089> ten

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
self-correcting system so you don't ten

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.409 
self-correcting system so you don't ten
hands<00:00:26.749> back<00:00:27.019> or<00:00:27.289> always<00:00:28.009> go<00:00:28.249> forwards<00:00:28.609> anyway

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:29.419 
hands back or always go forwards anyway

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:32.439 
hands back or always go forwards anyway
we<00:00:30.169> need<00:00:30.289> to<00:00:30.609> ascertain<00:00:31.609> they<00:00:32.329> have

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:32.449 
we need to ascertain they have

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.029 
we need to ascertain they have
synchronized<00:00:32.840> our<00:00:33.079> hands<00:00:33.469> to<00:00:33.620> tell<00:00:33.800> us<00:00:33.890> what

00:00:34.029 --> 00:00:34.039 
synchronized our hands to tell us what

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:35.590 
synchronized our hands to tell us what
the<00:00:34.160> strike<00:00:34.399> to<00:00:34.969> tell<00:00:35.120> us<00:00:35.210> sorry<00:00:35.390> what<00:00:35.570> the

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
the strike to tell us sorry what the

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.869 
the strike to tell us sorry what the
mechanism<00:00:36.050> is<00:00:36.110> actually<00:00:36.410> telling<00:00:36.590> us<00:00:36.739> so<00:00:37.640> the

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
mechanism is actually telling us so the

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:39.549 
mechanism is actually telling us so the
way<00:00:38.300> we<00:00:38.449> do<00:00:38.570> that<00:00:38.750> bring<00:00:39.050> it<00:00:39.170> up<00:00:39.260> to<00:00:39.440> the

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
way we do that bring it up to the

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.900 
way we do that bring it up to the
nearest<00:00:39.920> half<00:00:40.129> here<00:00:42.219> see<00:00:43.219> what<00:00:43.370> it<00:00:43.489> does<00:00:43.609> was

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
nearest half here see what it does was

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.450 
nearest half here see what it does was
to<00:00:44.120> struck<00:00:44.420> one<00:00:44.660> well<00:00:45.289> that<00:00:45.440> could<00:00:45.739> be<00:00:45.769> one

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
to struck one well that could be one

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.830 
to struck one well that could be one
o'clock<00:00:46.579> but<00:00:46.969> it<00:00:47.059> could<00:00:47.210> actually<00:00:47.359> be<00:00:47.539> half

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
o'clock but it could actually be half

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.840 
o'clock but it could actually be half
past<00:00:48.079> twelve<00:00:48.500> or<00:00:48.859> it<00:00:48.949> could<00:00:49.070> be<00:00:49.190> half<00:00:49.309> past<00:00:49.579> one

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
past twelve or it could be half past one

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.490 
past twelve or it could be half past one
so<00:00:50.149> it<00:00:50.449> doesn't<00:00:50.719> really<00:00:50.780> tell<00:00:51.050> us<00:00:51.170> an<00:00:51.260> awful

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
so it doesn't really tell us an awful

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.439 
so it doesn't really tell us an awful
lot<00:00:51.590> yet<00:00:51.829> so<00:00:52.160> what<00:00:52.370> we'll<00:00:52.489> do<00:00:52.670> is<00:00:52.820> bring<00:00:53.359> it

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
lot yet so what we'll do is bring it

00:00:53.449 --> 00:01:01.959 
lot yet so what we'll do is bring it
down<00:00:53.570> to<00:00:53.690> the<00:00:53.750> half<00:00:53.870> past<00:01:00.730> okay<00:01:01.730> it's<00:01:01.879> just

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
down to the half past okay it's just

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:03.520 
down to the half past okay it's just
strike<00:01:02.269> three<00:01:02.510> o'clock<00:01:02.780> now<00:01:03.019> let's<00:01:03.199> say<00:01:03.379> the

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
strike three o'clock now let's say the

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.630 
strike three o'clock now let's say the
hands<00:01:03.739> on<00:01:03.859> are<00:01:03.949> pointing<00:01:04.310> to<00:01:04.400> three<00:01:04.550> o'clock

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
hands on are pointing to three o'clock

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.460 
hands on are pointing to three o'clock
so<00:01:05.000> we<00:01:05.120> need<00:01:05.270> to<00:01:05.360> correct<00:01:05.540> that<00:01:05.780> debt<00:01:06.290> issue

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
so we need to correct that debt issue

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.230 
so we need to correct that debt issue
and<00:01:06.740> how<00:01:07.100> that's<00:01:07.310> done<00:01:07.520> is<00:01:07.790> we<00:01:07.910> need<00:01:08.060> to

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
and how that's done is we need to

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.300 
and how that's done is we need to
synchronize<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:09.410> the<00:01:09.620> hand<00:01:09.830> for<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:10.130> half

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
synchronize the the hand for the half

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.790 
synchronize the the hand for the half
past<00:01:10.640> for<00:01:10.940> a<00:01:10.970> start<00:01:11.300> and<00:01:11.540> it's<00:01:12.410> quite<00:01:12.650> simple

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
past for a start and it's quite simple

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.950 
past for a start and it's quite simple
you<00:01:12.980> go<00:01:13.160> advanced<00:01:13.730> through<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:14.120> air<00:01:14.330> right

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
you go advanced through the air right

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.380 
you go advanced through the air right
down<00:01:15.110> to<00:01:15.260> the<00:01:15.320> half<00:01:15.440> past<00:01:16.690> like<00:01:17.690> so<00:01:19.240> so<00:01:20.240> that's

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
down to the half past like so so that's

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.120 
down to the half past like so so that's
now<00:01:20.660> synchronized<00:01:20.990> it's<00:01:21.410> done<00:01:21.560> one<00:01:21.770> and<00:01:22.010> it's

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
now synchronized it's done one and it's

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.340 
now synchronized it's done one and it's
so<00:01:22.250> fast<00:01:22.490> so<00:01:23.210> now<00:01:23.330> we<00:01:23.390> have<00:01:23.630> to<00:01:23.810> see<00:01:24.080> what<00:01:24.230> it

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
so fast so now we have to see what it

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:34.530 
so fast so now we have to see what it
does<00:01:24.530> on<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:25.310> hour

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.050 

okay<00:01:35.540> it's<00:01:35.689> just<00:01:35.780> struck<00:01:36.110> four<00:01:36.409> so<00:01:37.159> the<00:01:37.850> sort

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
okay it's just struck four so the sort

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.359 
okay it's just struck four so the sort
of<00:01:38.090> model<00:01:38.360> of<00:01:38.509> clock<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:39.650> actual<00:01:39.920> hour<00:01:40.070> hand

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
of model of clock the actual hour hand

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.609 
of model of clock the actual hour hand
of<00:01:40.460> friction<00:01:41.090> fit<00:01:41.270> it<00:01:41.420> onto<00:01:41.570> its<00:01:41.780> shaft<00:01:42.080> the

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
of friction fit it onto its shaft the

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.490 
of friction fit it onto its shaft the
reason<00:01:42.950> for<00:01:43.130> that<00:01:43.310> is<00:01:43.490> so<00:01:43.670> we<00:01:43.850> can<00:01:43.970> actually

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
reason for that is so we can actually

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.780 
reason for that is so we can actually
synchronize<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.740> hands<00:01:46.159> to<00:01:46.340> tell<00:01:46.520> us<00:01:46.640> what

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
synchronize the hands to tell us what

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.820 
synchronize the hands to tell us what
the<00:01:46.909> mechanism<00:01:47.330> itself<00:01:47.450> is<00:01:47.750> doing<00:01:48.020> so<00:01:48.649> that's

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
the mechanism itself is doing so that's

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:49.600 
the mechanism itself is doing so that's
now<00:01:48.979> upset

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
now upset

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.520 
now upset
from<00:01:50.030> here<00:01:50.210> on<00:01:50.299> and<00:01:50.479> set<00:01:50.720> the<00:01:50.869> clock<00:01:51.140> to<00:01:51.320> time

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
from here on and set the clock to time

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.969 
from here on and set the clock to time
you<00:01:52.070> wait<00:01:52.670> for<00:01:53.000> it<00:01:53.090> to<00:01:53.119> strike<00:01:53.390> on<00:01:53.750> each<00:01:53.979> each

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
you wait for it to strike on each each

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.130 
you wait for it to strike on each each
half<00:01:55.280> now<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.090> reason<00:01:56.390> that<00:01:56.420> we<00:01:56.570> need<00:01:56.899> to<00:01:57.020> do

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
half now the reason that we need to do

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.570 
half now the reason that we need to do
something<00:01:57.590> like<00:01:57.680> this<00:01:57.830> with<00:01:58.039> the<00:01:58.220> sort<00:01:58.430> of<00:01:58.460> the

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
something like this with the sort of the

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.279 
something like this with the sort of the
model<00:01:58.729> of<00:01:58.880> clock<00:01:59.090> is<00:01:59.390> quite<00:01:59.930> simply<00:02:00.200> the

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
model of clock is quite simply the

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.559 
model of clock is quite simply the
actual<00:02:00.770> striking<00:02:01.759> side<00:02:02.149> of<00:02:02.330> the<00:02:02.390> clock

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:02.569 
actual striking side of the clock

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:04.149 
actual striking side of the clock
there's<00:02:02.810> more<00:02:02.929> physical<00:02:03.350> work<00:02:03.530> than<00:02:03.830> the<00:02:03.920> time

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
there's more physical work than the time

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.370 
there's more physical work than the time
side<00:02:04.429> so<00:02:05.060> if<00:02:05.210> you<00:02:05.300> go<00:02:05.420> away<00:02:05.539> on<00:02:05.929> holiday<00:02:05.960> for

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
side so if you go away on holiday for

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.139 
side so if you go away on holiday for
example<00:02:06.860> and<00:02:06.979> don't<00:02:07.039> stop<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.490> clock<00:02:07.580> the

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
example and don't stop the clock the

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.300 
example and don't stop the clock the
actual<00:02:08.509> time<00:02:08.840> will<00:02:09.050> advance<00:02:09.410> several<00:02:10.069> hours

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
actual time will advance several hours

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.309 
actual time will advance several hours
beyond<00:02:10.789> what<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:11.420> strike<00:02:11.690> will<00:02:11.870> actually<00:02:12.140> do

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
beyond what the strike will actually do

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.650 
beyond what the strike will actually do
putting<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:13.220> actual<00:02:13.550> hands<00:02:13.730> here<00:02:13.940> to<00:02:14.090> sync<00:02:14.330> so

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
putting the actual hands here to sync so

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.210 
putting the actual hands here to sync so
these<00:02:14.989> are<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.260> things<00:02:15.620> you'll<00:02:15.769> need<00:02:15.920> to<00:02:16.069> know

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
these are the things you'll need to know

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.610 
these are the things you'll need to know
when<00:02:16.819> you<00:02:16.910> come<00:02:17.030> back<00:02:17.209> after<00:02:17.420> holiday<00:02:17.870> to<00:02:17.930> see

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
when you come back after holiday to see

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.069 
when you come back after holiday to see
a<00:02:18.650> clock<00:02:18.890> running
