hi I'm Helen Yoos from gardening with
confidence<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:07.799> today<00:00:08.010> we're<00:00:08.189> going<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.370> talk

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.390 
confidence and today we're going to talk
about<00:00:08.580> amending<00:00:09.360> sandy<00:00:09.900> soil<00:00:10.309> using<00:00:11.309> the

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
about amending sandy soil using the

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.400 
about amending sandy soil using the
right<00:00:11.580> mixture<00:00:11.969> of<00:00:12.210> additives<00:00:12.960> we'll<00:00:13.200> take<00:00:13.380> a

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
right mixture of additives we'll take a

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.730 
right mixture of additives we'll take a
subpar<00:00:14.040> harvest<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.849> bumper<00:00:15.389> crop<00:00:15.740> no

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
subpar harvest to a bumper crop no

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.470 
subpar harvest to a bumper crop no
matter<00:00:16.920> what<00:00:17.130> kind<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.400> soil<00:00:17.609> you<00:00:17.850> have<00:00:17.880> the

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
matter what kind of soil you have the

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.210 
matter what kind of soil you have the
first<00:00:18.690> thing<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:18.930> want<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.199> do<00:00:19.350> is<00:00:19.619> do<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.890> soil

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
first thing you want to do is do a soil

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.640 
first thing you want to do is do a soil
test<00:00:20.400> this<00:00:21.390> can<00:00:21.630> either<00:00:21.779> be<00:00:21.960> done<00:00:21.990> with<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.350> home

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
test this can either be done with a home

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.710 
test this can either be done with a home
monitor<00:00:23.250> or<00:00:23.519> it<00:00:23.580> can<00:00:23.699> be<00:00:23.820> sent<00:00:24.090> off<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.330> your

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
monitor or it can be sent off to your

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.620 
monitor or it can be sent off to your
local<00:00:25.050> State<00:00:25.470> Extension<00:00:25.949> agent<00:00:26.730> we<00:00:27.330> need<00:00:27.539> to

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
local State Extension agent we need to

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.019 
local State Extension agent we need to
find<00:00:27.869> out<00:00:28.140> what<00:00:28.439> additives<00:00:28.949> might<00:00:29.279> be<00:00:29.550> missing

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
find out what additives might be missing

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.389 
find out what additives might be missing
or<00:00:30.269> what<00:00:30.929> we<00:00:31.050> might<00:00:31.199> have<00:00:31.439> too<00:00:31.650> much<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:32.160> and

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
or what we might have too much of and

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.340 
or what we might have too much of and
then<00:00:32.520> we<00:00:32.550> can<00:00:32.790> put<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.000> mixture<00:00:33.239> together<00:00:33.600> to

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
then we can put a mixture together to

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.190 
then we can put a mixture together to
make<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.770> soil<00:00:35.040> friable<00:00:35.690> sandy<00:00:36.690> soil<00:00:36.930> has

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
make that soil friable sandy soil has

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.880 
make that soil friable sandy soil has
about<00:00:37.530> 50%<00:00:38.120> sand<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.809> remainder<00:00:40.200> in<00:00:40.590> clay

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
about 50% sand and the remainder in clay

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.130 
about 50% sand and the remainder in clay
and<00:00:41.190> silt<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.329> actually<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> very<00:00:43.050> good

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
and silt this is actually a very good

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.310 
and silt this is actually a very good
kind<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:44.129> soil<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.640> grow<00:00:44.910> in<00:00:45.210> one<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.260> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
kind of soil to grow in one of the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.470 
kind of soil to grow in one of the
problems<00:00:46.770> however<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.760> does<00:00:48.030> drain

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
problems however is that it does drain

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.170 
problems however is that it does drain
quickly<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.379> that's<00:00:50.100> not<00:00:50.340> good<00:00:50.670> for<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.940> plan

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
quickly and that's not good for the plan

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.240 
quickly and that's not good for the plan
unless<00:00:52.140> you're<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> cactus

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
unless you're a cactus

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.760 
unless you're a cactus
so<00:00:53.730> if<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:53.940> add<00:00:54.120> compost<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.469> will<00:00:55.590> also

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
so if you add compost to it it will also

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.880 
so if you add compost to it it will also
add<00:00:56.160> nutrients<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.239> soil<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.960> retain

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
add nutrients to the soil and retain

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.000 
add nutrients to the soil and retain
water<00:00:59.250> so<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.270> plant<00:01:00.539> has<00:01:00.780> more<00:01:01.109> time<00:01:01.410> to

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
water so that the plant has more time to

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.579 
water so that the plant has more time to
absorb<00:01:02.100> we<00:01:02.879> had<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> soil<00:01:03.420> test<00:01:03.750> done<00:01:03.899> on<00:01:04.290> this

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
absorb we had a soil test done on this

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.830 
absorb we had a soil test done on this
soil<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.309> we<00:01:05.489> found<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.060> pH<00:01:06.360> was<00:01:06.570> right
