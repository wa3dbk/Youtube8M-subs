00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
and being green let's say so how can you

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.340 
and being green let's say so how can you
how<00:01:52.509> can<00:01:52.539> you<00:01:52.689> do<00:01:52.810> that

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
how can you do that

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.690 
how can you do that
yeah<00:01:53.920> that's<00:01:54.070> of<00:01:54.220> course<00:01:54.430> it's<00:01:54.610> a

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
yeah that's of course it's a

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.789 
yeah that's of course it's a
contradiction<00:01:55.030> but<00:01:55.930> it's<00:01:56.049> also<00:01:56.229> the<00:01:56.619> fact

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
contradiction but it's also the fact

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.859 
contradiction but it's also the fact
that<00:01:56.950> the<00:01:57.310> new<00:01:57.430> generation<00:01:58.060> of<00:01:58.180> guests<00:01:58.509> really
