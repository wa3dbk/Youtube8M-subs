00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 I made three of the white cross that I want 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.519
 doing is the first color now that I go 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:12.809
 I'll ride the other 400 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.820
 You can move everything here and in here. 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.199
 You can only take this part I can not take 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.270
 This is not to miss the boat. 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.980
 I put it on this side it does not have 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.320
 problem I did not do anything until I thought 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.660
 in place three distilled also goes 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.369
 be somewhat limited if you end up losing yourself 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.890
 I think it's best to do it anyway 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.480
 Let's go the first parish to do the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.410
 that the first person who arrives here has 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.690
 two 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.329
 the other is here and I have to put it together 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.590
 with that your turning the one here he'll come 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.879
 stop here 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.030
 So this green had to be here to 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:46.890
 formal for what I do I'll use 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.950
 This part to turn grandson brings him to 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.840
 there and then I can take Dad 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.180
 Only now you have to leave him like this. 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.160
 to join right here has to come not here 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:01.920
 I can come here too, I always have to 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.480
 keep this part here will get used to it 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.519
 leave this part here then you will see 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.439
 that will stay automatic here 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:13.799
 Orange I'll leave it here already 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:17.040
 other cultural vertical tac and other 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.770
 here then I will join this with this self 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.409
 I have to do this to make it go. 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.790
 join win here side then O 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:27.960
 Turn here, you see I'm using this 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.840
 part back together he practices it back 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.670
 Here and there he is not here yet, right? 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.930
 and here is the same thing when building 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.329
 yellow center reminds 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.540
 I'll leave the two lined up look that 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.780
 I'm using this part of the game and if 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.119
 place of what is already in the right place 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.890
 I saw twice the other side and power 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:52.500
 the other parent and the green is also the 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.560
 Blue is not blue right here I 'm not going 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.009
 leave it upright and this 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.960
 also vertically aligned throws the blue 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.509
 in place of what was already certain lived 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.220
 twice to be able to go back 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.629
 Okay, I did all the beauty centers. 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.580
 you are having trouble seeing another 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.830
 vehicle plus example 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.110
 there is only one partner missing 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.950
 red and white so now 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.930
 I will make 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.740
 so I'll still use this part here 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:27.810
 oh leave the red here look for the other 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:29.820
 red that are here're also have to 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.640
 use that part to spin and then 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.230
 finally I put red but not 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.450
 I know the center has no problem we 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.490
 Let's get going, and here's how it goes. 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.590
 put the red now reminds that the 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.240
 people put blue wrong but did not come 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.370
 for here the result the red rooster is 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.250
 then you put the red in place of the 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.770
 blue find a place where justice that 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.280
 is and back because then you messed up 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:56.010
 optical centers then sex so do not 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.790
 if I go back to those who keep it that way 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.980
 The mess but then I come here and back 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.770
 and then I do it here I always come back 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.050
 Once again, there's a problem, you can already line up. 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.640
 who had neither the cross tongue nor people 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.190
 it's going to work more so do not you see now 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.170
 will have to join the other pairs that the 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.510
 easily so I make two pairs 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.459
 first and put them back there to 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.800
 make it easier to look for parts 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.239
 so for now there is nothing to 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.340
 I really got the one on the left. 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.010
 on the bottom red yellow and I think 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.930
 I used to make it red yellow here. 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.280
 He 's underneath, he 's got this upstairs. 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:36.030
 here I will pick up right 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.130
 I fit in and I come back here 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.900
 What can I do together with little one? 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.910
 advanced hundred 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.430
 We'll go next to another country later. 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.140
 coming back so why when 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.630
 You'll join us here and look here. 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.650
 that what is orange and green is where the 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.720
 orange and green 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:56.040
 here's what I'm going to do 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.840
 I left it down there, huh? 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.580
 This ensures that green has come here in 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:05.070
 Up now they are doing something leads 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:09.840
 The party already did, I'll be back. 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:11.970
 so what do I do and I'll be back there 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.410
 At this time, if you want to enjoy it 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.720
 as he had not yet done 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:20.039
 back also has a yellow and blue here 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.720
 when I come back here to do it 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:25.480
 here I can try to make a line 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:28.060
 blue is here already 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.150
 I oppose that other upon good 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.580
 up in box and back 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:38.050
 Then when I come back I made yellow and 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:40.480
 blue orange and kiss in fact I can 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.240
 do this already with the first two 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:47.080
 good did two are already down here 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.640
 leaves behind we have 30 and we all 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.230
 to start with this one is messy 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.080
 All right then 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:55.480
 Come on, if it's messy, I'll get it. 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.660
 yellow and green low color 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.250
 I'll put up here can Takita 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.390
 fit on top 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:08.530
 shiro front back and back to not 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:10.960
 do nothing in yellow green bar together 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.740
 keep an eye on this piece here that is the 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.750
 that red and blue, right? 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.190
 Unfortunately, here's the plan. 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.660
 defended is already up there and goes 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.970
 fit here when she 's here 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.320
 You make you go, you have no way. 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.690
 put the blue red here because he 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:31.000
 you are here, do not put any other 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:33.610
 I do not know what it is, and I'll come back. 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.100
 Only now I 've been back already in the box. 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.710
 this one was waiting there and 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.050
 here who wants green and red then I 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.060
 I'll fit the green and the red wins. 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.460
 now you have to put it underneath it 's just 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:49.540
 put up there 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:52.120
 bunch and back when I come back downtown 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:55.620
 already leaves the green the red ready and 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.620
 now I've done it all
