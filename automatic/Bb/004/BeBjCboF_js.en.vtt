restaurant we're gonna be revisiting is

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.330 
restaurant we're gonna be revisiting is
right<00:00:36.570> here<00:00:36.960> in<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.290> hub<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.980> Magic

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.170 
right here in the hub in the Magic
Kingdom<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.649> Crystal<00:00:41.190> Palace<00:00:41.219> now

Kingdom and it is the Crystal Palace now
the<00:00:42.239> Crystal<00:00:42.660> Palace<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.200> very<00:00:43.590> interesting

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
the Crystal Palace is a very interesting

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.920 
the Crystal Palace is a very interesting
restaurant<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.850> revisit<00:00:45.360> because<00:00:45.690> there

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
restaurant to revisit because there

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.389 
restaurant to revisit because there
isn't<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.200> whole<00:00:46.440> lot<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.649> information<00:00:47.280> about

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
isn't a whole lot of information about

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.610 
isn't a whole lot of information about
the<00:00:47.610> design<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.149> Crystal<00:00:48.510> Palace

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
the design of the Crystal Palace

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.209 
the design of the Crystal Palace
I've<00:00:49.800> tried<00:00:50.160> looking<00:00:50.370> into<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.480> best

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
I've tried looking into it and the best

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.100 
I've tried looking into it and the best
the<00:00:53.219> best<00:00:53.489> theory<00:00:54.059> I've<00:00:54.090> been<00:00:54.480> able<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.750> see<00:00:54.989> on

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
the best theory I've been able to see on

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.630 
the best theory I've been able to see on
the<00:00:55.140> Internet<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.280> Crystal<00:00:56.610> Palace

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
the Internet is that the Crystal Palace

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.220 
the Internet is that the Crystal Palace
is<00:00:57.120> meant<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.449> act<00:00:57.629> as<00:00:57.899> sort<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.140> a

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
is meant to act as sort of a

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.599 
is meant to act as sort of a
transitional<00:00:58.890> restaurant<00:00:59.460> between

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
transitional restaurant between

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.299 
transitional restaurant between
Adventureland<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.719> Main<00:01:01.020> Street<00:01:01.320> USA<00:01:01.469> with

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
Adventureland and Main Street USA with

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.979 
Adventureland and Main Street USA with
the<00:01:02.430> idea<00:01:02.670> being<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:02.969> it's<00:01:03.270> elegant<00:01:03.719> enough

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
the idea being that it's elegant enough

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.329 
the idea being that it's elegant enough
that<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.260> would<00:01:04.350> sort<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.650> fit<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:04.949> with<00:01:05.100> Main

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
that it would sort of fit in with Main

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.429 
that it would sort of fit in with Main
Street<00:01:05.670> USA<00:01:05.820> because<00:01:06.689> it's<00:01:06.840> got<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.110> sort<00:01:07.350> of

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
Street USA because it's got that sort of

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.649 
Street USA because it's got that sort of
old-school<00:01:07.920> vibe<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.729> but<00:01:09.299> at<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.479> same

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
old-school vibe to it but at the same

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.030 
old-school vibe to it but at the same
time<00:01:09.900> it's<00:01:10.170> got<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.320> very<00:01:10.560> British

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
time it's got a very British

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.250 
time it's got a very British
architecture<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.119> design<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.869> that's

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
architecture and design to it that's

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.630 
architecture and design to it that's
very<00:01:13.320> reminiscent<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:14.130> when<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.400> British

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
very reminiscent of when the British

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.179 
very reminiscent of when the British
Empire<00:01:15.090> sort<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.659> had<00:01:15.840> its<00:01:16.380> roots<00:01:16.710> over<00:01:17.100> in

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
Empire sort of had its roots over in

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.760 
Empire sort of had its roots over in
India<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.420> sort<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.750> would<00:01:18.930> not<00:01:18.990> stand

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
India and so it sort of would not stand

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.830 
India and so it sort of would not stand
out<00:01:20.009> too<00:01:20.310> much<00:01:20.490> from<00:01:20.820> Adventureland<00:01:21.540> now<00:01:21.810> I

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
out too much from Adventureland now I

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.210 
out too much from Adventureland now I
don't<00:01:21.990> know<00:01:22.140> how<00:01:22.229> true<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.710> or<00:01:23.040> if<00:01:23.100> that's

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
don't know how true that is or if that's

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.450 
don't know how true that is or if that's
true<00:01:23.520> at<00:01:23.640> all<00:01:24.590> but<00:01:25.590> it's<00:01:25.830> it's<00:01:26.130> an<00:01:26.280> interesting

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
true at all but it's it's an interesting

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.969 
true at all but it's it's an interesting
theory<00:01:27.060> that's<00:01:27.330> for<00:01:27.540> sure<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.560> when<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.770> was

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
theory that's for sure and when I was

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.530 
theory that's for sure and when I was
thinking<00:01:29.100> about<00:01:29.310> how<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.579> would<00:01:29.729> revisit<00:01:30.390> this

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
thinking about how I would revisit this

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.289 
thinking about how I would revisit this
I<00:01:31.009> initially<00:01:32.009> decided<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.670> know<00:01:32.790> let's<00:01:33.090> go

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
I initially decided you know let's go

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.109 
I initially decided you know let's go

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
revisiting Adventureland is

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.010 
revisiting Adventureland is
seeing<00:02:14.160> this<00:02:14.370> plot<00:02:14.940> of<00:02:15.090> land<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.630> it<00:02:15.720> is<00:02:15.810> now

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
seeing this plot of land and it is now

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.480 
seeing this plot of land and it is now
going<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.319> become<00:02:16.500> an<00:02:16.860> extension<00:02:17.430> of

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
going to become an extension of

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.370 
going to become an extension of
Adventureland<00:02:18.120> as<00:02:18.330> opposed<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.750> an<00:02:18.900> extension

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
Adventureland as opposed to an extension

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.140 
Adventureland as opposed to an extension
of<00:02:19.470> Main<00:02:19.620> Street<00:02:19.920> USA<00:02:20.069> and<00:02:20.760> we're<00:02:21.030> gonna

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
of Main Street USA and we're gonna

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.750 
of Main Street USA and we're gonna
revisit<00:02:21.360> it<00:02:21.720> in<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.870> very<00:02:22.130> interesting<00:02:23.130> way<00:02:23.520> and

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
revisit it in a very interesting way and

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.240 
revisit it in a very interesting way and
I<00:02:24.030> say<00:02:24.300> interesting<00:02:24.870> because<00:02:25.050> it's<00:02:26.010> not

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
I say interesting because it's not

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.670 
I say interesting because it's not
probably<00:02:26.760> very<00:02:27.150> accurate<00:02:27.840> it's<00:02:28.020> really<00:02:28.470> more

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
probably very accurate it's really more

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.250 
probably very accurate it's really more
based<00:02:28.950> on<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.550> think<00:02:30.000> a<00:02:30.209> couple<00:02:30.630> of<00:02:30.810> connections

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
based on I think a couple of connections

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.770 
based on I think a couple of connections
between<00:02:31.650> films<00:02:32.490> and<00:02:32.700> misconceptions<00:02:33.510> maybe

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
between films and misconceptions maybe

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.470 
between films and misconceptions maybe
from<00:02:34.110> me<00:02:34.260> growing<00:02:34.560> up<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:36.060> have<00:02:36.240> just

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
from me growing up and that have just

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.260 
from me growing up and that have just
sort<00:02:36.660> of<00:02:36.750> grown<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.320> evolved<00:02:37.890> but<00:02:38.880> here's<00:02:39.120> my

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
sort of grown and evolved but here's my

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.670 
sort of grown and evolved but here's my
idea<00:02:39.570> let's<00:02:40.260> redesign<00:02:40.620> this<00:02:41.070> to<00:02:41.760> look<00:02:42.090> like

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
idea let's redesign this to look like

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.350 
idea let's redesign this to look like
basically<00:02:43.680> Disney's<00:02:44.280> interpretation<00:02:45.270> of<00:02:45.540> a

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
basically Disney's interpretation of a

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.940 
basically Disney's interpretation of a
very<00:02:48.830> what's<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:49.890> word<00:02:50.100> I'm<00:02:50.220> thinking<00:02:50.250> of

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
very what's the word I'm thinking of

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.380 
very what's the word I'm thinking of
exotic<00:02:52.950> bar<00:02:53.760> slash<00:02:54.269> restaurant<00:02:56.150> similar<00:02:57.150> to

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
exotic bar slash restaurant similar to

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.290 
exotic bar slash restaurant similar to
like<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:58.050> bar<00:02:58.350> from<00:02:58.769> Casablanca<00:02:59.730> right<00:03:00.060> with

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
like the bar from Casablanca right with

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.810 
like the bar from Casablanca right with
Humphrey<00:03:00.720> Bogart<00:03:01.170> famous<00:03:01.560> classic<00:03:02.040> film<00:03:02.310> you

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
Humphrey Bogart famous classic film you

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.280 
Humphrey Bogart famous classic film you
know<00:03:02.910> he's<00:03:03.120> in<00:03:03.269> Casablanca<00:03:03.870> that's<00:03:04.080> in

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
know he's in Casablanca that's in

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.330 
know he's in Casablanca that's in
Morocco<00:03:04.620> so<00:03:04.800> I<00:03:04.980> don't<00:03:05.130> think<00:03:05.250> that

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
Morocco so I don't think that

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.100 
Morocco so I don't think that
necessarily<00:03:05.970> would<00:03:06.630> fit<00:03:06.870> in<00:03:06.989> with

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
necessarily would fit in with

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.440 
necessarily would fit in with
Adventureland<00:03:07.920> but<00:03:08.610> I<00:03:08.640> think<00:03:09.030> it's<00:03:09.150> got<00:03:09.330> that

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
Adventureland but I think it's got that

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.840 
Adventureland but I think it's got that
sort<00:03:09.660> of<00:03:09.780> exotic<00:03:10.350> nature<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:11.010> it<00:03:11.190> that<00:03:11.640> would

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
sort of exotic nature to it that would

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.090 
sort of exotic nature to it that would
really<00:03:12.090> help<00:03:12.450> with<00:03:12.750> Adventureland<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.739> I

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
really help with Adventureland and I

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.740 
really help with Adventureland and I
think<00:03:14.340> it'd<00:03:14.430> be<00:03:14.459> cool<00:03:14.820> because<00:03:15.239> at<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.540> same

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
think it'd be cool because at the same

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.750 
think it'd be cool because at the same
time<00:03:16.019> because<00:03:16.410> you're<00:03:16.709> basing<00:03:17.190> it<00:03:17.280> off<00:03:17.459> of<00:03:17.670> a

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
time because you're basing it off of a

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.270 
time because you're basing it off of a
restaurant<00:03:18.239> from<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:18.450> 1940s<00:03:19.140> it's<00:03:19.860> going<00:03:20.160> to

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
restaurant from the 1940s it's going to

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.160 
restaurant from the 1940s it's going to
just<00:03:20.430> sort<00:03:20.640> of<00:03:20.700> innately<00:03:21.060> have<00:03:21.450> this<00:03:21.630> you<00:03:22.140> know

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
just sort of innately have this you know

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.310 
just sort of innately have this you know
very<00:03:23.100> elegant<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:23.880> nice<00:03:24.180> design<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:25.079> that

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
very elegant and nice design to it that

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.090 
very elegant and nice design to it that
I<00:03:25.350> think<00:03:25.590> people<00:03:25.980> visiting<00:03:26.579> today<00:03:26.760> would

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
I think people visiting today would

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.979 
I think people visiting today would
would<00:03:29.100> it<00:03:29.130> stick<00:03:29.670> out<00:03:29.790> too<00:03:30.150> much<00:03:30.360> from<00:03:30.720> Main

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
would it stick out too much from Main

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.650 
would it stick out too much from Main
Street<00:03:31.019> I<00:03:31.560> guess<00:03:31.829> is<00:03:32.010> what<00:03:32.220> I'm<00:03:32.340> thinking<00:03:32.660> you

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
Street I guess is what I'm thinking you

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.630 
Street I guess is what I'm thinking you
know<00:03:33.750> definitely<00:03:34.140> be<00:03:34.500> it<00:03:35.100> would<00:03:35.250> stick<00:03:35.459> out<00:03:35.579> a

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
know definitely be it would stick out a

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.699 
know definitely be it would stick out a
lot<00:03:35.910> more<00:03:36.090> than<00:03:36.150> this<00:03:36.480> this<00:03:36.930> does<00:03:37.200> that's<00:03:37.440> for

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
lot more than this this does that's for

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.370 
lot more than this this does that's for
sure<00:03:37.890> but<00:03:38.100> I<00:03:38.160> think<00:03:38.540> in<00:03:39.540> general<00:03:39.930> it<00:03:40.260> would

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
sure but I think in general it would

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.080 
sure but I think in general it would
still<00:03:40.590> have<00:03:40.739> a<00:03:40.769> very<00:03:40.980> old-school<00:03:41.459> vibe<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:42.060> it

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
still have a very old-school vibe to it

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.370 
still have a very old-school vibe to it
which<00:03:42.269> is<00:03:42.420> exactly<00:03:42.780> what<00:03:42.959> you<00:03:43.049> kind<00:03:43.200> of<00:03:43.320> want

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
which is exactly what you kind of want

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.780 
which is exactly what you kind of want
out<00:03:43.650> of<00:03:43.709> Main<00:03:43.890> Street<00:03:43.920> it's<00:03:44.370> something<00:03:44.670> that

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
out of Main Street it's something that

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.060 
out of Main Street it's something that
you'd<00:03:44.910> get<00:03:45.060> out<00:03:45.120> of<00:03:45.360> Adventureland<00:03:46.019> right<00:03:46.260> so

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
you'd get out of Adventureland right so

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.910 
you'd get out of Adventureland right so
you<00:03:47.790> know<00:03:47.910> it<00:03:48.180> would<00:03:48.269> be<00:03:48.299> a<00:03:48.660> lot<00:03:48.959> darker<00:03:49.709> I

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
you know it would be a lot darker I

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.710 
you know it would be a lot darker I
guess<00:03:50.280> because<00:03:50.579> there'd<00:03:50.910> be<00:03:51.060> less<00:03:51.269> windows

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
guess because there'd be less windows

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.930 
guess because there'd be less windows
this<00:03:51.900> is<00:03:51.959> a<00:03:52.049> very<00:03:52.430> open<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:53.610> spacious

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
this is a very open and spacious

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.880 
this is a very open and spacious
restaurant<00:03:54.690> and<00:03:54.840> you<00:03:54.900> compare<00:03:55.200> that<00:03:55.230> to<00:03:55.410> sort

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
restaurant and you compare that to sort

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.250 
restaurant and you compare that to sort
of<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.130> place<00:03:56.340> from<00:03:56.489> Casablanca<00:03:57.390> not<00:03:57.780> so<00:03:58.049> much

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
of the place from Casablanca not so much

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.289 
of the place from Casablanca not so much
but<00:03:58.739> it<00:03:58.829> still<00:03:59.070> has<00:03:59.160> a<00:03:59.190> very<00:03:59.280> cool<00:03:59.760> and<00:03:59.940> elegant

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
but it still has a very cool and elegant

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.520 
but it still has a very cool and elegant
design<00:04:00.329> to<00:04:00.870> it<00:04:02.329> you<00:04:03.329> have<00:04:03.360> a<00:04:03.600> piano<00:04:04.049> in<00:04:04.410> there

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
design to it you have a piano in there

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.100 
design to it you have a piano in there
you've<00:04:04.769> got<00:04:04.799> really<00:04:05.519> old<00:04:05.790> timey<00:04:06.180> music<00:04:06.720> you

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
you've got really old timey music you

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.750 
you've got really old timey music you
know<00:04:07.200> it's<00:04:07.380> the<00:04:07.530> sort<00:04:07.769> of<00:04:07.860> restaurant<00:04:08.310> that<00:04:08.730> I

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
know it's the sort of restaurant that I

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.550 
know it's the sort of restaurant that I
think<00:04:09.180> you'd<00:04:09.329> expect<00:04:09.810> in<00:04:09.959> either<00:04:10.109> animal

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
think you'd expect in either animal

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.210 
think you'd expect in either animal
kingdom<00:04:11.070> in<00:04:11.250> some<00:04:11.489> area<00:04:11.880> or<00:04:12.359> in<00:04:13.220> Hollywood

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
kingdom in some area or in Hollywood

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.969 
kingdom in some area or in Hollywood
studios<00:04:14.820> but<00:04:15.510> not<00:04:15.690> here<00:04:16.200> and<00:04:16.410> that's<00:04:16.590> sort<00:04:16.829> of

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
studios but not here and that's sort of

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.979 
studios but not here and that's sort of
why<00:04:17.310> I<00:04:17.340> like<00:04:17.789> the<00:04:17.970> idea<00:04:18.269> of<00:04:18.359> it<00:04:18.510> I<00:04:18.720> like<00:04:18.959> the

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
why I like the idea of it I like the

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.560 
why I like the idea of it I like the
idea<00:04:19.410> of<00:04:19.470> offering<00:04:20.400> something<00:04:20.729> like<00:04:21.060> that<00:04:21.329> in

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
idea of offering something like that in

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.500 
idea of offering something like that in
a<00:04:21.660> park<00:04:21.989> that<00:04:22.500> doesn't<00:04:23.280> have<00:04:23.490> a<00:04:23.789> lot<00:04:24.120> of<00:04:24.150> that

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
a park that doesn't have a lot of that

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.050 
a park that doesn't have a lot of that
to<00:04:24.780> be<00:04:24.930> honest<00:04:25.349> you<00:04:25.830> know<00:04:25.950> I<00:04:25.979> think<00:04:26.220> most<00:04:26.700> of<00:04:26.940> us

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
to be honest you know I think most of us

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.710 
to be honest you know I think most of us
when<00:04:27.300> we<00:04:27.390> think<00:04:27.419> of

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
when we think of

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.480 
when we think of
Disney<00:04:28.020> trip<00:04:28.200> you<00:04:28.380> think<00:04:28.590> of<00:04:28.680> multi<00:04:29.040> days<00:04:29.250> you

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
Disney trip you think of multi days you

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.120 
Disney trip you think of multi days you
think<00:04:29.700> of<00:04:29.820> going<00:04:30.390> to<00:04:30.510> all<00:04:30.660> the<00:04:30.870> parks<00:04:31.200> and<00:04:31.920> so

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
think of going to all the parks and so

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.650 
think of going to all the parks and so
you<00:04:32.220> can<00:04:32.430> get<00:04:32.610> those<00:04:32.760> different<00:04:33.090> experiences

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
you can get those different experiences

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.630 
you can get those different experiences
at<00:04:33.810> different<00:04:34.080> parks<00:04:34.320> but<00:04:34.860> you<00:04:35.280> know<00:04:35.400> for

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
at different parks but you know for

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.070 
at different parks but you know for
somebody<00:04:35.790> who<00:04:36.000> might<00:04:36.120> be<00:04:36.180> visiting<00:04:36.420> for<00:04:36.870> one

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
somebody who might be visiting for one

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.930 
somebody who might be visiting for one
day<00:04:37.290> with<00:04:37.500> their<00:04:37.650> family<00:04:38.100> you<00:04:38.670> know<00:04:38.760> this

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
day with their family you know this

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.220 
day with their family you know this

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
would be a cool I think a special place

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.600 
would be a cool I think a special place
that<00:04:43.260> you<00:04:43.620> can<00:04:43.800> eat<00:04:44.010> that<00:04:44.190> you<00:04:44.310> really

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
that you can eat that you really

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:45.950 
that you can eat that you really
wouldn't<00:04:44.760> get<00:04:44.940> that<00:04:45.030> experience<00:04:45.390> anywhere

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
wouldn't get that experience anywhere

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.620 
wouldn't get that experience anywhere
else<00:04:46.140> in<00:04:46.350> the<00:04:46.410> Magic<00:04:46.740> Kingdom<00:04:47.450> now<00:04:48.450> there

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.180 
else in the Magic Kingdom now there
isn't<00:04:48.750> a<00:04:48.900> whole<00:04:49.080> lot<00:04:49.110> else<00:04:49.470> that<00:04:49.680> you<00:04:49.800> could<00:04:49.920> do

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
isn't a whole lot else that you could do

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.070 
isn't a whole lot else that you could do

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
besides that you know you got the design

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.600 
besides that you know you got the design
of<00:04:52.260> the<00:04:52.320> building<00:04:52.650> you<00:04:52.770> can<00:04:52.920> revisit<00:04:53.250> the

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
of the building you can revisit the

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.630 
of the building you can revisit the
music<00:04:54.030> in<00:04:54.150> the<00:04:54.270> atmosphere<00:04:54.900> the<00:04:55.680> food<00:04:56.010> that's

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
music in the atmosphere the food that's

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.370 
music in the atmosphere the food that's
a<00:04:56.790> tough<00:04:57.060> one<00:04:57.300> I<00:04:57.510> mean<00:04:57.750> if<00:04:57.870> we're<00:04:58.020> going<00:04:58.170> into

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
a tough one I mean if we're going into

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.050 
a tough one I mean if we're going into
Adventureland<00:04:59.160> I<00:04:59.400> think<00:04:59.640> you<00:04:59.730> could<00:04:59.880> get<00:05:00.030> a

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
Adventureland I think you could get a

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.330 
Adventureland I think you could get a
little<00:05:00.270> more<00:05:00.540> exotic<00:05:01.110> with<00:05:01.290> the<00:05:01.320> food<00:05:01.710> but<00:05:02.280> at

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
little more exotic with the food but at

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.680 
little more exotic with the food but at
the<00:05:02.460> same<00:05:02.610> time<00:05:02.820> when<00:05:03.120> you<00:05:03.210> think<00:05:03.390> of<00:05:03.510> Disney

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
the same time when you think of Disney

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.360 
the same time when you think of Disney

their food to begin with they'll usually

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.960 
their food to begin with they'll usually
find<00:05:07.200> the<00:05:07.350> safer<00:05:07.770> of<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:07.950> options<00:05:08.400> because

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
find the safer of the options because

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.400 
find the safer of the options because
we're<00:05:09.120> near<00:05:09.270> tourists<00:05:09.690> you<00:05:10.110> know<00:05:10.200> if<00:05:10.290> you're

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
other than you know Central Florida to

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.060 
other than you know Central Florida to
begin<00:05:17.550> with<00:05:17.940> but<00:05:18.630> I<00:05:18.690> think<00:05:18.930> as<00:05:19.110> a<00:05:19.650> design

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
begin with but I think as a design

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.650 
begin with but I think as a design
choice<00:05:20.310> I<00:05:20.520> think<00:05:20.580> it'd<00:05:20.790> be<00:05:20.820> very<00:05:20.940> interesting

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
choice I think it'd be very interesting

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.600 
choice I think it'd be very interesting
one<00:05:21.840> now<00:05:22.260> the<00:05:22.320> one<00:05:22.590> thing<00:05:22.919> that<00:05:23.130> I<00:05:23.160> could<00:05:23.430> see

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
one now the one thing that I could see

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.060 
one now the one thing that I could see
it<00:05:23.700> would<00:05:23.880> be<00:05:23.940> a<00:05:24.060> drawback<00:05:24.510> would<00:05:24.780> be<00:05:24.930> that<00:05:25.560> by

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
it would be a drawback would be that by

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.490 
it would be a drawback would be that by
being<00:05:26.400> on<00:05:26.640> this<00:05:26.970> side<00:05:27.210> of<00:05:27.240> the<00:05:27.570> water<00:05:27.810> here<00:05:28.260> you

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
being on this side of the water here you

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.830 
being on this side of the water here you
would<00:05:28.860> not<00:05:29.130> transition<00:05:29.910> nearly<00:05:30.330> as<00:05:30.450> smoothly

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
would not transition nearly as smoothly

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.920 
would not transition nearly as smoothly
as<00:05:31.080> this<00:05:31.410> does<00:05:31.880> but<00:05:32.880> you<00:05:33.330> know<00:05:33.419> I<00:05:33.450> think<00:05:33.690> that's

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
as this does but you know I think that's

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.870 
as this does but you know I think that's
the<00:05:34.169> one<00:05:34.380> downside<00:05:34.980> that<00:05:35.040> I<00:05:35.220> would<00:05:35.400> take<00:05:35.580> to

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
the one downside that I would take to

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.159 
the one downside that I would take to
have<00:05:36.030> something<00:05:36.419> different<00:05:36.540> like<00:05:36.810> that<00:05:36.840> I

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
have something different like that I

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.500 
have something different like that I
guess<00:05:37.530> and<00:05:37.770> for<00:05:37.919> me<00:05:38.340> I<00:05:38.370> love<00:05:38.700> the<00:05:38.820> idea<00:05:39.090> because

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
guess and for me I love the idea because

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.870 
guess and for me I love the idea because
I<00:05:39.690> just<00:05:40.020> find<00:05:40.380> eating<00:05:40.950> in<00:05:41.070> the<00:05:41.190> Disney<00:05:41.640> World

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
restaurants they're the ones that do

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.500 
restaurants they're the ones that do
that<00:05:52.380> the<00:05:52.440> most<00:05:52.979> in<00:05:53.400> a<00:05:53.700> place<00:05:53.880> like<00:05:54.000> this<00:05:54.240> you

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
that the most in a place like this you

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.390 
that the most in a place like this you
know<00:05:54.630> very<00:05:54.870> nice<00:05:55.080> fancy<00:05:55.530> place<00:05:55.890> to<00:05:56.040> eat<00:05:56.160> but<00:05:56.310> it

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
know very nice fancy place to eat but it

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.120 
know very nice fancy place to eat but it
doesn't<00:05:56.930> transport<00:05:57.930> me<00:05:58.080> to<00:05:58.110> another<00:05:58.290> time<00:05:58.860> in

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
doesn't transport me to another time in

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.980 
doesn't transport me to another time in
another<00:05:59.220> place<00:05:59.700> the<00:05:59.970> way<00:06:00.060> I<00:06:00.090> think<00:06:00.630> something

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
another place the way I think something

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.900 
another place the way I think something
like<00:06:01.140> a<00:06:01.169> I'm<00:06:01.620> gonna<00:06:01.890> call<00:06:02.070> it<00:06:02.160> the<00:06:02.190> Casablanca

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:02.910 
like a I'm gonna call it the Casablanca

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.240 
like a I'm gonna call it the Casablanca
restaurant<00:06:03.360> although<00:06:03.870> obviously<00:06:04.410> they<00:06:05.010> take

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
restaurant although obviously they take

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.440 
restaurant although obviously they take
their<00:06:05.430> liberties<00:06:05.790> and<00:06:05.940> make<00:06:06.060> it<00:06:06.180> something

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 
their liberties and make it something

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.300 
their liberties and make it something
different<00:06:06.810> and<00:06:07.200> I<00:06:07.410> also<00:06:07.560> think<00:06:07.830> the<00:06:07.979> reason<00:06:08.220> I

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
different and I also think the reason I

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.150 
different and I also think the reason I
thinking<00:06:09.090> of<00:06:09.180> Casablanca<00:06:09.720> is<00:06:10.050> because<00:06:10.530> you've

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 
thinking of Casablanca is because you've

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.460 
thinking of Casablanca is because you've
got<00:06:11.370> the<00:06:11.790> Jungle<00:06:12.210> Cruise<00:06:12.360> right<00:06:12.780> next<00:06:13.200> to<00:06:13.320> us

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
got the Jungle Cruise right next to us

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.560 
got the Jungle Cruise right next to us
which<00:06:13.710> also<00:06:13.950> starred<00:06:14.340> Humphrey<00:06:14.490> Bogart<00:06:15.150> well

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:15.570 
which also starred Humphrey Bogart well

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.210 
which also starred Humphrey Bogart well
the<00:06:16.020> Jungle<00:06:16.350> Cruise<00:06:16.470> and<00:06:16.680> Starr<00:06:16.979> Humphrey

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 
the Jungle Cruise and Starr Humphrey

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.100 
the Jungle Cruise and Starr Humphrey
Bogart<00:06:17.580> let<00:06:17.729> me<00:06:17.820> clarify<00:06:18.030> that<00:06:18.240> the<00:06:18.780> Jungle

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
Bogart let me clarify that the Jungle

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.630 
Bogart let me clarify that the Jungle
Cruise<00:06:19.260> was<00:06:19.680> heavily<00:06:20.040> inspired<00:06:20.280> by<00:06:20.520> the

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:20.640 
Cruise was heavily inspired by the

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.670 
Cruise was heavily inspired by the
African<00:06:21.240> Queen<00:06:21.450> which<00:06:21.690> was<00:06:21.840> a<00:06:21.870> film<00:06:22.290> starring

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
African Queen which was a film starring

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.440 
African Queen which was a film starring
Humphrey<00:06:23.070> Bogart<00:06:23.460> so<00:06:23.820> I<00:06:23.850> think<00:06:23.970> I<00:06:24.210> have<00:06:24.360> that

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.450 
Humphrey Bogart so I think I have that

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:25.580 
Humphrey Bogart so I think I have that
Bogart<00:06:24.870> connection

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590 
Bogart connection

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.920 
Bogart connection
I<00:06:25.620> think<00:06:26.070> Casablanca<00:06:26.850> I<00:06:27.060> just<00:06:27.510> think<00:06:27.840> that

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
I think Casablanca I just think that

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.270 
I think Casablanca I just think that
would<00:06:28.020> be<00:06:28.140> a<00:06:28.200> really<00:06:28.470> cool<00:06:28.740> place<00:06:28.919> to<00:06:29.160> eat

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 
would be a really cool place to eat

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.500 
would be a really cool place to eat
anyway<00:06:29.669> let<00:06:29.850> me<00:06:29.910> know<00:06:30.030> what<00:06:30.180> you<00:06:30.300> think<00:06:30.450> of

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:30.510 
anyway let me know what you think of

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.060 
anyway let me know what you think of
this<00:06:30.570> idea<00:06:30.750> it<00:06:31.020> is<00:06:31.140> definitely<00:06:31.620> one<00:06:31.830> of<00:06:31.860> the

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.070 
this idea it is definitely one of the

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.800 
this idea it is definitely one of the
bigger<00:06:32.340> stretches<00:06:32.940> I've<00:06:33.090> had<00:06:33.330> when<00:06:33.510> it<00:06:33.630> comes

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810 
bigger stretches I've had when it comes
