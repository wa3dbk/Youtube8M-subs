00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 and so here is the object to work 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.700
 Percy to not interfere 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.620
 here we have extra details with their 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:17.340
 quick on clean you remember yes what 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:22.830
 we remove with the del key or 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:25.109
 cross it now we need here 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.930
 do the mysik is also very fast for this 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.539
 we use the point creation tool 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.860
 see point creation mode 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.260
 I click on him and in this case where 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.719
 I did not click will appear. but I need not 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.989
 anywhere exactly on this line 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:46.110
 in order to get to the ready 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:50.550
 line left hand attention now 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:53.579
 hold down the ctrl key and now when i 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.039
 I move there are these numbers 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.300
 by the way will help us measure the right 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.239
 the size 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.600
 cutout but now we just put 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:08.960
 somewhere in order to save again 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:13.439
 time again I remind you how to build lines 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:18.049
 we need a cape from here to here for this 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:21.270
 highlighted in the start point mode 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.970
 Now clamped ktr or to highlight 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:31.829
 second if more than one point clamp 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:34.890
 cocktail or more than one line this 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.909
 the line appeared because i left hand 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.240
 held 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.700
 the button that right clicked on 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.140
 keyboard 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:48.750
 The key with the letter l in English is now about 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:54.600
 need to remove the extra lines turn on 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:57.210
 line mode I lights cut selection 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.600
 check click on the line 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:05.149
 delete click on the line delete this 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:08.239
 moment nothing else i do cheers 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:13.000
 the next operation we need to schedule 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:15.920
 area we will drape 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.310
 limit it to dots this is mandatory 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.750
 condition for starting this one 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.560
 tool called here mode 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.079
 breeding 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.319
 but we ourselves say that this is the mode for 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:31.760
 draperies and since we put dots 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:33.290
 remember the mode of the creation of points included ktr 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.189
 el left hand 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.700
 squeezed and schedule a button where we 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:40.129
 will be 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.920
 my God button where we will 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:49.220
 the beginning of our drapery but suppose 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:51.889
 here and where we will have drapery again 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.769
 just put it somewhere to 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:03:00.010
 show here we set the lines 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:04.069
 o extra put an end i'm sorry 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.470
 bravo so here we have the area we have 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:11.359
 drapery will start right here and 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:22.370
 here will diverge go to 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:25.940
 breeding mode we clicked in mode 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:29.629
 lines on the segment which initially 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.870
 selected and now you need to confirm that 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:36.129
 he's left let's you and I 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.690
 parallel to think first left 1 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:44.569
 useful when we are at the other 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:46.760
 feather glasses did nothing else 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:50.209
 hold nowhere with your left hand not with your right 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.030
 hand is nothing more than a mouse again 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.540
 select the desired segment 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:04:03.169
 Sambo segment to share from point to point 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:04.299
 we press it right now other numbers 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:11.650
 here are two 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:15.260
 this number of arrows is one shift 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:17.840
 look at this segment if I 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.109
 I will write to calculate about I will write on the shit 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.390
 fly a minute sorry I did not allocate 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:28.090
 by the way 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:31.840
 see what happens here the same 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:39.430
 there is a shift if i put here not 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:43.000
 let's say three look here 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:45.460
 will in some cases be useful 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.600
 but now we want to have u drape that 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:52.120
 seen to us in this case here as well to everyone 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:58.120
 don't need any breeding mean 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:05:02.890
 calmly remove this one 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:10.900
 leave 0 here they are now using 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:18.250
 this window is the number of times two two times 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:23.410
 two three times two three 4 goals can be done 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:27.540
 more as you guess right now 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:40.660
 doing 15 that little didn't seem about how 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:46.890
 that is, here it is 15 degrees again 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:49.750
 calculate 10 degrees as much as 4 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:54.010
 the richest will drape here 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:06:00.210
 in fact, all do not forget 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:06:00.210
 press ok and our pattern is ready
