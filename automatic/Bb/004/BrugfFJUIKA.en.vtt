00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
I'm a little bit scared to try this

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.190 
I'm a little bit scared to try this
flavour<00:00:34.060> because<00:00:34.270> it's<00:00:34.480> got<00:00:34.600> raisins<00:00:34.990> in<00:00:35.110> it

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 
flavour because it's got raisins in it

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.340 
flavour because it's got raisins in it
and<00:00:35.410> we<00:00:36.100> keep<00:00:36.280> forgetting<00:00:36.460> that<00:00:36.700> raisins

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
and we keep forgetting that raisins

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.990 
and we keep forgetting that raisins
aren't<00:00:38.350> as<00:00:38.440> gross<00:00:38.770> as<00:00:38.800> they<00:00:39.160> sound<00:00:39.430> they<00:00:39.790> could

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
aren't as gross as they sound they could

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.460 
aren't as gross as they sound they could
be<00:00:40.120> quite<00:00:40.630> wonderful<00:00:41.110> so<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:44.110> could<00:00:44.320> be

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
be quite wonderful so this could be

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.850 
be quite wonderful so this could be
great

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
great

00:00:44.860 --> 00:01:00.010 
great

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:15.660

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.560
