this<00:01:21.740> case<00:01:21.979> we're<00:01:22.189> going<00:01:22.280> to<00:01:22.340> use<00:01:22.399> our

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
this case we're going to use our

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.600 
this case we're going to use our
high-tech<00:01:23.560> hard<00:01:24.560> drive<00:01:24.770> and<00:01:24.950> I'll<00:01:25.369> show<00:01:25.549> you

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
high-tech hard drive and I'll show you

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.030 
high-tech hard drive and I'll show you
why<00:01:25.850> it's<00:01:26.000> high-tech<00:01:26.149> after<00:01:26.930> a<00:01:26.960> while<00:01:27.170> so<00:01:27.860> it's

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
why it's high-tech after a while so it's

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.260 
why it's high-tech after a while so it's
going<00:01:28.130> to<00:01:28.189> confirm<00:01:28.579> the<00:01:28.640> backup<00:01:29.060> your

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
going to confirm the backup your

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.149 
going to confirm the backup your
settings<00:01:29.630> these<00:01:30.170> are<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:30.500> two<00:01:30.619> partitions

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
settings these are the two partitions

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:32.620 
settings these are the two partitions
we're<00:01:31.340> gonna<00:01:31.460> backup<00:01:31.969> or<00:01:32.210> the<00:01:32.390> drives

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
we're gonna backup or the drives

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.719 
we're gonna backup or the drives
actually<00:01:33.079> it's<00:01:33.770> going<00:01:33.950> to<00:01:34.009> say<00:01:34.159> Windows<00:01:34.579> we

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
actually it's going to say Windows we

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.700 
actually it's going to say Windows we
save<00:01:34.909> in<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.119> backup

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.750 

so<00:01:38.710> it's<00:01:38.860> repaired<00:01:39.220> to<00:01:39.340> create<00:01:39.520> a<00:01:39.550> backup<00:01:41.760> so

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
so it's repaired to create a backup so

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:49.980 
so it's repaired to create a backup so
here's<00:01:43.270> my<00:01:43.480> high-tech<00:01:44.250> hard<00:01:45.250> drive

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.520 

so<00:01:50.560> let's<00:01:50.920> fast<00:01:51.250> forward<00:01:52.229> when<00:01:53.229> you're<00:01:53.320> done

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
so let's fast forward when you're done

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.350 
so let's fast forward when you're done
creating<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.310> image<00:01:54.549> it's<00:01:54.760> going<00:01:54.880> to<00:01:54.940> ask<00:01:55.180> you

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
creating the image it's going to ask you

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.810 
creating the image it's going to ask you
do<00:01:55.479> you<00:01:55.540> want<00:01:55.570> to<00:01:55.750> create<00:01:55.960> a<00:01:56.049> restored<00:01:56.979> DVD

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
do you want to create a restored DVD

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.210 
do you want to create a restored DVD
you're<00:01:58.360> going<00:01:58.540> to<00:01:58.600> say<00:01:58.840> select<00:01:59.440> create<00:01:59.920> disc

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
you're going to say select create disc

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.580 
you're going to say select create disc
in<00:02:00.400> my<00:02:00.850> case<00:02:01.090> I<00:02:01.420> already<00:02:01.720> created<00:02:01.930> one<00:02:02.140> so<00:02:02.440> I'm

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
in my case I already created one so I'm

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.380 
in my case I already created one so I'm
just<00:02:02.830> going<00:02:02.979> to<00:02:03.040> hit<00:02:03.130> cancel<00:02:03.340> and<00:02:03.759> it's<00:02:04.270> going

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
just going to hit cancel and it's going

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.270 
just going to hit cancel and it's going
to<00:02:04.479> say<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:05.020> backup<00:02:05.409> completed<00:02:05.890> successfully

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
to say the backup completed successfully

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.229 
to say the backup completed successfully
so<00:02:06.909> you<00:02:06.970> go<00:02:07.119> ahead<00:02:07.240> and<00:02:07.390> close<00:02:07.540> this<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:09.819> shut

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
so you go ahead and close this you shut

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.750 
so you go ahead and close this you shut
down<00:02:10.390> your<00:02:10.569> computer<00:02:10.630> and<00:02:11.310> as<00:02:12.310> you<00:02:12.489> can<00:02:12.580> see<00:02:12.730> I

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
down your computer and as you can see I

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.540 
down your computer and as you can see I
have<00:02:13.060> two<00:02:13.270> partitions<00:02:14.190> because<00:02:15.190> I'm<00:02:15.340> going<00:02:15.459> to

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
have two partitions because I'm going to

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.320 
have two partitions because I'm going to
do<00:02:15.819> a<00:02:15.850> special<00:02:16.300> set<00:02:16.480> up<00:02:16.600> on<00:02:16.780> my<00:02:17.520> campus<00:02:18.520> in<00:02:18.700> my

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
do a special set up on my campus in my

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.150 
do a special set up on my campus in my
school<00:02:19.600> so<00:02:20.319> we're<00:02:20.590> just<00:02:20.620> going<00:02:20.950> to<00:02:21.010> go<00:02:21.100> ahead

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
school so we're just going to go ahead

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.190 
school so we're just going to go ahead
and<00:02:21.340> shut<00:02:21.459> down<00:02:21.940> this<00:02:22.150> computer<00:02:22.570> or<00:02:22.750> master

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
and shut down this computer or master

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.990 
and shut down this computer or master
computer<00:02:23.470> or<00:02:23.890> master<00:02:24.190> image<00:02:24.310> we're<00:02:24.820> going<00:02:24.850> to

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
computer or master image we're going to

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.250 
computer or master image we're going to
plug<00:02:25.150> in<00:02:25.209> another<00:02:25.510> one<00:02:27.239> so<00:02:28.239> we<00:02:28.750> plug<00:02:28.930> in<00:02:29.110> our

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
plug in another one so we plug in our

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.530 
plug in another one so we plug in our
high-tech<00:02:29.670> card<00:02:30.670> trick<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:31.060> hard<00:02:31.269> disk<00:02:31.480> drive

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
high-tech card trick the hard disk drive

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.610 
high-tech card trick the hard disk drive
and<00:02:33.030> we<00:02:34.030> power<00:02:34.330> it<00:02:34.420> on<00:02:34.630> and<00:02:34.870> we're<00:02:35.440> going<00:02:35.530> to

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
and we power it on and we're going to

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.430 
and we power it on and we're going to
boot<00:02:35.800> off<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:38.110> disk<00:02:38.380> we<00:02:38.560> created<00:02:39.070> earlier

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
boot off the the disk we created earlier

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.040 
boot off the the disk we created earlier
so<00:02:41.440> again<00:02:41.769> all<00:02:41.950> these<00:02:42.160> things<00:02:42.519> are<00:02:43.050> already

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
so again all these things are already

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.720 
so again all these things are already
installed<00:02:44.230> in<00:02:44.500> Windows<00:02:44.980> Professional<00:02:45.190> I

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
installed in Windows Professional I

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.100 
installed in Windows Professional I
don't<00:02:45.970> know<00:02:46.030> about<00:02:46.090> a<00:02:46.239> home<00:02:46.750> or<00:02:46.959> other

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
don't know about a home or other

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.050 
don't know about a home or other
additions<00:02:47.680> we're<00:02:48.400> going<00:02:48.550> to<00:02:48.610> boot<00:02:48.730> off<00:02:48.910> the

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
additions we're going to boot off the

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:57.240 
additions we're going to boot off the
DVD<00:02:49.360> and<00:02:49.690> it's<00:02:50.080> going<00:02:50.230> to<00:02:50.290> load<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.590> files

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.030 

so<00:02:57.910> it's<00:02:58.060> kind<00:02:58.210> of<00:02:58.300> shaky<00:02:58.480> because<00:02:58.600> I'm<00:02:58.810> up

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
so it's kind of shaky because I'm up

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.530 
so it's kind of shaky because I'm up
fast-forwarding<00:03:00.040> this<00:03:00.250> so<00:03:01.120> I<00:03:01.150> don't<00:03:01.240> want<00:03:01.420> to

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
fast-forwarding this so I don't want to

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.150 
fast-forwarding this so I don't want to
wade<00:03:01.840> through<00:03:01.870> it<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.560> whole<00:03:02.740> two<00:03:03.130> minutes

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
wade through it the whole two minutes

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.740 
wade through it the whole two minutes
that<00:03:03.610> it<00:03:03.730> takes<00:03:03.910> to<00:03:04.660> load<00:03:04.810> up

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.000 

so<00:03:09.750> after<00:03:09.989> a<00:03:10.019> load<00:03:10.200> you're<00:03:10.470> going<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:10.680> get<00:03:10.830> up

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
so after a load you're going to get up

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.940 
so after a load you're going to get up
make<00:03:11.910> sure<00:03:11.940> you<00:03:12.180> have<00:03:12.330> your<00:03:12.450> hard<00:03:12.930> driver<00:03:13.200> your

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
make sure you have your hard driver your

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.089 
make sure you have your hard driver your
device<00:03:14.730> that<00:03:15.090> you<00:03:15.300> save<00:03:15.720> your<00:03:15.930> image<00:03:16.140> to<00:03:16.170> to

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
device that you save your image to to

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:18.710 
device that you save your image to to
your<00:03:17.250> computer<00:03:17.580> so<00:03:18.209> it's<00:03:18.330> going<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.510> start

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
your computer so it's going to start

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.020 
your computer so it's going to start
searching<00:03:19.200> for<00:03:19.379> windows<00:03:19.709> installations<00:03:23.030> or

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
searching for windows installations or

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.660 
searching for windows installations or
actually<00:03:24.540> windows<00:03:24.870> images<00:03:25.349> that<00:03:25.560> you<00:03:25.709> backed

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
actually windows images that you backed

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:39.870 
actually windows images that you backed
up

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.280 

I<00:03:40.000> should<00:03:40.750> have<00:03:40.840> forwarded<00:03:41.260> this<00:03:41.470> as<00:03:41.740> well

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.300 

but<00:03:44.739> anyway<00:03:45.069> it's<00:03:45.400> already<00:03:45.790> running<00:03:45.940> too

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.570 

okay<00:03:48.970> so<00:03:49.030> there<00:03:49.330> it<00:03:49.420> is<00:03:49.980> stain<00:03:50.980> operating

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
okay so there it is stain operating

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.400 
okay so there it is stain operating

that's what what was found on the actual
computer<00:03:59.020> but<00:03:59.230> we're<00:03:59.350> going<00:03:59.500> to<00:03:59.560> select<00:03:59.830> a

it's a the actual same uh computer type

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.990 
it's a the actual same uh computer type
and<00:04:25.180> everything<00:04:25.450> same<00:04:25.780> model<00:04:26.640> so<00:04:27.640> we're<00:04:27.850> going

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
and everything same model so we're going

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.410 
and everything same model so we're going
to<00:04:28.090> select<00:04:28.480> that

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420

it already found it so if you need to

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.370 
it already found it so if you need to
find<00:04:34.210> it<00:04:34.390> elsewhere<00:04:34.660> you<00:04:34.840> can<00:04:34.900> select<00:04:35.260> an

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
find it elsewhere you can select an

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:45.850 
find it elsewhere you can select an
image<00:04:35.500> from<00:04:35.620> the<00:04:36.220> network<00:04:36.850> or<00:04:37.090> other<00:04:37.390> places

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.250 

so<00:04:46.490> you<00:04:46.640> need<00:04:46.760> to<00:04:46.880> load<00:04:47.390> additional<00:04:47.630> drivers

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
so you need to load additional drivers

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.020 
so you need to load additional drivers
and<00:04:48.500> for<00:04:48.800> advanced<00:04:49.070> I<00:04:49.280> mean<00:04:49.460> I<00:04:49.670> didn't<00:04:49.880> touch

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
and for advanced I mean I didn't touch

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.280 
and for advanced I mean I didn't touch
that<00:04:50.300> so<00:04:51.340> that's<00:04:52.340> what<00:04:52.700> I'm<00:04:52.910> not<00:04:53.720> related<00:04:54.110> so<00:04:54.230> I

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
that so that's what I'm not related so I

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.090 
that so that's what I'm not related so I
just<00:04:54.500> click<00:04:54.650> OK<00:04:54.980> next<00:04:56.140> usually<00:04:57.140> leaving<00:04:57.980> the

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
just click OK next usually leaving the

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.430 
just click OK next usually leaving the
defaults<00:04:58.580> the<00:04:59.480> way<00:04:59.630> they<00:04:59.810> are<00:04:59.930> you<00:05:00.110> should<00:05:00.140> be

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
defaults the way they are you should be

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.780 
defaults the way they are you should be
good<00:05:00.650> so<00:05:01.480> it's<00:05:02.480> picking<00:05:02.660> up<00:05:02.870> the<00:05:03.020> opening<00:05:03.730> at<00:05:04.730> a

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
good so it's picking up the opening at a

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.830 
good so it's picking up the opening at a
few<00:05:04.970> Cal<00:05:05.240> twelve<00:05:05.510> it's<00:05:06.200> going<00:05:06.410> to<00:05:06.470> ask<00:05:06.590> you

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
few Cal twelve it's going to ask you

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.880 
few Cal twelve it's going to ask you
that<00:05:08.840> everything<00:05:09.200> is<00:05:09.260> going<00:05:09.380> to<00:05:09.410> be<00:05:09.530> formatted

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
that everything is going to be formatted

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.760 
that everything is going to be formatted
if<00:05:10.160> you<00:05:10.250> want<00:05:10.400> to<00:05:10.460> proceed<00:05:10.580> you<00:05:11.300> can<00:05:11.560> go<00:05:12.560> back

if you want to proceed you can go back
and<00:05:13.570> retrieve<00:05:14.570> your<00:05:14.780> files<00:05:14.960> so<00:05:15.710> it's<00:05:15.830> going<00:05:15.950> to

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
and retrieve your files so it's going to

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.560 
and retrieve your files so it's going to
take<00:05:16.160> a<00:05:16.190> while<00:05:16.430> to<00:05:16.460> reimage<00:05:17.000> your<00:05:17.210> computer

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
you want to restart your computer now

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.310 
you want to restart your computer now
you<00:05:20.930> can<00:05:21.500> go<00:05:21.710> ahead<00:05:21.770> and<00:05:22.120> click<00:05:23.120> yes<00:05:23.360> or<00:05:23.600> wait

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
for it to do it by itself so yeah once

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.910 
for it to do it by itself so yeah once
it's<00:05:27.170> done<00:05:27.460> it's<00:05:28.460> going<00:05:28.640> to<00:05:28.730> load<00:05:28.910> up<00:05:29.920> exactly

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:30.920 
it's done it's going to load up exactly

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.710 
it's done it's going to load up exactly
the<00:05:31.190> way<00:05:31.430> the<00:05:31.730> other<00:05:31.850> one<00:05:32.000> was<00:05:32.240> it's<00:05:32.510> just

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
the way the other one was it's just

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.000 
the way the other one was it's just
going<00:05:32.840> to<00:05:32.900> make<00:05:33.020> a<00:05:33.080> clunk<00:05:33.440> because<00:05:33.710> it's<00:05:33.890> the

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
going to make a clunk because it's the

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.900 
going to make a clunk because it's the
same<00:05:34.220> image<00:05:34.430> so<00:05:35.270> you're<00:05:35.390> able<00:05:35.480> to<00:05:35.630> login

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
same image so you're able to login

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:45.930 
same image so you're able to login
username<00:05:37.910> and<00:05:38.240> password

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.510 

once<00:05:46.570> it<00:05:46.750> boots<00:05:46.930> up<00:05:47.200> remember<00:05:47.800> we<00:05:47.890> had<00:05:48.040> two

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
once it boots up remember we had two

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.240 
once it boots up remember we had two
different<00:05:49.060> partitions<00:05:49.750> so<00:05:49.930> one<00:05:50.740> is<00:05:50.860> my<00:05:51.010> local

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
different partitions so one is my local

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.270 
different partitions so one is my local
scene

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.100 

and<00:05:55.370> the<00:05:56.030> other<00:05:56.180> one<00:05:56.360> it's<00:05:56.720> going<00:05:56.900> to<00:05:56.960> be<00:05:57.080> a

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
and the other one it's going to be a

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.290 
and the other one it's going to be a
temp<00:05:57.650> folder<00:05:57.830> because<00:05:58.640> we<00:05:58.820> are<00:05:58.970> going<00:05:59.150> to<00:05:59.210> be

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
temp folder because we are going to be

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.340 
temp folder because we are going to be
using<00:05:59.630> deep<00:05:59.840> freeze

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
using deep freeze

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.590 
using deep freeze
I'm<00:06:00.950> going<00:06:01.190> to<00:06:01.250> leave<00:06:01.400> the<00:06:01.550> temp<00:06:02.180> folder<00:06:02.270> the<00:06:02.870> X

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
I'm going to leave the temp folder the X

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.840 
I'm going to leave the temp folder the X
thought<00:06:05.600> out<00:06:05.810> and<00:06:06.280> that's<00:06:07.280> a<00:06:07.400> difference<00:06:07.730> or

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:07.850 
thought out and that's a difference or

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.580 
thought out and that's a difference or
if<00:06:08.030> you're<00:06:08.240> familiar<00:06:08.420> with<00:06:08.660> a<00:06:08.780> deep<00:06:09.140> freeze<00:06:09.380> oh

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590 
if you're familiar with a deep freeze oh

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.790 
if you're familiar with a deep freeze oh
that's<00:06:10.040> what<00:06:10.160> we're<00:06:10.340> using<00:06:11.020> so<00:06:12.020> in<00:06:12.320> this<00:06:12.500> case

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
that's what we're using so in this case

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.190 
that's what we're using so in this case
we<00:06:13.040> have<00:06:13.160> a<00:06:13.190> two<00:06:13.490> hundred<00:06:13.520> and<00:06:13.970> some<00:06:14.660> gig<00:06:14.930> hard

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:15.200 
we have a two hundred and some gig hard

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.110 
we have a two hundred and some gig hard
drive<00:06:15.260> but<00:06:16.160> to<00:06:16.280> make<00:06:16.400> the<00:06:16.520> image<00:06:16.730> smaller<00:06:16.880> I

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
drive but to make the image smaller I

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.620 
drive but to make the image smaller I
went<00:06:17.720> ahead<00:06:17.840> to<00:06:18.260> this<00:06:18.410> management<00:06:18.830> before<00:06:19.220> I

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.630 
went ahead to this management before I

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.740 
went ahead to this management before I
did<00:06:20.630> the<00:06:20.780> image<00:06:21.080> and<00:06:21.370> reduce<00:06:22.370> the<00:06:22.580> file<00:06:23.240> not

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
did the image and reduce the file not

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.530 
did the image and reduce the file not
the<00:06:23.870> files<00:06:24.080> let's<00:06:24.320> put<00:06:24.530> the<00:06:24.710> partition<00:06:25.580> size<00:06:25.820> I

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:26.540 
the files let's put the partition size I

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.200 
the files let's put the partition size I
made<00:06:27.080> it<00:06:27.200> smaller<00:06:27.410> so<00:06:27.710> I<00:06:28.340> wouldn't<00:06:29.090> take<00:06:29.150> that

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210 
made it smaller so I wouldn't take that

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.230 
made it smaller so I wouldn't take that
much<00:06:29.390> time<00:06:29.780> so<00:06:30.020> it's<00:06:30.470> a<00:06:30.620> 29<00:06:31.100> gig<00:06:31.370> partition

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 
much time so it's a 29 gig partition

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.720 
much time so it's a 29 gig partition
where<00:06:32.600> it's<00:06:32.840> 200<00:06:33.830> and<00:06:33.920> some<00:06:34.130> gigs<00:06:34.430> of

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:34.730 
where it's 200 and some gigs of

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.910 
where it's 200 and some gigs of
unallocated<00:06:35.690> space<00:06:36.050> so<00:06:36.500> we<00:06:36.560> don't<00:06:36.710> have<00:06:36.800> to

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:36.920 
unallocated space so we don't have to

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.980 
unallocated space so we don't have to
worry<00:06:37.100> about<00:06:37.160> that<00:06:37.490> partition<00:06:38.030> so<00:06:38.780> that's

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990 
worry about that partition so that's

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.260 
worry about that partition so that's
pretty<00:06:39.230> much<00:06:39.320> it<00:06:39.650> on<00:06:39.770> how<00:06:40.040> you<00:06:40.100> clone<00:06:40.610> your

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.270 
pretty much it on how you clone your

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.630 
pretty much it on how you clone your
computer<00:06:42.080> to<00:06:42.230> a<00:06:42.260> different<00:06:42.620> computer<00:06:42.710> thanks

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:43.640
