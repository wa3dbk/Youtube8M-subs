 always the focus of the effort 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.550
 what this guy has been 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.330
 Licher fell through it is not much different for him 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.310
 the institute form 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.460
 the reason is a win duty 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.460
 she does not care so much about her 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.770
 Pauli back on the net

 the guests had to find another solution 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.330
 if she is not serious enough 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.330

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.800
 the mother opposite 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.800
 this is that someday it will take over Dr 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.350

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.320
 his future home 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.320
 Here the sun finally gives way to South 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.620

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.860
 under these back to Vienna 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.860
 had to save the only one 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.380
 they have not known each other very long 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.100
 for half a year anyway 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.880
 seems to me the power is very much in Yemen 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.480
 So how should I say that everywhere is 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.980

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.470
