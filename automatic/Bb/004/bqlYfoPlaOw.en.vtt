very much but I see a thing that there's

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.880 
very much but I see a thing that there's
my<00:00:38.430> whole<00:00:38.910> word<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.540> do<00:00:39.660> stuff<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.500> thought

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
my whole word to do stuff so I thought

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.709 
my whole word to do stuff so I thought
that<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.579> whole<00:00:41.610> industry<00:00:41.940> needed<00:00:42.300> just<00:00:42.540> they

longboard<00:01:37.259> industry<00:01:37.619> had<00:01:37.829> like<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.189> sort<00:01:38.460> of

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
longboard industry had like this sort of

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.630 
longboard industry had like this sort of
bulky<00:01:39.000> backpacks<00:01:39.479> really<00:01:40.470> had<00:01:40.740> like<00:01:41.310> lots<00:01:41.520> of

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
bulky backpacks really had like lots of

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.240 
bulky backpacks really had like lots of
straps<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.329> it's<00:01:42.720> too<00:01:42.960> flashy<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:43.979> find<00:01:44.159> it

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
straps and it's too flashy and I find it

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.340 
straps and it's too flashy and I find it
cool<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:44.670> we<00:01:44.939> were<00:01:45.060> rethinking<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.899> longboard

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
cool so we were rethinking the longboard

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.670 
cool so we were rethinking the longboard
bag<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.070> seeing<00:01:47.850> how<00:01:48.030> we<00:01:48.090> can<00:01:48.360> just<00:01:48.649> have<00:01:49.649> a

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
bag and seeing how we can just have a

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
bag and seeing how we can just have a
bagless

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
bagless

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.310 
bagless
still<00:01:50.909> cool<00:01:51.240> but<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.630> can<00:01:51.750> also<00:01:51.899> use<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.290> for

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
still cool but you can also use it for

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.990 
still cool but you can also use it for
traveling

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
traveling

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.240 
traveling
with<00:01:53.240> your<00:01:53.390> lumber<00:01:53.660> right<00:01:53.930> so<00:01:54.410> it's<00:01:54.590> like<00:01:54.680> a<00:01:54.800> a

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
with your lumber right so it's like a a

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.450 
with your lumber right so it's like a a
multi-purpose<00:01:56.150> thing<00:01:56.750> so<00:01:57.230> I<00:01:57.530> think<00:01:58.040> the<00:01:58.280> cool

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
multi-purpose thing so I think the cool
