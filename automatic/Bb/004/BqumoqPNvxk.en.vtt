00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:10.500
 powerful apparatus 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.090
 guys here or axel and today he tied us up 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.090
 this is just the event 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.490
 but powerful 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.410
 because first it will talk about zombies of 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.120
 black ops 2 of the green run in map 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.070
 transit mode than a new mode 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.190
 that they put but I won't explain you this way 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.200
 simple or something else a little 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.330
 you can say stupid so I'll explain 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.190
 one thing you really need to know 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.650
 as do the pat punch above all 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.390
 pack up also that that tool 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.309
 that makes you change your weapon 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.980
 making it very cautiously more 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.330
 all this is powerful then 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.800
 here and there flows mata that you will find there 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.379
 in front of a hundred zombies 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.810
 the pack up hans is a bit difficult to 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.890
 do because it is a construction a whole 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:54.180
 more pieces then first if you 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.910
 you have already played this mode 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.070
 sound I suggest you try it 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.809
 to the iso you will have to take the bus mi 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.370
 seems to the third point where you stop and 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.890
 or a little further, however, where 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.540
 there is that kind of village where it is 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.729
 background is a little red you will find yourself 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.990
 in front of a door this here and the door 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.310
 what do you have to do then first of all 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.640
 here it was to show some where I was 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.750
 you have to open this door will cost 750 e 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.270
 it will catapult you you said you will throw where 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.950
 in the place where you need to turn on the 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.930
 generator before turning on the 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.180
 generator you have to be very careful 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.979
 because there will be another door below 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.680
 you had to put a turbine in it 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.180
 After I explain precisely why, and it 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.140
 because you will have to build the generator 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.909
 need to build the generator because to 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.560
 feed the food current 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.509
 current v server has subsequently to 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.540
 open the paca punch room one 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.610
 I put the turbine there and I now 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.710
 which I was doing this here and the room 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.630
 of the generator of the main generator 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.299
 you will find yourself in front of this room 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.070
 this room will be composed there will be one 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.960
 work table that are blue ones and 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.090
 you will have to add three pieces that are 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.460
 precisely what a generator of 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.009
 normal energy and you will go near it 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.880
 you will have to crush square and note 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.470
 to take it 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.600
 you will go to the table from work that 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.980
 this one 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.410
 keep crushed square for 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.730
 the note to assemble it then you have to take 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.340
 another piece that always in this one 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.290
 room that is the lever we say of that 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.450
 will then be used to activate the light 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.310
 this is what this is 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.040
 say a moment to tell you 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.680
 of 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.879
 maybe you know if you need the video if you 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.840
 it served to let him taste me 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.329
 comment that are always nice 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.799
 however you will have to mount it once 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.540
 mounted you will miss the last piece 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.430
 the last piece is not found in this one 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.900
 room but it is not even possible it is not 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.890
 not even to define a piece because it is 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.470
 a hand 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:48.159
 yes if something a little strange though it is 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.870
 around and around around in this in 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.760
 this generator room will be one 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.010
 hand here I tell you immediately that the posts 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.299
 it is not said that these are us 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.030
 we did the edema once 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.040
 friends that I will say goodbye afterwards and there 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.720
 however these rooms have happened 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.689
 they are the ones so maybe if they are not the 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.340
 I'm there around just a moment 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:07.870
 get yourself to find yourself once composed 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.579
 this will be the generator 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.430
 you want enough that you will go near you will keep 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.750
 crushed square and what will happen 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.099
 well obviously I slowed down a 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.200
 moment so you can see for a moment 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.689
 better get up and get active and yes 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.849
 will activate the main generators then 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.739
 not something I was doing 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.430
 but I made a mistake when I entered 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.919
 in the room 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.930
 if I stayed a few seconds more I died 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:29.889
 because precisely while doing all this 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.900
 process 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:33.879
 you will have to be outside of this 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.540
 outside of this room because 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:38.979
 otherwise you will die here is enough 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.930
 along the process 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:42.609
 then I tell you a moment that we 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.280
 there were four of us doing everything 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:47.109
 and it took us a while, but maybe 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.329
 not watching this video 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.919
 no video so you can understand 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.269
 watching this video you can understand 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.229
 something more maybe do it in the minor 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.299
 possible time 

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:58.329
 once done that know a room 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.919
 however this is one of the last ones here 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.569
 stop when you get to the center 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:03.010
 the city center of the city will be there 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.030
 a bank this is the bank with the 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.769
 own safe 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.840
 how to destroy the safe 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.099
 since as you can see it does not ask for a tot 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.139
 of money 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.879
 you will have to throw a grenade e 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:14.680
 on the door so that he will do it 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.930
 burst now I sent the lens 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.669
 this too this action as well 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.280
 that you can see better then I have it 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.320
 burst both open and once 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.449
 entered cine will be one of April there 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.130
 will be another and do the same thing a 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:29.590
 same procedure launched the grenade 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.180
 wait a minute wait for it 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.159
 explode walk that you will need 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.110
 the last room as you see here was 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:36.490
 stuck because he was stuck because he didn't 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.340
 and this we had done before 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.280
 activate the generator in fact after you 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.090
 having put on the tour 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.350
 but I remind you and put it up and turbine it 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.240
 be careful that it doesn't bother you 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.320
 zombies and having attracted activated the 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.000
 current you will have to put one 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.160
 precisely the turbine now all turbine 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.520
 and the turbine you created in the beginning 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.780
 maybe if to make the turbine is 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.520
 very easy you will find the jets in the 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.400
 first room maybe at the end of the video 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.160
 I will also show you how to do it 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.110
 however, once you have arrived, you must 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.870
 finding three objects I didn't have another 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.220
 here it will be for another thing that will be 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.230
 much more special than it is a thing 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.270
 very powerful indeed if this video 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:20.000
 will reach approximately 100 I like in 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.520
 in fact doing 100 I like by tomorrow 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.220
 already understood tomorrow and we'll show you 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.530
 I don't want this this new now 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.650
 tell you nothing but really it is the most thing 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.990
 I believe it has never been discovered 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.790
 on this map then the last three 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.260
 objects to be taken are those of whom I 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:38.600
 as soon as you see you have to go to the 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.419
 table job from the work table and 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.070
 you have to assemble a very simple thing 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:45.200
 once assembled the pack up will come out 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.880
 in fact now I couldn't do it 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.800
 however the pack up too 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.020
 tool today so you can call it that 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.840
 and now I'll show you for a moment that 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.820
 shortly after we return 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.350
 this is where my first weapon will be in 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.720
 this game that I modified with the 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.400
 pat punch guys said this the 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.120
 video is almost finished now maybe you'll see 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.590
 the tutorial 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.030
 however these seem to the people who 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.720
 I wanted to thank them for being killers 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:10.400
 96 world and ectoplasm is gone 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.680
 however during the game the last was 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.240
 andrea sita and then guys said 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.500
 this greeting I feel next 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.150
 video remember to leave a like one 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:21.710
 to comment if he followed the video 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:24.020
 bubble here I am with the tutorial on how 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.160
 make the turbine then here it was as soon as it was 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.120
 just left the game 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.540
 lol 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:33.660
 in series green run of transit of 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:35.880
 transit mode in studying how 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.070
 sorry in the first room you will find 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.750
 of the first objects is this fan 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.430
 this is the event you owe 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.410
 crush square you will put it on 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.030
 work table and you will start a 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.520
 secondly you have to build 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:49.710
 take this band looks like a shovel not 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.570
 a ball of it was quite a no 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.220
 what I respect a plane ball then 

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.900
 oh well which one has killed some zombies and 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.900
 finally you have to take the dummy 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.729
 this mannequin here and once taken 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.919
 you will go to the table from work 

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:04.229
 the mountain network here you will have ready 

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:06.330
 turbine to be used to put must 

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:08.639
 just said that you will need it from 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.590
 for doors or things so guys said 

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:14.060
 this video you finish tell you power shovel 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.060
 you hear us at the next video bubble
