00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
snowblower which I recently purchased

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.980 
snowblower which I recently purchased
and<00:00:10.620> have<00:00:11.429> used<00:00:11.700> here<00:00:12.000> at<00:00:12.090> Michigan<00:00:12.570> I've<00:00:12.809> had

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
and have used here at Michigan I've had

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.440 
and have used here at Michigan I've had
a<00:00:13.019> really<00:00:13.259> great<00:00:13.349> experience<00:00:13.670> with<00:00:14.670> this<00:00:14.880> for

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
a really great experience with this for

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.160 
a really great experience with this for
a<00:00:15.780> number<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.800> reasons<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.730> first<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.600> that

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
a number of reasons the first is that

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.550 
a number of reasons the first is that
this<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.770> very<00:00:19.949> powerful<00:00:20.160> snowblower

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
this is a very powerful snowblower

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.590 
this is a very powerful snowblower
because<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.830> way<00:00:22.949> they've<00:00:23.250> done<00:00:23.910> the

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
because of the way they've done the

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.029 
because of the way they've done the
electrical<00:00:25.050> system<00:00:25.380> including<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.070> 80<00:00:26.820> volt

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
electrical system including the 80 volt

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.359 
electrical system including the 80 volt
battery<00:00:30.260> it's<00:00:31.260> very<00:00:31.500> powerful<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.219> has<00:00:32.340> a

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
battery it's very powerful and it has a

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.040 
battery it's very powerful and it has a
really<00:00:32.640> long<00:00:32.880> snow<00:00:33.390> throw<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:34.250> it'll<00:00:35.250> easily

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
really long snow throw so it'll easily

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.799 
really long snow throw so it'll easily
throw<00:00:37.309> clean<00:00:38.309> snow<00:00:38.489> at<00:00:38.969> least<00:00:39.239> 20<00:00:39.600> feet

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
throw clean snow at least 20 feet

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.389 
throw clean snow at least 20 feet
obviously<00:00:40.079> if<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.500> get<00:00:40.649> more<00:00:40.829> slushy<00:00:41.129> and

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
obviously if you get more slushy and

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.430 
obviously if you get more slushy and
more<00:00:41.579> autumn<00:00:42.329> or<00:00:42.420> icy<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.870> doesn't<00:00:43.110> go<00:00:43.200> quite

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
more autumn or icy it doesn't go quite

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.430 
more autumn or icy it doesn't go quite
as<00:00:43.680> far<00:00:43.879> but<00:00:44.879> it's<00:00:45.000> very<00:00:45.090> powerful<00:00:45.440> secondly

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
as far but it's very powerful secondly

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.970 
as far but it's very powerful secondly
it's<00:00:47.010> very<00:00:47.370> quiet<00:00:48.260> you<00:00:49.260> don't<00:00:49.469> have<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.649> start

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
it's very quiet you don't have to start

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.760 
it's very quiet you don't have to start
any<00:00:50.430> motor<00:00:50.910> or<00:00:51.270> anything<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:52.140> basically<00:00:52.559> push

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
any motor or anything you basically push

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.540 
any motor or anything you basically push
a<00:00:52.800> button<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.460> then<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:55.140> unit<00:00:55.680> itself<00:00:56.039> makes

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
a button and then the unit itself makes

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.299 
a button and then the unit itself makes
a<00:00:56.879> humming<00:00:57.180> noise<00:00:57.360> all<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.500> other<00:00:58.620> noise<00:00:58.800> is

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
a humming noise all the other noise is

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.610 
a humming noise all the other noise is
related<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.629> snow<00:01:00.930> going<00:01:01.320> through<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
related to the snow going through the

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:13.960 
related to the snow going through the
unit<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.010> being<00:01:02.219> blown<00:01:02.579> really<00:01:02.879> far

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.380 

and<00:01:14.970> probably<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.660> third<00:01:17.210> super<00:01:18.210> cool

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
and probably the third super cool

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.600 
and probably the third super cool
feature<00:01:18.600> about<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.320> how<00:01:19.710> convenient<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.430> is

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
feature about it is how convenient it is

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.670 
feature about it is how convenient it is
again<00:01:21.390> there's<00:01:21.570> no<00:01:21.720> start-up<00:01:22.290> there's<00:01:22.530> no<00:01:22.650> oil

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
again there's no start-up there's no oil

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.240 
again there's no start-up there's no oil
there's<00:01:23.250> no<00:01:23.370> gas<00:01:23.670> there's<00:01:24.570> no<00:01:24.720> exhaust<00:01:25.250> it

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
there's no gas there's no exhaust it

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.310 
there's no gas there's no exhaust it
doesn't<00:01:26.580> build<00:01:26.730> up<00:01:26.910> heat<00:01:27.270> along<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.050> chute

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
doesn't build up heat along the chute

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.410 
doesn't build up heat along the chute
and<00:01:28.620> melt<00:01:29.190> the<00:01:29.340> snow<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.760> then<00:01:29.880> clog<00:01:30.210> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
and melt the snow and then clog the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.470 
and melt the snow and then clog the
chute<00:01:30.710> it<00:01:31.710> stays<00:01:32.040> cold<00:01:32.370> there's<00:01:33.090> nothing<00:01:33.390> to

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 
chute it stays cold there's nothing to

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.850 
chute it stays cold there's nothing to
burn<00:01:33.630> yourself<00:01:34.050> on<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.410> there's<00:01:34.530> nothing

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
burn yourself on and there's nothing

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.890 
burn yourself on and there's nothing
that<00:01:34.980> wakes<00:01:35.160> up<00:01:35.340> your<00:01:35.520> neighbors<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.180> it's

that wakes up your neighbors so it's

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.590 
that wakes up your neighbors so it's
really<00:01:37.080> great<00:01:37.290> I've<00:01:37.800> used<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.310> on<00:01:38.460> my<00:01:39.300> driveway

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
really great I've used it on my driveway

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.050 
really great I've used it on my driveway
with<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> light<00:01:40.800> snow<00:01:40.980> meaning<00:01:41.520> like<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> couple

with a light snow meaning like a couple
of<00:01:42.150> inches<00:01:42.950> I've<00:01:43.950> cleared<00:01:44.370> my<00:01:44.730> driveway<00:01:45.030> in

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
of inches I've cleared my driveway in

of inches I've cleared my driveway in
the<00:01:45.300> morning<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.720> like<00:01:45.870> 15<00:01:46.320> minutes

l-shaped and it's pretty wide at the at

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.120 
l-shaped and it's pretty wide at the at
the<00:01:50.730> double<00:01:51.000> garage<00:01:51.150> so<00:01:51.690> and<00:01:52.650> it's<00:01:52.860> able<00:01:53.010> to

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
clear that whole thing the battery will

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.660 
clear that whole thing the battery will
last<00:01:56.330> even<00:01:57.330> in<00:01:57.600> heavy<00:01:57.810> use<00:01:58.220> you<00:01:59.220> know<00:01:59.340> thirty

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
last even in heavy use you know thirty

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.490 
last even in heavy use you know thirty
three<00:01:59.910> five<00:02:00.120> minutes<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:00.960> would<00:02:01.080> lighten

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
three five minutes and it would lighten

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.620 
three five minutes and it would lighten
use<00:02:01.800> probably<00:02:02.220> forty<00:02:02.610> forty<00:02:02.880> five<00:02:02.910> minutes<00:02:03.540> I

use probably forty forty five minutes I

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.050 
use probably forty forty five minutes I
haven't<00:02:04.380> actually<00:02:04.470> timed<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.100> but<00:02:05.280> I'm

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
haven't actually timed it but I'm

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.570 
haven't actually timed it but I'm
surprised<00:02:06.450> at<00:02:06.630> how<00:02:06.720> far<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.110> goes<00:02:07.260> charging<00:02:08.250> is

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
surprised at how far it goes charging is

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.660 
surprised at how far it goes charging is
a<00:02:08.610> breeze<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.270> batteries<00:02:09.869> snaps<00:02:10.290> out<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:10.890> the

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.210 
included adapter the charging unit even
has<00:02:17.760> its<00:02:17.940> own<00:02:18.000> fan<00:02:18.360> so<00:02:19.350> it<00:02:19.470> regulates<00:02:19.950> the

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
has its own fan so it regulates the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.990 
has its own fan so it regulates the
battery<00:02:20.820> charging<00:02:21.500> process<00:02:22.500> very<00:02:22.800> well<00:02:23.040> and

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
battery charging process very well and

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.460 
battery charging process very well and
it<00:02:24.209> really<00:02:24.420> only<00:02:24.570> takes<00:02:24.810> twenty<00:02:25.200> or<00:02:25.290> thirty

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
it really only takes twenty or thirty

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.710 
it really only takes twenty or thirty
minutes<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.950> charge<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.370> up<00:02:26.490> another<00:02:27.390> feature

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
minutes to charge it up another feature

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.320 
minutes to charge it up another feature
that<00:02:28.350> other<00:02:29.010> battery<00:02:29.400> ones<00:02:29.610> don't<00:02:29.850> have<00:02:30.090> are

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
that other battery ones don't have are

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.140 
that other battery ones don't have are
the<00:02:30.480> double<00:02:30.930> LED<00:02:31.140> lights<00:02:31.680> which<00:02:32.100> work<00:02:32.850> really

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
the double LED lights which work really

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.300 
the double LED lights which work really
well<00:02:34.080> they're<00:02:34.350> pretty<00:02:34.530> bright<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:35.100> it's

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
well they're pretty bright and it's

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.530 
well they're pretty bright and it's
actually<00:02:35.610> really<00:02:35.730> nice<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:36.000> have<00:02:36.239> them<00:02:36.360> on

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
actually really nice to have them on

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.470 
actually really nice to have them on
both<00:02:36.750> sides<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.760> up<00:02:38.760> high<00:02:38.970> where<00:02:39.209> they<00:02:39.330> are

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
both sides and up high where they are

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.800 
both sides and up high where they are
because<00:02:39.810> they<00:02:40.650> really<00:02:40.920> illuminate<00:02:41.810> your

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
because they really illuminate your

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.840 
because they really illuminate your
actually<00:02:43.230> your<00:02:43.470> actual<00:02:43.980> work<00:02:44.160> area<00:02:44.520> pretty

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
actually your actual work area pretty

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.780 
actually your actual work area pretty
well<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.840> drawbacks<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.680> unit<00:02:47.010> are

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
well the drawbacks to the unit are

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.810 
well the drawbacks to the unit are
basically<00:02:49.459> related<00:02:50.459> to<00:02:51.050> the<00:02:52.100> components<00:02:53.100> that

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
basically related to the components that

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.360 
basically related to the components that
it's<00:02:54.000> manufactured<00:02:54.540> of<00:02:54.980> really<00:02:55.980> nothing<00:02:56.250> to

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
it's manufactured of really nothing to

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.580 
it's manufactured of really nothing to
do<00:02:56.489> with<00:02:56.640> performance<00:02:57.200> most<00:02:58.200> of<00:02:58.380> it<00:02:58.470> is

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
do with performance most of it is

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.640 
do with performance most of it is
plastic<00:02:58.830> except<00:02:59.550> for<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.820> motor<00:03:00.060> itself<00:03:00.650> even

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
plastic except for the motor itself even

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.560 
plastic except for the motor itself even
the<00:03:01.860> blades<00:03:02.130> are<00:03:02.400> plastic<00:03:02.850> that's<00:03:03.120> different

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
the blades are plastic that's different

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.710 
the blades are plastic that's different
than<00:03:03.900> their<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.650> corded<00:03:05.220> version<00:03:05.610> which<00:03:06.360> I

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
than their a corded version which I

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.199 
than their a corded version which I
believe<00:03:07.260> has<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.880> metal<00:03:08.880> blade<00:03:09.209> as<00:03:09.840> well<00:03:10.140> as

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
believe has a metal blade as well as

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.550 
believe has a metal blade as well as
rubber<00:03:12.209> padding<00:03:12.690> on<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.840> blades<00:03:13.200> which<00:03:13.410> is

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
rubber padding on the blades which is

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.750 
rubber padding on the blades which is
actually<00:03:13.830> kind<00:03:14.010> of<00:03:14.070> nice<00:03:14.220> when<00:03:14.430> you're<00:03:14.580> going

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
actually kind of nice when you're going

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.470 
actually kind of nice when you're going
over<00:03:15.200> pavement<00:03:16.200> with<00:03:16.950> plastic<00:03:17.790> blades<00:03:18.060> they

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
over pavement with plastic blades they

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.449 
over pavement with plastic blades they
work<00:03:18.660> really<00:03:18.840> well<00:03:18.959> and<00:03:19.380> it<00:03:19.500> spins<00:03:19.860> incredibly

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
work really well and it spins incredibly

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.230 
work really well and it spins incredibly
fast<00:03:20.760> as<00:03:21.329> some<00:03:21.570> of<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:21.750> slow-mo

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
fast as some of the slow-mo

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.600 
fast as some of the slow-mo
videos<00:03:22.660> I've<00:03:23.560> shown<00:03:24.300> illustrate<00:03:25.380> but<00:03:26.490> if<00:03:27.490> you

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
videos I've shown illustrate but if you

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.510 
videos I've shown illustrate but if you
have<00:03:27.730> uneven<00:03:28.030> pavement<00:03:28.480> which<00:03:29.350> I<00:03:29.560> do<00:03:29.620> the

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
have uneven pavement which I do the

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.670 
have uneven pavement which I do the
blades<00:03:30.760> will<00:03:30.940> scratch<00:03:31.180> against<00:03:31.690> the<00:03:32.110> uneven

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
blades will scratch against the uneven

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.650 
blades will scratch against the uneven
pavement<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.460> kind<00:03:34.030> of<00:03:34.090> makes<00:03:34.210> a<00:03:34.270> loud<00:03:34.420> noise

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
pavement and kind of makes a loud noise

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.960 
pavement and kind of makes a loud noise
and<00:03:34.990> the<00:03:35.470> other<00:03:35.680> components<00:03:36.340> I<00:03:36.520> actually<00:03:36.670> had

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
and the other components I actually had

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.160 
and the other components I actually had
some<00:03:37.180> difficulty<00:03:37.720> with<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:38.050> battery<00:03:38.530> latch

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
some difficulty with the battery latch

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.220 
some difficulty with the battery latch
not<00:03:41.170> in<00:03:42.120> keeping<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:43.180> battery<00:03:43.330> in<00:03:43.720> but<00:03:44.050> it<00:03:44.140> was

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
not in keeping the battery in but it was

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.770 
not in keeping the battery in but it was
difficult<00:03:44.680> to<00:03:44.740> get<00:03:44.890> it<00:03:45.040> to<00:03:45.160> latch<00:03:45.370> properly<00:03:46.150> or

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
difficult to get it to latch properly or

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.410 
difficult to get it to latch properly or
at<00:03:46.960> least<00:03:47.110> easily<00:03:47.610> on<00:03:48.610> the<00:03:48.760> first<00:03:48.970> unit<00:03:49.210> that<00:03:49.360> I

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
at least easily on the first unit that I

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.240 
at least easily on the first unit that I
had<00:03:49.630> so<00:03:49.930> I<00:03:49.960> actually<00:03:50.200> have<00:03:50.500> a<00:03:50.530> second<00:03:50.920> unit<00:03:51.040> and

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
had so I actually have a second unit and

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.290 
had so I actually have a second unit and
it<00:03:51.400> works<00:03:51.550> it<00:03:52.150> works<00:03:52.270> fine<00:03:52.630> the<00:03:53.820> chute<00:03:56.040> angle

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
it works it works fine the chute angle

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.000 
it works it works fine the chute angle
rod<00:03:58.300> it<00:03:58.630> works<00:03:58.840> well<00:03:59.110> but<00:03:59.470> there's<00:03:59.680> a<00:03:59.740> lot<00:03:59.890> of

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
rod it works well but there's a lot of

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.610 
rod it works well but there's a lot of
play<00:04:00.220> in<00:04:00.520> it<00:04:00.640> and<00:04:00.970> it<00:04:01.570> just<00:04:01.600> kind<00:04:02.380> of<00:04:02.440> fits

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
play in it and it just kind of fits

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.260 
play in it and it just kind of fits
almost<00:04:02.860> loosely<00:04:03.490> inside<00:04:03.910> the<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:05.050> slot<00:04:06.270> and

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
almost loosely inside the the slot and

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.120 
almost loosely inside the the slot and
it's<00:04:07.750> it's<00:04:08.110> got<00:04:08.290> maybe<00:04:08.590> three<00:04:09.160> feet<00:04:09.400> of<00:04:10.050> rod<00:04:11.130> so

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
it's it's got maybe three feet of rod so

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.760 
it's it's got maybe three feet of rod so
it<00:04:12.780> there's<00:04:13.780> quite<00:04:13.930> a<00:04:13.960> bit<00:04:14.110> of<00:04:14.200> play<00:04:14.380> in<00:04:14.410> it

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
it there's quite a bit of play in it

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.680 
it there's quite a bit of play in it
basically<00:04:14.890> but<00:04:15.850> it<00:04:15.940> works<00:04:16.120> fine

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
basically but it works fine

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.039 
basically but it works fine
so<00:04:16.840> basically<00:04:17.530> durability<00:04:18.430> is<00:04:18.520> a<00:04:18.549> question

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
so basically durability is a question

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.110 
so basically durability is a question
don't<00:04:20.049> know<00:04:20.140> how<00:04:20.350> long<00:04:20.590> the<00:04:21.220> plastic

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
don't know how long the plastic

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.300 
don't know how long the plastic
components<00:04:22.570> are<00:04:22.690> going<00:04:23.170> to<00:04:23.230> last<00:04:23.410> so<00:04:23.920> far<00:04:24.190> it's

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
components are going to last so far it's

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.070 
components are going to last so far it's
lasted<00:04:24.670> and<00:04:25.450> done<00:04:26.200> just<00:04:26.470> fine

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.040 

my<00:04:29.289> experience<00:04:29.710> has<00:04:29.860> been<00:04:29.889> very<00:04:30.340> good<00:04:31.050> with

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
my experience has been very good with

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.540 
my experience has been very good with
this<00:04:32.199> blower<00:04:32.470> I've<00:04:32.710> been<00:04:32.889> really<00:04:33.189> surprised
