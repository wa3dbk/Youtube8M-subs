00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
America's Cup history I think there's

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.340 
America's Cup history I think there's
been<00:03:26.550> a<00:03:26.700> tremendous<00:03:26.970> amount<00:03:27.570> of<00:03:27.660> it<00:03:27.840> been

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
been a tremendous amount of it been

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.880 
been a tremendous amount of it been
achieved<00:03:28.709> but<00:03:29.190> we<00:03:29.790> all<00:03:29.940> realize<00:03:30.360> that<00:03:30.890> there's

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
achieved but we all realize that there's

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.920 
achieved but we all realize that there's
a<00:03:32.010> lot<00:03:32.160> more<00:03:32.220> work<00:03:32.580> to<00:03:32.610> do<00:03:32.910> yet<00:03:33.180> and<00:03:33.390> I<00:03:33.570> think

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
a lot more work to do yet and I think

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.120 
a lot more work to do yet and I think
what<00:03:34.080> we're<00:03:34.230> going<00:03:34.350> to<00:03:34.470> see<00:03:34.650> is<00:03:34.830> we're<00:03:35.040> going

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
what we're going to see is we're going

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.360 
what we're going to see is we're going
to<00:03:35.190> see<00:03:35.540> improvements<00:03:36.650> right<00:03:37.650> way<00:03:37.890> through<00:03:38.130> we

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
to see improvements right way through we

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.280 
to see improvements right way through we
are<00:03:38.490> never<00:03:38.730> going<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.120> be<00:03:39.240> content<00:03:39.660> with<00:03:39.959> this
