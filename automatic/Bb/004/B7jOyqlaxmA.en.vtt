00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.490
 although Android comes in handy 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.860
 organized in terms of management and access 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.110
 of applications the reality refers 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.180
 is that in the day to day we become 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.910
 crazy looking for that application that 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.760
 we need quickly between the mass of 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.250
 desktop shortcuts for 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.590
 these kinds of problems were created the 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.989
 application launchers which 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.420
 through shortcuts of all kinds we 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.129
 facilitate having at hand the 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.120
 function switches of our 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:43.610
 mobile or the applications that we use the most 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.800
 today we want to talk about quick in this 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.350
 application launcher is very similar 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.480
 in terms of operation to others that 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.160
 we have already seen that it allows us 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.100
 unfold a floating panel over 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.530
 any screen with just swipe 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.020
 the finger from the edge to the center 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.300
 but what Quickr adds about his 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.960
 rivals is the amount of panels that 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.270
 we can create in concrete 44 panels that 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.460
 we can configure manually with 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.950
 applications or widgets that we want 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.780
 have on hand or simply choose the 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.180
 which brings by default how they are 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.450
 recent applications applications in 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.100
 background contacts etc. 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.530
 wicker are programmed very 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.930
 we just have to create panels 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.790
 give them a name and choose what 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.580
 applications we want them to appear in 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.390
 they really is how to create a 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.970
 folder and fill it with shortcuts 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.700
 of course we can define the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.520
 active touch surface on screen and 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:49.520
 other parameters but as I said it is 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.520
 a great pitcher and very very fast
