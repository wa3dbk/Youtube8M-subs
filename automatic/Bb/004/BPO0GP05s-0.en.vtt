00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 one 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.930
 very good kids today we are in a 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.420
 new channel chapter and in this 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.820
 chapter then the thing is going to be pretty 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.680
 fast is simply a boxing of the 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.660
 new helmets that I have bought 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:36.040
 bought by amazon and they cost me 52 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:38.460
 euros so let's open them to see what 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.460
 such are 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.430
 topics that open the boxes with one hand 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.430
 it's a lot more than it seems 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:53.700
 Well now I come back here it is 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.430
 and we open the box 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:01.460
 - they bought amazon I already said it and 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.460
 they are the game 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.680
 good you know that lately the quality 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.170
 of my mike was pretty pretty dodgy 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.170
 It left a lot to be desired is a micro 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.700
 pretty cheap so I've decided 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.590
 spend a much more professional range 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.619
 and here you see them let's see if we can 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.200
 zoom out a bit so you can see it well 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:31.340
 games with your brawn sound and if gaming 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:35.570
 headset and they are 7.1 have a microphone there 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:38.270
 professional nor closely but the quality 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.940
 of the sound I've tried it but it has a 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.880
 my friend and the sound quality is 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:48.900
 pretty pretty good 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:52.050
 there you can see more in the details your sb 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.750
 and well for 50 euros is nothing 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:59.400
 bad the micro is worth waking up in the helmet 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:02.160
 is worth 82 euros in marketing and 160 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.520
 in the English court so the offer of 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.050
 amazon has been pretty good 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.690
 same as me at the time when he was 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.979
 looking for reviews of these helmets for sure 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.710
 that there are people who have come well 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.010
 to the channel to watch this video not because they are 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.140
 subscribers of the channel but because 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.750
 Well, you are looking for a reality of these 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.459
 helmets in concrete I advance you to the 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.260
 final I'll do a sound test so that 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:31.079
 you see how in the cases with the microphone 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.680
 because it's what I'm looking for videos from 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.840
 reviews 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.720
 I was always looking for what I wanted 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.730
 see was how you hear the microphone and 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.680
 there was no one who did the review of the 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.329
 micro I tried a cd that was 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.400
 trying to get out of the box but 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:49.400
 bored with me there are no ways now 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.400
 available 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:58.130
 Well, as you can see, they are very careful 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.130
 They are very comfortable helmets and very smart 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.090
 have a has as a protector value 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:06.490
 see how good it is not that it is 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.950
 nothing great but it's fine 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.920
 the quality is bestial that of the sound 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.990
 it's recording studio quality that 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.990
 is what some seek depends what 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:21.160
 look for but within the range of 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:23.710
 so relatively professional helmets 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.050
 for problems with games is what 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.750
 the best I've seen is without a doubt the best 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.000
 I've heard and the microphone has 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.930
 noise cancellation with which you hear 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.670
 of fable without causing problems to the 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.080
 Voice quality time has 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.050
 serious and six very well 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.390
 so without further ado what we are going to do is 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.310
 and to make the sound test good 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.860
 kids, this is the quality of the 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.230
 microphone when the quality test 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.870
 maybe it's not the best in the world but 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.270
 Of course, if you see the video that 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.030
 I have recorded before this the lime and the 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.590
 quality difference is bestial in the 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.420
 microphone that I had before that I have 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.060
 now I do not know if you notice but there is a 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.099
 small small static noise background 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.370
 the static noise I think I know where 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.379
 comes why 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.060
 when I connected it for the part 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.500
 front of the computer would be very much 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.930
 more and now that what connected by the 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.699
 back you can hardly hear anything like that 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.169
 that has to be something internal 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:23.540
 computer in addition when I tried these 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:26.000
 same helmets on the computer that I had 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.979
 In Madrid there was no static noise 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.160
 it seems to be a problem he has with 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:33.919
 some cards some base plates or 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.150
 something been reading out there but so 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.120
 seen this microphone is not exclusive 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.250
 but it happens to everyone so good 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.050
 others I suppose not but there is enough 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.449
 microphone to those who pass them so 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.979
 neither is a decisive factor in everything 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:48.080
 case I think the quality is pretty 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:50.330
 good enough to make gameplays in 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.770
 YouTube compared to what I had before 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.500
 this is going to be a joy for those trying 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.330
 the new videos so nothing you already know 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.590
 I leave the link where I bought it in the 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.020
 Video description if you are interested 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.400
 and see you next chapter a 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.030
 greeting everyone leaves you enjoy this one 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.030
 see you later
