00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.280
 so this piece is a small 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.420
 blues progression it's perfect for 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.510
 start to well muscled the little finger the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.160
 little finger because often when we 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.949
 start playing we will use a lot 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.920
 the index major but much less 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.739
 the ring finger and the little finger so there this 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.360
 exercise there it will allow us to 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:04.290
 work well muscled the 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:08.220
 outer part of the hand so we go 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:12.000
 start by placing the index on the 3rd 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.880
 freight sunday of your guitar and on 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.820
 the half serious agreement any time to 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.020
 first strings at the top or 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.020
 last string from the bottom 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.810
 then we will place the pinkie two 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:34.450
 boxes further on we jump from caspar whose 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.450
 three boxes further on the 6th box 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:43.159
 what will give or where we go we go 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:47.869
 start by rubbing the rope with 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:50.869
 the index twice or where we place 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.619
 the little finger we can be that can 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.619
 be typed too 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:02.479
 not complicated we can rub the rope 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.479
 or or 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.680
 so we cool with just the index 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:16.410
 ouh ouh ouh ouh 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:19.209
 and there we go down the index of a rope 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:24.090
 so on the rope from there we stay on the 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.090
 third party or 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.970
 we 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:42.050
 and we go back to 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:46.940
 hou hou hou hou and cooled with the 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:56.110
 little finger on the 6th box when half 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:56.110
 or hulu or hulu or 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:14.790
 so once we've learned that where we 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:53.519
 does the binding off pressing once 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:58.380
 on the index or you or or or or or oh oh 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:04:00.209
 oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.280
 once you understand this 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:07.130
 little mechanism just go down 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.130
 a rope and play the same 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.480
 so there you have almost everything seen so 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:31.460
 progression 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:38.360
 it's going to be twice at the top or learns 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:39.470
 drawing but except that one does that 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:49.210
 time there I 'll do it twice there 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:49.210
 must do it once and come back 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.970
 so that's twice once 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.240
 and so here we go down on the 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:26.410
 second rope from the top and we 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:29.590
 will slip two squares one manages ropes 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.590
 from there 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:51.860
 we 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:57.590
 we can do a little slice ourselves so 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:06:10.370
 we do the same thing we go back to 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:12.229
 second position had a lot that opposite 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:16.340
 it's not very complicated there the end we're going 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:20.570
 see it right after that so we do a 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:22.810
 times up or hulu we do it again 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:27.940
 we 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:33.620
 then we go down 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:36.289
 Well, we go down and we slide where we 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.550
 play one goes up in rule hoisting towards the 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:42.080
 high but staying on the second 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:46.849
 box on the second rope forgiveness and in 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:48.880
 romance or one last time before 

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:48.880
 make 

00:06:53.759 --> 00:07:01.499
 so for that you have to place the ring finger 

00:06:56.769 --> 00:07:04.389
 on the 5th box of the second string 

00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:11.069
 then the middle finger is on the box of the 

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:13.389
 above or as well as the index is next 

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:18.899
 the little finger the little finger will come back 

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:18.899
 on the top box of the rope me g 

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.390
 my 

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:49.570
 comforter and that's it
