00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
the opening went quite funny because I

my<00:00:36.899> arsenal<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:37.410> don't<00:00:37.620> think<00:00:37.800> it's<00:00:37.920> going<00:00:38.010> to

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
my arsenal I don't think it's going to

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.590 
my arsenal I don't think it's going to
stay<00:00:38.250> there<00:00:38.430> very<00:00:38.550> long<00:00:38.700> considering<00:00:39.329> every

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
stay there very long considering every

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.209 
stay there very long considering every
time<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:39.809> play<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.230> get<00:00:40.350> bad<00:00:40.530> positions<00:00:41.010> and

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
time I play it I get bad positions and

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.369 
time I play it I get bad positions and
my<00:00:42.059> friend<00:00:42.270> Josh<00:00:42.480> Vidal<00:00:42.840> claims<00:00:43.230> she's

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
my friend Josh Vidal claims she's

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.180 
my friend Josh Vidal claims she's
refuted<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:45.500> yeah<00:00:46.500> he<00:00:46.680> had<00:00:46.770> never<00:00:46.860> seen

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
refuted it so yeah he had never seen

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.590 
refuted it so yeah he had never seen
this<00:00:47.280> before<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.670> was<00:00:47.850> shocked<00:00:48.090> he<00:00:48.270> would<00:00:48.360> spend

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
this before I was shocked he would spend

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.479 
this before I was shocked he would spend
four<00:00:48.899> minutes<00:00:49.200> after<00:00:49.710> four<00:00:49.920> moves<00:00:50.129> spending

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
four minutes after four moves spending

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.819 
four minutes after four moves spending
20<00:00:50.820> minutes<00:00:51.090> but<00:00:51.420> he<00:00:52.110> actually<00:00:52.260> came<00:00:52.559> up<00:00:52.620> with

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
20 minutes but he actually came up with

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.860 
20 minutes but he actually came up with
some<00:00:52.949> really<00:00:53.100> interesting<00:00:53.399> ideas<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.420> at<00:00:54.690> one

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
some really interesting ideas and at one

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.600 
some really interesting ideas and at one
point<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:55.320> found<00:00:55.770> my<00:00:55.890> position<00:00:56.250> was<00:00:56.370> quite

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
point I found my position was quite

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.599 
point I found my position was quite
undesirable<00:00:57.440> but<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.920> end<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.219> managed<00:00:59.550> to

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
undesirable but in the end I managed to

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.520 
undesirable but in the end I managed to
prove<00:00:59.879> Ali<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.510> think<00:01:00.750> he<00:01:00.870> overlooked<00:01:01.289> some

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
prove Ali I think he overlooked some

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.070 
prove Ali I think he overlooked some
trick<00:01:02.100> tactics<00:01:02.820> think<00:01:03.449> what<00:01:03.600> he<00:01:03.660> overlooked

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
trick tactics think what he overlooked

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.289 
trick tactics think what he overlooked
was<00:01:04.260> after<00:01:04.500> Bishop<00:01:04.680> takes<00:01:04.979> f6<00:01:05.400> work<00:01:05.700> takes<00:01:05.970> f6

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
was after Bishop takes f6 work takes f6

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.359 
was after Bishop takes f6 work takes f6
Queen<00:01:06.600> takes<00:01:06.750> f6<00:01:07.080> Bishop<00:01:07.439> g5<00:01:07.770> there's<00:01:08.040> rookie

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
Queen takes f6 Bishop g5 there's rookie

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.640 
Queen takes f6 Bishop g5 there's rookie
five<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.760> think<00:01:08.790> he<00:01:09.090> missed<00:01:09.270> this<00:01:09.390> move<00:01:09.650> which

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
five I think he missed this move which

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.740 
five I think he missed this move which
pins<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.040> bishop<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.490> king<00:01:11.760> further<00:01:12.540> to

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
pins the bishop to the king further to

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.990 
pins the bishop to the king further to
the<00:01:12.869> Queen<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.740> think<00:01:14.010> black<00:01:14.340> just<00:01:14.670> ends<00:01:14.909> up

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
the Queen and I think black just ends up

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.480 
the Queen and I think black just ends up
ahead<00:01:15.780> material<00:01:16.560> he's<00:01:16.710> already<00:01:16.890> up<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.130> pond<00:01:17.369> in

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
ahead material he's already up a pond in

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.429 
ahead material he's already up a pond in
exchange<00:01:17.939> White<00:01:18.270> has<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.509> play<00:01:18.659> rook<00:01:18.810> g<00:01:19.020> 1<00:01:19.200> i'm

596 and blacks up a healthy pawn and

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.080 
596 and blacks up a healthy pawn and
whites<00:01:25.259> king<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.710> quite<00:01:26.159> unhappy<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:26.850> i<00:01:26.880> think

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
whites king is quite unhappy so i think

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.960 
whites king is quite unhappy so i think
blacks<00:01:27.479> just<00:01:27.659> better<00:01:27.840> than<00:01:28.070> if<00:01:29.070> instead<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.490> of

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
blacks just better than if instead of of

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.760 
blacks just better than if instead of of
60<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.540> play<00:01:30.659> d5<00:01:31.049> i<00:01:31.079> was<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.439> little<00:01:31.590> bit

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
60 and play d5 i was a little bit

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.980 
60 and play d5 i was a little bit
worried<00:01:32.100> because<00:01:32.310> my<00:01:32.850> original<00:01:33.210> plan<00:01:33.390> was<00:01:33.509> g6

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
worried because my original plan was g6

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.170 
worried because my original plan was g6
thought<00:01:34.560> if<00:01:34.680> he<00:01:34.770> plays<00:01:34.950> Queen<00:01:35.220> h6<00:01:35.579> Bishop<00:01:35.880> f8

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
thought if he plays Queen h6 Bishop f8

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.940 
thought if he plays Queen h6 Bishop f8
is<00:01:36.299> good<00:01:36.509> if<00:01:36.689> he<00:01:36.780> plays<00:01:36.960> Quincy<00:01:37.350> for<00:01:37.590> King<00:01:37.799> f

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
is good if he plays Quincy for King f

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.819 
is good if he plays Quincy for King f
king<00:01:38.340> h8<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.759> probably<00:01:39.000> playable<00:01:39.299> but<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:40.049> think

king h8 is probably playable but I think
he<00:01:41.070> probably<00:01:41.250> overlooked<00:01:41.820> how<00:01:41.939> strong<00:01:42.180> rook<00:01:42.360> g

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540
