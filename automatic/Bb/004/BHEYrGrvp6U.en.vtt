00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:09.830
an important part of any machining process is the cutting tool

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.849
which removes unwanted material

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.279
from the blank as chips... In conventional
machining processes

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.390
the tool material is always harder
then the workpiece material

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.289
let's have a look at the parts of cutting tool

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.300
with reference to lathe...

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.439
This part is the shank which is held at the tool post

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.780
This face is the rake face, over which the chip flows

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.320
this is the principal cutting edge which
does the cutting job

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.000
This one is the auxiliary cutting edge.
This face is

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.059
is called principle flank. And this one
the auxiliary flank

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.260
This point is called tool point

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.910
where the two flanks and the rake
face meets

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.490
This portion is called the heel

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.540
Geometry of a tool is defined by a set
of 7 parameters called

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.750
Tool Designation or Tool Nomenclature
There are various system

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.010
of Tool Designation. The most popular ones

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.640
being ORS and ASA. 
The Orthogonal Rake System

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.660
is based on three mutually perpendicular
planes

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.140
meeting at the tool point the Horizontal
plane is called

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.470
reference plane (Pi R). The vertical plane

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.430
containing the primary cutting edge is
called cutting plane (Pi C).

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.430
And the orthogonal plane (Pi O) is the

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:37.590
plane perpendicular to both Pi R
and Pi C

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.219
now if we look normal to the cutting
plane then the planes Pi R

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:47.170
and Pi O form horizontal and vertical
lines

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.320
This angle is called Inclination Angle, while

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.780
while this one is called the auxiliary clearance angle

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.990
similarity if you look normal to the orthogonal plane

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.190
the planes Pi R and Pi C
are horizontal

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.530
and vertical. Now this angle is Orthogonal

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.090
Rake Angle, or just Rake Angle. This is the
Principal Clearance Angle

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.239

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.560
in a machining process the angle between the PCE

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.290
and the direction of longitudinal feed is
called the principal

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.739
approach angle whereas the angle in between the auxiliary cutting-edge

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.109
and the feed is called the auxiliary approach angle

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:28.480
most tools also have a nose radius instead of a sharp edge.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.439
These six angles and the nose radius in a specific order

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:35.790
gives the tool geometry in

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:36.220
ORS system
