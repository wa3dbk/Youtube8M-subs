00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:05.390 
we're going to start with the plain of

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.100 
we're going to start with the plain of
back<00:00:05.779> front<00:00:06.490> so<00:00:07.490> what<00:00:08.299> happens<00:00:08.719> to<00:00:08.780> most

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.110 
back front so what happens to most

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.100 
back front so what happens to most
people<00:00:09.650> is<00:00:09.889> a<00:00:10.129> mini<00:00:10.610> version<00:00:10.940> of<00:00:11.240> the<00:00:11.870> top

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
people is a mini version of the top

people is a mini version of the top
picture<00:00:12.559> here<00:00:12.769> the<00:00:12.889> horse<00:00:13.099> is<00:00:13.280> often<00:00:13.610> speeding

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.090 
picture here the horse is often speeding

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.410 
picture here the horse is often speeding
out<00:00:14.179> from<00:00:14.420> underneath<00:00:14.690> them<00:00:15.049> they<00:00:15.920> are

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
out from underneath them they are

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.820 
out from underneath them they are
toppling<00:00:17.420> backwards<00:00:17.930> as<00:00:18.140> the<00:00:18.500> horses

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
toppling backwards as the horses

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.490 
toppling backwards as the horses
accelerated<00:00:19.670> so<00:00:20.240> think<00:00:20.630> of<00:00:20.869> somebody<00:00:21.230> pulls

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
accelerated so think of somebody pulls

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.439 
accelerated so think of somebody pulls
the<00:00:21.590> rug<00:00:21.740> out<00:00:21.830> from<00:00:21.890> under<00:00:22.250> your<00:00:22.369> feet<00:00:22.430> as<00:00:22.939> the

rug goes out from underneath you you

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.220 
rug goes out from underneath you you
topple<00:00:25.130> back<00:00:25.390> think<00:00:26.390> of<00:00:26.449> maybe<00:00:26.630> sitting<00:00:27.019> in<00:00:27.109> an

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
topple back think of maybe sitting in an

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.140 
topple back think of maybe sitting in an
airplane<00:00:27.619> when<00:00:28.010> it<00:00:28.130> accelerates<00:00:28.730> along<00:00:29.000> the

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
airplane when it accelerates along the

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.269 
airplane when it accelerates along the
runway<00:00:29.300> to<00:00:29.539> take<00:00:29.900> off<00:00:30.170> and<00:00:30.410> you<00:00:30.470> are<00:00:31.010> pushed

runway to take off and you are pushed
back<00:00:31.460> into<00:00:31.670> the<00:00:31.880> seat<00:00:32.119> by<00:00:32.689> that<00:00:32.930> acceleration

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:34.059 
back into the seat by that acceleration

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:36.700 
back into the seat by that acceleration
here's<00:00:35.059> the<00:00:35.239> opposite<00:00:35.629> version<00:00:35.900> in<00:00:36.350> the

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
here's the opposite version in the

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.680 
here's the opposite version in the
bottom<00:00:37.430> drawing<00:00:37.850> of<00:00:37.970> the<00:00:38.120> horse<00:00:38.390> stop

now on the back front plane the ride has

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.289 
now on the back front plane the ride has
got<00:00:44.960> to<00:00:45.110> be<00:00:45.199> able<00:00:45.320> to<00:00:45.530> maintain<00:00:45.739> that<00:00:46.549> vertical

shoulder hip heel line and do it in the
face<00:00:50.570> of<00:00:50.839> both<00:00:51.369> acceleration<00:00:52.369> and

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
face of both acceleration and

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.140 
face of both acceleration and
deceleration<00:00:53.330> and<00:00:54.320> not<00:00:55.040> many<00:00:55.309> people<00:00:55.430> can<00:00:55.820> do

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
deceleration and not many people can do

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.590 
deceleration and not many people can do
that<00:00:56.330> and<00:00:56.629> the<00:00:57.290> faster<00:00:57.830> you<00:00:57.979> go<00:00:58.220> the<00:00:58.610> more<00:00:59.360> it's

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
that and the faster you go the more it's

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.079 
that and the faster you go the more it's
like<00:00:59.809> riding<00:01:00.500> into<00:01:00.650> a<00:01:00.769> very<00:01:01.040> strong<00:01:01.430> wind<00:01:01.699> and

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
like riding into a very strong wind and

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.119 
like riding into a very strong wind and
the<00:01:02.600> more<00:01:02.809> you're<00:01:02.989> likely<00:01:03.260> to<00:01:03.619> suffer<00:01:03.890> the

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
the more you're likely to suffer the

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.970 
the more you're likely to suffer the
fate<00:01:04.400> of<00:01:04.670> the<00:01:05.150> rider<00:01:05.420> in<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:05.930> top<00:01:06.200> drawing
