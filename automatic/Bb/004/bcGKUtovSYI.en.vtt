wanted to have a real residential feel
and<00:02:56.970> I<00:02:57.150> think<00:02:57.360> that's<00:02:57.540> something<00:02:57.720> that's<00:02:57.900> been

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
and I think that's something that's been

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.520 
and I think that's something that's been
missing<00:02:58.140> is<00:02:58.560> more<00:02:58.860> furniture<00:02:59.300> looking

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
missing is more furniture looking

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.290 
missing is more furniture looking
