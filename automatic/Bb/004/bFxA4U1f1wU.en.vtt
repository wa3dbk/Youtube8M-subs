00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.130 
webs are but anyways the recipe is kind
of<00:00:51.950> expensive<00:00:52.340> as<00:00:52.670> you<00:00:52.850> can<00:00:53.000> see<00:00:53.180> two<00:00:53.870> redstone

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
of expensive as you can see two redstone

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.610 
of expensive as you can see two redstone
blocks<00:00:54.680> a<00:00:54.920> block<00:00:55.370> of<00:00:55.550> diamonds<00:00:56.060> a<00:00:56.210> jukebox<00:00:56.990> to

note blocks and also three buttons and
there's<00:01:00.500> a<00:01:00.560> good<00:01:00.710> reason<00:01:00.770> it's<00:01:01.250> so<00:01:01.400> expensive

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
there's a good reason it's so expensive

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.359 
there's a good reason it's so expensive
they<00:01:02.570> are<00:01:02.690> so<00:01:02.930> cool<00:01:03.260> and<00:01:03.590> they<00:01:03.800> actually<00:01:03.980> don't

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
they are so cool and they actually don't

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.550 
they are so cool and they actually don't
run<00:01:04.549> out<00:01:04.580> of<00:01:04.699> durability<00:01:05.299> either<00:01:05.540> so<00:01:06.320> yeah<00:01:06.470> of

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
run out of durability either so yeah of

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.560 
run out of durability either so yeah of
course<00:01:06.920> it's<00:01:07.250> got<00:01:07.549> to<00:01:07.640> cost<00:01:07.820> you<00:01:08.060> quite<00:01:08.299> a<00:01:08.450> bit

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
is spawn in a couple iron golems just to

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.150 
is spawn in a couple iron golems just to
show<00:02:08.750> you<00:02:08.810> guys<00:02:09.020> like<00:02:09.320> how<00:02:09.560> powerful<00:02:10.070> this

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
show you guys like how powerful this

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.610 
show you guys like how powerful this
stuff<00:02:10.399> is<00:02:10.729> and<00:02:11.060> of<00:02:11.510> course<00:02:11.540> each<00:02:11.930> gun<00:02:12.380> does

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
stuff is and of course each gun does

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.600 
stuff is and of course each gun does
have<00:02:12.770> a<00:02:12.830> different<00:02:13.100> song

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
have a different song

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.220

so<00:02:13.880> these<00:02:14.030> iron<00:02:14.390> golems<00:02:14.720> I'm<00:02:14.930> actually<00:02:15.050> the

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
so these iron golems I'm actually the

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.290 
so these iron golems I'm actually the
spawn<00:02:15.410> a<00:02:15.440> bunch<00:02:15.680> are<00:02:15.980> not<00:02:16.670> going<00:02:16.940> to<00:02:17.030> survive

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
spawn a bunch are not going to survive

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.480 
spawn a bunch are not going to survive
long<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:17.990> this<00:02:18.290> is<00:02:18.410> probably<00:02:18.800> why<00:02:19.190> it's<00:02:19.370> so

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
long and this is probably why it's so

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.280 
long and this is probably why it's so
expensive<00:02:19.700> all<00:02:20.450> right<00:02:20.570> so<00:02:20.720> I'm<00:02:20.780> try<00:02:20.990> this<00:02:21.050> one
