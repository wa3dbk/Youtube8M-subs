 Hello Hi Keystone Art from "Broken Pieces" iPods years ago 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.420
 and today i show you the preinstalled is far the feature of 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.029
 Samsung 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.960
 on the Samsung Galaxy s 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.770
 So to wipe these fixed tours to use and so you can 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:33.110
 get pressed into a text box 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.380
 other methods and then be 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.710
 it is short 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.710
 and 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.970
 this led to 2 opened 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.130
 as I said before doing his display stress 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.210
 You only need to wag your fingers over the letters and then 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.120
 automatically remembers what you wrote then 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.120
 if anyone write firmly Hello 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.010
 Issue is hello 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.440
 so 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.280
 apparently called Zeitz 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.380
 the d 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.380
 in the test 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.580
 now 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.940
 that has what recognized that 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.890
 Artistry had rewritten talent 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.200
 but it's probably because I'm not allowed to have weight 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.110
 There are also people who do not have two drafts of a book 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.650
 You can easily add them manually too 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.490
 manually 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.639
 for example the word pocket-pc point spar with certainly not given 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.310
 so there is at all 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.980
 the PSI Zwickau 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.590
 okay now it is supposed to hit over Patzern over today 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.590
 function 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.170
 OK the 17 degrees 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.790
 Son is that we hope 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.890
 the back what should these young women have but we can seem to 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.850
 or visited and also for the cockpits the top 10 from
