to have a razor member however i love
the<00:00:17.430> ergonomics<00:00:17.910> but<00:00:18.150> i<00:00:18.180> really<00:00:18.539> didn't<00:00:18.869> like

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
the ergonomics but i really didn't like

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.750 
the ergonomics but i really didn't like
the<00:00:19.289> fact<00:00:19.439> he<00:00:19.590> had<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.830> keep<00:00:19.949> chanting<00:00:20.310> all<00:00:20.670> the

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
the fact he had to keep chanting all the

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.210 
the fact he had to keep chanting all the
time<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.960> obviously<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.650> could<00:00:22.980> use<00:00:23.189> it

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
time and obviously you could use it

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.400 
time and obviously you could use it
wired<00:00:23.970> but<00:00:24.390> then<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.779> might<00:00:24.900> as<00:00:25.019> well<00:00:25.199> have

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
wired but then you might as well have

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.920 
wired but then you might as well have
something<00:00:26.250> like<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.550> Death<00:00:26.760> Adder<00:00:27.029> didn't

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
something like the Death Adder didn't

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.300 
something like the Death Adder didn't
really<00:00:28.109> make<00:00:28.199> much<00:00:28.410> sense<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.710> me<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.039> sold

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310
