think he'll benefit for that room I

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.279 
think he'll benefit for that room I
think<00:00:20.939> they<00:00:21.000> all<00:00:21.150> benefit<00:00:21.600> from<00:00:21.660> having<00:00:21.960> been

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
think they all benefit from having been

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.439 
think they all benefit from having been
there<00:00:22.470> in<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.619> past<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:23.699> was<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.850> decision

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
there in the past it was a decision

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.910 
there in the past it was a decision
whether<00:00:24.570> he<00:00:24.779> stayed<00:00:25.019> or<00:00:25.199> not<00:00:25.320> last<00:00:25.560> year<00:00:25.769> that

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
whether he stayed or not last year that

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.259 
whether he stayed or not last year that
was<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.070> big<00:00:26.310> thing<00:00:26.340> in<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.670> back<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:26.939> our<00:00:27.029> mind

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
was a big thing in the back of our mind

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.240 
was a big thing in the back of our mind
so<00:00:27.570> I'm<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:28.320> fact<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.560> he<00:00:28.680> stayed<00:00:28.890> on<00:00:28.920> so

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250
