00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
you how to lubricate your chain now we

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.230 
you how to lubricate your chain now we
use<00:00:18.949> two<00:00:19.189> different<00:00:19.220> kinds<00:00:19.550> of<00:00:19.699> lubricants

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
use two different kinds of lubricants

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.630 
use two different kinds of lubricants
here<00:00:21.009> basically<00:00:22.009> we<00:00:22.160> use<00:00:22.340> what's<00:00:22.580> called

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
here basically we use what's called

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.339 
here basically we use what's called
white<00:00:23.000> lightning<00:00:23.509> and<00:00:23.750> we<00:00:23.840> use<00:00:23.990> another<00:00:24.230> one

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349 
white lightning and we use another one

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.700 
white lightning and we use another one
called<00:00:24.590> pro-link<00:00:25.929> white<00:00:26.929> lightning<00:00:27.500> if<00:00:27.650> you

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
called pro-link white lightning if you

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:28.990 
called pro-link white lightning if you
took<00:00:27.859> a<00:00:27.920> bottle<00:00:28.160> white<00:00:28.429> lightning<00:00:28.789> that<00:00:28.880> was

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
took a bottle white lightning that was

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.519 
took a bottle white lightning that was
just<00:00:29.210> sitting<00:00:29.419> on<00:00:29.480> the<00:00:29.539> shelf<00:00:29.900> without

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
just sitting on the shelf without

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.050 
just sitting on the shelf without
shaking<00:00:30.949> it<00:00:31.189> up<00:00:31.279> you'd<00:00:31.490> notice<00:00:31.820> there<00:00:31.970> would

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:32.060 
shaking it up you'd notice there would

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.640 
shaking it up you'd notice there would
be<00:00:32.090> a<00:00:32.240> little<00:00:32.450> white<00:00:32.660> section<00:00:33.020> in<00:00:33.260> the<00:00:33.350> bottom

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 
be a little white section in the bottom

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.139 
be a little white section in the bottom
and<00:00:33.710> then<00:00:33.830> be<00:00:33.950> clear<00:00:34.280> the<00:00:34.460> rest<00:00:34.610> the<00:00:34.789> way<00:00:34.940> up

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
and then be clear the rest the way up

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.639 
and then be clear the rest the way up
and<00:00:36.050> basically<00:00:36.829> what<00:00:37.039> that<00:00:37.100> is<00:00:37.280> is<00:00:37.430> a<00:00:37.700> wax<00:00:38.649> with

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
and basically what that is is a wax with

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.279 
and basically what that is is a wax with
an<00:00:39.800> alcohol<00:00:40.340> carrier<00:00:40.789> so<00:00:41.449> the<00:00:41.780> old-timers

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:42.289 
an alcohol carrier so the old-timers

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:43.840 
an alcohol carrier so the old-timers
used<00:00:42.379> to<00:00:42.530> wax<00:00:42.739> their<00:00:42.949> change<00:00:43.219> they<00:00:43.430> melt<00:00:43.699> the

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
used to wax their change they melt the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.049 
used to wax their change they melt the
wax<00:00:44.449> in<00:00:44.719> a<00:00:44.809> can<00:00:45.230> of<00:00:45.590> paraffin<00:00:46.309> wax<00:00:46.520> in<00:00:46.730> a<00:00:46.820> can

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
wax in a can of paraffin wax in a can

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.209 
wax in a can of paraffin wax in a can
they<00:00:47.629> put<00:00:47.840> their<00:00:47.989> chain<00:00:48.260> in<00:00:48.440> and<00:00:48.590> let<00:00:48.739> it<00:00:48.770> cook

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
they put their chain in and let it cook

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:50.889 
they put their chain in and let it cook
and<00:00:49.460> then<00:00:49.550> they<00:00:49.670> take<00:00:49.910> it<00:00:50.090> out<00:00:50.210> and<00:00:50.480> it

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
and then they take it out and it

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:52.599 
and then they take it out and it
actually<00:00:51.050> worked<00:00:51.379> pretty<00:00:51.469> good<00:00:51.829> because<00:00:52.489> I'm

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:52.609 
actually worked pretty good because I'm

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.229 
actually worked pretty good because I'm
an<00:00:52.730> old-timer<00:00:52.910> I<00:00:53.180> used<00:00:53.329> to<00:00:53.420> do<00:00:53.510> that<00:00:54.219> but<00:00:55.239> and

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
an old-timer I used to do that but and

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.240 
an old-timer I used to do that but and
then<00:00:56.390> we've<00:00:56.510> got<00:00:56.660> our<00:00:56.780> pro<00:00:56.989> link<00:00:57.289> and<00:00:57.440> pro<00:00:57.980> link

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
then we've got our pro link and pro link

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.430 
then we've got our pro link and pro link
is<00:00:58.430> more<00:00:58.640> of<00:00:58.699> an<00:00:58.760> oil<00:00:58.910> based<00:00:59.210> lubricant<00:00:59.809> it's

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
is more of an oil based lubricant it's

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.430 
is more of an oil based lubricant it's
very<00:01:00.679> thin<00:01:01.039> it<00:01:01.190> penetrates<00:01:01.760> well<00:01:02.059> we<00:01:02.989> use<00:01:03.140> pro

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
very thin it penetrates well we use pro

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.340 
very thin it penetrates well we use pro
link<00:01:03.970> in<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.090> shop<00:01:05.330> a<00:01:05.360> lot<00:01:05.660> with<00:01:05.930> these<00:01:06.080> little

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
link in the shop a lot with these little

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.210 
link in the shop a lot with these little
these<00:01:06.830> little<00:01:08.380> looks<00:01:09.380> like<00:01:09.530> a<00:01:09.560> little<00:01:09.830> syringe

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
these little looks like a little syringe

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.060 
these little looks like a little syringe
saying<00:01:10.840> but<00:01:11.840> we<00:01:11.960> use<00:01:12.140> this<00:01:12.320> little<00:01:12.530> syringe<00:01:12.830> to

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
saying but we use this little syringe to

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.320 
saying but we use this little syringe to
get<00:01:13.189> into<00:01:13.369> nooks<00:01:13.610> and<00:01:13.700> crannies<00:01:14.090> on<00:01:14.240> the

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
get into nooks and crannies on the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.609 
get into nooks and crannies on the
derailers<00:01:14.810> and<00:01:14.990> other<00:01:15.080> parts<00:01:15.409> that<00:01:15.500> we<00:01:15.590> need

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
derailers and other parts that we need

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.530 
derailers and other parts that we need
to<00:01:15.770> lubricate<00:01:15.979> maybe<00:01:16.520> brake<00:01:16.820> calipers<00:01:17.330> things

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
to lubricate maybe brake calipers things

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.300 
to lubricate maybe brake calipers things
like<00:01:17.689> that<00:01:17.840> it<00:01:17.960> works<00:01:18.140> great<00:01:18.380> I<00:01:18.710> highly

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
like that it works great I highly

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.210 
like that it works great I highly
recommend<00:01:19.430> this<00:01:20.320> so<00:01:21.320> anyway<00:01:21.619> back<00:01:21.770> to<00:01:21.950> chains

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
recommend this so anyway back to chains

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.749 
recommend this so anyway back to chains
so<00:01:23.950> let's<00:01:24.950> say<00:01:25.070> you<00:01:25.100> decide<00:01:25.310> you're<00:01:25.549> going<00:01:25.670> to

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
is you want to clean your chain very

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.440 
is you want to clean your chain very
well<00:01:30.500> okay<00:01:31.130> and<00:01:31.369> dry<00:01:31.640> it<00:01:31.700> off<00:01:31.850> real<00:01:32.149> well<00:01:32.180> to

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
well okay and dry it off real well to

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.999 
well okay and dry it off real well to
start<00:01:32.540> with<00:01:32.659> a<00:01:32.780> clean<00:01:32.960> dry<00:01:33.229> chain<00:01:33.590> even<00:01:33.860> if<00:01:33.950> you

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
start with a clean dry chain even if you

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.469 
start with a clean dry chain even if you
have<00:01:34.130> a<00:01:34.159> new<00:01:34.369> chain<00:01:34.700> you<00:01:34.909> want<00:01:35.090> to<00:01:35.180> clean<00:01:35.360> the

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
have a new chain you want to clean the

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.600 
have a new chain you want to clean the
lubricant<00:01:35.899> off<00:01:36.049> because<00:01:36.649> the<00:01:36.770> stock<00:01:37.070> stuff<00:01:37.430> we

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
lubricant off because the stock stuff we

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.190 
lubricant off because the stock stuff we
don't<00:01:37.729> like<00:01:37.909> it<00:01:38.090> anyway<00:01:38.360> it's<00:01:38.570> it's<00:01:38.899> kind<00:01:39.140> of

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
don't like it anyway it's it's kind of

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.039 
don't like it anyway it's it's kind of
tacky<00:01:39.439> and<00:01:40.240> chains<00:01:41.240> work<00:01:41.450> much<00:01:41.659> better<00:01:41.689> if

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
tacky and chains work much better if

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:43.300 
tacky and chains work much better if
it's<00:01:42.170> lubricated<00:01:42.590> with<00:01:42.799> one<00:01:42.950> of<00:01:43.070> these<00:01:43.159> two

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
it's lubricated with one of these two

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.139 
it's lubricated with one of these two
lubricants<00:01:43.850> and<00:01:45.729> we<00:01:46.729> like<00:01:46.909> the<00:01:47.000> white

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
lubricants and we like the white

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.209 
lubricants and we like the white
lightning<00:01:47.509> because<00:01:47.780> it's<00:01:48.170> a<00:01:48.380> wax-based<00:01:48.829> it

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
lightning because it's a wax-based it

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:51.670 
lightning because it's a wax-based it
does<00:01:49.520> not<00:01:49.790> attract<00:01:50.479> dirt<00:01:50.780> like<00:01:51.079> some<00:01:51.500> of<00:01:51.619> the

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
does not attract dirt like some of the

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.550 
does not attract dirt like some of the
oily<00:01:52.070> or<00:01:52.159> loops<00:01:52.369> to<00:01:52.549> but<00:01:52.759> it<00:01:52.850> also<00:01:52.909> requires<00:01:53.600> a

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
oily or loops to but it also requires a

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.490 
oily or loops to but it also requires a
few<00:01:55.159> more<00:01:55.280> applications<00:01:56.259> so<00:01:57.259> you'd<00:01:57.380> be

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
few more applications so you'd be

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.990 
few more applications so you'd be
lubricating<00:01:58.070> your<00:01:58.100> chain<00:01:58.399> more<00:01:58.579> basically

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
lubricating your chain more basically

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.550

what you do if you're using white light
you<00:02:00.799> shake<00:02:01.130> it<00:02:01.250> up<00:02:01.369> real<00:02:01.579> good<00:02:01.610> and<00:02:02.829> you<00:02:03.829> got

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
you shake it up real good and you got

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.359 
you shake it up real good and you got
your<00:02:04.100> chain<00:02:04.399> here<00:02:05.560> and<00:02:06.560> you<00:02:06.649> would<00:02:06.799> just<00:02:06.920> drip

taking on the white lightning and it

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.140 
taking on the white lightning and it
ends<00:02:50.430> up<00:02:51.500> just<00:02:52.500> building<00:02:52.980> up<00:02:53.040> with<00:02:53.220> wax<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.790> it

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
ends up just building up with wax and it

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.059 
ends up just building up with wax and it
just<00:02:54.420> is<00:02:54.600> just<00:02:54.630> a<00:02:54.900> massive<00:02:55.110> it<00:02:55.560> can<00:02:55.709> get<00:02:55.830> on<00:02:55.950> the

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
just is just a massive it can get on the

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.400 
just is just a massive it can get on the
rims<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.670> affect<00:02:56.910> your<00:02:57.060> braking<00:02:57.569> and<00:02:57.840> it's

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
rims and affect your braking and it's

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.960 
rims and affect your braking and it's
just<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.739> mess<00:02:58.890> so<00:02:59.100> you<00:02:59.190> always<00:02:59.400> want<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.850> wipe

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
just a mess so you always want to wipe

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.640 
just a mess so you always want to wipe
your<00:03:00.150> change<00:03:00.420> you<00:03:00.540> spend<00:03:00.750> more<00:03:00.989> time<00:03:01.290> wiping

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
your change you spend more time wiping

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.220 
your change you spend more time wiping
your<00:03:01.920> chain<00:03:02.190> than<00:03:02.459> you<00:03:02.549> do<00:03:03.200> lubricating<00:03:04.200> your

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
your chain than you do lubricating your

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.039 
your chain than you do lubricating your
chain<00:03:04.560> so<00:03:05.120> just<00:03:06.120> just<00:03:06.540> food<00:03:06.780> for<00:03:06.810> thought

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
chain so just just food for thought

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.039 
chain so just just food for thought
there<00:03:08.030> if<00:03:09.030> you're<00:03:09.150> using<00:03:09.299> the<00:03:09.420> pro<00:03:09.630> link<00:03:09.900> it's

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
there if you're using the pro link it's

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.770 
there if you're using the pro link it's
the<00:03:10.140> same<00:03:10.380> basic<00:03:10.890> procedure<00:03:11.330> so<00:03:12.330> like<00:03:12.600> I<00:03:12.720> said

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
the same basic procedure so like I said

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.300 
the same basic procedure so like I said
if<00:03:12.989> you're<00:03:13.110> using<00:03:13.260> prolink<00:03:13.709> it's<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.040> same

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
if you're using prolink it's the same

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.060 
if you're using prolink it's the same
basic<00:03:14.700> procedure<00:03:15.390> but<00:03:16.049> you<00:03:16.200> definitely<00:03:16.530> want

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
basic procedure but you definitely want

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.789 
basic procedure but you definitely want
to<00:03:17.359> really<00:03:18.359> really<00:03:18.810> wipe<00:03:19.109> that<00:03:19.320> chain<00:03:19.620> down

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
to really really wipe that chain down

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.860 
to really really wipe that chain down
good<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.329> so<00:03:21.329> I<00:03:21.420> be<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.660> tip<00:03:21.840> of<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.019> week<00:03:22.140> and

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
good and so I be the tip of the week and

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.240 
good and so I be the tip of the week and
remember<00:03:24.870> we<00:03:25.109> have<00:03:25.230> repair<00:03:25.620> seminars<00:03:26.070> on

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
remember we have repair seminars on

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.960 
remember we have repair seminars on
tuesdays<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:26.850> thursdays<00:03:27.209> at<00:03:27.359> seven<00:03:27.600> and<00:03:28.970> last

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
tuesdays and thursdays at seven and last

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.050 
tuesdays and thursdays at seven and last
night<00:03:30.239> which<00:03:30.600> was<00:03:30.630> Tuesday<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.920> 12th<00:03:32.609> we<00:03:32.820> did

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
night which was Tuesday the 12th we did

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.479 
night which was Tuesday the 12th we did
we<00:03:33.269> learned<00:03:33.570> how<00:03:33.690> to<00:03:33.750> fix<00:03:33.959> a<00:03:34.079> flat<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:34.650> I<00:03:35.250> think

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
we learned how to fix a flat and I think

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.940 
we learned how to fix a flat and I think
probably<00:03:36.019> tomorrow<00:03:37.019> we'll<00:03:37.470> be<00:03:37.590> doing

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
probably tomorrow we'll be doing

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.840 
probably tomorrow we'll be doing
lubricating<00:03:38.549> your<00:03:38.579> chain<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.299> derailleur

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
lubricating your chain and derailleur
