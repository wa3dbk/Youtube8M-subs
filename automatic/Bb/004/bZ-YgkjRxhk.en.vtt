Raw<00:01:50.909> I'm<00:01:51.780> expecting<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.350> course<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.740> match<00:01:52.920> with

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
Raw I'm expecting of course a match with

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.460 
Raw I'm expecting of course a match with
the<00:01:53.280> shield's<00:01:53.909> because<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:54.780> far<00:01:54.990> they<00:01:55.170> don't

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
the shield's because so far they don't

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.770 
the shield's because so far they don't
have<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.649> matchup<00:01:55.950> I'm<00:01:56.909> expecting<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.479> know

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
have a matchup I'm expecting you know

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.840 
have a matchup I'm expecting you know
six-man<00:01:58.170> not<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.500> six-man<00:01:58.890> tag-team<00:01:59.399> matchup

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
six-man not a six-man tag-team matchup

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.370 
six-man not a six-man tag-team matchup
with<00:02:00.299> shield<00:02:00.600> I'm<00:02:00.750> not<00:02:00.930> really<00:02:01.140> expecting

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
with shield I'm not really expecting

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.039 
with shield I'm not really expecting
them<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:02.210> defend<00:02:03.210> their<00:02:03.450> respective<00:02:03.869> titles

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
them to defend their respective titles

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.780 
them to defend their respective titles
so<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.829> don't<00:02:05.070> think<00:02:05.189> it's<00:02:05.280> gonna<00:02:05.399> be<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:05.759> know
