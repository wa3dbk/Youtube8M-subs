00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.530 

you

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.259 

um<00:02:40.540> I<00:02:41.050> don't<00:02:41.890> really<00:02:42.250> know<00:02:42.640> about<00:02:43.620> technology

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
um I don't really know about technology

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.559 
um I don't really know about technology
so<00:02:46.269> I<00:02:46.540> think<00:02:47.250> this<00:02:48.250> turns<00:02:48.670> off<00:02:48.909> the<00:02:49.090> same<00:02:49.360> way

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.959 
so I think this turns off the same way
is<00:02:50.129> my<00:02:51.129> eyebrow<00:02:52.120> shaver<00:02:52.510> does
