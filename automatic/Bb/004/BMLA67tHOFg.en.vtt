00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
hint of lime in there you don't need a

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.229 
hint of lime in there you don't need a
lot<00:02:15.349> of<00:02:15.380> it<00:02:18.190> just<00:02:19.190> enough<00:02:19.489> to<00:02:19.610> give<00:02:19.760> it<00:02:19.790> a<00:02:19.910> that

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
lot of it just enough to give it a that

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:26.880
