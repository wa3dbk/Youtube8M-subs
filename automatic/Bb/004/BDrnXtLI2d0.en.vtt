a<00:00:30.340> few<00:00:30.760> years<00:00:30.880> ago<00:00:31.090> we<00:00:31.300> were<00:00:31.330> looking<00:00:31.690> for<00:00:31.900> a

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
a few years ago we were looking for a

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.210 
a few years ago we were looking for a
solution<00:00:33.090> for<00:00:34.090> our<00:00:34.600> POS<00:00:34.930> work<00:00:35.290> we<00:00:35.710> can<00:00:35.920> use<00:00:36.070> an

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
solution for our POS work we can use an

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.670 
solution for our POS work we can use an
iPad<00:00:36.640> we<00:00:37.540> did<00:00:37.720> some<00:00:37.900> research<00:00:38.080> and<00:00:38.350> we<00:00:38.440> ended

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
iPad we did some research and we ended

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.770 
iPad we did some research and we ended
up<00:00:38.770> with<00:00:38.920> shopkeep<00:00:39.400> before<00:00:40.090> we<00:00:40.270> were<00:00:40.390> using<00:00:40.420> a

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
up with shopkeep before we were using a

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.270 
up with shopkeep before we were using a
windows-based<00:00:41.110> system<00:00:41.740> where<00:00:41.980> the<00:00:42.100> cash

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
windows-based system where the cash

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.850 
windows-based system where the cash
register<00:00:42.790> was<00:00:43.110> everything<00:00:44.110> was<00:00:44.200> hardwired<00:00:44.620> in

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
register was everything was hardwired in

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.979 
register was everything was hardwired in
the<00:00:44.980> store<00:00:45.220> if<00:00:46.059> we<00:00:46.300> needed<00:00:46.510> to<00:00:46.600> get<00:00:46.809> any

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
the store if we needed to get any

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:48.750 
the store if we needed to get any
reports<00:00:47.500> or<00:00:47.739> information<00:00:48.250> we<00:00:48.340> would<00:00:48.489> have<00:00:48.610> to

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
reports or information we would have to

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.350 
reports or information we would have to
do<00:00:49.059> it<00:00:49.270> at<00:00:49.540> the<00:00:49.780> at<00:00:50.140> the<00:00:50.380> location<00:00:50.890> and<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:52.180> took

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
do it at the at the location and it took

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.170 
do it at the at the location and it took
a<00:00:52.480> long<00:00:52.660> time<00:00:52.690> to<00:00:52.930> for<00:00:53.590> the<00:00:53.680> reports<00:00:54.129> to<00:00:54.370> come

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
a long time to for the reports to come

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.530 
a long time to for the reports to come
out<00:00:55.360> so<00:00:56.280> sometimes<00:00:57.280> in<00:00:57.489> order<00:00:57.610> to<00:00:58.150> run<00:00:58.480> a

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
out so sometimes in order to run a

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.410 
out so sometimes in order to run a
report<00:00:58.720> we<00:00:59.710> would<00:00:59.920> have<00:01:00.220> to<00:01:00.430> sit<00:01:00.670> at<00:01:01.150> the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
report we would have to sit at the

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.859 
report we would have to sit at the
register<00:01:01.870> and<00:01:02.110> and<00:01:02.700> make<00:01:03.700> people<00:01:04.000> wait<00:01:04.180> and<00:01:04.750> to

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
register and and make people wait and to

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.920 
register and and make people wait and to
pay<00:01:05.080> it<00:01:05.530> was<00:01:05.740> a<00:01:05.770> ridiculous<00:01:06.450> system<00:01:07.450> we

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
pay it was a ridiculous system we

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.050 
pay it was a ridiculous system we
switched<00:01:08.229> to<00:01:08.470> shop<00:01:09.250> keep<00:01:09.490> that<00:01:09.700> works<00:01:09.850> with

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
does that makes it very very simple it's

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.930 
does that makes it very very simple it's
a<00:01:38.950> it<00:01:39.490> turned<00:01:39.729> a<00:01:40.210> tedious<00:01:41.049> job<00:01:41.140> into<00:01:41.979> no<00:01:42.490> job<00:01:42.760> at

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
a it turned a tedious job into no job at

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.170 
a it turned a tedious job into no job at
all<00:01:43.080> we<00:01:44.080> use<00:01:44.320> the<00:01:44.799> reports<00:01:45.310> and<00:01:45.460> shopkeep<00:01:45.940> to

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
all we use the reports and shopkeep to

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.719 
all we use the reports and shopkeep to
decide<00:01:46.540> where<00:01:46.990> to<00:01:47.020> put<00:01:47.380> product<00:01:47.979> and<00:01:48.159> if<00:01:48.700> the

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
decide where to put product and if the

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.780 
decide where to put product and if the
product<00:01:49.180> is<00:01:49.920> performing<00:01:50.920> for<00:01:51.369> the<00:01:51.460> amount<00:01:51.670> of

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
product is performing for the amount of

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.430 
product is performing for the amount of
space<00:01:51.850> that<00:01:52.210> we<00:01:52.270> give<00:01:52.540> it<00:01:52.690> so<00:01:52.990> if<00:01:53.049> something's

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
space that we give it so if something's

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.100 
space that we give it so if something's
on<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.590> front<00:01:53.950> counter<00:01:54.130> we<00:01:55.060> watch<00:01:55.570> the<00:01:55.840> sales

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
on the front counter we watch the sales

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.320 
on the front counter we watch the sales
and<00:01:56.409> we<00:01:56.619> compare<00:01:57.010> it<00:01:57.040> to<00:01:57.159> something<00:01:57.520> that<00:01:57.939> we

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
and we compare it to something that we

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.070 
and we compare it to something that we
put<00:01:58.479> in<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.689> same<00:01:58.930> spot<00:01:59.369> on<00:02:00.510> at<00:02:01.510> another<00:02:01.630> time

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
put in the same spot on at another time

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.770 
put in the same spot on at another time
so<00:02:02.560> we<00:02:02.710> make<00:02:02.890> decisions<00:02:03.700> about<00:02:03.880> how<00:02:04.540> much

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
so we make decisions about how much

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.050 
so we make decisions about how much
space<00:02:04.900> we<00:02:05.260> give<00:02:05.409> product<00:02:05.860> where<00:02:06.520> we<00:02:06.700> put<00:02:06.939> the
