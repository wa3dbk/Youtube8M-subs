easy<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.610> screwin<00:00:48.149> base<00:00:48.360> this<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.590> a

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
easy this is a screwin base this is a

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.540 
easy this is a screwin base this is a
e39<00:00:51.320> socket<00:00:52.320> fitment<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:54.829> here's<00:00:55.829> an<00:00:56.039> e39

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
e39 socket fitment and here's an e39

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.869 
e39 socket fitment and here's an e39
socket<00:00:57.559> you<00:00:58.559> could<00:00:58.710> buy<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:58.890> at<00:00:59.219> Home<00:00:59.430> Depot

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
socket you could buy this at Home Depot

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.200 
socket you could buy this at Home Depot
I<00:01:00.090> believe<00:01:00.510> they<00:01:00.629> sell<00:01:00.840> for<00:01:01.050> 89<00:01:01.500> bucks<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.210> all

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
I believe they sell for 89 bucks and all

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.770 
I believe they sell for 89 bucks and all
it<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.539> it's<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:04.019> two<00:01:04.589> wires<00:01:04.830> direct<00:01:05.510> to<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> AC

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
it is it's a two wires direct to the AC

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.030 
it is it's a two wires direct to the AC
so<00:01:07.290> as<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.530> can<00:01:07.619> see<00:01:08.210> here<00:01:09.350> it's<00:01:10.350> hooked<00:01:10.830> up<00:01:10.979> to

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
so as you can see here it's hooked up to

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.390 
so as you can see here it's hooked up to
the<00:01:11.610> positive<00:01:11.640> negative<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.979> it<00:01:13.979> connects<00:01:14.340> to

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
the positive negative and it connects to

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.580 
the positive negative and it connects to
two<00:01:14.490> wire<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:14.880> have<00:01:15.299> this<00:01:15.450> bamboo<00:01:15.689> on<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.259> was

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
two wire I have this bamboo on it was

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.140 
two wire I have this bamboo on it was
meant<00:01:17.130> for<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.670> light<00:01:18.420> show<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.990> used<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:19.590> I

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
meant for a light show that I used so I

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:27.170 
meant for a light show that I used so I
basically<00:01:22.909> attached<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:26.060> security<00:01:27.060> device

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
basically attached a security device

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.310 
basically attached a security device
here<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.229> inside<00:01:29.390> so<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.570> extra

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
here to the inside so that it extra

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.090 
here to the inside so that it extra
strength<00:01:31.619> holds<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.960> basic<00:01:33.960> concept<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.590> you

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
strength holds it basic concept is you

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.670 
strength holds it basic concept is you
know<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.460> screw<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:38.390> okay<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.600> then<00:01:40.560> you

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
know you screw it in okay and then you

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.929 
know you screw it in okay and then you
got<00:01:40.829> this<00:01:40.950> long<00:01:41.220> wire<00:01:43.340> and<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.520> just<00:01:44.670> go<00:01:44.850> ahead

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
got this long wire and you just go ahead

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:52.430 
got this long wire and you just go ahead
and<00:01:45.090> plug<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:46.820> directly<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.119> wall

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.720 

and<00:01:53.440> there<00:01:53.830> it<00:01:53.950> is<00:01:54.810> it's<00:01:55.810> ready<00:01:56.050> to<00:01:56.140> go<00:01:56.260> so<00:01:56.730> the

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
and there it is it's ready to go so the

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.760 
and there it is it's ready to go so the
idea<00:01:58.060> is<00:01:58.330> that<00:01:58.360> you<00:01:58.960> want<00:01:59.110> to<00:01:59.290> get<00:01:59.470> something

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
idea is that you want to get something

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:00.720 
idea is that you want to get something
like<00:01:59.920> this

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:00.730 
like this

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.900 
like this
maybe<00:02:01.690> a<00:02:01.810> chain<00:02:02.260> fixture<00:02:03.100> on<00:02:03.190> the<00:02:03.340> top<00:02:03.640> of<00:02:03.820> the

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
maybe a chain fixture on the top of the

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.020 
maybe a chain fixture on the top of the
roof<00:02:04.230> to<00:02:05.230> wherever<00:02:05.950> you<00:02:06.220> want<00:02:06.250> to<00:02:06.460> hang<00:02:06.610> it<00:02:06.790> and

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
roof to wherever you want to hang it and

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.680 
roof to wherever you want to hang it and
you<00:02:07.960> get<00:02:08.140> a<00:02:08.170> chain<00:02:08.500> and<00:02:08.800> it's<00:02:09.010> secure<00:02:09.460> it<00:02:09.690> to

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
you get a chain and it's secure it to

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.680 
you get a chain and it's secure it to
your<00:02:10.720> fixture<00:02:11.350> to<00:02:11.650> your<00:02:11.860> to<00:02:12.280> your<00:02:12.690> screwin

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
your fixture to your to your screwin

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.770 
your fixture to your to your screwin
base<00:02:13.870> and<00:02:14.880> there<00:02:15.880> they<00:02:16.060> self<00:02:16.330> suffer<00:02:16.660> out

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
base and there they self suffer out

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.360 
base and there they self suffer out
there<00:02:16.990> for<00:02:17.230> really<00:02:17.470> cheap<00:02:17.740> you<00:02:17.920> can<00:02:18.070> could<00:02:18.250> buy

you got this chain here where if I can
just

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.240 

okay<00:03:04.890> so<00:03:05.310> now<00:03:05.460> you<00:03:05.520> have<00:03:05.670> this<00:03:05.910> chain<00:03:07.160> this<00:03:08.160> is

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
okay so now you have this chain this is

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.930 
okay so now you have this chain this is
a<00:03:08.310> fairly<00:03:09.090> long<00:03:09.240> chain<00:03:09.630> that<00:03:10.530> you<00:03:10.710> got<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.190> you

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
a fairly long chain that you got and you

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.020 
a fairly long chain that you got and you
can<00:03:12.090> use<00:03:12.330> this<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:13.650> secure<00:03:14.100> it<00:03:14.220> even<00:03:14.520> better

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
can use this to secure it even better

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.700 
can use this to secure it even better
than<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:16.860> this<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:18.000> connection<00:03:18.510> here<00:03:18.690> so<00:03:18.900> the

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
than the this the connection here so the

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.900 
than the this the connection here so the
idea<00:03:20.040> is<00:03:20.340> that<00:03:20.400> you<00:03:20.880> hook<00:03:21.150> it<00:03:22.700> inside<00:03:23.700> one<00:03:23.880> of

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
idea is that you hook it inside one of

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:31.130 
idea is that you hook it inside one of
these<00:03:24.150> holes<00:03:27.830> like<00:03:28.830> so<00:03:29.100> and<00:03:29.810> you<00:03:30.810> hook<00:03:30.990> the

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
these holes like so and you hook the

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.870 
these holes like so and you hook the
other<00:03:31.170> one<00:03:32.450> on<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.480> other<00:03:33.930> side<00:03:34.400> directly<00:03:35.400> of

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
other one on the other side directly of

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:43.940 
other one on the other side directly of
course<00:03:36.800> so<00:03:40.310> like<00:03:41.310> so<00:03:42.050> so<00:03:43.050> as<00:03:43.200> you<00:03:43.290> can<00:03:43.440> see<00:03:43.680> it's

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
course so like so so as you can see it's

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.700 
course so like so so as you can see it's
good<00:03:44.310> to<00:03:44.430> the<00:03:44.520> hole<00:03:45.920> it's<00:03:46.920> pretty<00:03:47.160> secure<00:03:47.660> and

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
good to the hole it's pretty secure and

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:54.620 
good to the hole it's pretty secure and
now<00:03:49.710> you<00:03:49.770> got<00:03:50.540> extra<00:03:51.540> security<00:03:52.140> line<00:03:53.420> to<00:03:54.420> hold

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
now you got extra security line to hold

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.020 
now you got extra security line to hold
the<00:03:54.720> high<00:03:54.870> bay<00:03:55.050> up<00:03:55.460> you<00:03:56.460> know<00:03:56.580> and<00:03:56.730> it's<00:03:56.850> not<00:03:57.000> a

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
the high bay up you know and it's not a

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.070 
the high bay up you know and it's not a
very<00:03:57.150> heavy<00:03:57.630> heavy<00:03:58.470> device<00:03:58.950> so<00:03:59.810> it<00:04:00.810> will<00:04:00.930> look

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
very heavy heavy device so it will look

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.810 
very heavy heavy device so it will look
something<00:04:01.140> like<00:04:01.470> this<00:04:01.770> you<00:04:04.310> know<00:04:05.310> we<00:04:05.489> put<00:04:05.700> on

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
something like this you know we put on

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:13.800 
something like this you know we put on
the<00:04:05.940> ground<00:04:06.120> here<00:04:06.450> so<00:04:06.739> you<00:04:07.739> can<00:04:07.890> see

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.330 

you<00:04:14.810> know<00:04:14.930> and<00:04:15.140> then<00:04:15.230> these<00:04:15.440> two<00:04:15.770> hooks<00:04:16.010> you

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
you know and then these two hooks you

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.789 
you know and then these two hooks you
can<00:04:16.549> attach<00:04:17.450> it<00:04:17.480> somewhere<00:04:17.930> on<00:04:18.080> the<00:04:18.200> roof<00:04:18.410> or

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
can attach it somewhere on the roof or

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.400 
can attach it somewhere on the roof or
to<00:04:18.980> a<00:04:19.010> hook<00:04:19.310> on<00:04:19.459> the<00:04:19.519> roof<00:04:19.790> and<00:04:20.120> just<00:04:21.080> make<00:04:21.260> sure

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
to a hook on the roof and just make sure

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.980 
to a hook on the roof and just make sure
it's<00:04:21.590> stable<00:04:21.799> and<00:04:22.310> I<00:04:23.060> would<00:04:23.270> suggest<00:04:23.450> you<00:04:23.780> to

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
it's stable and I would suggest you to

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.810 
it's stable and I would suggest you to
coordinate<00:04:24.590> with<00:04:24.950> your<00:04:25.130> electrician<00:04:25.550> there

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
coordinate with your electrician there

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.670 
coordinate with your electrician there
to<00:04:26.030> help<00:04:26.180> you<00:04:26.360> do<00:04:26.540> this<00:04:26.690> maybe<00:04:26.960> one<00:04:27.260> or<00:04:27.380> two<00:04:27.410> of

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
to help you do this maybe one or two of

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.610 
to help you do this maybe one or two of
them<00:04:27.860> and<00:04:28.070> just<00:04:28.940> so<00:04:29.060> you<00:04:29.120> get<00:04:29.390> an<00:04:29.480> idea<00:04:29.780> but

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
them and just so you get an idea but

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.590 
them and just so you get an idea but
it's<00:04:30.980> fairly<00:04:31.250> straightforward<00:04:31.820> you<00:04:32.450> know

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
it's fairly straightforward you know

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.710 
it's fairly straightforward you know
there's<00:04:32.780> no<00:04:33.050> wiring<00:04:33.380> needed<00:04:34.450> it's<00:04:35.450> it's

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
there's no wiring needed it's it's

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.460 
there's no wiring needed it's it's
purely<00:04:36.020> a<00:04:36.170> plug-and-play<00:04:36.530> system<00:04:37.570> so<00:04:38.570> it

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
purely a plug-and-play system so it

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.110 
purely a plug-and-play system so it
should<00:04:39.650> be<00:04:39.770> very<00:04:40.040> easy<00:04:40.100> for<00:04:40.400> you<00:04:40.610> to<00:04:40.700> install

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
should be very easy for you to install

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.780 
should be very easy for you to install
and<00:04:41.390> I<00:04:42.380> hope<00:04:42.590> this<00:04:42.800> video<00:04:43.010> has<00:04:43.370> helped<00:04:43.670> you<00:04:43.730> out
