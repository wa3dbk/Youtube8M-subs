00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
about my project I got inside around the

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.680 
about my project I got inside around the
terminals<00:00:35.910> where<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:37.520> harness<00:00:38.520> connects<00:00:39.329> and

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
terminals where the harness connects and

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.150 
terminals where the harness connects and
I<00:00:40.290> cleaned<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:41.129> tip<00:00:42.260> where<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.649> injector

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
I cleaned the tip where the injector

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.459 
I cleaned the tip where the injector
snaps<00:00:44.430> into<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.879> fuel<00:00:45.120> rail<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:46.170> gas

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
snaps into the fuel rail and the gas

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.040 
snaps into the fuel rail and the gas
enters<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.280> injector<00:00:47.760> now<00:00:48.510> what<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.690> have<00:00:48.870> not

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
enters the injector now what I have not

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.350 
enters the injector now what I have not
done<00:00:49.320> yet<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:50.300> anything<00:00:51.300> with<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:53.000> actual<00:00:54.000> tip

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360

done yet is anything with the actual tip
of<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:56.180> injector<00:00:57.180> itself<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.719> spray<00:00:58.020> jet

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
of the injector itself the spray jet

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.110

slide this hose on over the tip of the

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.770 
slide this hose on over the tip of the
injector<00:03:11.630> just<00:03:11.840> by<00:03:12.020> twisting<00:03:12.680> it<00:03:13.660> until<00:03:14.660> it

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
injector just by twisting it until it

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.480 
injector just by twisting it until it
goes<00:03:14.990> over<00:03:15.290> just<00:03:16.010> like<00:03:16.190> that

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
goes over just like that

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.800 
goes over just like that

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
on my on my pulsing rig so that the

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.180 
on my on my pulsing rig so that the
whole<00:04:11.330> rig<00:04:11.570> doesn't<00:04:11.810> get<00:04:12.020> in<00:04:12.110> the<00:04:12.140> way<00:04:12.230> alright

gonna push my my button and pulse the

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.159 
gonna push my my button and pulse the
injector<00:05:23.510> and<00:05:24.470> you<00:05:25.039> can<00:05:25.190> see<00:05:25.460> right<00:05:25.820> now<00:05:26.169> which

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 
injector and you can see right now which

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:32.590 
injector and you can see right now which
is<00:05:27.199> very<00:05:27.410> interesting<00:05:27.949> that<00:05:30.100> the<00:05:31.330> solvent<00:05:32.330> is

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
is very interesting that the solvent is

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.920 
is very interesting that the solvent is
just<00:05:32.960> dripping<00:05:33.800> out<00:05:34.070> when<00:05:34.370> I<00:05:34.400> pulse<00:05:34.820> it<00:05:35.090> mister

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
just dripping out when I pulse it mister

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.540 
just dripping out when I pulse it mister
you<00:05:36.410> might<00:05:36.590> not<00:05:36.740> be<00:05:36.860> able<00:05:36.979> to<00:05:37.070> see<00:05:37.220> that<00:05:37.370> in<00:05:37.490> a

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
you might not be able to see that in a

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:43.390 
you might not be able to see that in a
jar<00:05:40.060> but<00:05:41.060> it's<00:05:41.180> just<00:05:41.389> dripping<00:05:41.660> out<00:05:42.310> so<00:05:43.310> I'm

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
jar but it's just dripping out so I'm

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.409 
jar but it's just dripping out so I'm
gonna<00:05:43.550> see<00:05:43.820> if<00:05:43.849> I<00:05:43.970> can<00:05:44.090> stand<00:05:44.360> this<00:05:44.539> camera<00:05:45.139> up

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
gonna see if I can stand this camera up

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:51.150 
gonna see if I can stand this camera up
on<00:05:47.419> its<00:05:47.570> tripod<00:05:47.930> and<00:05:48.560> now<00:05:49.340> what<00:05:49.789> I'm<00:05:49.880> gonna<00:05:50.030> do

is I'm gonna squeeze that ketchup bottle
as<00:05:55.430> I<00:05:55.669> pulse<00:05:56.000> it<00:05:56.240> and<00:05:56.419> I<00:05:56.479> get<00:05:56.630> a<00:05:56.660> nice<00:05:56.979> spray<00:05:57.979> out

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 
as I pulse it and I get a nice spray out

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.469 
as I pulse it and I get a nice spray out
of<00:05:58.280> that<00:05:58.400> injector<00:05:58.880> now<00:05:59.060> cuz<00:05:59.330> it's

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 
of that injector now cuz it's
