00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.910
 the labor lawyer in the judgment of brussels 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:11.240
 we are not going to resign ourselves quickly 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.540
 and that it came from the beginning 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.560
 But nothing more 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.429
 the 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.490
 not the public's confidence as a magician 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.289
 he is a serious man many times are answered with with magic 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.380
 just enter inside a red drop 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.609
 a doubtful 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.539
 a double two or july red 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.610
 or any other product I do not know is that it changes 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.670
 and I put it on the low I do not usually know why use 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.080
 they are statements 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.510
 under a pretext motive 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.809
 do you believe that there is a blue letter 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:49.650
 not only in the following 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.220
 when I start with my routine I show 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.790
 the red deck did not finish up 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.840
 and I tell him in public 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.500
 lara shuffles 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.820
 it's not that it's 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.900
 red but letters heats up 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.500
 will present the letter 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.300
 it's colder among others 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.600
 And it is 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.080
 exactly 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.980
 then he showed the letters that I draw 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.570
 shows the Zulu letter made a brief under the following letter the second trick 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.580
 the az of spades 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.230
 i 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.390
 he indicated 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.510
 doing a double helix at this time indicated the az of diamonds 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.510
 is the coldest letter of low toa is not the most costly hot but without 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.130
 However, if the doors 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.870
 we get 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.970
 that it turns red like the others 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.770
 obviously what you have done 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.210
 has been to turn over the double letter 2 or 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.040
 by his side 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.450
 jo so what do you think that feeling 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.610
 that you have a blue tent 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.490
 and very cleanly when the majul extraction is exactly down 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.390
 If you have no guarantee or security 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.360
 to advance this game 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.449
 with the double helix 

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:11.919
 You can apply o'brien a little pantic earth 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.820
 both 2 2 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.219
 of evil is to say to the two red sides 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:20.869
 so that few experts remain 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:24.059
 a little bit of double-sided arecibo 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:26.759
 on the red back 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:29.219
 from the side of the back 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:33.169
 this way you will be stopped you can treat both letters as one 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:35.999
 without it being returned 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:38.939
 turn it around very cleanly 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:42.739
 but they always do it on account every wait time if they take the witness 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.739
 you must have slipped little to 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:50.479
 detachment of city has exposed if part was found there is no problem 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:57.099
 not everyone already have enough in their case beyond tax minds a 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.099
 product that mulet and much better 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:02.369
 during this year 

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:04.139
 back will be bee 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:07.189
 anything that makes it possible to have the layers tacuarembÃ³ 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:11.029
 then the fruits half a turn 

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:13.569
 and it has been his first 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:14.529
 effect 

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:17.389
 that comes 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:20.979
 have a small problem and it is that this letter times that disarmed part 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:23.130
 because otherwise 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.179
 You go 

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:28.239
 love dark secret statute 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.869
 while the suppliers 

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:32.389
 will be on the letter 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:36.099
 we only have an appointment at my side where I have my decks 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:40.559
 and on the pretext of going to pick up a pen by osasuna prediction with 

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:41.529
 the same hand 

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:44.360
 from below I enter 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.480
 deposited the magna carta 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.129
 I choose the pen 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:49.510
 and except vol 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.429
 what they shuffle 

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:53.539
 without having consulted before 

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:58.120
 in a class of suspicions or while vacancies to notice people will touch 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.050
 because this one the speed in the presentation the Chilean fans I 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:03.529
 I've done 

00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:05.709
 and I do not have much respect 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.009
 each 

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:08.789
 with its everything 

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:11.509
 what is best for you 

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:14.559
 later a series of videos will be made 

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:18.279
 intended for a double two 

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:21.759
 both of a single color and of the colors 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:25.789
 I hope you liked that series you can find 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:29.919
 the whole sequence the playlist on the right side in my 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.860
 main channel 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.699
 it's not so much to playlist folders 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:36.330
 soon 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.330
 we will start 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:43.090
 the double-sided juices 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.139
 the world its immediate 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.009
 other modalities 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:51.419
 of types of letters thank you very much 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:52.320
 is already coming
