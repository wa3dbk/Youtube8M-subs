big<00:01:45.119> tank<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.540> you're<00:01:45.630> by<00:01:45.780> yourself<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:46.170> can

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
big tank and you're by yourself you can

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.850 
big tank and you're by yourself you can
jam<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.740> flap<00:01:47.750> medium-sized<00:01:48.750> flat<00:01:49.140> file<00:01:49.470> there

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
jam a flap medium-sized flat file there

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.190 
jam a flap medium-sized flat file there
and<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.189> will<00:01:50.310> hold<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.729> really<00:01:50.880> firmly<00:01:51.420> then

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
and that will hold it really firmly then

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.510 
and that will hold it really firmly then
when<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.470> tighten<00:01:52.799> up<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.070> that's<00:01:53.189> from<00:01:53.430> the

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
when you tighten up and that's from the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.700 
when you tighten up and that's from the
outside<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.060> tank<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:55.020> file<00:01:55.290> will<00:01:55.470> Jam

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
outside of the tank the file will Jam

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.709 
outside of the tank the file will Jam
against<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.130> side<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.549> tech<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:57.149> few

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
against the side of the tech a few

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.380 
against the side of the tech a few
things<00:01:57.899> like<00:01:58.110> not<00:01:58.290> without<00:01:58.640> having<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.969> people

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
things like not without having to people

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.510 
things like not without having to people
and<00:02:00.630> afterwards<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.619> just<00:02:01.649> have<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.100> flip<00:02:02.280> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
and afterwards you just have to flip the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.690 
and afterwards you just have to flip the
foil<00:02:02.759> out<00:02:03.000> again

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
foil out again

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.130 
foil out again
we'll<00:02:03.820> out<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:05.409> that's<00:02:05.560> one<00:02:05.740> tip<00:02:06.009> there

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
we'll out so that's one tip there

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.550 
we'll out so that's one tip there
obviously<00:02:08.140> I'm<00:02:08.410> using<00:02:08.470> a<00:02:10.290> expansion<00:02:11.290> tech

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
obviously I'm using a expansion tech

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.080 
obviously I'm using a expansion tech
here<00:02:11.830> because<00:02:12.129> I<00:02:12.250> want<00:02:12.430> to<00:02:12.489> use<00:02:12.610> a<00:02:12.640> cold<00:02:12.940> water

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
here because I want to use a cold water

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.600 
here because I want to use a cold water
storage<00:02:13.450> tank<00:02:13.750> it's<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.650> same<00:02:14.890> it's<00:02:15.550> just

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
storage tank it's the same it's just

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.520 
storage tank it's the same it's just
easier<00:02:16.300> to<00:02:16.420> show<00:02:16.599> you<00:02:16.660> with<00:02:16.900> this<00:02:16.989> small<00:02:17.260> tank

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
easier to show you with this small tank

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.320 
easier to show you with this small tank
that<00:02:17.680> is<00:02:17.860> a<00:02:17.890> big<00:02:18.160> cold<00:02:18.400> water<00:02:18.610> storage<00:02:18.970> tank

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
that is a big cold water storage tank

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.660 
that is a big cold water storage tank
okay<00:02:19.989> so<00:02:20.050> now<00:02:20.140> we're<00:02:20.290> going<00:02:20.380> to<00:02:20.440> fit<00:02:20.620> it<00:02:20.800> so<00:02:21.010> we

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
okay so now we're going to fit it so we

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.339 
okay so now we're going to fit it so we
put<00:02:21.819> one<00:02:21.849> poly<00:02:22.269> washer<00:02:22.569> on<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.750> inside<00:02:23.080> I'm

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
put one poly washer on the inside I'm

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.170 
put one poly washer on the inside I'm
going<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.560> put<00:02:23.680> a<00:02:23.709> little<00:02:23.980> bit<00:02:24.190> of<00:02:24.310> PTFE<00:02:24.970> tape

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
going to put a little bit of PTFE tape

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.229 
going to put a little bit of PTFE tape
now<00:02:25.959> this<00:02:26.110> is<00:02:26.290> just<00:02:26.470> purely<00:02:26.890> to<00:02:27.700> lubricate

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
now this is just purely to lubricate

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.199 
now this is just purely to lubricate
thread<00:02:28.720> and<00:02:29.190> just<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:30.310> give<00:02:30.459> it<00:02:30.489> a<00:02:30.640> little<00:02:30.910> tiny

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
thread and just to give it a little tiny

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.449 
thread and just to give it a little tiny
seal<00:02:31.599> on<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:31.989> thread

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
seal on the thread

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.160 
seal on the thread
you<00:02:34.000> see<00:02:34.180> I've<00:02:34.269> only<00:02:34.360> put<00:02:34.599> a<00:02:34.629> little<00:02:34.810> tiny<00:02:35.049> bit

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
you see I've only put a little tiny bit

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.680 
you see I've only put a little tiny bit
like<00:02:35.410> you<00:02:35.500> must<00:02:35.680> put<00:02:35.860> too<00:02:35.980> much<00:02:36.160> on<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:37.299> reason

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
like you must put too much on the reason

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.960 
like you must put too much on the reason
I'm<00:02:37.870> putting<00:02:38.019> a<00:02:38.200> bit<00:02:38.349> on<00:02:38.470> is<00:02:38.650> when<00:02:39.489> you<00:02:39.610> cut<00:02:39.849> the

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
I'm putting a bit on is when you cut the

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.910 
I'm putting a bit on is when you cut the
hole<00:02:40.180> in<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.720> tank<00:02:40.900> with<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.230> hole<00:02:41.410> cut<00:02:41.650> with

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
hole in the tank with the hole cut with

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.710 
hole in the tank with the hole cut with
thread<00:02:42.480> our<00:02:43.480> circular<00:02:43.989> holes<00:02:44.200> saw<00:02:45.060> or<00:02:46.060> a

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
thread our circular holes saw or a

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.330 
thread our circular holes saw or a
cutter

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
cutter

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.940 
cutter
it's<00:02:49.269> very<00:02:49.540> tight<00:02:49.810> fit<00:02:50.049> you<00:02:50.200> see<00:02:50.380> live<00:02:50.590> tropic

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
it's very tight fit you see live tropic

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.979 
it's very tight fit you see live tropic
screwing<00:02:51.370> that<00:02:51.519> through<00:02:51.849> yeah<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.329> that<00:02:52.420> PTFE

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
screwing that through yeah and that PTFE

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.050 
screwing that through yeah and that PTFE
tape<00:02:53.200> just<00:02:53.650> helps<00:02:54.069> a<00:02:54.250> bit<00:02:54.489> screw<00:02:54.819> through<00:02:55.000> the

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
tape just helps a bit screw through the

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.720 
tape just helps a bit screw through the
plastic<00:02:55.500> yeah<00:02:56.500> that's<00:02:56.920> good<00:02:57.220> that's<00:02:57.250> a<00:02:57.549> nice

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
plastic yeah that's good that's a nice

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.699 
plastic yeah that's good that's a nice
tight<00:02:58.030> fit<00:02:58.269> don't<00:02:58.569> even<00:02:58.989> consider<00:02:59.349> about

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
tight fit don't even consider about

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.979 
tight fit don't even consider about
heating<00:03:00.579> up<00:03:00.700> my<00:03:00.790> knife<00:03:00.970> cutting<00:03:01.450> a<00:03:01.569> hold<00:03:01.780> or

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
heating up my knife cutting a hold or

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.500 
heating up my knife cutting a hold or
heating<00:03:02.319> up<00:03:02.410> a<00:03:02.440> bit<00:03:02.530> pushing<00:03:03.250> me<00:03:03.400> through

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
heating up a bit pushing me through

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.240 
heating up a bit pushing me through
because<00:03:04.510> it<00:03:04.599> will<00:03:04.720> chemically<00:03:05.260> change<00:03:05.590> the

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
because it will chemically change the

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.309 
because it will chemically change the
area<00:03:06.849> of<00:03:06.940> plastic<00:03:07.329> around<00:03:07.450> a<00:03:07.630> hole<00:03:07.810> I<00:03:08.019> think

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
area of plastic around a hole I think

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.680 
area of plastic around a hole I think
after<00:03:08.920> a<00:03:09.190> while<00:03:09.340> you<00:03:09.670> start<00:03:10.239> to<00:03:10.269> have<00:03:10.389> a<00:03:10.450> leak

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
after a while you start to have a leak

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.410 
after a while you start to have a leak
after<00:03:11.019> a<00:03:11.049> couple<00:03:11.260> months<00:03:11.470> or<00:03:11.739> a<00:03:12.040> year<00:03:12.100> or<00:03:12.310> so<00:03:12.549> so

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
after a couple months or a year or so so

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.670 
after a couple months or a year or so so
the<00:03:13.569> other<00:03:13.690> poly<00:03:13.959> washer<00:03:14.230> goes<00:03:14.350> on<00:03:14.500> outside

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
the other poly washer goes on outside

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.620 
the other poly washer goes on outside
like<00:03:15.130> you<00:03:15.190> just<00:03:15.340> say<00:03:15.549> and<00:03:16.030> you<00:03:16.180> put<00:03:16.359> the<00:03:16.450> back

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
like you just say and you put the back

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.800 
like you just say and you put the back
up<00:03:17.190> yeah<00:03:18.250> then<00:03:18.519> you<00:03:18.670> need<00:03:18.819> either<00:03:19.120> to<00:03:19.420> use<00:03:19.690> the

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
up yeah then you need either to use the

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.420 
up yeah then you need either to use the
file<00:03:20.049> which<00:03:20.440> you<00:03:20.560> can<00:03:20.680> do<00:03:20.769> any<00:03:20.950> jam<00:03:21.220> it<00:03:21.340> in

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
file which you can do any jam it in

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.000 
file which you can do any jam it in
between<00:03:21.639> the<00:03:22.120> two<00:03:22.269> locks<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:23.319> it<00:03:23.500> over<00:03:23.769> hold

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
between the two locks and it over hold

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.240 
between the two locks and it over hold
it<00:03:24.190> or<00:03:24.389> use<00:03:25.389> a<00:03:25.420> pair<00:03:25.750> grips<00:03:26.049> or<00:03:26.290> water<00:03:26.980> pot

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
it or use a pair grips or water pot

someone over to very low hops or you use
the<00:03:41.670> foil<00:03:41.910> like<00:03:42.210> a<00:03:42.240> certain<00:03:42.600> like<00:03:42.720> jamming<00:03:43.260> it

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
the foil like a certain like jamming it

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.800 
the foil like a certain like jamming it
no<00:03:43.530> Jam<00:03:44.040> against<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.400> side<00:03:44.610> of<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:44.820> tank<00:03:45.030> okay

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
so you hold that and then you tighten up

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.830 
so you hold that and then you tighten up
the<00:03:47.580> outside<00:03:48.470> that's<00:03:49.470> reasonably<00:03:50.010> tight<00:03:50.840> and

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
poly washer which would you just poo

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.220 
poly washer which would you just poo
that's<00:04:08.910> helped<00:04:09.180> lubricated<00:04:09.840> a<00:04:09.900> bit<00:04:10.050> that

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
that's helped lubricated a bit that

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.560 
that's helped lubricated a bit that
that's<00:04:10.410> a<00:04:10.530> good<00:04:10.710> thing<00:04:10.860> about<00:04:10.980> PTFE<00:04:11.640> tape<00:04:11.850> it's

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
that's a good thing about PTFE tape it's

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.710 
that's a good thing about PTFE tape it's
also<00:04:12.840> good<00:04:13.170> as<00:04:13.260> a<00:04:13.290> lubricant<00:04:13.860> on<00:04:14.010> threads<00:04:14.720> so

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
also good as a lubricant on threads so

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.020 
also good as a lubricant on threads so
now<00:04:15.930> make<00:04:16.080> sure<00:04:16.110> you<00:04:16.320> get<00:04:16.380> your<00:04:16.560> right<00:04:16.680> nut

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
tell by sight but if you just wind it up

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.300 
tell by sight but if you just wind it up
again<00:04:22.110> it<00:04:22.200> check<00:04:22.440> put<00:04:22.650> your<00:04:22.770> olive<00:04:22.980> on<00:04:23.100> make

not live to hold against yeah I use a
spanner<00:04:57.469> on<00:04:58.309> these<00:04:58.519> nuts<00:04:58.759> if<00:04:58.909> you<00:04:58.939> can't<00:04:59.239> it

00:04:59.439 --> 00:04:59.449 
spanner on these nuts if you can't it

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:01.899 
spanner on these nuts if you can't it
just<00:04:59.899> doesn't<00:05:00.379> bark<00:05:00.589> it<00:05:00.769> as<00:05:00.860> much<00:05:01.039> here<00:05:01.879> so

it's good to have a nice big adjustable

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.909 
it's good to have a nice big adjustable
spanner

spanner

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:06.399 
spanner
so<00:05:04.549> grip<00:05:04.789> it<00:05:04.909> slightly<00:05:05.089> on<00:05:05.360> the<00:05:05.449> inside<00:05:05.809> and
