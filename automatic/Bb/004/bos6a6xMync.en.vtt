if<00:00:08.280> you<00:00:08.580> remember<00:00:08.820> last<00:00:08.970> time<00:00:09.090> I<00:00:09.300> decided<00:00:09.599> to

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
if you remember last time I decided to

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.150 
if you remember last time I decided to
drive<00:00:09.990> down<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.410> train<00:00:10.590> tracks<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:10.889> sort<00:00:11.099> of

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
drive down the train tracks and sort of

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.259 
drive down the train tracks and sort of
see<00:00:11.250> how<00:00:11.400> far<00:00:11.639> you<00:00:11.790> can<00:00:11.820> go

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
see how far you can go

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.999 
see how far you can go
turns<00:00:12.690> out<00:00:12.900> not<00:00:13.080> very<00:00:13.139> far<00:00:13.530> because<00:00:13.650> there's<00:00:13.889> a

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
turns out not very far because there's a

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.320 
turns out not very far because there's a
bunch<00:00:14.250> of<00:00:14.370> invisible<00:00:14.790> walls<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.089> everything

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
bunch of invisible walls and everything

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.260 
bunch of invisible walls and everything
like<00:00:15.420> that<00:00:15.480> but<00:00:15.809> if<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:17.220> turn<00:00:17.430> around<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:18.000> go

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
like that but if you turn around and go

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.820 
like that but if you turn around and go
the<00:00:18.300> other<00:00:18.570> way<00:00:18.690> some<00:00:19.380> pretty<00:00:19.560> interesting

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
the other way some pretty interesting

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.460 
the other way some pretty interesting
things<00:00:20.070> happen<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:20.789> I<00:00:21.029> wanted<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.689> sort<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:21.960> try

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
things happen so I wanted to sort of try

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.810 
things happen so I wanted to sort of try
it<00:00:22.500> today<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:22.890> sort<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.160> show<00:00:23.430> you<00:00:23.460> guys<00:00:23.640> how

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
it today and sort of show you guys how

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.060 
it today and sort of show you guys how
to<00:00:23.850> do<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:24.570> also<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.380> realized<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.740> much<00:00:25.920> better

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
to do it also I realized a much better

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.920 
to do it also I realized a much better
way<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.279> getting<00:00:26.550> in<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.449> sort<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.720> cover

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
way of getting in is to sort of cover

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.589 
way of getting in is to sort of cover
this<00:00:28.289> sort<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.740> angle<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:30.179> have<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.390> sort

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
this sort of angle and you have to sort

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.810 
this sort of angle and you have to sort
of<00:00:30.720> get<00:00:30.840> stuck<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.890> tree<00:00:32.189> so<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.430> may<00:00:32.700> need

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
of get stuck in the tree so I may need

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.970 
of get stuck in the tree so I may need
to<00:00:32.940> actually<00:00:33.059> go<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.390> get<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.540> faster<00:00:34.140> car<00:00:34.620> for

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
to actually go and get a faster car for

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.049 
to actually go and get a faster car for
this<00:00:35.130> or<00:00:35.399> not<00:00:37.280> or<00:00:38.280> it'll<00:00:38.460> just<00:00:38.610> work<00:00:38.700> like<00:00:38.760> the

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
this or not or it'll just work like the

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.310 
this or not or it'll just work like the
third<00:00:39.239> time<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.719> -<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:41.399> okay<00:00:41.489> last<00:00:42.480> time<00:00:42.750> you

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
third time that - so okay last time you

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.319 
third time that - so okay last time you
may<00:00:43.469> have<00:00:43.590> remembered<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:44.129> drove<00:00:44.700> this<00:00:44.850> way<00:00:45.090> and

invisible

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.449 
invisible
although<00:02:13.740> yeah<00:02:14.870> we<00:02:15.870> should<00:02:16.020> try<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.400> so<00:02:17.400> this

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
although yeah we should try that so this

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.020 
although yeah we should try that so this
is<00:02:17.640> totally<00:02:18.180> how<00:02:19.050> forts<00:02:19.470> is<00:02:19.560> mentioned<00:02:20.030> some

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
is totally how forts is mentioned some

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.180 
is totally how forts is mentioned some
cars<00:02:21.240> up<00:02:21.390> there<00:02:21.480> these<00:02:21.630> having<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:21.959> fight<00:02:22.190> this

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
cars up there these having to fight this

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.670 
cars up there these having to fight this
is<00:02:23.370> how<00:02:23.459> forts<00:02:23.760> is<00:02:23.850> meant<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.060> be<00:02:24.150> played<00:02:24.360> with

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
is how forts is meant to be played with

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.540 
is how forts is meant to be played with
massive<00:02:25.680> glitches<00:02:26.069> it<00:02:26.190> makes<00:02:26.310> it<00:02:26.400> much<00:02:26.490> better

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
massive glitches it makes it much better

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.580 
massive glitches it makes it much better
that<00:02:27.540> is<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.780> best<00:02:27.990> spot<00:02:28.230> for<00:02:28.290> hide-and-seek

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
that is the best spot for hide-and-seek

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.830 
that is the best spot for hide-and-seek
if<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:29.700> knew<00:02:29.910> about<00:02:30.060> this<00:02:30.300> before<00:02:30.569> we<00:02:30.690> fell

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
if I knew about this before we fell

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.270 
if I knew about this before we fell
behind<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.200> seek<00:02:31.290> video<00:02:31.500> so<00:02:31.709> I<00:02:31.920> totally<00:02:32.069> would

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
behind and seek video so I totally would

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.070 
behind and seek video so I totally would
have<00:02:32.370> done<00:02:32.459> it<00:02:32.780> next<00:02:33.780> time<00:02:33.840> we<00:02:33.959> do<00:02:34.050> it

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
have done it next time we do it

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.510 
have done it next time we do it
hopefully<00:02:34.709> no<00:02:34.920> one<00:02:35.040> else<00:02:35.160> is<00:02:35.220> watching<00:02:35.310> the

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
hopefully no one else is watching the

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.510 
hopefully no one else is watching the
stream<00:02:35.610> I'm<00:02:35.819> coming<00:02:36.180> down<00:02:36.330> here<00:02:37.190> I'm<00:02:38.190> totally

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
stream I'm coming down here I'm totally

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.650 
stream I'm coming down here I'm totally
coming<00:02:38.850> down<00:02:39.030> here<00:02:39.150> because<00:02:39.239> you<00:02:39.330> can<00:02:39.480> see

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
coming down here because you can see

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.320 
coming down here because you can see
through<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:40.020> floor<00:02:40.260> you<00:02:40.739> see<00:02:40.920> everyone<00:02:41.330> so

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
through the floor you see everyone so

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.410 
through the floor you see everyone so
let's<00:02:42.480> see<00:02:42.569> how<00:02:42.750> far<00:02:43.050> we<00:02:43.440> can<00:02:44.000> not<00:02:45.000> that<00:02:45.180> hard

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
let's see how far we can not that hard

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.410 
let's see how far we can not that hard
where<00:02:45.870> are<00:02:45.930> we<00:02:45.989> going<00:02:46.580> why<00:02:47.580> is<00:02:47.610> this<00:02:47.850> why<00:02:48.390> is

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
where are we going why is this why is

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.949 
where are we going why is this why is
this<00:02:48.600> all<00:02:48.810> mapped<00:02:49.940> why<00:02:50.940> is<00:02:51.000> this<00:02:51.300> a<00:02:51.360> thing<00:02:51.720> okay

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
this all mapped why is this a thing okay

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.040 
this all mapped why is this a thing okay
so<00:02:52.500> we've<00:02:52.709> got<00:02:52.739> nope<00:02:53.480> maybe<00:02:54.480> don't<00:02:54.750> I<00:02:54.810> mapped

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
so we've got nope maybe don't I mapped

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.500 
so we've got nope maybe don't I mapped
until<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.410> actual<00:02:55.680> train<00:02:56.040> track<00:02:56.370> so<00:02:57.030> there

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
until the actual train track so there

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.309 
until the actual train track so there
you<00:02:57.630> go<00:02:57.780> if<00:02:57.959> you<00:02:58.080> turn<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.830> other<00:02:58.860> way<00:03:00.170> you<00:03:01.170> can

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
you go if you turn the other way you can

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.650 
you go if you turn the other way you can
come<00:03:01.500> over<00:03:01.620> here<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:02.160> have<00:03:02.790> some<00:03:02.910> fun<00:03:02.970> I<00:03:03.360> don't
