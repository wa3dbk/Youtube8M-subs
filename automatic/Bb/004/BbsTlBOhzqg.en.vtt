00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.489

 world in levels to levels in 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.440
 the levels there are different eggs that 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.110
 contain objects inside and the player 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.750
 the earth 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.030
 hit them has been a break and collect the 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.009
 objects the outer side I put a 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.720
 simple game system buttons are 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.720
 used to jump and swallow 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.150
 we have basically eight areas each 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.620
 divided into four rounds 11 12 13 14 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.060
 each area has a boss who always 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.060
 present of rock 4 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.460
 and now we have to go jumping from the 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.170
 fruits like this we always have time 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.110
 in this case we have hammer for the most 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.730
 beyond the theory of the little angel we passed and 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.909
 we have everything 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:51.149
 but later we also have 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.829
 of party have a kind of 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.310
 boleadoras rebounder almost how 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.750
 they call 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.750
 what does basically the same thing 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.090
 we do not have skips we are 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:12.670
 it's always possible 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.670
 I have gone from battle to try to go 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.980
 next screen 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.599
 but the 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.599
 this area 12 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.170
 but I have to kill these octopuses 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.400
 that sometimes get tough 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.380
 to kill them 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.970
 the other 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.590
 or not 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.590
 there was something I do not agree 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.660
 fruits and so grab it when 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.660
 see you in recent time 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.130
 I have to give them the pockets this 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.130
 jumps 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.630
 Islam also known as the island 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.800
 the islander 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.090
 on these sides 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.090
 let's go to an islander 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.620
 but we have the octopus between seeing you two 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.620
 years and to kill him 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.950
 and it fell but it's a little bit further 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.990
 according to the many treacherous 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.909
 Phew 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:39.290
 little angel 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.290
 I take 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.290
 everyone 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.060
 bid 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
 l 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.180
 t 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:04.040
 as it is quite simple besides a 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.040
 pretty long game 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.630
 Here you have to run keeping the button 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.760
 like mario and run faster and 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.260
 jump a little away from me 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.910
 I forgot to do as you saw 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:23.090
 and mental and as the best 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:26.930
 but good can happen as I said and 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.930
 save it save it anything 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.060
 I have to dedicate hours and hours a 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:37.930
 once done by the console nothing 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.930
 that one needs and we pass screen 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.570
 since the next part is coming 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.570
 bats if I'm not mistaken 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.639
 it seems to me it seems seems to me it appears 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.680
 divinity 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:56.680
 and hammer 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.490
 good all this bothers me 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.490
 bats are difficult 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:15.810
 good people this was the adventure island 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.180
