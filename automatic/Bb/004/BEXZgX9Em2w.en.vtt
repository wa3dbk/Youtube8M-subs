for<00:00:08.610> time<00:00:08.639> we're<00:00:08.940> going<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.090> do<00:00:09.180> something<00:00:09.389> a

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
for time we're going to do something a

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.420 
for time we're going to do something a
little<00:00:09.660> bit<00:00:09.870> different<00:00:10.380> we're<00:00:11.040> going<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.309> look

little bit different we're going to look

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.230 
little bit different we're going to look
at<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.330> three<00:00:12.600> distinct<00:00:13.110> orders<00:00:13.530> of

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240 
at the the three distinct orders of

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.320 
at the the three distinct orders of
classical<00:00:15.240> ancient<00:00:15.660> Greek<00:00:16.139> architecture<00:00:16.379> and

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
classical ancient Greek architecture and

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.730 
classical ancient Greek architecture and
the<00:00:18.330> names<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.690> those<00:00:18.840> three<00:00:19.050> orders<00:00:19.320> are<00:00:19.529> the

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
the names of those three orders are the

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.280 
the names of those three orders are the
Doric<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.670> ionic<00:00:21.120> and<00:00:21.300> then<00:00:21.750> later<00:00:22.080> the

Doric the ionic and then later the

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.070 
Doric the ionic and then later the
Corinthian<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.240> those<00:00:24.240> three<00:00:24.480> orders<00:00:24.780> as<00:00:24.960> I

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
Corinthian and those three orders as I

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.110 
Corinthian and those three orders as I
said<00:00:25.290> were<00:00:25.490> developed<00:00:26.490> in<00:00:26.580> ancient<00:00:26.760> Greece

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:27.120 
said were developed in ancient Greece

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.640 
said were developed in ancient Greece
but<00:00:27.330> they<00:00:27.420> were<00:00:27.510> later<00:00:27.690> adopted<00:00:28.260> by<00:00:28.500> the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
but they were later adopted by the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.640 
but they were later adopted by the
Romans<00:00:29.190> which<00:00:29.940> occurred<00:00:30.300> in<00:00:30.420> about<00:00:30.690> the<00:00:31.380> 1st

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
Romans which occurred in about the 1st

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.630 
Romans which occurred in about the 1st
century<00:00:31.800> BC<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:33.050> then<00:00:34.050> these<00:00:34.649> three<00:00:35.039> Greek

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
century BC and then these three Greek

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.029 
century BC and then these three Greek
classical<00:00:36.090> orders<00:00:36.270> have<00:00:36.829> consistently<00:00:37.829> since

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:38.039 
classical orders have consistently since

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:41.329 
classical orders have consistently since
then<00:00:38.309> been<00:00:39.030> used<00:00:39.329> in<00:00:39.629> neoclassical<00:00:40.350> European

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:41.339 
then been used in neoclassical European

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:42.829 
then been used in neoclassical European
architecture<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.030> you'll<00:00:42.120> see<00:00:42.269> examples<00:00:42.569> of

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:42.839 
architecture and you'll see examples of

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:46.220 
architecture and you'll see examples of
these<00:00:42.929> columns<00:00:43.760> everywhere<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.230> that's

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
these columns everywhere and that's

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.899 
these columns everywhere and that's
really<00:00:46.379> what<00:00:46.559> neoclassical<00:00:47.190> architecture<00:00:47.760> is

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:47.909 
really what neoclassical architecture is

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:49.729 
really what neoclassical architecture is
it's<00:00:48.149> incorporating<00:00:48.839> these<00:00:48.960> ancient<00:00:49.440> Greek

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
it's incorporating these ancient Greek

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.130 
it's incorporating these ancient Greek
and<00:00:49.920> also<00:00:50.640> ancient<00:00:50.819> Roman<00:00:51.359> classical<00:00:51.989> orders

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
and also ancient Roman classical orders

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.349 
and also ancient Roman classical orders
the<00:00:52.409> Romans<00:00:52.739> adopted<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.729> Greek<00:00:53.879> orders<00:00:54.120> and

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359 
the Romans adopted the Greek orders and

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:56.059 
the Romans adopted the Greek orders and
then<00:00:54.449> kind<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.719> refined<00:00:55.079> them<00:00:55.289> but

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:56.069 
then kind of refined them but

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:57.529 
then kind of refined them but
incorporating<00:00:56.550> those<00:00:56.729> ancient<00:00:57.059> styles<00:00:57.389> into

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
incorporating those ancient styles into

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.410 
incorporating those ancient styles into
modern<00:00:58.069> architecture<00:00:59.069> as<00:00:59.219> well<00:00:59.269> so<00:01:00.269> look

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
modern architecture as well so look

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.639 
modern architecture as well so look
around<00:01:00.539> next<00:01:00.899> time<00:01:01.019> you<00:01:01.109> see<00:01:01.229> a<00:01:01.260> building<00:01:01.469> with

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
around next time you see a building with

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.889 
around next time you see a building with
columns<00:01:01.979> and<00:01:02.039> see<00:01:02.219> if<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.339> can<00:01:02.460> identify

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
columns and see if you can identify

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.430 
columns and see if you can identify
which<00:01:03.899> type<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.530> order<00:01:05.040> it's<00:01:05.670> based<00:01:05.970> upon<00:01:06.440> okay

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
which type of order it's based upon okay

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.960 
which type of order it's based upon okay
the<00:01:07.560> first<00:01:07.680> order<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.250> Doric<00:01:08.550> order<00:01:08.670> and

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
the first order is the Doric order and

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.850 
the first order is the Doric order and
this<00:01:09.030> originated<00:01:09.690> from<00:01:09.870> the<00:01:10.050> mainland<00:01:10.500> and

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
this originated from the mainland and

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.450 
this originated from the mainland and
Western<00:01:11.520> Greece<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.560> it's<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.890> simplest<00:01:14.310> of

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
Western Greece and it's the simplest of

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.160 
Western Greece and it's the simplest of
all<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.730> the<00:01:14.850> orders<00:01:15.180> typically

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
all of the orders typically

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.760 
all of the orders typically
characterized<00:01:16.680> by<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.950> short<00:01:17.850> heavy<00:01:18.210> column

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
characterized by a short heavy column

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.430 
characterized by a short heavy column
with<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.800> plain<00:01:20.190> round<00:01:21.030> capital<00:01:21.510> and<00:01:21.900> there's

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
with a plain round capital and there's

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.840 
with a plain round capital and there's
some<00:01:22.590> terminology<00:01:23.130> associated<00:01:23.370> with

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
some terminology associated with

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.670 
some terminology associated with
architecture<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.780> specifically<00:01:25.260> columns

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
architecture and specifically columns

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.960 
architecture and specifically columns
which<00:01:25.800> I'm<00:01:25.920> going<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.100> introduce<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.760> here

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
which I'm going to introduce you to here

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.870 
which I'm going to introduce you to here
the<00:01:27.420> capital<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.320> just<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.560> rounded<00:01:29.010> top<00:01:29.160> of

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
the capital is just the rounded top of

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.380 
the capital is just the rounded top of
the<00:01:30.030> column<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:31.470> Doric<00:01:32.000> columns<00:01:33.000> typically

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
the column the Doric columns typically

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.700 
the column the Doric columns typically
don't<00:01:33.630> have<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> defined<00:01:34.560> base<00:01:34.980> or<00:01:35.280> plinth<00:01:36.710> some

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
don't have a defined base or plinth some

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.960 
don't have a defined base or plinth some
of<00:01:37.830> them<00:01:37.920> view<00:01:38.100> obviously<00:01:38.520> there's<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.730> lot<00:01:38.850> of

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
of them view obviously there's a lot of

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.640 
of them view obviously there's a lot of
variation<00:01:39.420> but<00:01:39.600> traditionally<00:01:40.290> there<00:01:40.410> was<00:01:40.500> no

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
variation but traditionally there was no

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.590 
variation but traditionally there was no
base<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.160> the<00:01:41.820> height<00:01:42.000> was<00:01:42.300> also

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
base and the height was also

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.970 
base and the height was also
traditionally<00:01:43.080> only<00:01:43.320> about<00:01:43.500> four<00:01:43.830> to<00:01:43.920> eight

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980 
traditionally only about four to eight

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.400 
traditionally only about four to eight
times<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.850> diameter<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.540> column<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
times the diameter of the column so the

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.060 
times the diameter of the column so the
columns<00:01:46.770> were<00:01:47.000> typically<00:01:48.000> very<00:01:48.480> squat<00:01:49.200> very

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
columns were typically very squat very

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.850 
columns were typically very squat very
fat<00:01:50.580> and<00:01:50.610> short<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.840> course<00:01:52.140> like<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.650> said

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
fat and short of course like I said

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.260 
fat and short of course like I said
there's<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.100> lot<00:01:53.190> of<00:01:53.280> variation<00:01:53.790> on<00:01:53.910> that<00:01:54.090> and

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
there's a lot of variation on that and

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.350 
there's a lot of variation on that and
they<00:01:55.260> aren't<00:01:55.530> necessarily<00:01:56.010> always<00:01:56.700> between

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
they aren't necessarily always between

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.850 
they aren't necessarily always between
four<00:01:57.690> and<00:01:57.720> eight<00:01:57.810> times<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.170> diameter<00:01:58.320> today

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
four and eight times the diameter today

the best picture but you can kind of see

the best picture but you can kind of see
why<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:55.710> would<00:02:55.830> be<00:02:55.860> called<00:02:56.130> an<00:02:56.220> egg<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.520> dart

shape and the ionic shaft typically came

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.270 
shape and the ionic shaft typically came
with<00:03:05.070> four<00:03:05.370> more<00:03:05.580> flutes<00:03:05.910> than<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:07.140> Doric<00:03:07.650> so

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
with four more flutes than the Doric so

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.090 
with four more flutes than the Doric so
it<00:03:08.490> had<00:03:08.640> 24<00:03:09.270> little<00:03:09.600> flutes<00:03:10.380> channeled<00:03:10.890> into

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
it had 24 little flutes channeled into

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.280 
it had 24 little flutes channeled into
the<00:03:11.190> column<00:03:11.550> as<00:03:11.670> opposed<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.720> 20<00:03:13.050> that<00:03:13.170> we

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
the column as opposed to the 20 that we

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.530 
the column as opposed to the 20 that we
saw<00:03:13.410> on<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.560> Doric<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:15.060> column<00:03:15.390> of<00:03:15.480> the

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
saw on the Doric and the column of the

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.310 
saw on the Doric and the column of the
ionic<00:03:15.960> order<00:03:16.140> was<00:03:16.320> typically<00:03:16.740> nine<00:03:17.400> or<00:03:17.730> fewer

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
ionic order was typically nine or fewer

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.710 
ionic order was typically nine or fewer
diameters<00:03:19.320> and<00:03:20.150> so<00:03:21.150> here's<00:03:21.360> another<00:03:21.540> example

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
diameters and so here's another example

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.140 
diameters and so here's another example
of<00:03:22.080> kind<00:03:22.350> of<00:03:22.440> been<00:03:22.590> trying<00:03:22.830> to<00:03:22.890> show<00:03:23.040> you<00:03:23.150> an

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:02.810 
some detail maybe that can help the
economy<00:04:00.920> into<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:01.950> shaft<00:04:02.250> of<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.520> Corinthian

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
economy into the shaft of the Corinthian

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.210 
economy into the shaft of the Corinthian
order<00:04:03.180> like<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:03.570> ionic<00:04:03.990> typically<00:04:04.500> also<00:04:04.890> has

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
order like the ionic typically also has

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.310 
order like the ionic typically also has
24<00:04:05.700> flutes<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:06.300> the<00:04:06.660> column<00:04:06.900> is<00:04:07.020> usually<00:04:07.260> a

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
24 flutes and the column is usually a

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.560 
24 flutes and the column is usually a
little<00:04:07.410> bit<00:04:07.590> higher<00:04:07.860> than<00:04:08.460> either<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.150> Doric

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
little bit higher than either the Doric

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.570 
little bit higher than either the Doric
or<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:09.810> ionic<00:04:10.110> typically<00:04:10.920> about<00:04:11.520> 10

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
or the ionic typically about 10

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.230 
or the ionic typically about 10
diameters<00:04:12.390> high<00:04:13.610> so<00:04:14.610> one<00:04:14.760> last<00:04:14.850> thing<00:04:15.000> that<00:04:15.120> I

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
diameters high so one last thing that I

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.150 
diameters high so one last thing that I
think<00:04:15.480> maybe<00:04:15.660> is<00:04:15.840> worth<00:04:15.990> mentioning<00:04:16.440> is<00:04:16.620> this

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
think maybe is worth mentioning is this

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.520 
think maybe is worth mentioning is this
church<00:04:17.489> which<00:04:17.760> is<00:04:18.200> remarkable<00:04:19.200> in<00:04:19.320> that<00:04:19.350> it

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
church which is remarkable in that it

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.039 
church which is remarkable in that it
actually<00:04:19.710> shows<00:04:20.070> all<00:04:20.370> three<00:04:20.730> orders<00:04:21.120> of<00:04:21.150> the

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
actually shows all three orders of the

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.210 
actually shows all three orders of the

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
classical Greek architecture on

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630
