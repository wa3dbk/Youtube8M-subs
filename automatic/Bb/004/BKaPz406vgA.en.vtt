00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:03.300
 Hello and welcome to another video of me 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.470
 In this video I would like to show you the bug in StarCraft 2 b 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.539
 can give 

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:12.529
 namely with the error of the right out of the no longer possible makes StarCraft 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:14.409
 2 to maximize 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:16.789
 that is, it minimizes the game 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.470
 do you want something on the internet Arraf comes back after two minutes 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.580
 so outside Firefox is to narrow volumes and wealth Stockhoff 2 again 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:26.539
 maximize 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.499
 and it does not work, it hangs and if you're Maximin 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:32.890
 completely always just a black screen 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.300
 or sinks down on you can then according to the still 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.080
 End task manager 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.640
 the problem in itself until recently also does not want to be more busy 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.360
 I have finally found a solution 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.680
 lips 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.940
 that needs most only when the graphics cards on 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.670
 I filtered out of the information and 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.010
 how you can possibly solve this in the end is in the 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.010
 that's the program that attacks something like pools 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.510
 and that is one 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.450
 on the bass right test setup the 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.000
 the graphics driver can give the Stuhr 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.280
 you will now live Anaya Racer me so great graphics driver and 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.400
 to fire up 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.200
 but who, for example, like me, was quite often full and just the one over 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.470
 the other graphics driver has installed you will generally do anyway 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.640
 but I should have done it too 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.910
 Furniture 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.020
 and 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.490
 That's why I'm just now how to do that then 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.719
 and then the problem of the errors should not come anymore 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.300
 exercised 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.300
 Provincial in the quite normal 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.900
 a test for symbolically practical and the like Blair we do not want this 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.580
 Soft creeps more 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.300
 as soon as it installs 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.300
 then it just starts 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.530
 whether the family does not live on all 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.250
 but that Clegg 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.690
 Put it on the day when it's easy and press Clean then it'll throw everything away 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:05.249
 from 

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:08.249
 Artie graphics card driver so to the readers of Artie 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.819
 Welder down all display related stuff 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.819
 and then the ones on the homepage of it 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:19.389
 what no money from com or as nice and get seats on it 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.499
 then go right to the corner here and support something like that 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:27.229
 World Heritage BaFin card on it 

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:29.699
 and thereby the drivers euro on it 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:32.349
 but again this 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.999
 after this in the market so this box then minute everything 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:39.919
 the display PZ Ravel 

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:40.979
 concerns 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:44.409
 if you then advertise the Clean 1 Clean Gold Race After the Rain 

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:47.419
 the form hangs as this from her 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:51.480
 and the program will show general TAS Manager as no feedback 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.099
 but it did not surprise that this just ended in peace 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.539
 So do not end it with haas-manager but just 

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:00.029
 Run clock 

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:03.029
 and after that, whichever new location to states will ask the best 

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:07.269
 then install the startup card driver and again to new 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.209
 after that, Stockhoff is supposed to maximize two without problems 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.979
 Minimize was his 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:16.189
 and yet, I definitely helped with it, and I had a pretty long time with it 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:19.430
 Problems and distemper in Lienz also written by said period 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.549
 and he could ultimately help with this animal then wanted 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.699
 I just now just spread it so that other people may not be that way 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:29.609
 long as I dealt with it 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:33.099
 of course I would like to thank you again and I hope so 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:34.209
 could help you 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.489
 First of all bye bye
