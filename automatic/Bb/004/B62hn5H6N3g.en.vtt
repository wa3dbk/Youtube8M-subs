00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210

running<00:00:51.820> dual<00:00:52.720> shocks<00:00:53.110> off<00:00:53.440> your<00:00:53.920> gy<00:00:54.519> sixes

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
running dual shocks off your gy sixes

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.930

well i'm only running on mono shock and

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.850 
well i'm only running on mono shock and
I<00:01:00.940> noticed<00:01:01.629> that<00:01:02.129> brace<00:01:03.129> had<00:01:03.430> these<00:01:03.699> two<00:01:04.860> pegs

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
I noticed that brace had these two pegs

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.469 
I noticed that brace had these two pegs
I<00:01:06.250> don't<00:01:06.790> know<00:01:06.880> wherever<00:01:07.060> the<00:01:07.240> hell<00:01:07.360> they<00:01:07.390> are

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
I don't know wherever the hell they are

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.680 
I don't know wherever the hell they are
coming<00:01:07.960> off<00:01:08.080> of<00:01:08.110> it<00:01:08.380> well<00:01:09.130> these<00:01:09.909> pegs<00:01:10.240> are

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
coming off of it well these pegs are

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.460 
coming off of it well these pegs are
threaded<00:01:11.140> and<00:01:11.830> I<00:01:11.920> think<00:01:12.250> maybe<00:01:12.460> it<00:01:12.670> was<00:01:12.820> for

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
threaded and I think maybe it was for

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.840 
threaded and I think maybe it was for
holding<00:01:14.470> the<00:01:14.590> exhaust<00:01:14.920> on<00:01:15.190> I<00:01:15.430> don't<00:01:16.240> know<00:01:16.330> but

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
this you know jerry-rigged tool I was

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.110 
this you know jerry-rigged tool I was
able<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.360> get<00:02:37.360> that<00:02:37.510> nut<00:02:37.720> loose<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:40.030> know

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.280 
along so this has to get removed so that
this<00:03:35.670> bill<00:03:35.970> can<00:03:36.300> come<00:03:36.450> off<00:03:36.630> so<00:03:36.870> that<00:03:36.900> this

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
this bill can come off so that this

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.650 
this bill can come off so that this
piece<00:03:37.530> will<00:03:37.650> come<00:03:37.830> off<00:03:37.980> otherwise<00:03:38.450> you'll<00:03:39.450> get

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
piece will come off otherwise you'll get

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.020 
piece will come off otherwise you'll get
almost<00:03:40.230> off<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:40.890> then<00:03:41.220> you'll<00:03:41.520> realize<00:03:41.700> that

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
almost off and then you'll realize that

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.520 
almost off and then you'll realize that
the<00:03:42.120> belt<00:03:42.300> just<00:03:42.480> doesn't<00:03:42.900> stretch<00:03:43.230> and<00:03:43.500> I

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
the belt just doesn't stretch and I

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.870 
the belt just doesn't stretch and I
think<00:03:43.800> I've<00:03:43.920> already<00:03:44.070> kind<00:03:44.400> of<00:03:44.460> tweaked<00:03:44.760> the

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
think I've already kind of tweaked the

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.370 
think I've already kind of tweaked the
belt<00:03:45.060> but<00:03:45.270> that's<00:03:45.420> okay<00:03:45.750> because<00:03:45.780> I'll

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
belt but that's okay because I'll

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.230 
belt but that's okay because I'll
probably<00:03:46.410> upgrade<00:03:47.160> my<00:03:47.310> adult<00:03:47.580> anyways<00:03:48.290> well

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
probably upgrade my adult anyways well

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.670 
probably upgrade my adult anyways well
so<00:03:51.240> what<00:03:51.450> we<00:03:51.540> got<00:03:51.690> is<00:03:51.900> we<00:03:52.110> got<00:03:52.260> a<00:03:52.290> similar

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
so what we got is we got a similar

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.080 
so what we got is we got a similar
situation<00:03:52.860> what<00:03:53.340> we<00:03:53.430> had<00:03:53.550> on<00:03:53.580> the<00:03:53.700> other<00:03:53.850> side

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
situation what we had on the other side

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.120 
situation what we had on the other side
where<00:03:54.780> we<00:03:55.080> were<00:03:55.200> trying<00:03:55.530> to<00:03:55.560> pull<00:03:55.740> that<00:03:55.890> one

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
where we were trying to pull that one

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.180 
where we were trying to pull that one
plate<00:03:56.340> that<00:03:56.580> covers<00:03:56.850> this<00:03:56.970> off<00:03:57.150> well<00:03:58.190> you'll

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
plate that covers this off well you'll

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.210 
plate that covers this off well you'll
notice<00:03:59.520> there's<00:03:59.760> these<00:03:59.880> two<00:04:00.380> holes<00:04:01.380> on<00:04:01.770> either

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
notice there's these two holes on either

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.410 
notice there's these two holes on either
side<00:04:02.640> right<00:04:02.670> here<00:04:03.590> well<00:04:04.590> I<00:04:05.150> figure<00:04:06.150> if<00:04:06.300> it

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
side right here well I figure if it

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.610 
side right here well I figure if it
worked<00:04:06.600> the<00:04:06.720> first<00:04:06.750> time<00:04:07.050> might<00:04:07.320> as<00:04:07.380> well<00:04:07.500> work

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
worked the first time might as well work

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.220 
worked the first time might as well work
the<00:04:07.740> second<00:04:08.100> time<00:04:08.130> and<00:04:09.020> try<00:04:10.020> to<00:04:10.080> find

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
the second time and try to find

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.480 
the second time and try to find
something<00:04:10.470> small<00:04:10.770> enough<00:04:10.800> to<00:04:10.950> fit<00:04:11.100> and<00:04:11.460> I

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
something small enough to fit and I

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.230 
something small enough to fit and I
found<00:04:11.730> a<00:04:11.820> couple<00:04:11.850> little<00:04:12.210> screws<00:04:14.060> little<00:04:15.060> tiny

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
found a couple little screws little tiny

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.949 
found a couple little screws little tiny
screws<00:04:15.510> and<00:04:16.020> put<00:04:16.230> them<00:04:16.320> in<00:04:16.470> and<00:04:16.680> then<00:04:17.959> once

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
screws and put them in and then once

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:25.730 
screws and put them in and then once
again<00:04:19.520> taking<00:04:20.520> my<00:04:20.930> my<00:04:21.930> tool<00:04:22.200> I<00:04:24.500> placed<00:04:25.500> it<00:04:25.650> on

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
again taking my my tool I placed it on

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.390

where<00:04:29.550> you<00:04:29.730> can<00:04:29.910> actually<00:04:30.060> hang<00:04:30.390> on<00:04:30.540> to<00:04:30.720> as<00:04:31.020> you

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
where you can actually hang on to as you

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.520 
where you can actually hang on to as you
try<00:04:31.440> to<00:04:31.610> torque<00:04:32.610> that<00:04:32.760> thing<00:04:33.000> off<00:04:33.530> it's
