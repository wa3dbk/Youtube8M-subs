00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.940 
and it also allows the background and be
transparent<00:02:18.420> so<00:02:19.080> this<00:02:19.230> tweak<00:02:19.470> is<00:02:19.620> probably

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
transparent so this tweak is probably

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.650 
transparent so this tweak is probably
