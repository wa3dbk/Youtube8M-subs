00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
the sugars in there you don't have a

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:04.220 
the sugars in there you don't have a
extra<00:01:57.810> sweet<00:01:58.080> taste

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.800 

not<00:02:04.890> bad<00:02:05.100> also<00:02:05.970> they<00:02:06.090> have<00:02:06.240> some<00:02:06.420> other<00:02:06.480> things

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810

not bad also they have some other things
that<00:02:06.900> test<00:02:07.200> booster<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.830> thermogenic<00:02:08.820> and<00:02:09.300> a

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
that test booster a thermogenic and a

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.280 
that test booster a thermogenic and a
pre-workout<00:02:11.100> called<00:02:11.730> siege<00:02:12.290> that<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.970> think<00:02:14.970> is

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
pre-workout called siege that I think is

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.290 
pre-workout called siege that I think is
without<00:02:16.290> preteen<00:02:16.710> without<00:02:16.980> modality<00:02:17.760> so<00:02:18.060> I

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
without preteen without modality so I

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.580 
without preteen without modality so I
haven't<00:02:18.750> tried<00:02:18.810> those<00:02:19.020> out<00:02:19.140> yet<00:02:19.320> but<00:02:19.350> I<00:02:19.560> will

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
haven't tried those out yet but I will

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.770 
haven't tried those out yet but I will
hopefully<00:02:20.180> check<00:02:21.180> them<00:02:21.330> out<00:02:21.420> in<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.600> near

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
hopefully check them out in the near

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.260 
hopefully check them out in the near
future<00:02:21.840> I<00:02:22.320> still<00:02:23.310> like<00:02:23.430> my<00:02:23.550> city<00:02:23.760> core<00:02:23.940> in<00:02:24.060> five

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
future I still like my city core in five

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.170 
future I still like my city core in five
to<00:02:24.510> one<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.990> few<00:02:25.680> tubs<00:02:25.830> of<00:02:25.980> that<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:26.430> what<00:02:26.970> you

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
to one a few tubs of that and what you

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.030 
to one a few tubs of that and what you
said<00:02:27.390> as<00:02:27.540> long<00:02:27.600> as<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:27.840> possibly<00:02:27.870> can<00:02:28.350> since<00:02:28.740> you

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
said as long as I possibly can since you

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.240 
said as long as I possibly can since you
can't<00:02:29.100> buy<00:02:29.370> other<00:02:29.610> site<00:02:29.910> anymore<00:02:30.680> so<00:02:31.680> overall

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
can't buy other site anymore so overall

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.190 
can't buy other site anymore so overall
pretty<00:02:32.490> good<00:02:32.580> I<00:02:32.910> still<00:02:33.540> like<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.780> flavor<00:02:34.020> in

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
pretty good I still like the flavor in

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.640 
pretty good I still like the flavor in
the<00:02:34.260> case<00:02:34.440> of<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:35.580> core<00:02:35.790> dcas<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.500> album
