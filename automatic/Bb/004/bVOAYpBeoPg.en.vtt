00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:53.129
 I'll introduce you to the network. 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.010
 is a network that I believe and is 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:58.049
 I trust and the network offers 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.349
 benefits mainly to those who are 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:03.930
 beginning and does not understand much of this 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:07.290
 network business offers a payment 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.599
 minimum $ 1 ie if your car 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.079
 yield at least $ 1 per month 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:15.359
 You get that money something else. 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:18.299
 network has a temporary contract of 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:20.609
 three months you can click on the network 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:23.040
 for three months if you do not like it 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.750
 just ask them they cancel 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.959
 your contract in case you want 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:31.230
 continue your contract is only one 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.700
 year and finally the ox thing that I think 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.739
 more interesting 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.260

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.090

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.629
