00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.790
 good morning 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.419
 ok 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.490
 fans of the blue shirt 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:47.640
 welcome to the sachsenring for the test 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:50.160
 final of the 87th six days of enduro 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.770
 to host it of course the circuit 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.500
 himself in a race that will be supermoto 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.720
 so much asphalt a bit of dirt road 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.850
 very few jumps for a final test 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.110
 a little unusual compared to those 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.239
 to which we have witnessed in 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.220
 last years with trophy games 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.510
 world and junior in practice 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.520
 closed the reason of interest is 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.590
 certainly the individual classification la 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.930
 challenge in the French house collapsed held 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.400
 meo and the attempt by alex salvini by 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.740
 enter the top five 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.720
 we will start with the finals of the 1 a 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.070
 follow the two letters finally we go to 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.070
 enjoy the tender images 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.090
 maurizio micheluz the first Italian in 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.210
 race cuts the 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.610
 goal of 18 but test for him yes 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.470
 square in mid-table without any 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.840
 kind of problem was certainly not today 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.229
 the ideal day to attack running 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.229
 unnecessary risks 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.920
 after what 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.640
 alex wanted to do a race to the attack 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.110
 then the slip to the first street maybe has 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.440
 changed his strategies 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.879
 no no I slipped to the first way later 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.129
 fortunately he has redone his departure 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.500
 for a false start they left 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.910
 much better, however, on 3 March 10 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.250
 four and a half of the asphalt sent in 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.080
 via I recovered so much of the disk but not 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.910
 we managed to pass phillips I was maybe 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.519
 a little faster than the first ones but not 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.970
 I could pass the same mine 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.060
 goal was to finish on the podium class 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.250
 absolute mini server has made it 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:15.060
 its just hope that even in the 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.590
 three straight and worlds come to an end 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.069
 so we also do sword see podium 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.069
 perfect 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.070
 at sunset 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.570
 in all 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:47.139
 Italy sure of third place considering that 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.819
 Finns quarters were already from yesterday to 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:50.109
 safe distance and that Australia 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.359
 the second was rather than 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:54.459
 reachable took one day 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:56.859
 of races in the sign of tranquility 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.299
 of avoiding unnecessary risks 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:00.459
 so all the Italians are 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.590
 behave very well by placing yourself without 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.019
 problems around the middle of the 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.829
 open the micheluz dances in 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:12.549
 e1 continued salvini and philippaerts 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:15.669
 in and two eventually closed gritti e 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:20.229
 money in class 3 thus giving space to 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:22.630
 final party present sixth but year ago 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:25.060
 after the Finnish debacle he spoke that 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.720
 in the two would have been a page today 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:31.930
 year after a beautiful Italy closes third 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.310
 and we have not turned completely 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.289
 page a better result than 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:39.220
 last year 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:41.440
 I would say quite logical is expected in 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.320
 trophy that even if he could 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.509
 compete to the end with all the 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.659
 components i think i wouldn't have 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:52.570
 could get a better result 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:55.780
 there is a certain regret for the trophy 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:58.599
 junior that if he had arrived complete 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.849
 however with three pilots 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:05.440
 I believe he could have fought 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:08.250
 for an excellent result and this is in 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.509
 future prospect is our hope 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.660
 so that in the next edition plans there 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:14.240
 I can do 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.950
 keep bones compared starting 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.720
 right from the next maybe that in 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.480
 sardinia we play at home so 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.240
 I imagine Italy will still want to bet 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.800
 to something important 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.540
 evidently beyond appearance 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.430
 organizational in which all there 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.380
 we will strive to have the best 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.210
 results demonstrate again 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.150
 our organizational skills from each 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:38.390
 point of view it is clear that we count 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:42.580
 the chest especially June 28th and maybe 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.580
 even in the clubs at an excellent city
