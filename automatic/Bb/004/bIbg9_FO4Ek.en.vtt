anywhere from twenty-five to thirty six
weeks<00:01:31.799> um<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.030> know<00:01:33.060> obviously<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.720> can

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
weeks um but you know obviously you can

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.800

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
would be about the bare minimum that you

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.520 
would be about the bare minimum that you
should<00:01:38.850> be<00:01:38.970> able<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.299> get<00:01:39.420> away<00:01:39.600> with<00:01:39.750> go<00:01:40.380> in

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
should be able to get away with go in

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.190 
should be able to get away with go in
there<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.890> be<00:01:41.130> pretty<00:01:41.520> prepared<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.540> the

there and be pretty prepared and the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.969 
there and be pretty prepared and the
last<00:01:43.439> thing<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.890> how<00:01:44.189> much<00:01:44.610> protein<00:01:45.259> do<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.530> need

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
last thing is how much protein do I need

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.889 
last thing is how much protein do I need
you<00:01:47.220> definitely<00:01:47.790> need<00:01:47.939> protein<00:01:48.210> endurance

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
you definitely need protein endurance

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.810 
you definitely need protein endurance
athletes<00:01:49.350> actually<00:01:49.649> need<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.860> just<00:01:50.490> as<00:01:50.610> much

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
athletes actually need to just as much
