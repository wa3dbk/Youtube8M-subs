00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:03.740
 the Ivory Coast 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.080
 Cacau named number one 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.080
 a good third of world production comes from me 

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:12.579
 one in four lives on cocoa cultivation 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:14.359
 also Victor Kaboré 

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:19.300
 the whole family works daily on its small plantation St 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.619
 even if this is annoying but and we do not know how to get through 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.950
 all Europeans of the place from where should we take the money for the school of 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.539
 Children's spicy shore 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.599
 This is very expensive but is used by this party and if someone is sick 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.920
 we can not afford the hospital 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.420
 At Aixtron, Angela Merkel will turn on the other way round 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.370
 because Ankara is must of every kind 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.970
 also the children 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.560
 Werner is 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.510
 He has been through every harvest since the age of 8 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.130
 a tough job 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.820
 he and the other kids have to drag the hoops out of the morning 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.620
 until evening 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.270
 for months 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.760
 After all, that was safe by volley 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.020
 5 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.020
 Mending it is the worst 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.010
 important is not too short 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.010
 why that happens is exhausting 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.320
 With the backwards loosen the Kerber is the beans from the cocoa debt 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.320
 The children help here as well 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.320
 again and again she hurt herself 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.830
 Werner was the only child of the family ever visited a school if it 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.940
 he does not know in the future either - it depends on the harvest 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.780
 the other children would like to go to school but never the money 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.340
 enough 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.490
 Children are important to chocolate manufacturers 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.020
 as a target group 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.020
 Children love chocolate 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.810
 For other children to work the manufacturers have since 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:50.710
 years 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.149
 but without Cocoa from the Ivory Coast it does not work 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.610
 almost all the big industry strength of the region with then Nestlé 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.010
 depend on it 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.229
 the cocoa from the Ivory Coast is 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.469
 our main city here in Germany 50 percent come 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:12.209
 Côte d'Ivoire and almost all manufacturers did not 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.339
 just here it comes chocolates 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:17.659
 refer Cacaus Dettmann coast 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:21.559
 one of the children on the plantation of Victor Kaboré has got noticed 

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:23.839
 15 years 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:26.699
 he carries the hardest and never pauses 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:31.619
 he is not a child of the family he is a child of the slave from the neighboring country 

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:33.679
 Burkina Faso 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:37.519
 Lehmann took me along and said I'll work with cocoa 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.949
 Five years ago, like sugar Buri 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:43.939
 Danielle bought 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:45.349
 to tell it 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.889
 He has not seen his parents since 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:50.349
 he now belongs to Victor Kaboré 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.550
 to the family will be relaxed 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.390
 the work is very encouraging nobody was hurt Michael Ballack wants 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:02.639
 we have everything at the moment is a lot of work I have no money for 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:06.719
 Adult employees stay what should I do wherever you can save what you do 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:10.159
 if it does not want it is not appropriate 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.629
 we show our photos Friedel hütz-adams from the research institute 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:15.219
 south wind 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:20.049
 For a study, he has been following the dark side of chocolate 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.050
 he estimates that in West Africa 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.550
 Hundreds of thousands of children and more than ten thousand child slaves on plantations 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.410
 Many children work and work many hours a week 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.169
 Have to do night work since childhood 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:36.799
 prove to the project planning for a lower 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.739
 Deficits are exposed and this leads to the course of construction sites 

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:44.559
 and that's what even those who do not go to school for 

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:47.559
 A minimal perspective has gotten out of their poverty because they have no 

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:49.289
 Have education 

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:52.029
 also the manufacturers know that for years 

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:56.650
 already in 2001 they made a commitment they promised 

00:03:56.649 --> 00:04:00.119
 to fight at least the worst forms of child labor 

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:03.119
 For thousands of children, nothing has changed to this day 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.569
 the conditions in Cote d'Ivoire just the country has special 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.159
 addressed by the political conditions are still unstable 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:14.159
 and you can not reach every single farmer that's OK 

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:17.189
 the village price target occurs 

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:21.839
 it shows that the inhabitants of other countries also produce fair trade 

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:22.819
 chocolate 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:26.779
 That's why they get a fixed minimum price for their beans 

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:30.050
 They deserve enough reason are not on kids as cheap labor 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.349
 instructed the kids go to school here in their free time they can 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:37.479
 Kim and play 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.360
 the fairtrade seal on the pack indicates that the cocoa farmers are fair 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.650
 it was paid around that no child labor in the chocolate it is 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.469
 There are two more wins but they are not featured on any pack Bremen 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:51.580
 Isabell 1 and briefly said Veit 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.060
 they are considered an industrial nation 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.980
 Aaron does not offer the farmer minimum prices though 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.599
 they too should exclude child labor 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:02.520
 Only all three wins together do not even make up one percent of the Germans 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.409
 Chocolate from one percent 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:07.460
 the rest is without guarantee 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.169
 the first building blocks so curator song so fall we are on the right track 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.930
 there are already some millions of these projects in the but are in the 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.199
 same period some billions have gone into advertising and that is so 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:19.289
 a relation 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:21.139
 around with that chocolate 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:24.710
 Consumers and Guinea's chocolates nobody should actually take 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.449
 little hope for the children on the plantation of Big Soul Calibur IV 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:32.780
 for dinner there are midfield as usual 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.650
 we offer the near and the Daniel chocolate 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.130
 It's the first time in your life that you eat chocolate 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.620
 Rome 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.410
