 to teach you how to set up is a new 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.630
 browser by gps force consulting is a 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.369
 Simple process I go here is this 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.949
 video no I will not give more details 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.500
 where to download how to download here 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.760
 price point you have already downloaded a new one 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.980
 browser has connected a friend or 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.840
 so many others that exist in the market and 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.030
 is in doubt the common people and how 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.460
 then we imagine that you 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.700
 found the new browser and has already 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:44.480
 internal memory of your GPS or memory 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:46.739
 outside the place where it comes with a 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.760
 flash 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.680
 finally already counting on the browsers 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.680
 compacted on the floor on your gps is very 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.410
 simple to configure to select 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.989
 as a main browser, and in the 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:06.260
 settings option that option here side 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:11.240

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.970
 here is the origin path of the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.330

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.180
 your new browser you must click here 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:28.020
 will have a page called resident 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:34.799
 flash than the root of the internal memory 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:43.500
 ne GPS internal flash memory is 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:47.390
 here you will get to g1 which is the player's 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:51.270
 I found that my case is clear 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:55.470

00:01:51.270 --> 00:02:02.000

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:02.000
 I click on Sunday 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:12.910
 just go back to click on that navigation 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.460
 he will already carry 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.550
 This is how it's lived, it's very simple, right? 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:24.590

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:27.760

 that a lot of people have questions 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.630

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.910

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.580
 know how to set your name with the 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.830
