00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
bowling alleys they must have put them

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.499 
bowling alleys they must have put them
in<00:01:47.220> here<00:01:47.869> anyway<00:01:48.890> all<00:01:49.890> right<00:01:50.180> makes<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.299> think

in here anyway all right makes you think
your<00:01:51.689> bumper<00:01:51.960> bowling<00:01:52.170> but<00:01:52.439> then<00:01:52.590> you're

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
your bumper bowling but then you're

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.319 
your bumper bowling but then you're
actually<00:01:52.920> not<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.490> it's<00:01:53.610> like<00:01:53.790> huh

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
actually not and it's like huh

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.530 
actually not and it's like huh
psyche<00:01:55.250> direct<00:01:56.250> anyway<00:01:56.880> okay<00:01:57.180> let's<00:01:57.390> look

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
psyche direct anyway okay let's look

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.289 
psyche direct anyway okay let's look
straight<00:01:57.810> on<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.649> think<00:01:59.060> according<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.210> the

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
straight on and I think according to the

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.319 
straight on and I think according to the
video<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.600> watched<00:02:00.899> if<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.409> sort<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.189> move<00:02:02.490> as<00:02:02.850> I

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
video I watched if I sort of move as I

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.630 
video I watched if I sort of move as I
after<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:03.930> release<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.590> should<00:02:04.950> kind<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.369> curve

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
after I release it should kind of curve

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.389 
after I release it should kind of curve
the<00:02:05.850> thing<00:02:06.090> right<00:02:06.299> yeah<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:07.079> then<00:02:08.039> we<00:02:08.129> can<00:02:08.310> do

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
the thing right yeah and then we can do

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.279 
the thing right yeah and then we can do
some<00:02:08.610> super<00:02:08.849> duper<00:02:09.060> freaking<00:02:09.629> spin<00:02:09.899> moves<00:02:10.140> oh

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
some super duper freaking spin moves oh

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.940 
some super duper freaking spin moves oh
there<00:02:10.560> we<00:02:10.709> go

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
there we go

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.059 
there we go
6a<00:02:11.640> does<00:02:11.790> have<00:02:11.940> improvements<00:02:12.780> in

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
6a does have improvements in

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.489 
6a does have improvements in
provement<00:02:13.489> that's<00:02:14.180> seven<00:02:14.569> with<00:02:14.749> three<00:02:15.079> go<00:02:15.260> so

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:15.499 
provement that's seven with three go so

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:16.569 
provement that's seven with three go so
I<00:02:15.560> guess<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.799> best<00:02:15.950> we<00:02:16.159> could<00:02:16.280> do<00:02:16.400> is<00:02:16.430> a

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:16.579 
I guess the best we could do is a

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:20.289 
I guess the best we could do is a
hundred<00:02:18.069> how<00:02:19.069> in<00:02:19.219> the<00:02:19.340> world<00:02:19.519> god<00:02:19.790> this<00:02:19.939> is<00:02:20.120> so

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
hundred how in the world god this is so

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:21.940 
hundred how in the world god this is so
cool<00:02:20.480> it<00:02:20.689> just<00:02:20.810> like<00:02:20.989> pops<00:02:21.260> out<00:02:21.469> again<00:02:21.769> from

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
cool it just like pops out again from

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.610 
cool it just like pops out again from
the<00:02:22.120> that's<00:02:23.120> from<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:23.900> conveyor<00:02:24.230> belt<00:02:24.319> that's

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
the that's from the conveyor belt that's

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.459 
the that's from the conveyor belt that's
awesome<00:02:25.150> okay<00:02:26.150> so<00:02:26.900> I<00:02:26.930> think<00:02:27.019> the<00:02:27.230> way<00:02:27.319> this

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:27.469 
awesome okay so I think the way this

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:28.989 
awesome okay so I think the way this
works<00:02:27.709> is<00:02:27.859> there's<00:02:27.980> some<00:02:28.219> armor<00:02:28.519> stands<00:02:28.760> like

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:28.999 
works is there's some armor stands like

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:30.729 
works is there's some armor stands like
hooked<00:02:29.239> up<00:02:29.389> to<00:02:29.569> the<00:02:29.719> the<00:02:30.170> pins<00:02:30.409> we'll<00:02:30.560> take<00:02:30.709> a

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
hooked up to the the pins we'll take a

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.259 
hooked up to the the pins we'll take a
closer<00:02:31.010> look<00:02:31.129> after<00:02:31.579> I<00:02:31.609> complete<00:02:31.939> my<00:02:31.969> round

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
closer look after I complete my round

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.110 
closer look after I complete my round
here<00:02:32.420> we<00:02:32.510> go<00:02:32.689> oh<00:02:32.870> come<00:02:33.530> on<00:02:33.590> someone<00:02:34.579> do<00:02:35.000> the

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
here we go oh come on someone do the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.039 
here we go oh come on someone do the
curve<00:02:35.329> do<00:02:35.569> the<00:02:35.689> curve<00:02:35.959> there<00:02:36.530> we<00:02:36.650> just<00:02:37.519> -<00:02:38.049> what

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
curve do the curve there we just - what

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.440 
curve do the curve there we just - what
the<00:02:39.230> heck<00:02:39.379> physics<00:02:39.889> what<00:02:40.219> are<00:02:40.310> you<00:02:40.370> doing<00:02:40.730> what

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
happened there is I had so much spin on

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.360 
happened there is I had so much spin on
the<00:03:30.799> ball<00:03:30.949> that<00:03:31.459> the<00:03:31.669> the<00:03:32.590> airway<00:03:33.590> Oh<00:03:33.829> curve<00:03:34.220> it

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
the ball that the the airway Oh curve it

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.849 
the ball that the the airway Oh curve it
back<00:03:34.519> around<00:03:34.780> there<00:03:35.780> we<00:03:36.049> go<00:03:36.290> see<00:03:36.769> another

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
back around there we go see another

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:38.890 
back around there we go see another
eight<00:03:37.220> out<00:03:37.340> of<00:03:37.370> ten<00:03:37.579> that's<00:03:37.729> the<00:03:37.879> key<00:03:38.180> get<00:03:38.659> that

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
eight out of ten that's the key get that

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.030 
eight out of ten that's the key get that
get<00:03:39.590> that<00:03:39.620> spin<00:03:40.189> going<00:03:41.169> okay<00:03:42.169> see<00:03:42.799> what

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
get that spin going okay see what

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.550 
get that spin going okay see what
happened<00:03:43.400> is<00:03:43.489> I<00:03:43.579> had<00:03:43.699> so<00:03:43.939> much<00:03:44.090> spin<00:03:44.540> that<00:03:45.229> it

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
happened is I had so much spin that it

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.780 
happened is I had so much spin that it
basically<00:03:46.129> oh<00:03:46.459> oh<00:03:46.759> oh<00:03:47.239> I<00:03:48.040> spun<00:03:49.040> it<00:03:49.069> too<00:03:49.310> much<00:03:49.489> I

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
basically oh oh oh I spun it too much I

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.390 
basically oh oh oh I spun it too much I
spun<00:03:50.419> it<00:03:50.449> too<00:03:50.689> much<00:03:50.870> okay<00:03:51.500> so<00:03:52.099> I<00:03:52.129> think<00:03:52.189> what<00:03:52.370> I

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
spun it too much okay so I think what I

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.890 
spun it too much okay so I think what I
have<00:03:52.549> to<00:03:52.669> do<00:03:52.759> is<00:03:52.879> I<00:03:52.970> have<00:03:53.090> to<00:03:53.209> move<00:03:53.389> like<00:03:53.449> just

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
have to do is I have to move like just

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.749 
have to do is I have to move like just
as<00:03:54.049> I<00:03:54.169> drop<00:03:54.439> it<00:03:54.620> so<00:03:54.889> angle<00:03:55.250> over<00:03:55.370> there<00:03:55.579> and

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:55.759 
as I drop it so angle over there and

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:56.379 
as I drop it so angle over there and
then<00:03:55.909> move<00:03:56.120> it

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:56.389 
then move it

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:59.679 
then move it
Oh<00:03:56.419> see<00:03:57.290> that's<00:03:57.530> how<00:03:57.739> we<00:03:57.769> spin<00:03:58.189> it<00:03:58.540> that's<00:03:59.540> how

00:03:59.679 --> 00:03:59.689 
Oh see that's how we spin it that's how

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:01.589 
Oh see that's how we spin it that's how
we<00:03:59.750> spin<00:04:00.139> it<00:04:00.169> I've<00:04:00.680> had<00:04:00.859> to<00:04:01.009> be<00:04:01.099> out<00:04:01.219> of<00:04:01.250> frames

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
we spin it I've had to be out of frames

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.360 
we spin it I've had to be out of frames
but<00:04:02.599> I'm<00:04:03.139> getting<00:04:03.469> the<00:04:03.530> hang<00:04:03.680> of<00:04:03.829> it<00:04:03.919> okay<00:04:04.310> so

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
but I'm getting the hang of it okay so

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.080 
but I'm getting the hang of it okay so
we<00:04:04.669> drop<00:04:05.000> and<00:04:05.329> then<00:04:05.840> we<00:04:05.959> know<00:04:06.889> okay<00:04:07.489> dropped

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
we drop and then we know okay dropped

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.499 
we drop and then we know okay dropped
and<00:04:08.299> then<00:04:08.389> add<00:04:08.509> a<00:04:08.540> little<00:04:08.719> bit<00:04:08.840> spin<00:04:09.229> there<00:04:09.409> we

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:10.509 
and then add a little bit spin there we

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:14.770 
and then add a little bit spin there we
score<00:04:11.509> is<00:04:11.629> 25<00:04:12.199> okay<00:04:13.189> so<00:04:13.250> not<00:04:13.729> not<00:04:14.090> exactly<00:04:14.659> a

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
score is 25 okay so not not exactly a

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.580 
score is 25 okay so not not exactly a
professional<00:04:15.439> but<00:04:16.389> very<00:04:17.389> far<00:04:17.630> from<00:04:17.840> it<00:04:18.049> but

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
professional but very far from it but

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.439 
professional but very far from it but
you<00:04:18.650> kind<00:04:19.009> of<00:04:19.070> get<00:04:19.219> the<00:04:19.370> idea<00:04:19.400> it's<00:04:20.209> pretty

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:20.449 
you kind of get the idea it's pretty

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:22.570 
you kind of get the idea it's pretty
cool<00:04:20.630> it's<00:04:21.229> pretty<00:04:21.289> cool<00:04:21.500> so<00:04:21.829> I<00:04:21.859> don't<00:04:22.099> we<00:04:22.190> mi<00:04:22.400> I

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
cool it's pretty cool so I don't we mi I

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.129 
cool it's pretty cool so I don't we mi I
figure<00:04:22.940> we<00:04:23.029> can<00:04:23.120> switch<00:04:23.360> into<00:04:23.599> spectator<00:04:24.020> and

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
figure we can switch into spectator and

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.940 
figure we can switch into spectator and
actually<00:04:24.409> take<00:04:24.560> a<00:04:24.590> closer<00:04:24.830> look<00:04:24.979> at<00:04:25.279> it

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
actually take a closer look at it

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.320 
actually take a closer look at it
be<00:04:27.070> able<00:04:27.220> to<00:04:27.340> even<00:04:27.640> take<00:04:27.730> a<00:04:27.820> look<00:04:27.970> at<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.180> other

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
be able to even take a look at the other

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.730 
be able to even take a look at the other
command<00:04:28.630> block<00:04:28.810> soon<00:04:29.020> as<00:04:29.200> well<00:04:29.380> but<00:04:29.590> here

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
command block soon as well but here

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.400 
command block soon as well but here
let's<00:04:29.920> click<00:04:30.040> the<00:04:30.250> play<00:04:30.430> and<00:04:30.670> then<00:04:31.230> switch<00:04:32.230> on

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
let's click the play and then switch on

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.580 
let's click the play and then switch on
over<00:04:32.830> to<00:04:34.470> spectator

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
over to spectator

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.070 
over to spectator
and<00:04:36.310> we<00:04:36.430> should<00:04:36.640> be<00:04:36.790> able<00:04:36.880> to<00:04:37.000> see<00:04:37.300> all<00:04:37.600> of<00:04:37.630> the

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
and we should be able to see all of the

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.780 
and we should be able to see all of the
the<00:04:38.380> fanciness<00:04:38.800> that's<00:04:39.160> taking<00:04:39.430> place<00:04:39.610> so

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
the fanciness that's taking place so

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.640 
the fanciness that's taking place so
look<00:04:39.940> at<00:04:40.030> that<00:04:40.180> so<00:04:40.870> you<00:04:40.990> got<00:04:41.140> an<00:04:41.260> armor<00:04:41.620> stand

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
look at that so you got an armor stand

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.150 
look at that so you got an armor stand
that's<00:04:42.220> actually<00:04:42.730> holding<00:04:43.560> okay<00:04:44.590> that<00:04:44.950> makes

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
that's actually holding okay that makes

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.880 
that's actually holding okay that makes
sense<00:04:45.460> that<00:04:45.790> makes<00:04:45.970> sense<00:04:46.480> and<00:04:46.750> then<00:04:47.110> so<00:04:47.860> all

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
sense that makes sense and then so all

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.280 
sense that makes sense and then so all
the<00:04:48.220> pins<00:04:48.520> I<00:04:48.910> don't<00:04:49.510> know<00:04:49.600> what<00:04:49.750> kind<00:04:49.930> of<00:04:50.020> item

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
the pins I don't know what kind of item

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.420 
the pins I don't know what kind of item
they<00:04:50.440> are<00:04:50.470> but<00:04:50.770> they're<00:04:50.920> actually<00:04:51.280> like

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
they are but they're actually like

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.750 
they are but they're actually like
hooked<00:04:51.700> up<00:04:51.970> to<00:04:52.890> another<00:04:53.890> set<00:04:54.190> of<00:04:54.280> armor<00:04:54.520> stands

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
hooked up to another set of armor stands

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.670 
hooked up to another set of armor stands
down<00:04:55.030> there<00:04:55.330> it's<00:04:55.630> like<00:04:55.810> they're<00:04:56.260> wearing

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
down there it's like they're wearing

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.290 
down there it's like they're wearing
that<00:04:56.890> the<00:04:57.040> pins<00:04:57.280> as<00:04:57.460> helmets<00:04:57.670> or<00:04:58.000> something

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
that the pins as helmets or something

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.750 
that the pins as helmets or something
like<00:04:58.420> that<00:04:58.830> and<00:04:59.830> then<00:04:59.980> I<00:05:00.040> think<00:05:00.220> what<00:05:00.370> happens

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
like that and then I think what happens

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.680 
like that and then I think what happens
is<00:05:01.360> that<00:05:01.420> when<00:05:01.990> you<00:05:02.260> actually<00:05:03.000> like<00:05:04.000> fire<00:05:04.360> the

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
is that when you actually like fire the

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.350 
is that when you actually like fire the
ball<00:05:05.290> down<00:05:05.680> the<00:05:05.830> lane<00:05:06.070> basically<00:05:06.880> it<00:05:07.060> spawns

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
ball down the lane basically it spawns

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.380 
ball down the lane basically it spawns
another<00:05:07.570> armored<00:05:08.140> stand<00:05:08.490> with<00:05:09.490> the<00:05:09.700> ball<00:05:09.910> and

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
another armored stand with the ball and

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:11.970 
another armored stand with the ball and
it<00:05:10.540> kind<00:05:10.780> of<00:05:10.810> goes<00:05:10.960> along<00:05:10.990> here<00:05:11.560> and<00:05:11.710> then<00:05:11.830> it

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
it kind of goes along here and then it

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.430 
it kind of goes along here and then it
hits<00:05:12.700> into<00:05:13.000> these<00:05:13.150> and<00:05:13.420> it<00:05:13.840> tries<00:05:14.080> it's<00:05:14.380> best

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
hits into these and it tries it's best

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.350 
hits into these and it tries it's best
to<00:05:14.710> like<00:05:14.890> approximate<00:05:15.550> collision<00:05:16.030> detection

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
to like approximate collision detection

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.200 
to like approximate collision detection
then<00:05:16.690> does<00:05:16.870> a<00:05:16.900> chain<00:05:17.260> reaction<00:05:17.920> where<00:05:18.730> the<00:05:18.970> the

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
then does a chain reaction where the the

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.520 
then does a chain reaction where the the
pins<00:05:19.390> actually<00:05:19.720> get<00:05:19.840> knocked<00:05:19.990> down<00:05:20.140> I<00:05:20.200> wonder

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
pins actually get knocked down I wonder

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.450
