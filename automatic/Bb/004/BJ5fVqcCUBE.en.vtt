00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:02.689 

I'm<00:05:01.229> sure<00:05:01.529> this<00:05:01.679> probably<00:05:01.979> exceeds<00:05:02.399> 10

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
I'm sure this probably exceeds 10

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.869 
I'm sure this probably exceeds 10
minutes<00:05:03.029> so<00:05:03.860> they<00:05:04.860> probably<00:05:05.099> won't<00:05:05.459> fit<00:05:05.759> in<00:05:05.849> my

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:05.879 
minutes so they probably won't fit in my

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:08.569 
minutes so they probably won't fit in my
whole<00:05:06.149> video<00:05:06.389> so<00:05:07.379> they'll<00:05:08.129> probably<00:05:08.339> be<00:05:08.549> a

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:08.579 
whole video so they'll probably be a

00:05:08.579 --> 00:05:10.939 
whole video so they'll probably be a
second<00:05:08.999> one<00:05:09.029> and<00:05:09.389> that's<00:05:10.319> where<00:05:10.559> I'll<00:05:10.709> catch

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
second one and that's where I'll catch

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:12.969 
second one and that's where I'll catch
it<00:05:11.129> and<00:05:11.309> show<00:05:11.579> you<00:05:11.639> how<00:05:11.849> to<00:05:11.909> get<00:05:12.089> it<00:05:12.209> in<00:05:12.299> sky<00:05:12.539> for

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
it and show you how to get it in sky for

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:24.550 
it and show you how to get it in sky for
so<00:05:13.979> we'll<00:05:14.909> die

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560
