00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:08.559
 Yes macho 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:12.460
 Yes this time it was cold 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:18.390
 I think I'm going to hibernate the hornet 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.390
 So it is to use this time it is this fuel version 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.600
 In ql version 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:32.500
 Well, it's mainly carbon class because it is an additive 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:38.850
 It is this It is a company other than the thread this time I'd used in the removal of carbon 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.850
 Use the function to exercise the fuel gauge survey 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:48.310
 By placing a plate to plant this day along with the fuel 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.370
 It is possible that gasoline will rot 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:55.360
 It is to prevent the rust of the tank 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.360
 You can 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.450

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:13.190
 When fuel 30 liters actually win 2 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.880
 It is written that please do not pass over more than 22% 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:21.039
 So Hornet's 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.620
 It is always toxic when changing the tank to 16 liters 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:26.820
 It is a milliliter 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:31.380
 One percent of that is 160mm 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:34.920
 So do not put a 160ml water because 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.760
 The to this time Curie is 150ml 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.760
 I want to stay 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:47.640
 Yes I bought a 100 cup salary cup 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:50.090
 This 150mm ql 1 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.280
 Put on the protective net 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.280
 Definitive be wrapped in a tank 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.369
 I can do it by putting in the collection 1 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:08.830

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.830

 And to clean the Kikabe Hornet 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.560
 I'm hibernating and I will be a Hornet islander 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:24.730
 Come in 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:26.670
 It is subject to a ql 1 properly fuel be in full sail 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.920
 Ask courtesy 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:34.280
 epo dimm polishes nicely 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.490
 The islander's fountain is now complete 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:41.410
 I don't mind forming, I'm floating 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.410
 It is a hobby for Osu boss 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:50.310
 Yes this completes 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:57.470
 Tobu Hornet will be a bribe 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:03:01.940
 I would like to refer to the also heat dissipation path of the video if there is a Yeah opportunity, even a 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:04.570
