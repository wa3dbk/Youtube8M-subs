alright now in addition to just having
these<00:01:42.990> four<00:01:43.229> different<00:01:43.530> designs<00:01:43.680> they

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
these four different designs they

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.649 
these four different designs they
interact<00:01:44.579> with<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.850> environment<00:01:45.090> slightly

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
interact with the environment slightly

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.429 
interact with the environment slightly
different<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.740> as<00:01:46.950> we<00:01:47.100> go<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.520> one<00:01:47.820> island

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
different so as we go to one island

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.020
