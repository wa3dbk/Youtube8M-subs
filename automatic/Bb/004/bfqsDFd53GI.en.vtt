00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.760
 underground streams 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.280
 and around them has appeared a 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.280
 abundant vegetation 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.330

 one of the most important and exclusive 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.630
 Peruvian spas then 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.870
 houses and hotels were built 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:50.019
 a beautiful boardwalk was raised around 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.019
 from the lagoon 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.980

 presence of its best two times 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.390
 survivors of this era are first

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.860
 land 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.659
 where whose interior can be appreciated 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.989
 the works that the artist painted by the 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:41.989
 local 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:51.069
 it is true that currently the lagoon 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.069
 of huacachina looks somewhat damaged 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:59.159
 the waters of the lagoon have descended 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:59.159
 about 50 centimeters from its original level 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.200
 at the same time they have lost their greenness 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.200
 but because of its proximity to the city its 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:13.950
 easy access and all the infrastructure 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.950
 with what counts 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.520
 it is still a point of passage 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:26.199
 Mandatory for travelers and tourists 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.199

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.310
 especially for young people who 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.040
 have discovered that in the dunes and in 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.670
 the dunes surrounding the oasis of 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.280

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:44.610
 as iquenos call it to the mouth 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.610
 China 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:56.749
 they are an excellent place to practice 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:05:00.490
 of adventure sports such as 

00:04:56.749 --> 00:05:00.490

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.720

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.750
 contributed to that the easy thing of Peru 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.350
 otermín call oasis of america be more 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.350
 known 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:34.570
 sculptures were built such as 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.570
 sérvulo gutiérrez 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.050
 josé de la torre ugarte among others 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.600
 history of the huacachina lagoon 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.569
 There is a legend about the origin of 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:56.630
 this oasis a love story that is 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:59.210
 traces very pre-Hispanic times 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.880
 where a maiden woman coming in 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:04.340
 the nearby town of caracas arrived 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:07.610
 disconsolate to this place where only 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:09.560
 there were about 4 guarangos to cry at 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.310
 death of his beloved of a brave 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:15.710
 Inca general according to some versions 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:19.010
 the tear of this green-eyed woman 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:21.440
 and very black hair were forming 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.610
 little by little the lagoon is said to be 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.219
 nights of the new moon 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:30.379
 you can hear their laments those that 

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:30.379
 confuse unsuspecting visitors 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:36.140
 well this has been all the work 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:38.660
 about what the peru will be before me 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:41.120
 called oasis of america this why 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:45.190
 because there is no other place in all 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.190
 america is not the base of the huacachina
