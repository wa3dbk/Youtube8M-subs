00:00:08.226 --> 00:00:10.226
 what do you think 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:12.549
 I would be with you 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:13.877
 if you were a man? 

00:00:14.398 --> 00:00:16.398
 not 

00:00:17.391 --> 00:00:19.391
 Matt is taking me home 

00:00:19.391 --> 00:00:20.823
 to Stefan 

00:00:20.823 --> 00:00:22.063
 no i don't think we would be together 

00:00:22.063 --> 00:00:23.357
 if you were still a man 

00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:25.165
 if the choice was between me and him 

00:00:27.185 --> 00:00:29.185
 and you would have to do it 

00:00:29.282 --> 00:00:31.282
 who would you choose? 

00:00:31.334 --> 00:00:33.334
 you chose Stefan 

00:00:33.334 --> 00:00:35.245
 it's not about me, Elena 

00:00:35.745 --> 00:00:36.245
 it's about stefan 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:42.449
 according to legend, you are destined to each other by fate 

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:47.869
 as soon as she comes to herself 

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:49.666
 she will immediately return to Stefan 

00:00:51.444 --> 00:00:53.444
 it's true that becoming a vampire 

00:00:53.444 --> 00:00:54.901
 have I completely changed? 

00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:56.188
 I just don't want to be ... 

00:00:56.188 --> 00:00:57.786
 ...like me 

00:00:58.927 --> 00:01:00.927
 i don't want to change you 

00:01:08.376 --> 00:01:10.376
 Matt drove me to him 

00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:13.002
 I still came back to you 

00:01:19.221 --> 00:01:21.221
 it doesn't matter if I remember or not 

00:01:21.565 --> 00:01:23.565
 it doesn't matter whether I am a vampire or not 

00:01:30.611 --> 00:01:32.611
 i always come back 

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:34.634
 to you 

00:01:38.291 --> 00:01:40.291
 don't love me 

00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:41.591
 I can not! 

00:01:42.373 --> 00:01:44.373
 I don't want to stop loving him 

00:01:44.373 --> 00:01:45.934
 I will love you 

00:01:45.934 --> 00:01:47.168
 even after when it's all over 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:50.929
 think about it, Elena 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:52.258
 think about the moment you knew 

00:01:52.258 --> 00:01:54.051
 what do you have feelings for him 

00:01:54.051 --> 00:01:55.514
 that you loved him 

00:01:55.514 --> 00:01:56.936
 and saw with him forever 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:02.189
 Damon, somehow I always come back to you 

00:02:02.462 --> 00:02:04.462
 i don't want to see him 

00:02:04.462 --> 00:02:05.917
 i want to see you 

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:07.710
 i hate him stefan 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.742
 i like you now 

00:02:08.742 --> 00:02:10.366
 i must let you go 

00:02:10.366 --> 00:02:11.000
 you 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.505
 it seems to me that I will die 

00:02:12.787 --> 00:02:14.787
 I never felt more alive 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:19.409
 the universe controls nothing 

00:02:23.775 --> 00:02:25.775
 I made a lot of terrible mistakes 

00:02:27.406 --> 00:02:29.406
 but the fact that I was with you was not a mistake 

00:02:35.313 --> 00:02:37.313
 so if the past is a place where we are not together 

00:02:38.745 --> 00:02:40.745
 then stop living
