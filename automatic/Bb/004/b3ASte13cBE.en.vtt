00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.069
 it's summer again this is another one 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.139
 new series 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.240
 galaxy pepsi can almost clock this up 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.980
 put a Samsung right nowadays 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.289
 comes again this time with a 7-inch 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.539
 and the 10.1 inch so nothing new that flat 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.699
 but also for the first time with an 8-inch 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.970
 galaxy tab and we don't see that size 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.859
 often 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.240
 and that alone makes it worthwhile 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.240
 worth a closer look 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.110
 from the outside the only thing is me 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.790
 actually distinguish that format from 8 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.500
 inch or the rest is it over and over 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.059
 a galaxy device 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.220
 just like the other feature tips and the 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.470
 note and the galaxy smartphones he has 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.989
 a glossy plastic casing in white 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.760
 this case with a silver color 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.620
 edge yes it's good to see that 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.059
 sand and nowadays is consistent with 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.550
 they have design that says have a design 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.140
 to use all those devices 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.429
 another side if prefer it anyway 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.020
 we 'd rather see them something 

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:09.960
 tighter design had chosen that 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.460
 slightly less plastic is that 8 inches 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.560
 format is fine and it is mainly because 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.840
 kept the Samsung tablet compact 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.690
 he is nice and thin he also does not weigh 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.590
 much 314 grams and that is why it is good 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.149
 dinant 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.310
 and also nice is that they besselsen 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.630
 nice and thin screen on the long side 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.940
 therefore he is 8 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.860
 inch tablet pretty narrow and that helps 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.880
 again if you have a hand that way 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.020
 hold 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.090
 as we do from samsung though 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.039
 are used to that tab 3 8 inches 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.330
 well equipped you have a micro usb 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.640
 port to which is also used for 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.439
 charge and pair from the computer 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.790
 but you also have a micro sd 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.649
 Finally the you can make memory easier 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.180
 and he also has one 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.439
 infrared transmitter 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.210
 and therefore you can act as a remote control 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.930
 use for your tv well i do n't have it 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.060
 often used 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.189
 but it is a funny feature on it 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.509
 the field of hardware is something that three 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.399
 not as spectacular as it gets 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.490
 powered by Samsung's own 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.170
 exynos 4212 chip and it already dates back 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.369
 2011 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.500
 and that is also slightly faster than 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.000
 a chip that was adopted in the galaxy s2 is 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.729
 now with the galaxy s4 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.989
 so as a difference of two generations 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.390
 and you notice that a bit there 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.700
 works well with that tablet but 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.829
 as often seen in samsung shock 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.230
 that interface is the frame rate for us 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:20.160
 low and in addition the touch is on 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.049
 the touchscreen 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.340
 sometimes not well registered especially with 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.570
 the notification bar 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.239
 sometimes you have to go a few times from above 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.620
 sneak down before he 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.840
 finally grabs 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.640
 yes and for a tablet of 300 euros 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.140
 I already expected better 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.450
 follow an ipad mini that is not even 2 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.200
 tens of more expensive is a whole lot 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.549
 responsive there also the screen is not top 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.010
 blood while app for two generations 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.990
 has long been on iPad and Sony now 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.400
 the tablet minus the full hd screen 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.610
 and google the new nexus 7 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.890
 announced for the screen and he together 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.110
 still a resolution of 1280 at 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.120
 800 pixels and can now just predict 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.640
 that in the coming months in the area of bacon 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.690
 Going beyond being far is one 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.730
 color have production 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.930
 also not very good the only thing it 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.400
 screen actually get 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.830
 is the high brightness name can also 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.390
 good use and relatively good 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.010
 viewing angles 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.780
 well what samsung certainly good for each other 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.610
 has is the battery life 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.130
 He goes about seven and a half hours 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.110
 in our housing test and 8 hours in 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.850
 the video testing is certainly possible 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.100
 three films they look up continuously 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.260
 and with that leaves many an android tablet 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.690
 in the back it even comes fairly close 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.330
 near the ipad mini samsung 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.980
 android always adjusts considerably by touch 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.620
 with in that they build their own 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.090
 variant on android with different skin 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.650
 a different appearance other possibilities 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.900
 in other colors 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.370
 Well used to say 20 years ago 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.690
 it also needed because android as then 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.370
 still very young 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.740
 the fog still had many friends and google 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.480
 then really little eye for design but 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.370
 Android has huge last year 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.750
 made steps while touch with qua 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.610
 appearance actually a bit quiet 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.380
 and you could say 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.330
 that sometimes a bit caught up is the 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.900
 Google and TouchWiz now looks a little 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.000
 bit 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.210
 yes old-fashioned and a bit childish 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.610
 in terms of possibilities 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.170
 touch with does not stand still at all 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.360
 even opposite samsung prop at 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.520
 every new version more and more 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.560
 more features the ring and it seems it was 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.300
 sometimes as if they want to adjust things 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.430
 purely to make the adjustment purely to let 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.799
 See that these are Samsung devices 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.480
 not just in android tablet after one 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.700
 The result is that touch with nowadays 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.230
 a bit exposed it is full of it 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.720
 features that you may not all have 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.950
 need and also make adjustments that 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.750
 may not all be needed 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.030
 the settings menu for example 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.250
 normally that is with a single column 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.570
 that works great here are 2 column 2 wood 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.520
 used that is not necessary 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.040
 It was also less well and had them 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.570
 to have let so tasty and well 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.430
 more things like that 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:48.250
 just feel a bit forced 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.960
 Samsung is also a bit stubborn 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.080
 they still use the old ones 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.240
 menu button and that they menu button via Google 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.700
 been discarded long been a reason to order 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.410
 discarded is that you never know if 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.660
 an app that supports menu button you need 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.220
 you press and then you see if you 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.390
 can do something with it 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.100
 well in all apps that samsung 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.230
 you still have to add to that 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.880
 menu button to look or somewhere 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.470
 hidden options 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.820
 it would be a lot nicer about samsung 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.770
 this area would just go with it 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.600
 google with new guidelines and the 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.550
 menu button 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.560
 well touch with so certainly yes 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.720
 we can also use makeover 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.340
 certainly good side because samsung delivers 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.050
 a lot of apps with my own 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.090
 appstore that in the often nice offer 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.980
 in you get that remote control 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.870
 a good video player and a browser 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.950
 which is considerably optimized and therefore 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.950
 works smoothly 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.020
 tab 3 8 inch is really such a tablet 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.120
 can not call it bad he deserves 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.040
 not either but you think the other side too 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.880
 actually out of nowhere 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.530
 it also feels a bit like one 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.420
 uninspired tablet as if you were in it 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.610
 put together with parts that give birth 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.230
 were left at samsung 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.900
 what they did draw is 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:58.490
 size and the battery life but the rest 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.470
 the processor in the screen in the 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.210
 software the touch with it's all 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.460
 a bit mediocre and certainly if you 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.350
 consider that samsung here 300 euros 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.850
 want for 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.630
 well at the moment we find that tab 3 8 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.060
 inch 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.770
 so already on the expensive side but certainly with 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.410
 knowing that it will be in the coming months 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.180
 Many small tablets arrive with better ones 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.640
 specs and most likely those too 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.630
 to be even cheaper must really be 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.100
 to conclude 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.200
 so if you really value for money we 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:27.130
 better yet can wait for 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.130
 what the competition comes with
