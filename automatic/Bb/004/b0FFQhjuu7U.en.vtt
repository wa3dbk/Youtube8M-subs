00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
well as some basic instructions it's

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.490 
well as some basic instructions it's
actually<00:00:51.449> pretty<00:00:51.600> interesting<00:00:51.899> about<00:00:52.289> this

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
actually pretty interesting about this

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.319 
actually pretty interesting about this
is<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.250> vehicle<00:00:53.640> shown<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.120> box

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
is that the vehicle shown on the box

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.600 
is that the vehicle shown on the box
actually<00:00:54.600> differs<00:00:55.530> from<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.010> vehicle<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.550> the

actually differs from the vehicle in the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.180 
actually differs from the vehicle in the
box<00:00:56.910> my<00:00:57.719> guess<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.260> prototype<00:00:58.680> pictures

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
box my guess is that prototype pictures

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.830 
box my guess is that prototype pictures
were<00:00:59.309> used<00:00:59.489> for<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.730> box<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.270> actually

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
were used for the box and actually

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.569 
were used for the box and actually
prefer<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.649> look<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.129> one<00:01:02.280> we<00:01:02.430> received
