but I think that a lot of people already
have<00:04:35.770> the<00:04:36.039> game<00:04:36.220> that<00:04:36.580> it's<00:04:36.789> not<00:04:37.030> as<00:04:37.360> unique<00:04:38.320> as

always good luck to everyone and I just

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.629 
always good luck to everyone and I just
want<00:05:04.509> to<00:05:04.900> try<00:05:05.229> and<00:05:05.289> make<00:05:05.650> a<00:05:05.680> few<00:05:05.919> people<00:05:06.280> happy

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
want to try and make a few people happy

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:11.250 
want to try and make a few people happy
and<00:05:07.260> I<00:05:08.340> can<00:05:09.340> do<00:05:09.820> that<00:05:10.060> in<00:05:10.330> hopefully<00:05:10.780> this<00:05:10.930> way

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
and I can do that in hopefully this way

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.020 
and I can do that in hopefully this way
and<00:05:11.500> so<00:05:12.039> I<00:05:12.070> guess<00:05:12.310> that<00:05:12.340> also<00:05:12.550> fourth<00:05:12.909> to<00:05:13.000> fifth

and so I guess that also fourth to fifth

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.990 
and so I guess that also fourth to fifth
place<00:05:13.330> I<00:05:13.599> will<00:05:13.990> have<00:05:14.289> just<00:05:15.070> like<00:05:15.250> some<00:05:15.699> shiny
