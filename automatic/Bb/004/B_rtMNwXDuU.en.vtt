00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:02.890
 but so much football he played himself 

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:04.620
 which position 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.550
 Pour in 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.629
 Allplan Kaiser sends you thanks 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:13.629
 w 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.580
 in the words the biggest and known 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.009
 she tappe carnic 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.009
 in El Arenal it would be Pauli say 3 inches 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:29.050
 Treat yourself to peace and quiet 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.129
 we were just quicker to orient and so it comes back buried 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:36.140
 or a new hiking trail 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.550
 the football there with Emperor Nero and all the hardship this time the the 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.230
 be sensitive 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.350
 Moniz go 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.140
 and they do not have to let Dr be percent here as well 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.660
 to add our mustard friends South Africa is the host country and there 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.160
 of course I would like to hear from you what you get from this country 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.860
 yes winter writes sentence and hold so it is a bit cold there 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:00.930
 and 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.730
 and you can say all this new Lara Chur will be for the DFB and 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.870
 for our national team preparing the ideal preparation 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.900
 to the next tournament »GM 2012 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.330
 and above all, what about the crime statistics of the legs 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.110
 determined 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.340
 Guggenbühl figures they only dived out any and parallels 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.300
 Yalom is used to us and is from the perspective of the city this is one 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.440
 long before the tournament 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.050
 to come to the conclusion that really is the only one 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.540
 Difference between poland / ukraine and if she is there for it actually around 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.480
 yes they are there are more black and that they even in the 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.100
 Winter so yes and at the moment it is too 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.890
 Year after his Polo otherwise 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.360
 is turned 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.020
 JAL sad but true about South Africa, the host has a wonderful country around 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.060
 the German national team that had landed a few days in the district 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.230
 moved in and has to be welcomed directly on mobile phones so synonymous get the 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.030
 Coalition or one officially agrees not set up, however, is that 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.280
 Net not built up and the grainy then talk the Aachener is 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.280
 However, what is completely different yes our sources say that the 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.240
 All mobile phones were collected by Lukas Podolski and Mesut özil 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.050
 ADR's loaners had the option of Farce and Piotr 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.779
 To buy back Trochowski again 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:15.579
 "Wonderful" wonderful that he runs 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:20.470
 the young German team for you to young fall from no absolutely 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.950
 "Absolutely not" to Dunga 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.119
 all these in a good mood 

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:25.220
 apart from preparation was world class 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.710
 Even though some top players mistake Jaffé because they are hurt Rare around 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.710
 Nevertheless, I think that they will come a long way 

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:36.699
 perhaps in a timely manner, the emperor might have even anticipated songs 

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:37.470
 further 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.710
 Teacher will start the final tournament for the people », said Mattes on Sunday 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.560
 against the first group opponents the Australians then it starts at 20 30 and 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.719
 yes, the Australian 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:51.839
 an interesting team an interesting aspect just have five players 

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:56.609
 over 50 caps and yes that makes us but courage or definitely us 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.010
 are against any form as a German team around 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.379
 m Kramer wishes again funds over 50 caps surface light we have 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:03.809
 at least 6 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:06.369
 So grab an advantage on our side yes and 

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:08.629
 But ozil has to say but I know during the holidays 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.790
 researched it has my favorite word around the pan in 50's 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.390
 Internationals or whatever I'm 60s they may be the five players around 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:22.079
 Hold on 20 25 30 against Thaci Samoa New Zealand still fits so bookable 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.689
 Turner been that singer in front of us 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:27.720
 are missing these games only as yes once not even seen 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.230
 from experience more meaning the very clear advantage even if our 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.789
 team 

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:33.419
 quite clear advantage of doing so by the NAS, there are also a few others 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:36.319
 Facts about the Australia are more than interesting 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.269
 The Australian, fortunately, has only two trained strikers in the field 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.659
 a in the whole squad one is Joshua know the Danes from the Bundeswehr in 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:44.860
 Cannes from Karlsruher SC 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.959
 who is now in care in Japan and the other 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:48.930
 around Galicia 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.709
 or something like that and the soup from Ukraine 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.699
 great, but I believe only two 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:57.969
 with two strikers that clearly shows that Australia is the focus entirely 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:01.469
 clear on the defensive is the defensive and so are 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:05.079
 it is always one player the other so now with his team 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:06.260
 Siegen can join again 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.870
 He also has his crew is naturally holding his ears 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.649
 del plays in the 

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:13.169
 Turkish 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:16.419
 Ott at Galatasary Istanbul, which this year reaches a bluish square 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:17.120
 to have 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.070
 Since you can already see percent year Jules holds as much value as the phones 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.460
 from the German cloud and RM 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.530
 Cocktails Merkel pleaded 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.849
 the sail yes that has its advantages 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:31.899
 Super League South Wales atmosphere but Tim Cahill the Swede is longer 

00:04:31.899 --> 00:04:35.439
 when expect that no bad that still very short and mild of the 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:39.259
 Australian team will say two shells again yes and there he will 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:40.660
 sleep and German knees 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.380
 too expensive for us but we'll see what on sunday 11 Blatter looked up 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.419
 the place work 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.139
 Percent quite interesting 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.199
 are also a few other lyrics Australian national team under 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:54.159
 percent other a very important link between Australia and APA 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:55.870
 Samoa is right 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:56.650
 he sure 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.749
 Australia has the Northern Murra those of 

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:00.700
 Victory of 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.479
 AR international history unofficial 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:06.770
 nla-game of FIFA retraced I was one of his view to zero once so 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.740
 I have you different Men Tanner im 31 that makes him KUNIGKEIT 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.479
 but good but also in the ear but played alone there went eleven people product 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.389
 Eick american-samoa hot summer night but so clock, after all 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:19.389
 Eleven players or Jaggi also directs it bored alone 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:21.240
 but in 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.180
 he may not be able to prove so well about Pauli and what also 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.630
 On it alone she has questions she brought him friends 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:27.460
 the game 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.930
 is so close to the box and we'll see what happens 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.699
 Of course, it is also interesting that the tournament is expensive 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:36.600
 will be installed world champion 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.889
 Heldt the trophy at the end 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:41.430
 Jan the people talk a lot about England twice they lent 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.690
 Min and how they are called but but I think the winner is Germany 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.199
 hot or if you look at a Piccoli 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:49.199
 Also the Polish team has their preferences and around 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.210
 of course, Cuba got the otherwise easier 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.360
 I like my team there so I believe the Germany Travel Real 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.680
 the Polish team against dam break and flood 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.629
 just hard for the team 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:04.099
 At the end of the bout, Dutt let the Polish champion hospital list end up 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:06.650
 itself is in signal iduna park percent 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.319
 the long-term average 

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:12.030
 like the tick Erika Erica I see March for you Germany as 

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:12.939
 World Champion 

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:16.050
 Dell for me there is only one problem, that is Kim Yong Il 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.020
 North Korean who casts it President King the crime scene a hunch 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.080
 Hermann in the state first man in the state 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.800
 he I pity that he threatens to start other countries 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.530
 War nuclear bomb everything so what he has hidden to his country there or so 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:30.749
 that's why 

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:34.079
 I think I now in Europe, but otherwise give Germany very clear 

00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:35.800
 Favorite for me and the economy 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.569
 To Jung said Bremen for a euro, there are thousands of euros 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:43.350
 a world champion tip on North Korea so maybe back home one 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:45.529
 recognized problem of the Mainzer information 

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:49.259
 As of Thursday, close to North Korea around I expect that he himself 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:53.169
 In the last group game on a horse, horseback riding should be done and transferred 

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:54.529
 scored three goals 

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:56.009
 that sounds very real is not 

00:06:56.009 --> 00:06:59.009
 Herne I would like to set the Trierer also join a BMZ 

00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:01.939
 Germany world champion 

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:06.050
 Games against Spain also learn from another like Westerwelle now 

00:07:06.049 --> 00:07:09.289
 Striker the better save the best midfield though 

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:11.449
 when 

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:13.159
 Nadal 

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:15.689
 Patriot the competition he was anyway 

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:18.069
 World star Raúl as well as in summer 

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:21.490
 also in Africa now winter is Germany for world champion 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:22.550
 with these words 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.810
 even while saying that and then it seems like far away places too 

00:07:26.939 --> 00:07:29.939
 with come experience women 

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:34.020
 Herten 

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.169
 Huber Tel No says honestly
