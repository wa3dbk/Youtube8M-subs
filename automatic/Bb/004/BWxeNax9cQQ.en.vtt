50<00:01:15.840> ingredients<00:01:15.960> which<00:01:16.680> scares<00:01:17.009> me<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.549> little

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
50 ingredients which scares me a little

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.980 
50 ingredients which scares me a little
thicker<00:01:18.000> than<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.270> thought<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.540> would<00:01:18.630> be<00:01:18.750> I

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
thicker than I thought it would be I

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.749 
thicker than I thought it would be I
thought<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.710> would<00:01:19.860> look<00:01:19.979> like<00:01:20.040> syrup<00:01:20.490> it

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
thought it would look like syrup it

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.310 
thought it would look like syrup it
looks<00:01:20.880> more<00:01:21.060> like<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.240> honey<00:01:21.450> mustard<00:01:21.630> with<00:01:22.200> the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
looks more like a honey mustard with the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.370 
looks more like a honey mustard with the
sauce<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.860> think<00:01:22.920> I'm<00:01:23.070> gonna<00:01:23.159> be<00:01:23.250> blown<00:01:23.400> away

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
sauce I think I'm gonna be blown away

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.310 
sauce I think I'm gonna be blown away
that's<00:01:25.380> good<00:01:26.119> if<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.240> ate<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.570> whole<00:01:27.659> thing<00:01:28.110> I

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
that's good if I ate a whole thing I

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.590 
that's good if I ate a whole thing I
think<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.740> was<00:01:28.860> going<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.250> food<00:01:29.430> coma<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:30.060> feel

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
think I was going to a food coma I feel

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.120 
think I was going to a food coma I feel
like<00:01:30.840> they're<00:01:31.110> probably<00:01:31.290> just<00:01:31.619> putting<00:01:31.950> a

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
like they're probably just putting a

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.950 
like they're probably just putting a
dollar

that or calling it something new because

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.789 
that or calling it something new because
they're<00:01:36.960> not<00:01:37.020> gonna<00:01:37.170> really<00:01:37.290> mess<00:01:37.530> with<00:01:37.560> their
