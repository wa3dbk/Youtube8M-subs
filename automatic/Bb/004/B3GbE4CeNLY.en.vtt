Australia has been incredible and I

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.790 
Australia has been incredible and I
think<00:00:56.809> we're<00:00:56.930> just<00:00:57.110> starting<00:00:57.290> to<00:00:57.410> get<00:00:57.559> to<00:00:57.710> that

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
think we're just starting to get to that

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.100 
think we're just starting to get to that
nexus<00:00:58.190> point<00:00:58.399> of<00:00:58.699> understanding<00:00:58.970> where<00:00:59.930> the

on those regional characteristics

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.300 
on those regional characteristics
certainly<00:01:05.449> regional<00:01:06.200> diversity<00:01:06.380> comes<00:01:07.130> to

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310

of<00:01:34.580> things<00:01:34.640> each<00:01:35.500> region<00:01:36.500> is<00:01:36.649> developing<00:01:37.520> its

of things each region is developing its
own<00:01:37.850> style<00:01:38.210> so<00:01:38.570> people<00:01:39.050> have<00:01:39.170> worked<00:01:39.320> out<00:01:39.560> that

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
own style so people have worked out that

margaret river for example you know it
was<00:01:41.720> all<00:01:41.869> about<00:01:42.170> powerful<00:01:42.590> fruit<00:01:43.009> with<00:01:43.160> the

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
was all about powerful fruit with the

was all about powerful fruit with the
Yarra<00:01:43.490> Valley<00:01:43.580> is<00:01:43.910> probably<00:01:44.149> more<00:01:44.300> about

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
Yarra Valley is probably more about

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.810 
Yarra Valley is probably more about
minerality<00:01:44.960> and<00:01:45.320> complexity<00:01:45.890> and<00:01:46.070> and<00:01:46.250> each

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
minerality and complexity and and each

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.639 
minerality and complexity and and each
region<00:01:47.390> will<00:01:47.539> find<00:01:47.810> where<00:01:48.110> that<00:01:48.140> pendulum

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
region will find where that pendulum

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.649 
region will find where that pendulum
stops<00:01:49.039> and<00:01:49.399> find<00:01:49.909> their<00:01:50.060> own<00:01:50.119> balance<00:01:50.390> which

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
stops and find their own balance which

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.779 
stops and find their own balance which
is<00:01:50.810> fantastic<00:01:50.990> and<00:01:51.530> so<00:01:51.740> great<00:01:52.009> to<00:01:52.190> see<00:01:52.220> fruit

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
is fantastic and so great to see fruit

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:54.639 
is fantastic and so great to see fruit
is<00:01:52.970> still<00:01:53.240> a<00:01:53.270> hero<00:01:53.509> and<00:01:53.840> people<00:01:54.200> are<00:01:54.259> not<00:01:54.409> using

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
is still a hero and people are not using

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.309 
is still a hero and people are not using
too<00:01:54.920> much<00:01:55.070> oak<00:01:55.340> and<00:01:56.000> artifact<00:01:56.690> is<00:01:56.869> pushed<00:01:57.170> back

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
too much oak and artifact is pushed back

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:59.589 
too much oak and artifact is pushed back
into<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.679> one<00:01:57.860> choosing<00:01:58.520> winning<00:01:59.000> wines<00:01:59.179> is

00:01:59.589 --> 00:01:59.599 
into the one choosing winning wines is

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:02.620 
into the one choosing winning wines is
really<00:02:00.380> about<00:02:00.649> finding<00:02:01.610> examples<00:02:02.209> of

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
really about finding examples of

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.960 
really about finding examples of
different<00:02:02.690> styles<00:02:03.470> we<00:02:03.979> will<00:02:04.220> find<00:02:04.520> type

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
different styles we will find type

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.389 
different styles we will find type
examples<00:02:05.690> will<00:02:05.899> find<00:02:06.259> some<00:02:06.470> uh<00:02:06.619> sure<00:02:06.800> examples

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
examples will find some uh sure examples

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:08.949 
examples will find some uh sure examples
but<00:02:07.759> as<00:02:07.880> long<00:02:08.030> as<00:02:08.060> they're<00:02:08.270> balanced<00:02:08.780> and

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
but as long as they're balanced and

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.140 
but as long as they're balanced and
they're<00:02:09.380> like<00:02:10.039> it's<00:02:10.190> true<00:02:10.429> to<00:02:10.550> themselves<00:02:10.940> as

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
they're like it's true to themselves as

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.839 
they're like it's true to themselves as
wife<00:02:11.390> then<00:02:11.780> we'll<00:02:12.200> find<00:02:12.440> gold<00:02:12.739> if<00:02:13.190> you<00:02:13.610> look<00:02:13.760> at

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
wife then we'll find gold if you look at

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.550 
wife then we'll find gold if you look at
the<00:02:13.940> wines<00:02:14.150> it's<00:02:14.569> very<00:02:14.959> much<00:02:15.140> a<00:02:15.170> rollercoaster

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
the wines it's very much a rollercoaster

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.640 
the wines it's very much a rollercoaster
of<00:02:15.890> style<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:16.540> I<00:02:17.540> think<00:02:18.020> that's<00:02:18.200> part<00:02:18.470> of<00:02:18.530> the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
of style and I think that's part of the

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.530 
of style and I think that's part of the
joy<00:02:18.800> of<00:02:18.830> discovering<00:02:19.730> Chardonnay<00:02:20.090> for<00:02:20.270> people

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
joy of discovering Chardonnay for people

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.809 
joy of discovering Chardonnay for people
is<00:02:20.720> being<00:02:20.989> able<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.319> find<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.980> pleasure<00:02:22.280> in

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
seeing Australian chardonnays at a level

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.660 
seeing Australian chardonnays at a level
that<00:02:32.660> is<00:02:32.959> is<00:02:33.230> truly<00:02:33.620> competitive<00:02:33.950> on<00:02:34.370> a

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
that is is truly competitive on a

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.410 
that is is truly competitive on a
worldwide<00:02:35.030> basis

worldwide basis

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.790
