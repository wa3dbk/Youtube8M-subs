00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.430
 george Havas has nevertheless is 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.990
 still a sacred player he confirms to 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.370
 chilliwack me I find it good I 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.639
 find that there is no better back 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.809
 left in crucell francs at home in 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.040
 French football is him 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.389
 better left back he'll have to 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.770
 very quickly that we think about it for the team of 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.770
 France I wonder how far 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.960
 at the moment we have to look psg where 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.160
 actually we all noted in any case 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.930
 I noticed that since the beginning of the 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.970
 paris season for me they do not have 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.349
 started again and I think the match 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.150
 against saint-etienne was a kind of 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.070
 their because holy night there was 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.750
 really as a tourist and that it's a 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.239
 score that was swollen arch that the 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.660
 circumstances have made that sometimes the 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.710
 scores like that inflates itself alone I 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.010
 did not see them make a good match 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.460
 again and I know that there is in this 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.309
 team 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.950
 a kind of return to the sufficiency that 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.750
 we pointed out some time ago to psg 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.860
 I have a nice start a little when all 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.739
 stars began to arrive 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.539
 last year I think the arrival 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.530
 monaco of the Monegasque investor 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.969
 had done a lot of good 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.620
 indirectly prevent it's always the 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.080
 same story when we say that the 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.420
 locomotives that rivalries make 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.560
 raise the level of pushing you that did 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.420
 a lot of good it's a like there is a 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.740
 rival and monaco to they took falcao 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.020
 is one and I think the players of the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.090
 psg are diabate is holding the league 1 going 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.530
 ride because monaco is trying 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.850
 to arrive because time was said 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.009
 even at the lens was going to have 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.119
 sorrel there was a kind of 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.650
 wriggling at the beginning of the season 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.530
 last alas this year it was starting 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.360
 boom all went down monaco bass is 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.310
 spinning and I believe 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.780
 that it plays somewhere on the psg 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.390
 that is saying brad fish is going 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.310
 to be a champion by playing 50% and 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.780
 risk of finding a sufficient psg 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.650
 arrogant I did not like them at all 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.990
 reindeer service 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.540
 the problem is it will tell me that 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.490
 for a year now is what a 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.740
 day we had something new in 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.450
 the compo an experiment on a 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.590
 tweet to a little something a little different 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.509
 as you say for example 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.369
 here I feel that david luiz at 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.049
 middle he goes a little what things and 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.399
 I'm going to hinge when silva 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.829
 come back if he'll score but by 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.170
 example or hot tea no I went there will be 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.600
 well there will never have been any more stuff 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.520
 like that there is no coincidence 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.170
 I did not stop laughing all the way 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.310
 time will matuidi continue to 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.649
 to be on the bench the first match of 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.360
 league of champions has arrived 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.610
 white had announced in the combe of 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.829
 yeah lie to you i know more he has 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.239
 come out good had told him he must not 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:19.790
 to be really ready because I think 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.950
 that if not he will play again 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.659
 even later come back in them 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.069
 agree with him but it seems he will not go 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.500
 on the bench it will be Belgium had neither 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.909
 arm so we will come back as by the way 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.040
 it was tonight the traditional team 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:36.620
 who will never change who this one is 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.480
 it's his eleven it does not move he to these 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.849
 principles there when the visit will be 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.379
 totally restored to shape he will come back 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.030
 at lukasz will return to the bench at 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.620
 see everyone else you have not 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.609
 of experiments you will not have yes 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:53.629
 frankly you can and it's like that 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:54.859
 we remove the spectators from the years 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.480
 now that we are exchanging on the air 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:58.069
 both of them that makes I believe since 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.319
 the euro-2008 we did together 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.560
 you already remember two when we 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.030
 spoke and you it's normal everything was 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.230
 supercharged on the ground maybe that 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.760
 you became aware of things a 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.150
 little bit later but you remember 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.389
 of all our discussions especially in 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.889
 two in 2010 it started when we 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:17.810
 was starting to talk about German football 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:19.790
 and we wonder if football 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.629
 French in 2010 we still have two clubs 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.129
 in the league quarterfinals 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.049
 champions anyway huh so you had 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.879
 enough to say no everything is not dead or 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.260
 is not this this I'm starting to be 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.370
 worried have started to study that 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.959
 together to do comparative 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.069
 now German football they 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.540
 try beyond so much he has us 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.639
 surpassed he is world champion he 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.919
 final afut two semi-finals at the euro 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:38.030
 in short, we do not even talk about them all 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:40.099
 start to happen in front of us 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.900
 at first I remember when we had 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.430
 so this does not concern you but when 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.650
 we had debates sometimes on football 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.359
 Portuguese now everybody has 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.060
 heard Portuguese football stronger 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:52.099
 in smart recruitment all in the 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.319
 descent is much worse here is the 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.329
 descent she and she seems inexorable 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.349
 year after year because even you who 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.609
 was still someone very 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.530
 positive for a long time 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:02.750
 ab i come today has more 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.040
 often more and more I was very 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.090
 pessimistic but you're good we're good 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.479
 obliged now we are more and more 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.479
 Okay
