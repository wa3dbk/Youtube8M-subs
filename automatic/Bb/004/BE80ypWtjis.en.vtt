hey<00:00:00.539> guys<00:00:00.750> this<00:00:00.900> is<00:00:00.960> going<00:00:01.230> to<00:00:01.290> be<00:00:01.410> the<00:00:01.530> home

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:02.540 
hey guys this is going to be the home

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.930 
hey guys this is going to be the home
third<00:00:03.540> know<00:00:04.020> the<00:00:04.170> second<00:00:04.560> video<00:00:04.940> theory

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
third know the second video theory

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.770 
third know the second video theory
behind<00:00:06.770> drifting<00:00:07.770> like<00:00:08.389> it's<00:00:09.389> best<00:00:09.630> to

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
behind drifting like it's best to

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.259 
behind drifting like it's best to
understand<00:00:10.349> like<00:00:10.650> he's<00:00:10.800> easier<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.250> be<00:00:12.120> able

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
understand like he's easier to be able

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.850 
understand like he's easier to be able
to<00:00:12.360> drift<00:00:12.570> if<00:00:12.750> you<00:00:12.900> understand<00:00:13.500> what<00:00:13.679> you're

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
to drift if you understand what you're

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.450 
to drift if you understand what you're
actually<00:00:14.040> doing<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.880> like<00:00:16.039> if<00:00:17.039> you<00:00:17.160> think<00:00:17.369> of

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
actually doing and like if you think of

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.340 
actually doing and like if you think of
it<00:00:17.550> all<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:18.029> basically<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.810> controlled

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
it all it is basically is a controlled

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.220 
it all it is basically is a controlled
slide<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.850> starts<00:00:21.150> slidin<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:22.020> have<00:00:22.109> to

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
slide and it starts slidin you have to

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.950 
slide and it starts slidin you have to
lose<00:00:22.470> control<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.609> lose<00:00:23.760> control<00:00:24.240> you

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
lose control and you lose control you

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.320 
lose control and you lose control you
either<00:00:25.170> have<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.680> slam<00:00:26.250> on<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.519> brakes<00:00:26.789> well

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
either have to slam on the brakes well

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.000 
either have to slam on the brakes well
first<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.840> all<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.320> solve<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.800> tiger

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
first of all is to solve the tiger

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.319 
first of all is to solve the tiger
problem<00:00:29.400> which<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.609> on<00:00:30.349> loss<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.560> traction

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
problem which is on loss of traction

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.180 
problem which is on loss of traction
rubber<00:00:33.329> tires<00:00:33.660> won't<00:00:34.050> cut<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:34.980> have<00:00:35.100> to

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
rubber tires won't cut it so you have to

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.220 
rubber tires won't cut it so you have to
tape<00:00:35.489> them<00:00:35.700> or<00:00:35.880> get<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.149> plastic<00:00:36.480> drift<00:00:36.930> tires

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
tape them or get the plastic drift tires

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.000 
tape them or get the plastic drift tires
or<00:00:37.590> something<00:00:37.980> but<00:00:38.820> yeah<00:00:39.629> um<00:00:39.870> what<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:40.920> have

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
or something but yeah um what you have

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.830 
or something but yeah um what you have
to<00:00:41.070> do<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.399> either<00:00:41.520> lose<00:00:41.820> control<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.629> either

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
to do to either lose control is either

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.479 
to do to either lose control is either
one<00:00:43.230> slam<00:00:43.890> on<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.190> brakes<00:00:44.430> really<00:00:44.700> hard<00:00:45.000> or<00:00:45.239> to

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
one slam on the brakes really hard or to

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.490 
one slam on the brakes really hard or to
mash<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.730> throttle<00:00:48.149> because<00:00:48.930> most<00:00:49.170> people

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
mash the throttle because most people

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.950 
mash the throttle because most people
when<00:00:49.590> they<00:00:49.620> get<00:00:49.800> into<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.280> drift<00:00:50.809> actually<00:00:51.809> all

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
when they get into to drift actually all

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.810 
when they get into to drift actually all
people<00:00:52.500> when<00:00:52.649> they<00:00:52.770> get<00:00:52.890> into<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.129> drift<00:00:53.399> aren't

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
people when they get into a drift aren't

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.790 
people when they get into a drift aren't
on<00:00:53.879> full<00:00:54.149> throttle<00:00:54.350> so<00:00:55.350> you're<00:00:56.160> just<00:00:56.250> like

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.160 

most<00:01:01.800> people<00:01:02.219> they're<00:01:02.640> like<00:01:03.170> quarter

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
most people they're like quarter

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.560 
most people they're like quarter
throttle<00:01:04.619> like<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.939> do<00:01:06.150> when

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
throttle like that and you do when

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.870 
throttle like that and you do when
you're<00:01:06.689> approaching<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.470> turn<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.729> would

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
you're approaching a turn you would

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.859 
you're approaching a turn you would
either<00:01:09.470> this<00:01:10.470> is<00:01:10.560> really<00:01:10.680> awkward<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.869> say

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
either this is really awkward I say

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.810 
either this is really awkward I say
you'd<00:01:13.110> either<00:01:14.930> mash<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.200> gas<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.590> turn<00:01:16.830> or<00:01:17.130> hit

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
you'd either mash the gas in turn or hit

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.730 
you'd either mash the gas in turn or hit
the<00:01:17.970> brake<00:01:18.240> then<00:01:18.659> turn<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.049> then<00:01:19.290> mash<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
the brake then turn and then mash the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.950 
the brake then turn and then mash the
gas<00:01:19.770> because<00:01:20.759> what<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.299> does<00:01:21.479> if<00:01:21.810> you're

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
gas because what that does if you're

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.109 
gas because what that does if you're
braking<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.590> you're<00:01:23.130> losing<00:01:23.490> control<00:01:23.520> and

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
braking is you're losing control and

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.780 
braking is you're losing control and
then<00:01:24.570> when<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.810> turn<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.530> front<00:01:26.310> wheels<00:01:26.549> are

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
then when you turn the front wheels are

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.760 
then when you turn the front wheels are
angling<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.600> car<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.229> then<00:01:28.320> when<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.500> get<00:01:28.619> on

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
angling the car and then when you get on

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.740 
angling the car and then when you get on
the<00:01:28.860> throttle<00:01:28.890> again<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:30.150> back<00:01:30.360> wheels<00:01:30.600> are

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
the throttle again the back wheels are

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.179 
the throttle again the back wheels are
going<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.930> push<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.229> through<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.710> turn<00:01:31.950> and

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
going to push you through the turn and

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.270 
going to push you through the turn and
then<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.729> get<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.850> counter<00:01:33.240> steer<00:01:33.509> um<00:01:34.100> and<00:01:35.100> then

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
then you get a counter steer um and then

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.039 
then you get a counter steer um and then
you<00:01:35.369> got<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> counter<00:01:35.880> steer<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.750> I'll<00:01:36.869> get

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
you got a counter steer and I'll get

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.410 
you got a counter steer and I'll get
into<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.380> turning<00:01:37.770> more<00:01:37.950> on<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.369> or<00:01:38.939> basically

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
into the turning more on it or basically

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.020 
into the turning more on it or basically
it's<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.049> controlled<00:01:40.530> slot<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.430> mashing<00:01:41.850> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
it's a controlled slot and mashing the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.960 
it's a controlled slot and mashing the
throttle<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.720> or<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.259> break<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:44.520> allows<00:01:44.759> you

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
throttle and or the break it allows you

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.880 
throttle and or the break it allows you
to<00:01:45.090> lose<00:01:45.329> control<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.020> car<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.680> game

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
to lose control of the car and the game

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.109 
to lose control of the car and the game
that<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.700> can<00:01:47.880> end<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.420> slide<00:01:48.930> arm<00:01:49.909> to<00:01:50.909> keep

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
that that can end that slide arm to keep

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.789 
that that can end that slide arm to keep
it<00:01:51.299> under<00:01:51.600> control<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:52.140> have<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.320> counter

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
it under control you have to counter

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.240 
it under control you have to counter
steer<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.310> control<00:01:53.750> your<00:01:54.750> throttle<00:01:55.259> I'm<00:01:55.409> kind

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
steer and control your throttle I'm kind

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.730 
steer and control your throttle I'm kind
of<00:01:56.340> steering<00:01:56.759> it's<00:01:57.090> basically<00:01:57.689> like<00:01:57.960> if

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
of steering it's basically like if

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.889 
of steering it's basically like if
you're<00:01:59.159> I'm<00:02:00.000> pretty<00:02:00.270> sure<00:02:00.450> most<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.719> y'all

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
you're I'm pretty sure most of y'all

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.840 
you're I'm pretty sure most of y'all
know<00:02:00.990> what<00:02:01.079> this<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.229> if<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:01.920> run<00:02:02.070> off<00:02:02.340> road<00:02:02.579> or

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
know what this is if you run off road or

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.840 
know what this is if you run off road or
on<00:02:02.880> road<00:02:03.390> but<00:02:04.229> if<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.799> don't<00:02:05.070> you'll<00:02:05.399> say

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
on road but if you don't you'll say

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.320 
on road but if you don't you'll say
you're<00:02:06.060> drifting<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.170> left<00:02:08.030> well<00:02:09.030> you

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
you're drifting to the left well you

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.210 
you're drifting to the left well you
want<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.660> stay<00:02:10.140> straight<00:02:11.069> as<00:02:11.190> possible

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
want to stay straight as possible

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.830 
want to stay straight as possible
without<00:02:11.790> spinning<00:02:12.090> out<00:02:12.300> so<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.540> return<00:02:12.810> to

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
without spinning out so you return to

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.309 
without spinning out so you return to
the<00:02:12.989> right

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
the right

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.009 
the right
so<00:02:13.920> you're<00:02:14.069> basically<00:02:14.159> doing<00:02:14.670> like<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.269> so

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
so you're basically doing like that so

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.709 
so you're basically doing like that so
it<00:02:16.260> is<00:02:16.439> it's<00:02:16.739> pretty<00:02:17.040> simple<00:02:17.719> countersteering

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:18.719 
it is it's pretty simple countersteering

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:25.940 
it is it's pretty simple countersteering
um<00:02:21.319> the<00:02:22.319> theory<00:02:22.769> um<00:02:24.200> that's<00:02:25.200> basically<00:02:25.799> about

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
um the theory um that's basically about

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.080 
um the theory um that's basically about
it<00:02:26.549> in<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.849> nutshell<00:02:27.319> um<00:02:28.319> so<00:02:28.950> if<00:02:29.549> you<00:02:29.730> have<00:02:29.819> any

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
it in a nutshell um so if you have any

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.530

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.240 
this weekend I'll be able to get started
on<00:02:42.689> the<00:02:42.870> arm<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:45.510> testing<00:02:45.959> videos<00:02:46.349> I<00:02:46.709> mean<00:02:47.129> the

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
on the arm the testing videos I mean the

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.020 
on the arm the testing videos I mean the
arm<00:02:47.599> throttle<00:02:48.599> the<00:02:49.590> throttle<00:02:49.790> technique<00:02:50.790> and

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
arm throttle the throttle technique and

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.670 
arm throttle the throttle technique and
the<00:02:51.180> steering<00:02:51.480> technique<00:02:52.340> behind<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.699> also<00:02:54.209> um

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
the steering technique behind it also um

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.159 
the steering technique behind it also um
thanks<00:02:55.680> for<00:02:55.739> watching
