Y<00:00:16.730> animations<00:00:17.730> now<00:00:18.449> we've<00:00:18.630> actually<00:00:18.779> got<00:00:19.170> an

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
Y animations now we've actually got an

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.870 
Y animations now we've actually got an
animation<00:00:19.710> going<00:00:20.189> on<00:00:20.369> right<00:00:21.000> here<00:00:21.170> already<00:00:22.170> a

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
animation going on right here already a

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.820 
animation going on right here already a
little<00:00:23.880> bit<00:00:24.029> it's<00:00:24.300> switching<00:00:24.630> colors<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.439> lot

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
little bit it's switching colors a lot

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.160 
little bit it's switching colors a lot
and<00:00:26.189> that's<00:00:26.910> all<00:00:27.210> fine<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.720> dandy<00:00:27.779> but<00:00:28.109> I

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
and that's all fine and dandy but I

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.740 
and that's all fine and dandy but I
wanted<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.740> do<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.920> better<00:00:29.460> animation<00:00:30.119> what<00:00:30.630> if

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
wanted to do a better animation what if

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.700 
wanted to do a better animation what if
we<00:00:30.900> moved<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.859> G<00:00:32.099> Y<00:00:32.780> well<00:00:33.780> if<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:34.020> just<00:00:34.200> slid

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
we moved the G Y well if it just slid

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.060 
we moved the G Y well if it just slid
into<00:00:34.950> view<00:00:35.309> hmm<00:00:36.440> well<00:00:37.440> that's<00:00:37.770> what<00:00:37.950> we're

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
into view hmm well that's what we're

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.270 
into view hmm well that's what we're
going<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.280> work<00:00:38.430> on<00:00:38.640> today<00:00:39.290> so<00:00:40.290> let's<00:00:40.860> just<00:00:41.100> go

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
going to work on today so let's just go

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.910 
going to work on today so let's just go
into<00:00:41.430> our<00:00:41.550> Sturge<00:00:42.149> Y<00:00:42.329> screams<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.170> eye<00:00:43.200> frame

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
into our Sturge Y screams you eye frame

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.510 
into our Sturge Y screams you eye frame
and<00:00:44.760> open<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.239> script<00:00:45.710> so<00:00:46.710> right<00:00:46.920> now<00:00:47.160> it's

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
and open the script so right now it's

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.100 
and open the script so right now it's
doing<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.969> whole<00:00:48.149> loop<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.600> changing<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
doing the whole loop and changing the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.760 
doing the whole loop and changing the
color<00:00:49.320> but<00:00:49.649> let's<00:00:50.190> just<00:00:50.399> get<00:00:50.579> rid<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.770> in

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
color but let's just get rid of that in

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.069 
color but let's just get rid of that in
the<00:00:52.980> way<00:00:53.129> well<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.730> did<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.510> second<00:00:54.960> or

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
the way well I did in in a second or

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.510 
the way well I did in in a second or
else<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.379> will<00:00:55.440> crash<00:00:55.680> your<00:00:55.710> entire<00:00:56.190> game

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
else it will crash your entire game

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.459 
else it will crash your entire game
which<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.570> don't<00:00:57.719> know<00:00:57.870> if<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.050> taught<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.320> guys

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
which I don't know if I taught you guys

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.689 
which I don't know if I taught you guys
but<00:00:58.710> if<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.829> don't<00:00:59.010> have<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.280> weight<00:00:59.430> it

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
but if you don't have the weight it

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.790 
but if you don't have the weight it
takes<00:00:59.940> up<00:01:00.090> all<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.270> roblox's<00:01:01.050> resource<00:01:01.530> time

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
takes up all of roblox's resource time

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.939 
takes up all of roblox's resource time
and<00:01:02.210> it<00:01:03.210> crashes<00:01:03.539> your<00:01:03.899> game<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.530> got<00:01:04.799> to

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
and it crashes your game so you got to

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.320 
and it crashes your game so you got to
have<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.100> weight<00:01:05.339> in<00:01:05.489> there<00:01:05.700> um<00:01:08.030> but<00:01:09.030> for<00:01:09.240> right

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
have a weight in there um but for right

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.710 
have a weight in there um but for right
now<00:01:10.310> let's<00:01:11.310> just<00:01:11.600> move<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.869> G<00:01:13.110> Y<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:14.720> script

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
now let's just move the G Y so script

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.859 
now let's just move the G Y so script
that<00:01:16.259> parent<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.520> let's<00:01:17.700> just<00:01:17.970> move<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.360> to

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
that parent and let's just move it to

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:19.670 
that parent and let's just move it to
the<00:01:19.020> left

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
the left

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.800 
the left
shall<00:01:20.070> we<00:01:20.420> script<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.659> parent<00:01:22.140> that

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
shall we script that parent that

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.390 
shall we script that parent that
position<00:01:25.850> equals<00:01:26.900> script<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.439> parent<00:01:28.950> that

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
position equals script that parent that

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.819 
position equals script that parent that
position<00:01:30.110> plus<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:32.040> dim<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.700> data<00:01:33.360> new<00:01:33.829> now

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
position plus you dim to data new now

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.670 
position plus you dim to data new now
the<00:01:34.890> X<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.579> first<00:01:35.880> but<00:01:36.299> remember<00:01:37.079> we're<00:01:37.650> only

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
the X is first but remember we're only

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.880 
the X is first but remember we're only
working<00:01:38.490> with<00:01:38.659> one<00:01:39.659> second<00:01:40.049> go<00:01:40.650> into

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
working with one second go into

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.609 
working with one second go into
properties<00:01:41.299> we're<00:01:42.299> only<00:01:42.570> working<00:01:42.899> with<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.350> X

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
properties we're only working with the X

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.100 
properties we're only working with the X
to<00:01:44.399> move<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.759> over<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.450> we're<00:01:45.570> actually<00:01:45.750> only

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
to move it over and we're actually only

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.920 
to move it over and we're actually only
working<00:01:46.500> with<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.680> X<00:01:46.890> offset<00:01:47.130> because

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
working with the X offset because

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.830 
working with the X offset because
there's<00:01:48.930> nothing<00:01:49.439> in<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:50.070> pixel<00:01:50.579> map<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.450> back

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
there's nothing in the pixel map so back

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.760 
there's nothing in the pixel map so back
in<00:01:52.020> our<00:01:52.110> script<00:01:52.820> position<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:54.290> will<00:01:55.290> go<00:01:55.470> and

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
in our script position I will go and

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.080 
in our script position I will go and
just<00:01:56.100> move<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:57.149> hundreth<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:58.020> um<00:01:59.090> offset

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
just move it a hundreth of um offset

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.980 
just move it a hundreth of um offset
every<00:02:00.479> time<00:02:00.689> like<00:02:01.579> 1%<00:02:02.579> of<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.119> screen<00:02:03.450> every

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
every time like 1% of the screen every

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.760 
every time like 1% of the screen every
run<00:02:04.200> through<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:05.329> zero<00:02:06.329> point<00:02:06.869> zero<00:02:06.990> one<00:02:07.560> zero

run through so zero point zero one zero

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.950 
run through so zero point zero one zero
zero<00:02:08.640> zero<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.330> when<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.080> add

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
to you dim - positions it'll take each

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.700 
to you dim - positions it'll take each

individual positions like the X offset X
or<00:02:18.250> X<00:02:18.820> scale<00:02:19.570> X<00:02:19.960> offset<00:02:20.260> Y<00:02:20.980> scale<00:02:21.310> y<00:02:21.640> offset<00:02:21.880> and

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
or X scale X offset Y scale y offset and

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.450 
or X scale X offset Y scale y offset and
it'll<00:02:22.720> add<00:02:22.840> them<00:02:23.020> all<00:02:23.200> together<00:02:23.460> individually

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
it'll add them all together individually

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.060 
it'll add them all together individually
and<00:02:24.670> that'll<00:02:25.540> make<00:02:25.660> four<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:26.440> that<00:02:26.710> makes<00:02:26.890> it

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
and that'll make four and that makes it

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.950 
and that'll make four and that makes it
so<00:02:27.250> we<00:02:27.370> can<00:02:27.490> just<00:02:27.670> add<00:02:27.880> them<00:02:28.270> together<00:02:28.510> or<00:02:28.930> even

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
so we can just add them together or even

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.260 
so we can just add them together or even
subtract<00:02:29.650> them<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:30.100> actually<00:02:30.940> in<00:02:31.090> this<00:02:31.210> case

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
subtract them and actually in this case

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.940 
subtract them and actually in this case
since<00:02:31.750> we're<00:02:31.930> going<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.170> be<00:02:32.260> moving<00:02:32.470> it<00:02:32.710> to<00:02:32.890> the

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
since we're going to be moving it to the

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.480 
since we're going to be moving it to the
left<00:02:33.660> actually<00:02:34.660> from<00:02:35.200> you<00:02:35.350> guys<00:02:35.560> maybe<00:02:36.310> I

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
left actually from you guys maybe I

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.250 
left actually from you guys maybe I
should<00:02:36.700> move<00:02:36.790> my<00:02:36.850> hands<00:02:37.210> that<00:02:37.480> way<00:02:37.630> anyway

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
should move my hands that way anyway

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.090 
should move my hands that way anyway
we're<00:02:38.440> moving<00:02:38.740> it<00:02:39.060> away<00:02:40.090> I<00:02:40.390> had<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.740> the<00:02:41.860> left

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
we're moving it away I had to the left

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.770 
we're moving it away I had to the left
that's<00:02:42.490> the<00:02:42.670> only<00:02:42.850> thing<00:02:43.030> I<00:02:43.120> can<00:02:43.300> really<00:02:43.420> say<00:02:43.570> I

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
that's the only thing I can really say I

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.450 
that's the only thing I can really say I
don't<00:02:43.990> know<00:02:44.260> which<00:02:44.410> way<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:44.590> should<00:02:44.680> play<00:02:44.980> to

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
don't know which way I should play to

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.980 
don't know which way I should play to
the<00:02:45.580> left<00:02:45.900> that<00:02:46.900> way<00:02:47.110> ah<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:49.000> we're<00:02:49.690> going<00:02:49.930> to

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
the left that way ah and we're going to

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.860 
the left that way ah and we're going to
need<00:02:50.200> to<00:02:50.350> subtract<00:02:50.920> because<00:02:51.280> as<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:52.240> X<00:02:52.480> gets

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
need to subtract because as the X gets

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.990 
need to subtract because as the X gets
greater<00:02:53.290> it<00:02:53.650> moves<00:02:53.920> more<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.550> right<00:02:54.730> and

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
greater it moves more to the right and

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.180 
greater it moves more to the right and
as<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.690> Y<00:02:55.810> gets<00:02:56.110> greater<00:02:56.410> it<00:02:56.560> moves<00:02:56.770> further

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
as the Y gets greater it moves further

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.000 
as the Y gets greater it moves further
down<00:02:57.700> only<00:02:58.300> in<00:02:58.690> two-dimensional<00:02:59.380> space<00:02:59.560> is

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
down only in two-dimensional space is

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.360 
down only in two-dimensional space is
this<00:03:00.220> really<00:03:00.700> true<00:03:01.080> it's<00:03:02.130> much<00:03:03.130> more

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
this really true it's much more

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.710 
this really true it's much more
difficult<00:03:03.550> in<00:03:04.110> three-dimensional<00:03:05.110> space<00:03:05.140> but

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
difficult in three-dimensional space but

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.010 
difficult in three-dimensional space but
let's<00:03:07.720> just<00:03:07.960> test<00:03:08.350> that<00:03:08.530> oh<00:03:09.720> one<00:03:10.720> thing<00:03:10.750> we

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
let's just test that oh one thing we

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.470 
let's just test that oh one thing we
need<00:03:11.230> before<00:03:11.650> I'm<00:03:12.160> going<00:03:12.730> Drecker<00:03:12.970> game<00:03:13.300> oh

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
need before I'm going Drecker game oh

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.110 
need before I'm going Drecker game oh
wait<00:03:13.990> and<00:03:14.440> they'll<00:03:14.920> just<00:03:15.010> wait<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.700> smallest

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
wait and they'll just wait the smallest

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.250 
wait and they'll just wait the smallest
amount<00:03:16.420> of<00:03:16.570> time<00:03:16.750> that<00:03:16.780> roblox<00:03:17.350> allows<00:03:17.650> it<00:03:17.890> to

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
amount of time that roblox allows it to

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.700 
amount of time that roblox allows it to
all<00:03:20.260> right

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.710 
all right

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.340 
all right
just<00:03:21.370> boom<00:03:21.550> pow<00:03:22.090> okay<00:03:22.450> there<00:03:22.690> it<00:03:22.810> goes<00:03:22.840> it<00:03:23.200> goes

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
just boom pow okay there it goes it goes

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.070 
just boom pow okay there it goes it goes
scrolling<00:03:23.920> off<00:03:24.100> the<00:03:24.760> lag<00:03:24.970> kind<00:03:25.420> of<00:03:25.570> ruined<00:03:25.960> it

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
scrolling off the lag kind of ruined it

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.320 
scrolling off the lag kind of ruined it
a<00:03:26.170> little<00:03:26.440> bit<00:03:26.680> but<00:03:26.890> it<00:03:26.980> did<00:03:27.160> scroll<00:03:27.520> off<00:03:27.730> umm

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
a little bit but it did scroll off umm

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.950 
a little bit but it did scroll off umm
which<00:03:29.110> if<00:03:29.290> I<00:03:29.460> can't<00:03:30.460> really<00:03:30.580> reset<00:03:31.090> it<00:03:31.240> but

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:31.960 
which if I can't really reset it but

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.670 
which if I can't really reset it but
what<00:03:32.140> I<00:03:32.170> can<00:03:32.740> do<00:03:32.980> is<00:03:33.130> pause<00:03:34.110> go<00:03:35.110> to<00:03:35.170> our<00:03:35.440> frame

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
what I can do is pause go to our frame

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.190 
what I can do is pause go to our frame
and<00:03:35.890> this<00:03:36.580> properties<00:03:37.120> window<00:03:37.450> does<00:03:37.630> not<00:03:37.660> like

you know what we're just going to copy

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.090 
you know what we're just going to copy
the<00:04:03.460> screen<00:04:03.790> G<00:04:04.000> Y<00:04:04.150> from<00:04:04.390> here<00:04:04.720> delete<00:04:05.530> this<00:04:05.830> one

the screen G Y from here delete this one

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.920 
the screen G Y from here delete this one
and<00:04:06.670> paste<00:04:06.880> into<00:04:07.180> their<00:04:07.390> players<00:04:07.600> you<00:04:07.780> like

and<00:04:08.320> it's<00:04:08.530> moving<00:04:08.920> across<00:04:09.070> snacks

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
and it's moving across snacks

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.650 
and it's moving across snacks
necessarily<00:04:11.010> buddy<00:04:11.220> is<00:04:11.400> moving<00:04:11.850> just<00:04:12.360> as<00:04:12.510> the

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
necessarily buddy is moving just as the

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.900 
necessarily buddy is moving just as the
meteor<00:04:13.080> falls<00:04:13.320> right<00:04:13.590> in<00:04:13.770> front<00:04:14.070> of<00:04:14.160> me<00:04:14.310> okay

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.990 

so<00:04:18.230> let<00:04:19.230> me<00:04:19.260> explain<00:04:19.680> this<00:04:19.950> again<00:04:20.220> so<00:04:20.820> it's

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
so let me explain this again so it's

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.070 
so let me explain this again so it's
moving<00:04:21.270> over<00:04:21.830> so<00:04:22.830> much<00:04:23.060> 1%<00:04:24.060> every<00:04:24.270> time<00:04:24.900> it

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
moving over so much 1% every time it

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.760 
moving over so much 1% every time it
goes<00:04:25.230> through<00:04:25.560> the<00:04:25.710> loop<00:04:25.820> okay<00:04:26.820> it's<00:04:27.000> moving

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
goes through the loop okay it's moving

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.580 
goes through the loop okay it's moving
but<00:04:28.770> it<00:04:29.100> wasn't<00:04:29.700> smooth<00:04:30.090> right<00:04:30.540> okay<00:04:31.290> let's

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
but it wasn't smooth right okay let's

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.740 
but it wasn't smooth right okay let's
make<00:04:31.770> it<00:04:31.830> a<00:04:32.010> little<00:04:32.250> smoother<00:04:32.850> and<00:04:33.030> to<00:04:33.450> do<00:04:33.600> that

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
make it a little smoother and to do that

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.450 
make it a little smoother and to do that
you'll<00:04:34.020> just<00:04:34.200> make<00:04:34.410> it<00:04:34.470> smaller<00:04:34.800> so<00:04:35.220> I'm<00:04:35.310> gonna

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
you'll just make it smaller so I'm gonna

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.700 
you'll just make it smaller so I'm gonna
cut<00:04:35.760> in<00:04:35.940> half<00:04:36.150> and<00:04:36.240> move<00:04:36.420> a<00:04:36.570> half<00:04:37.380> of<00:04:37.590> a<00:04:37.680> percent

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
cut in half and move a half of a percent

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.630 
cut in half and move a half of a percent
of<00:04:38.280> the<00:04:38.370> screen<00:04:38.850> every<00:04:39.270> time<00:04:39.510> and<00:04:40.340> now<00:04:41.340> we<00:04:41.400> can

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
of the screen every time and now we can

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.800 
of the screen every time and now we can
press<00:04:41.850> f6<00:04:42.450> and<00:04:42.810> it<00:04:43.800> should<00:04:44.310> go<00:04:44.790> I'll<00:04:45.480> probably

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
press f6 and it should go I'll probably

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.800 
press f6 and it should go I'll probably
have<00:04:46.050> to<00:04:46.110> delete<00:04:46.560> in<00:04:46.770> copy<00:04:47.220> it<00:04:47.460> in<00:04:47.580> again<00:04:47.970> so<00:04:48.690> we

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
have to delete in copy it in again so we

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.110 
have to delete in copy it in again so we
can<00:04:48.840> actually<00:04:49.080> tell<00:04:49.440> but<00:04:49.740> it<00:04:49.950> should<00:04:50.430> be<00:04:50.460> kind

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
can actually tell but it should be kind

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.370 
can actually tell but it should be kind
of<00:04:51.240> obvious<00:04:51.600> that's<00:04:52.400> moving<00:04:53.400> across<00:04:54.380> it's

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
of obvious that's moving across it's

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.620 
of obvious that's moving across it's
lagging<00:04:56.100> right<00:04:56.460> now<00:04:56.670> there<00:04:57.150> we<00:04:57.270> go

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
lagging right now there we go

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.750 
lagging right now there we go
okay<00:04:58.020> so<00:04:58.080> it's<00:04:58.380> moving<00:04:58.710> across<00:04:58.950> it's<00:04:59.280> still

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
okay so it's moving across it's still

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.600 
okay so it's moving across it's still
not<00:05:00.090> super<00:05:00.390> smooth<00:05:00.960> but<00:05:01.620> part<00:05:02.010> of<00:05:02.160> the<00:05:02.310> reason

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
not super smooth but part of the reason

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.990 
not super smooth but part of the reason
it's<00:05:02.760> not<00:05:02.820> super<00:05:03.510> smooth<00:05:03.810> again<00:05:04.500> is

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
it's not super smooth again is

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.440 
it's not super smooth again is
apparently<00:05:06.000> I'm<00:05:06.240> a<00:05:06.270> meteor<00:05:07.230> magnet<00:05:08.190> but<00:05:08.910> like

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
apparently I'm a meteor magnet but like

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.710 
apparently I'm a meteor magnet but like
that's<00:05:10.080> also<00:05:10.440> kind<00:05:10.920> of<00:05:10.950> because<00:05:11.280> I<00:05:11.520> am<00:05:11.850> using<00:05:12.240> a

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
that's also kind of because I am using a

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.380 
that's also kind of because I am using a
screen<00:05:13.440> recording<00:05:13.920> software<00:05:13.950> so<00:05:14.790> you<00:05:14.850> can't

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
screen recording software so you can't

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.740 
screen recording software so you can't
fault<00:05:16.350> roblox<00:05:16.800> necessarily<00:05:17.700> you<00:05:18.420> can

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
fault roblox necessarily you can

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.470 
fault roblox necessarily you can
it's<00:05:19.080> just<00:05:19.380> screen<00:05:19.860> requires<00:05:20.190> obviously<00:05:20.550> drop

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480 
it's just screen requires obviously drop

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.730 
it's just screen requires obviously drop
the<00:05:21.690> FPS<00:05:22.110> of<00:05:22.320> everything<00:05:23.210> as<00:05:24.210> they<00:05:24.480> work<00:05:24.740> but

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
the FPS of everything as they work but

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.520 
the FPS of everything as they work but
we're<00:05:26.040> going<00:05:26.160> to<00:05:26.310> copy<00:05:26.550> and<00:05:26.790> paste<00:05:26.880> our

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
we're going to copy and paste our

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:34.130 
we're going to copy and paste our
screens<00:05:28.530> UI<00:05:30.080> into<00:05:31.080> the<00:05:31.200> play<00:05:31.380> of<00:05:31.530> Juba<00:05:31.830> and<00:05:33.140> now

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
screens UI into the play of Juba and now

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:39.050 
screens UI into the play of Juba and now
we<00:05:34.200> can<00:05:34.410> see<00:05:34.680> it<00:05:34.770> a<00:05:34.830> little<00:05:34.860> better<00:05:37.130> yeah

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
we can see it a little better yeah

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.750 
we can see it a little better yeah
let's<00:05:39.180> put<00:05:39.450> that<00:05:39.630> tool<00:05:39.840> away<00:05:40.080> there<00:05:40.560> we<00:05:40.680> go<00:05:40.860> all

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
let's put that tool away there we go all

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.160 
let's put that tool away there we go all
right<00:05:41.790> let's<00:05:41.910> go<00:05:42.240> into<00:05:42.450> this<00:05:42.630> script<00:05:42.990> and

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.170 
right let's go into this script and

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.970 
right let's go into this script and
let's<00:05:43.470> actually<00:05:43.620> make<00:05:43.980> it<00:05:44.190> five<00:05:44.970> times<00:05:45.150> slower

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:45.980 
let's actually make it five times slower

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.730 
let's actually make it five times slower
then<00:05:46.980> copy<00:05:47.340> it<00:05:47.580> delete<00:05:48.330> this<00:05:48.570> and<00:05:49.230> paste<00:05:49.560> it

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
then copy it delete this and paste it

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.260 
then copy it delete this and paste it
back<00:05:49.920> in<00:05:51.740> again<00:05:52.740> it's<00:05:52.920> not<00:05:53.130> smooth<00:05:53.550> but<00:05:54.060> it

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
back in again it's not smooth but it

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.570 
back in again it's not smooth but it
actually<00:05:54.690> would<00:05:54.870> be<00:05:55.020> really<00:05:55.740> really<00:05:55.770> smooth

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
actually would be really really smooth

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.270 
actually would be really really smooth
really<00:05:57.120> slow<00:05:57.390> but<00:05:57.780> really<00:05:58.350> really<00:05:58.590> smooth<00:05:59.070> if

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
really slow but really really smooth if

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.960 
really slow but really really smooth if
you<00:05:59.400> did<00:05:59.640> this<00:05:59.820> on<00:06:00.090> a<00:06:00.120> mediums<00:06:00.990> a<00:06:01.400> good<00:06:02.400> quality

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970 
you did this on a mediums a good quality

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.610 
you did this on a mediums a good quality
computer<00:06:03.420> with<00:06:03.720> good<00:06:03.960> graphics<00:06:04.440> and

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
computer with good graphics and

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.410 
computer with good graphics and
everything<00:06:04.710> and<00:06:05.130> you<00:06:05.220> weren't<00:06:05.490> recording

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:06.420 
everything and you weren't recording

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.810 
everything and you weren't recording
your<00:06:06.570> screen<00:06:06.890> that<00:06:07.890> would<00:06:08.100> speed<00:06:08.400> things<00:06:08.640> up

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
your screen that would speed things up

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.460 
your screen that would speed things up
tremendously<00:06:09.690> for<00:06:10.050> you<00:06:10.170> all<00:06:10.350> right<00:06:11.930> okay<00:06:12.930> so
