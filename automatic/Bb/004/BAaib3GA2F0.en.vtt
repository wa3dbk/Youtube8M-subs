00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
saying myself well maybe that's because

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.690

better<00:00:46.020> but<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.920> just<00:00:47.640> think<00:00:47.820> it's<00:00:47.940> because

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
better but I just think it's because

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.290 
better but I just think it's because
maybe<00:00:48.450> no<00:00:48.870> one<00:00:49.020> wants<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.410> on<00:00:49.440> their<00:00:49.649> team<00:00:50.300> you

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.520 
now basically those are two pro players
that's<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.780> only<00:03:42.930> reason<00:03:43.019> when<00:03:43.230> I<00:03:43.290> say<00:03:43.410> they

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
that's the only reason when I say they

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.660 
that's the only reason when I say they
should<00:03:43.560> have<00:03:43.769> a<00:03:43.799> true<00:03:43.980> knowledge<00:03:44.190> of<00:03:44.430> the<00:03:44.519> game

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
should have a true knowledge of the game

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.150 
should have a true knowledge of the game
coaches<00:03:45.600> will<00:03:45.780> never<00:03:45.959> have<00:03:46.170> a<00:03:46.200> truly<00:03:46.860> full

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
coaches will never have a truly full

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.740 
coaches will never have a truly full
concept<00:03:47.670> of<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:47.940> game<00:03:48.120> as<00:03:48.360> the<00:03:48.510> way<00:03:48.630> the

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
concept of the game as the way the

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.120 
concept of the game as the way the
players<00:03:48.930> do<00:03:49.200> we<00:03:49.230> have<00:03:49.470> a<00:03:49.500> coaching<00:03:49.950> aspect

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
players do we have a coaching aspect

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.750 
players do we have a coaching aspect
that's<00:03:50.940> different<00:03:51.510> now<00:03:51.860> unless<00:03:52.860> you<00:03:53.640> can

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
that's different now unless you can

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.400 
that's different now unless you can
actually<00:03:53.970> compete<00:03:54.269> at<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.600> pro<00:03:54.780> level<00:03:54.810> which

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
actually compete at the pro level which

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.050 
actually compete at the pro level which
if<00:03:55.680> you<00:03:55.890> would<00:03:56.100> you<00:03:56.340> wouldn't<00:03:56.579> be<00:03:56.670> coaching

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
if you would you wouldn't be coaching

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.300 
if you would you wouldn't be coaching
you'd<00:03:57.299> be<00:03:57.420> playing<00:03:57.780> making<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:58.709> money<00:03:58.920> you

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
you'd be playing making the money you

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.830 
you'd be playing making the money you
wouldn't<00:03:59.430> coach<00:03:59.670> because<00:04:00.000> it's<00:04:00.209> fun<00:04:00.510> you

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840

wouldn't coach because it's fun you
coach<00:04:01.049> coach<00:04:01.739> because<00:04:02.040> it's<00:04:02.760> just<00:04:03.000> something

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
coach coach because it's just something

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.520 
coach coach because it's just something
you<00:04:03.239> would<00:04:03.420> rather<00:04:03.630> do<00:04:03.989> because<00:04:04.290> you<00:04:04.350> know<00:04:04.470> you

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530
