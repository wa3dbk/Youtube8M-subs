00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:03.760
 health paulson assured 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.950
 extracted the pop figure volpi 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.269
 abroad 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.980
 the breath and we wish you and also known as the line d 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:15.900
 buenos aires where specifically 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.859
 already this letter in this beautiful web 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:20.900
 and well here we have it not fine 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.329
 the bbc the figure for which I began to collect give us the time 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.730
 it's very good it has some details 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.730
 the vehicle mode is even better it was a small 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.520
 percent cuchi here 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.920
 that if we want we can I think we want it we'll be 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.020
 just the other side another of the blade 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.460
 but that in this case he 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.880
 he also brings a gun 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.740
 a bus see 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.790
 clear articulation of the arm does not allow to handle the have 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:56.280
 you who are for those who do not want to use the for example we can use it 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.250
 the back of the foot to transform 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.820
 and here in this bit of chance we can put it on 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.490
 and it looks good 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.830
 and then we do not have to attack 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:09.940
 so 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.580
 of having good articulation in practically all the feet one hundred 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.640
 p very good figure the head is very similar to the second 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.000
 with roberto oliver on the side of the corners everything is very similar 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.810
 information is this science to me as it may seem 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.960
 the first we have to fix the feet 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.220
 the happy one was the pocket 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.270
 we highlight the feet 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.270
 and we do not put in that position 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.490
 Christ we do the same with the 12 we stop this apart here 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.660
 we turn 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.080
 wolf is not like that 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.080
 and in this way we practically have armed the feet 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.800
 we get in there to put them 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.830
 about it with a little hard 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:14.579
 how important the feet 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.279
 in this way for what 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:19.329
 when we finish the assembly above 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:23.469
 it was much easier either had the war assad center 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.879
 so 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:30.639
 Robert Gesink 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:34.139
 I think I should be sure that we have just done almost all the 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:35.069
 figure 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.469
 then this sport because today the next thing in his exile 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.279
 first we put the head of chocolates 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.889
 the objectives nothing good 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.129
 and we close the box 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.539
 this part caresses what we adjust 

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:58.609
 and we are not 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:02.939
 once we have raised this part then we use the arms 

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:06.319
 we put ourselves in this position 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.019
 it is very important the position of this bit century after just fine 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.109
 and also here to this one 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.259
 and we do the same thing with the other right side the villagers 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:22.649
 Carefully read work force without blade failure if it does not get in the way 

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:25.079
 Right 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.959
 then once we have this 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.399
 we close this part here this capital there is anarchy juti esteve 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:37.459
 and before going to bed it would be good to double the bombs in this position 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:42.269
 And so there is a wink success 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.110
 that slipped into this little crack so that the arms that send well 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:47.259
 level 

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:50.379
 let us assemble the figure in the best possible way 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.819
 quique well adjusted for that 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.209
 then this destination we played 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.019
 and what are the cells to lose to achieve it is what we are doing 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.689
 the stretches in this way 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:09.069
 we stick here 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.809
 and what we are going to take it off 

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:16.309
 there's a bit of swords and vicente garrido did not know much I apologize 

00:04:16.309 --> 00:04:18.109
 but that file 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.279
 the only two months was ruled out so it's 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.409
 ansa 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:27.650
 and well I think we're going to put together the top part really 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:32.579
 these tests is one of the most difficult parts of me 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:36.479
 wants to submit the feet precisely 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:37.860
 in the part 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.740
 subsequently the transformer 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.650
 play play do it at the same time to digest better adjusted 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.240
 this patient that when I do this table I guard everything else 

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:51.090
 but I think it's because it's 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.120
 I do not do it very well but this one 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.289
 things 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:58.419
 We stick wears stump customer stump and here is tl 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.520
 he also monitors what this child is capable of 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.520
 hard 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.699
 so they fit as best as possible and ready 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:10.129
 then if we can enter it which ensures the state 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:13.189
 if we make the best of the tornadoes 

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:15.779
 will be based the hotel stump in it 

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:18.289
 orifice 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:20.280
 and then that does not help 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.280
 saving to eat well the figure in the high part 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.870
 the street 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:36.309
 Hispanics all hours 

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:39.080
 what is expected 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.080
 we have armed and arauco death in mode 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.860
 Vehicles against Spain 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.059
 how big is the small 

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:49.319
 for example here I have a 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:51.480
 optimus pad 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.419
 with free entry 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:56.419
 and if we compare it the musel is a leftover step 

00:05:56.939 --> 00:06:00.169
 is a little more about those issues than what 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:03.349
 correct I want the 41 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:06.430
 obviously these little hands and feet 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.680
 that love and it would be a vedette comparison the optimal veil 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:13.189
 they did very well 

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:14.940
 great figure bump oblivion 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.199
 d must do to me I love this mode 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:19.409
 I want it 

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:20.710
 ii 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:21.729
 in this way 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:25.409
 the one that hubert in the car that again what I like more the new robot 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:27.770
 but I started my taste 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.629
 Well I hope you have liked to be this review are pending for 

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:35.720
 more reviews of others are backgrounds that had in cantabria have need 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.029
 when you in another one more to the east that seizes me
