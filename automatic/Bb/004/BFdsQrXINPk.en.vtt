I<00:00:02.210> have<00:00:03.210> taken<00:00:03.540> this<00:00:03.870> example<00:00:04.049> from<00:00:05.089> page<00:00:06.319> 171

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
I have taken this example from page 171

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.870 
I have taken this example from page 171
so<00:00:07.649> let<00:00:07.770> me<00:00:07.919> write<00:00:08.099> page<00:00:08.570> 171<00:00:10.550> question<00:00:11.550> number

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
so let me write page 171 question number

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.240 
so let me write page 171 question number
2<00:00:13.519> okay<00:00:14.519> so<00:00:14.580> yeah<00:00:15.030> this<00:00:15.719> is<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:15.960> ramp<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:17.100> this

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
2 okay so yeah this is a ramp and this

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.939 
2 okay so yeah this is a ramp and this
is<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.430> concrete<00:00:17.730> ramp<00:00:18.330> so<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:18.990> concrete

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
is a concrete ramp so this is concrete

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.660 
is a concrete ramp so this is concrete
looks<00:00:20.910> like<00:00:21.150> wooden<00:00:21.630> ramp<00:00:22.369> so<00:00:23.369> what's<00:00:23.550> the

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
looks like wooden ramp so what's the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.509 
looks like wooden ramp so what's the
information<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.330> we<00:00:24.480> have<00:00:24.800> this<00:00:25.800> length<00:00:26.160> is

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
information that we have this length is

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.689 
information that we have this length is
given<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:27.029> be<00:00:27.150> 1.2<00:00:27.750> meters<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.470> this<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.550> very

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
given to be 1.2 meters and this is very

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.659 
given to be 1.2 meters and this is very
vital<00:00:30.000> information<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.529> slope<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.489> ramp

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
vital information the slope of the ramp

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.229 
vital information the slope of the ramp
is<00:00:32.910> 1<00:00:33.239> into<00:00:33.570> 12<00:00:34.130> one<00:00:35.130> in<00:00:35.430> 12<00:00:35.820> what<00:00:36.090> does<00:00:36.120> that

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
is 1 into 12 one in 12 what does that

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:36.950 
is 1 into 12 one in 12 what does that
mean

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
mean

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.639 
mean
this<00:00:37.320> means<00:00:38.300> slope<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.450> ramp<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.809> 1<00:00:40.079> in<00:00:40.320> 12

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
this means slope of ramp is 1 in 12

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.520 
this means slope of ramp is 1 in 12
means<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.520> for<00:00:41.760> every<00:00:43.969> for<00:00:44.969> every<00:00:45.420> 12<00:00:45.840> meters

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
means that for every for every 12 meters

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.520 
means that for every for every 12 meters
Lindt<00:00:49.340> it<00:00:50.340> has<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.850> for<00:00:51.180> every<00:00:51.629> 12<00:00:51.930> meters<00:00:52.379> of

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
Lindt it has to for every 12 meters of

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.270 
Lindt it has to for every 12 meters of
length<00:00:52.910> the<00:00:53.910> lamp<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:55.199> ramps<00:00:55.710> or<00:00:55.920> not<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
length the lamp the ramps or not the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.689 
length the lamp the ramps or not the
lamp<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.969> ramp<00:00:58.070> Rises<00:00:59.070> by<00:00:59.280> 1<00:00:59.520> meter<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.359> ramp

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
lamp the ramp Rises by 1 meter the ramp

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:07.490 
lamp the ramp Rises by 1 meter the ramp
rises<00:01:02.699> by<00:01:02.969> 1<00:01:03.600> meter<00:01:05.420> so<00:01:06.420> that's<00:01:06.659> what<00:01:06.960> this

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
rises by 1 meter so that's what this

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.789 
rises by 1 meter so that's what this
ratio<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.460> slope<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.360> ramp<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.720> 1<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.350> 12

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
ratio is slope of the ramp is 1 in 12

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.030 
ratio is slope of the ramp is 1 in 12
that<00:01:11.490> means<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.970> height<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.960> 1<00:01:13.470> meter<00:01:13.740> for

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
that means the height is 1 meter for

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.560 
that means the height is 1 meter for
every<00:01:14.369> 12<00:01:14.640> meters<00:01:15.320> so<00:01:16.320> if<00:01:16.759> if<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.000> height<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.240> 1

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
every 12 meters so if if the height is 1

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.590 
every 12 meters so if if the height is 1
meter<00:01:18.780> for<00:01:19.020> every<00:01:19.409> 12<00:01:20.189> meters<00:01:20.729> here<00:01:21.299> if<00:01:21.450> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
meter for every 12 meters here if the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.719 
meter for every 12 meters here if the
height<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:21.840> 0.5<00:01:22.710> meter<00:01:23.159> how<00:01:23.340> much<00:01:23.520> would<00:01:23.700> be

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
height is 0.5 meter how much would be

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.920 
height is 0.5 meter how much would be
the<00:01:23.880> length<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:25.380> length<00:01:25.409> would<00:01:25.799> be<00:01:26.540> 0.5<00:01:27.540> times

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
the length the length would be 0.5 times

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.920 
the length the length would be 0.5 times
12<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.799> can<00:01:28.920> use<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> calculator<00:01:29.570> so<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:30.750> will

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
12 you can use a calculator so this will

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.600 
12 you can use a calculator so this will
be<00:01:31.049> 0.5<00:01:32.180> times<00:01:33.180> 12<00:01:33.659> or<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.829> basically<00:01:35.220> 1/2

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
be 0.5 times 12 or that is basically 1/2

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.530 
be 0.5 times 12 or that is basically 1/2
times<00:01:35.970> 12<00:01:36.390> which<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.659> 6<00:01:37.140> meters<00:01:38.180> so<00:01:39.180> yeah<00:01:39.479> you

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
times 12 which is 6 meters so yeah you

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.310 
times 12 which is 6 meters so yeah you
want<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.049> find<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.350> volume<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:40.979> concrete

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
want to find the volume of this concrete

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.810 
want to find the volume of this concrete
well<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.500> can<00:01:43.680> look<00:01:43.920> at<00:01:44.070> look<00:01:44.729> at<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:45.180> as<00:01:45.450> a

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
well you can look at look at this as a

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.100 
well you can look at look at this as a
this<00:01:47.820> shape<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:49.409> prism<00:01:50.570> you<00:01:51.570> can<00:01:51.720> cut<00:01:51.930> if<00:01:52.079> you

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
this shape is a prism you can cut if you

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.340 
this shape is a prism you can cut if you
see<00:01:52.470> this<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.009> base<00:01:53.810> if<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.899> consider

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
see this is the base if you consider

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.600 
see this is the base if you consider
this<00:01:56.990> rectangular<00:01:57.990> as<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.380> base<00:01:58.610> the

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
this rectangular as the base the

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.819 
this rectangular as the base the
cross-section<00:02:00.329> would<00:02:00.479> be<00:02:00.630> equal<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.560> is

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
cross-section would be equal so this is

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.950 
cross-section would be equal so this is
one<00:02:02.369> thing<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:03.000> need<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.210> understand

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
one thing that you need to understand

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.910 
one thing that you need to understand
this<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.549> prism<00:02:06.290> this<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.700> prism

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
this is a prism this is a prism

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.070 
this is a prism this is a prism
from<00:02:10.069> this<00:02:10.250> if<00:02:10.700> you<00:02:10.880> consider<00:02:11.270> this<00:02:11.510> as<00:02:11.780> the

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
from this if you consider this as the

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.010 
from this if you consider this as the
base<00:02:12.590> and<00:02:12.950> you're<00:02:13.340> going<00:02:13.520> to<00:02:13.580> have<00:02:14.020> equal

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
base and you're going to have equal

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.580 
base and you're going to have equal
cross-section<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:16.069> if<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:17.510> base<00:02:17.780> the

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
cross-section and if the base the

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.820 
cross-section and if the base the
cross-section<00:02:19.280> of<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:19.730> base<00:02:19.940> is<00:02:20.330> equal<00:02:20.830> then

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
cross-section of the base is equal then

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.890 
cross-section of the base is equal then
it's<00:02:22.099> called<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.550> prism<00:02:22.940> now<00:02:23.330> volume<00:02:23.599> of<00:02:23.810> a

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
it's called a prism now volume of a

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.949 
it's called a prism now volume of a
prism<00:02:24.110> you<00:02:24.940> should<00:02:25.940> know<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.239> formula<00:02:26.750> volume

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
prism you should know the formula volume

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.510 
prism you should know the formula volume
off<00:02:27.580> you<00:02:28.580> can<00:02:28.760> see<00:02:29.030> here<00:02:29.360> it's<00:02:29.569> a<00:02:29.750> ramp<00:02:30.520> would

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
off you can see here it's a ramp would

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.759 
off you can see here it's a ramp would
be<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.850> base<00:02:32.030> area<00:02:34.420> base<00:02:35.420> area<00:02:36.140> times<00:02:36.200> height

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
be the base area base area times height

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.150 
be the base area base area times height
times<00:02:38.890> height

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
times height

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.460 
times height
so<00:02:40.310> yeah<00:02:40.580> this<00:02:40.849> 12<00:02:41.269> meters<00:02:41.840> is<00:02:42.080> your<00:02:42.290> height

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
so yeah this 12 meters is your height

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.370 
so yeah this 12 meters is your height
and<00:02:42.819> this<00:02:43.819> is<00:02:43.970> your<00:02:44.090> area<00:02:44.540> that<00:02:44.690> you'd<00:02:44.870> need<00:02:45.230> to

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
and this is your area that you'd need to

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.640 
and this is your area that you'd need to
find<00:02:45.650> now<00:02:46.610> this<00:02:46.790> is<00:02:46.910> a<00:02:46.940> triangle<00:02:47.390> so<00:02:48.200> area<00:02:48.500> of<00:02:48.590> a

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
find now this is a triangle so area of a

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.770 
find now this is a triangle so area of a
triangle<00:02:48.920> is<00:02:49.160> 1/2<00:02:49.190> base<00:02:49.430> times<00:02:50.120> height<00:02:50.299> or

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
triangle is 1/2 base times height or

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.440 
triangle is 1/2 base times height or
base<00:02:51.620> times<00:02:51.950> height<00:02:52.100> divided<00:02:52.670> by<00:02:52.880> 2<00:02:52.940> so<00:02:53.299> this

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
base times height divided by 2 so this

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.830 
base times height divided by 2 so this
is<00:02:53.569> your<00:02:53.750> base<00:02:54.850> these<00:02:55.850> are<00:02:55.910> 6<00:02:56.299> meters<00:02:56.810> and

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
is your base these are 6 meters and

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.009 
is your base these are 6 meters and
height<00:02:57.290> is<00:02:57.530> 0.5<00:02:58.280> meters<00:02:58.700> so<00:02:59.660> I'd<00:02:59.750> like<00:02:59.900> to

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
height is 0.5 meters so I'd like to

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.809 
height is 0.5 meters so I'd like to
write<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.319> formula<00:03:00.530> like<00:03:00.860> this<00:03:01.130> base<00:03:01.459> times

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
write the formula like this base times

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.570 
write the formula like this base times
height<00:03:01.970> which<00:03:02.480> is<00:03:03.319> 6<00:03:03.590> meters<00:03:04.330> times<00:03:06.580> 0.5

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
height which is 6 meters times 0.5

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.400 
height which is 6 meters times 0.5
meters<00:03:09.549> divided<00:03:10.549> by<00:03:10.730> 2<00:03:10.790> this<00:03:11.600> is<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.900> area<00:03:12.260> of

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
meters divided by 2 this is the area of

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.180 
meters divided by 2 this is the area of
the<00:03:12.650> triangle<00:03:13.250> and<00:03:14.260> then<00:03:15.260> you<00:03:15.290> times<00:03:15.739> it<00:03:15.950> by

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
the triangle and then you times it by

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.979 
the triangle and then you times it by
the<00:03:16.430> height<00:03:16.820> which<00:03:17.540> is<00:03:17.570> 1.2<00:03:18.530> meters<00:03:19.959> so<00:03:20.959> you

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
the height which is 1.2 meters so you

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.630 
the height which is 1.2 meters so you
can<00:03:21.500> do<00:03:21.709> this<00:03:21.920> 2<00:03:22.190> goes<00:03:22.549> into<00:03:22.880> 6<00:03:23.810> 3<00:03:24.320> times<00:03:24.640> so

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
can do this 2 goes into 6 3 times so

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.819 
can do this 2 goes into 6 3 times so
this<00:03:25.880> is<00:03:26.060> basically<00:03:26.510> 3<00:03:26.959> meters<00:03:27.940> times<00:03:29.829> 0.5

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
this is basically 3 meters times 0.5

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:37.300 
this is basically 3 meters times 0.5
meters<00:03:32.799> times<00:03:33.880> 1.2<00:03:34.880> meters<00:03:35.950> so<00:03:36.950> use<00:03:37.130> your

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
meters times 1.2 meters so use your

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.310 
meters times 1.2 meters so use your
calculator<00:03:37.880> and<00:03:38.180> you<00:03:38.299> will<00:03:38.420> find<00:03:38.750> that<00:03:39.109> will

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
calculator and you will find that will

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.960 
calculator and you will find that will
be<00:03:39.519> 1.2<00:03:40.780> meter<00:03:41.780> cube<00:03:42.590> because<00:03:43.400> you<00:03:43.519> got<00:03:43.670> meter

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
be 1.2 meter cube because you got meter

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.440 
be 1.2 meter cube because you got meter
times<00:03:44.870> meter<00:03:45.290> times<00:03:45.769> meter<00:03:46.160> so<00:03:46.940> the<00:03:47.060> volume<00:03:47.390> of

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
times meter times meter so the volume of

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.620 
times meter times meter so the volume of
this<00:03:47.660> concrete<00:03:48.280> or<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:49.340> concrete<00:03:49.970> used<00:03:50.359> in

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
this concrete or the concrete used in

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.610 
this concrete or the concrete used in
this<00:03:50.840> slab<00:03:51.200> or<00:03:51.950> this<00:03:52.250> ramp<00:03:52.970> is<00:03:53.810> 1<00:03:54.170> point<00:03:54.410> 8

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
this slab or this ramp is 1 point 8

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.819 
this slab or this ramp is 1 point 8
meter<00:03:55.250> cube
