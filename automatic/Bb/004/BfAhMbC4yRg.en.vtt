00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:52.579

 It 's a metal part of the body , so it's a nut 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:28.600
 Do you want to take power from and install the etc body ? 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:32.430

 First you paste this double-sided tape that before always there to act 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:07.310
 Be sure to blow and degrease before installing because it is a wet tissue with 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:10.170
 Because this cord pushed and bite in this rail and was hidden well 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:14.010

 I'm wet and this is a flow 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.760

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.290

 Yes mounting we Tan 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:12.790
 If you install it well, the adhesion will be stronger if you put a force, so this must also be added to the work 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.790
 Please
