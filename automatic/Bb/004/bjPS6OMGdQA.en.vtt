00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
interesting things that have been added

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.860 
interesting things that have been added
to<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.650> game<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:20.730> actual<00:02:20.970> graphics<00:02:21.569> haven't

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
to the game the actual graphics haven't

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.630 
to the game the actual graphics haven't
seen<00:02:22.080> too<00:02:22.230> great<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.500> leap<00:02:23.269> the<00:02:24.269> the<00:02:25.080> game<00:02:25.640> has

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
seen too great a leap the the game has

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.640 
seen too great a leap the the game has
obviously<00:02:27.000> been<00:02:27.239> visually<00:02:28.109> upgraded<00:02:28.560> from

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
obviously been visually upgraded from

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.050 
obviously been visually upgraded from
the<00:02:28.829> gameboy<00:02:29.069> color<00:02:29.159> version

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
the gameboy color version

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.150 
the gameboy color version
because<00:02:30.810> there's<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.290> bit<00:02:31.470> more<00:02:31.500> detail<00:02:31.770> in

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
because there's a bit more detail in

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.710 
because there's a bit more detail in
quite<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:32.370> few<00:02:32.459> new<00:02:32.819> little<00:02:33.090> special<00:02:33.390> effects

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
quite a few new little special effects

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.690 
quite a few new little special effects
that<00:02:33.900> are<00:02:33.989> on<00:02:34.140> pop<00:02:34.349> up<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.860> obviously<00:02:35.580> the

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
that are on pop up and obviously the

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.580 
that are on pop up and obviously the
animation<00:02:36.209> in<00:02:36.330> battles<00:02:36.690> is<00:02:36.840> much<00:02:37.020> smoother<00:02:37.470> in

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
animation in battles is much smoother in

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.900 
animation in battles is much smoother in
the<00:02:37.709> battles<00:02:37.980> or<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.099> little<00:02:38.190> bit<00:02:38.340> more<00:02:38.430> dynamic

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
the battles or a little bit more dynamic

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.140 
the battles or a little bit more dynamic
but<00:02:39.950> it<00:02:40.950> hasn't<00:02:41.550> gotten<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.819> very<00:02:42.000> dramatic

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
but it hasn't gotten a very dramatic

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.120 
but it hasn't gotten a very dramatic
makeover<00:02:42.930> which<00:02:43.140> is<00:02:43.260> probably<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.830> only

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
makeover which is probably the only

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.630 
makeover which is probably the only
really<00:02:44.489> ding<00:02:44.730> against<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.239> game<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:47.160> pokemon

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
really ding against the game the pokemon

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.600 
really ding against the game the pokemon
and<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.750> characters<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.200> everything<00:02:49.920> are

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
and the characters and everything are

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.290 
and the characters and everything are
just<00:02:51.380> they're<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:52.410> little<00:02:52.590> better<00:02:52.830> but<00:02:53.040> not

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
just they're a little better but not

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.680 
just they're a little better but not
dramatically<00:02:54.300> so<00:02:54.599> and<00:02:54.840> in<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.560> face<00:02:55.739> of<00:02:56.690> many

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
dramatically so and in the face of many

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.300 
dramatically so and in the face of many
game<00:02:58.050> boy<00:02:58.230> advance<00:02:58.530> games<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:58.950> are<00:02:59.069> coming

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.830 
out that feature just really superb
detail<00:03:02.010> that's<00:03:02.610> kind<00:03:02.910> of<00:03:02.940> disappointing<00:03:03.060> but

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
detail that's kind of disappointing but

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.100 
detail that's kind of disappointing but
still<00:03:04.430> what<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.970> game<00:03:06.180> is<00:03:06.209> definitely<00:03:06.780> very

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
still what the game is definitely very

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.699 
still what the game is definitely very
very<00:03:07.380> fun<00:03:08.480> we've<00:03:09.480> kind<00:03:09.870> of<00:03:09.900> been<00:03:10.019> playing<00:03:10.350> both

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
very fun we've kind of been playing both

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.430 
very fun we've kind of been playing both
and<00:03:11.069> it<00:03:11.940> really<00:03:12.239> does<00:03:12.510> still<00:03:12.810> possess<00:03:13.170> the

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
and it really does still possess the

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.740 
and it really does still possess the
same<00:03:13.590> sort<00:03:13.920> of<00:03:13.980> magic<00:03:14.519> or<00:03:14.700> addictive<00:03:15.360> quality

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
same sort of magic or addictive quality

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.710 
same sort of magic or addictive quality
that<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.319> earlier<00:03:16.620> ones<00:03:16.950> did<00:03:17.720> the

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
that the the earlier ones did the

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.900 
that the the earlier ones did the
exploration<00:03:19.380> everything<00:03:19.920> in<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.310> game<00:03:20.459> just

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
exploration everything in the game just

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.490 
exploration everything in the game just
definitely<00:03:21.299> ramps<00:03:21.690> up<00:03:21.810> at<00:03:21.989> a<00:03:22.019> really<00:03:22.290> solid

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
definitely ramps up at a really solid

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.800 
definitely ramps up at a really solid
pace<00:03:22.830> they<00:03:23.220> really<00:03:23.459> do<00:03:23.670> encourage<00:03:23.849> you<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:24.660> do

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
sort of like inventive thinking to sort

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.449 
sort of like inventive thinking to sort
of<00:03:30.750> like<00:03:30.930> deal<00:03:31.110> with<00:03:31.290> enemies<00:03:31.620> solve<00:03:32.010> puzzles

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
of like deal with enemies solve puzzles

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.000 
of like deal with enemies solve puzzles
and<00:03:32.730> just<00:03:32.880> do<00:03:33.000> some<00:03:33.150> exploring<00:03:33.660> so<00:03:34.290> I<00:03:34.739> mean

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
and just do some exploring so I mean

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.830

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
we're pretty pleased obviously we'd hope

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.720 
we're pretty pleased obviously we'd hope
that<00:03:37.079> the<00:03:37.560> graphics<00:03:37.980> maybe<00:03:38.190> would<00:03:38.430> have<00:03:38.549> been

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
that the graphics maybe would have been

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.430 
that the graphics maybe would have been
brought<00:03:39.329> up<00:03:39.450> to<00:03:39.600> par<00:03:39.810> with<00:03:40.049> some<00:03:40.290> of<00:03:40.380> the

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
brought up to par with some of the

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.819 
brought up to par with some of the
higher-end<00:03:40.650> entries<00:03:41.130> on<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.280> GBA<00:03:41.760> but<00:03:42.829> you

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
higher-end entries on the GBA but you

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.940 
higher-end entries on the GBA but you
know<00:03:43.950> what<00:03:44.250> you<00:03:44.370> get<00:03:44.579> is<00:03:44.940> solid<00:03:45.359> enough<00:03:45.420> and

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
know what you get is solid enough and

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.289 
know what you get is solid enough and
really<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.130> game<00:03:47.340> is<00:03:47.549> just<00:03:47.760> all<00:03:47.880> about<00:03:47.970> the

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
really the game is just all about the

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.120 
really the game is just all about the
gameplay<00:03:48.480> and<00:03:48.989> that's<00:03:49.440> there<00:03:49.709> and<00:03:49.950> that's

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
gameplay and that's there and that's

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.370 
gameplay and that's there and that's
solid
