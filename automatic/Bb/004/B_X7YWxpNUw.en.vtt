Vegan Sweet Potato Pie Recipe by The Sweetest Vegan

00:00:02.392 --> 00:00:03.704
Hey my Sweet Vs, it's The Sweetest Vegan here and today on the show

00:00:03.704 --> 00:00:06.607
We will be making the highly request recipe for Thanksgiving

00:00:06.607 --> 00:00:15.650
Vegan Sweet Potato Pie

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.856
So there are two things I have done today 
 to kind of protect you from boredom

00:00:17.856 --> 00:00:19.667
I have already pre baked my pie crust

00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:22.709
If you do not already have a pie crust recipe, 
 you can look in the description bar below, 

00:00:22.709 --> 00:00:27.678
or you can click here on my pie crust and it 
 will take you to my vegan pumpkin pie recipe

00:00:27.678 --> 00:00:29.884
and it will show you how I made this crust.

00:00:29.884 --> 00:00:32.694
And I have also already cooked my sweet potatoes

00:00:32.694 --> 00:00:36.537
I cut my sweet potatoes into huge chunks, put them 
 into a pot of water and boiled them 

00:00:36.537 --> 00:00:38.359
for about 20 minutes and they were done.

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:42.493
And now we can move on to the exciting 
 part, our vegan sweet potato pie filling.

00:00:42.493 --> 00:00:46.486
To a large mixing bowl, you want to add in your sweet potatoes,

00:00:46.486 --> 00:00:50.573
vegan butter, maple syrup, raw sugar, 

00:00:50.573 --> 00:00:56.889
almond milk, vegan cream cheese, which is going to make this nice and creamy

00:00:56.889 --> 00:01:02.624
and scrumptious, vanilla extract, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, and ginger

00:01:02.624 --> 00:01:07.935
Mix it all together with your electric mixer and then we 
 are ready to put it into the pie crust.

00:01:07.935 --> 00:01:14.211
I just had a quick taste of the pie filling, 
 and I must say that it is absolutely delicious

00:01:14.211 --> 00:01:16.109
and I can not wait to eat it at the end of this video

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:19.319
but we must bake our pie.

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:23.453
Bake the Vegan Sweet Potato Pie for about 40 minutes and 350 degrees F.

00:01:23.453 --> 00:01:26.239
So I am here and I am ready to do my taste test.

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:31.162
I am so bad about letting thing sit, 
 I know this would have been together

00:01:31.162 --> 00:01:34.728
if I would have waited 10 minutes, but I want to try the pie.

00:01:34.728 --> 00:01:36.920
So I went ahead and cut into it.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.683
Oh and its steaming

00:01:39.683 --> 00:01:44.300
This is one vegan pie that I will not be able to put down.

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:47.860
It's delicious guys, it is so good.

00:01:47.857 --> 00:01:55.580
It is so creamy, I can not believe how good this turned out.
