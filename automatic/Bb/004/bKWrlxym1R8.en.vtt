00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.659
 ingredients and I also here already 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:23.439

 here some buds you fill buds 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.590
 best way to put them is to complicate 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.310
 how 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.310

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.650
 the yolk and there are many people that one 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.879
