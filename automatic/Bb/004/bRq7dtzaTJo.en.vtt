he gets taken out on the edge of the box
and<00:02:18.380> that<00:02:18.470> does<00:02:18.770> of<00:02:19.010> course<00:02:19.040> mean<00:02:19.610> that<00:02:19.760> we<00:02:19.850> are

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
and that does of course mean that we are

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.390 
and that does of course mean that we are
going<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.300> be<00:02:20.390> given<00:02:20.690> a<00:02:20.810> penalty<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:21.620> the

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
going to be given a penalty and the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.970 
going to be given a penalty and the
chance<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:23.390> shore<00:02:23.690> up<00:02:23.720> this<00:02:24.140> you<00:02:24.560> know<00:02:24.710> lead

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
chance to shore up this you know lead

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.640 
chance to shore up this you know lead
and<00:02:25.280> also<00:02:25.850> take<00:02:26.060> down<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:26.480> coin<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:27.050> you<00:02:27.530> can

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
and also take down the coin so you can

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.070 
and also take down the coin so you can
see<00:02:27.800> that<00:02:27.830> it<00:02:28.160> was<00:02:28.430> probably<00:02:29.090> not<00:02:29.450> a<00:02:29.480> penalty<00:02:29.780> I

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
see that it was probably not a penalty I

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.690 
see that it was probably not a penalty I
think<00:02:30.380> that<00:02:30.470> was<00:02:30.620> a<00:02:30.710> very<00:02:30.920> very<00:02:31.220> clean<00:02:31.430> tackle

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
think that was a very very clean tackle

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.970 
think that was a very very clean tackle
but<00:02:32.060> you<00:02:32.540> know<00:02:32.660> they<00:02:33.350> make<00:02:33.380> mistakes

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
but you know they make mistakes

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.250 
but you know they make mistakes

game but you made a good safe putting

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.539 
game but you made a good safe putting
over<00:03:32.600> the<00:03:32.780> bar<00:03:32.959> but<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.920> resulting<00:03:34.340> corner

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
over the bar but the resulting corner

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.479 
over the bar but the resulting corner
does<00:03:35.120> again<00:03:35.690> give<00:03:36.350> us<00:03:36.500> a<00:03:36.620> goal<00:03:36.890> and<00:03:37.100> this<00:03:37.280> time

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
does again give us a goal and this time

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:38.979 
does again give us a goal and this time
it<00:03:37.610> isn't<00:03:37.730> a<00:03:37.910> goal<00:03:38.090> from<00:03:38.209> it<00:03:38.390> although<00:03:38.810> it

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
it isn't a goal from it although it

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:40.330 
it isn't a goal from it although it
probably<00:03:39.200> should<00:03:39.500> have<00:03:39.680> been<00:03:39.920> it<00:03:40.250> was

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
probably should have been it was

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.979 
probably should have been it was
actually<00:03:40.610> an<00:03:40.790> own<00:03:40.910> goal<00:03:40.940> from<00:03:41.239> Jordi<00:03:41.540> Alba<00:03:41.810> who

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
heads in and over the line now we have a

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.660 
heads in and over the line now we have a
chance<00:03:44.840> they're<00:03:45.410> keeping<00:03:45.920> makes<00:03:46.070> a<00:03:46.190> good<00:03:46.370> save

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
chance they're keeping makes a good save

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.210 
chance they're keeping makes a good save
and<00:03:46.970> we<00:03:47.750> don't<00:03:47.900> get<00:03:48.140> our<00:03:48.350> lead<00:03:48.620> to<00:03:48.860> increase

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
and we don't get our lead to increase

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.310 
and we don't get our lead to increase
