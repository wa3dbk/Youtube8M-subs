00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
black-and-white printer I also have a

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.000 
black-and-white printer I also have a
Canon<00:00:39.260> multifunction<00:00:40.260> printer<00:00:40.530> that's<00:00:40.800> a

Canon multifunction printer that's a
color<00:00:41.489> printer<00:00:41.820> could<00:00:41.969> print<00:00:42.120> photos<00:00:42.680> so<00:00:43.680> I

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
color printer could print photos so I

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.709 
color printer could print photos so I
can<00:00:43.860> switch<00:00:44.010> between<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.460> two<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.700> these<00:00:44.850> so

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.270 
grayscale printing the important thing
to<00:01:51.600> remember<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.259> these<00:01:52.560> options<00:01:53.009> change

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
to remember is these options change

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.560 
to remember is these options change
depending<00:01:53.610> upon<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.909> printer<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.329> if<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.479> get

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
depending upon the printer so if you get

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.030 
depending upon the printer so if you get
a<00:01:54.600> new<00:01:54.899> printer<00:01:55.259> you're<00:01:55.500> gonna<00:01:55.619> have<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.799> new

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
a new printer you're gonna have a new

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.200 
a new printer you're gonna have a new
set<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.280> options<00:01:56.460> depending<00:01:56.939> upon<00:01:57.030> the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
set of options depending upon the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.030 
set of options depending upon the
capabilities<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:57.960> printer<00:01:58.229> if<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.920> go

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
capabilities of that printer if you go

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.219 
capabilities of that printer if you go
over<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> friend's<00:01:59.820> house<00:01:59.969> or<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.509> co-workers

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
over a friend's house or a co-workers

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.990 
over a friend's house or a co-workers
cubicle<00:02:01.680> if<00:02:01.829> they<00:02:02.070> have<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.219> different<00:02:02.670> printer

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
cubicle if they have a different printer

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.399 
cubicle if they have a different printer
then<00:02:03.479> they're<00:02:03.780> gonna<00:02:03.869> have<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.020> different<00:02:04.079> set

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
then they're gonna have a different set

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:04.969 
then they're gonna have a different set
of<00:02:04.500> options

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
of options

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.069 
of options
so<00:02:05.280> when<00:02:05.549> relaying<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.210> somebody<00:02:06.570> how<00:02:07.020> to

so when relaying to somebody how to

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.900 
so when relaying to somebody how to
print<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.560> document<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:08.369> have<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.670> take<00:02:08.819> this

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
print a document you have to take this

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.770 
print a document you have to take this
under<00:02:09.090> consideration

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
under consideration

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.809 
under consideration
there<00:02:10.289> are<00:02:10.379> even<00:02:10.649> whole<00:02:11.039> sets<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.489> options

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
there are even whole sets of options

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.330 
there are even whole sets of options
that<00:02:11.879> are<00:02:11.970> only<00:02:12.150> available<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.690> some<00:02:12.989> printers

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
that are only available to some printers

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.250 
that are only available to some printers
for<00:02:13.430> instance<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:14.180> cannon<00:02:14.750> color<00:02:14.930> printer

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
for instance the cannon color printer

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.309 
for instance the cannon color printer
here<00:02:15.470> has<00:02:15.860> a<00:02:16.220> borderless<00:02:16.760> printing<00:02:17.360> option

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
here has a borderless printing option

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.259 
here has a borderless printing option
and<00:02:18.470> I<00:02:19.010> could<00:02:19.160> set<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.370> amount<00:02:19.580> of<00:02:19.790> extension

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
and I could set the amount of extension

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.150 
and I could set the amount of extension
over<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.599> edges<00:02:20.900> to<00:02:21.080> get<00:02:21.200> a<00:02:21.440> borderless<00:02:21.830> print

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
over the edges to get a borderless print

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.720 
over the edges to get a borderless print
but<00:02:22.819> if<00:02:22.940> I<00:02:23.030> switch<00:02:23.330> to<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:24.260> older<00:02:25.010> black<00:02:25.550> and

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
but if I switch to the older black and

but if I switch to the older black and
white<00:02:25.819> laser<00:02:26.000> printer<00:02:26.390> I<00:02:26.569> don't<00:02:26.989> even<00:02:27.050> have

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
white laser printer I don't even have

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:28.809 
white laser printer I don't even have

likewise for a newer color printer you

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.330 
likewise for a newer color printer you
may<00:02:31.580> find<00:02:31.910> supply<00:02:32.629> levels<00:02:33.049> and<00:02:33.260> get<00:02:33.830> a<00:02:33.860> list<00:02:34.160> of

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
may find supply levels and get a list of

may find supply levels and get a list of
the<00:02:35.060> amount<00:02:35.269> of<00:02:35.330> ink<00:02:35.629> available<00:02:36.140> in<00:02:36.290> each

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.990 
cartridge but if you go to a laser
printer<00:02:39.590> you<00:02:39.739> would<00:02:39.830> expect<00:02:40.340> to<00:02:40.370> find<00:02:40.459> perhaps

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
printer you would expect to find perhaps

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.380

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
the amount of toner available and you

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.210 
the amount of toner available and you
would<00:02:44.569> for<00:02:44.840> a<00:02:44.870> lot<00:02:45.080> but<00:02:45.380> this<00:02:45.680> is<00:02:45.860> such<00:02:45.980> an<00:02:46.099> old

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
would for a lot but this is such an old

would for a lot but this is such an old
printer<00:02:46.549> you<00:02:46.700> don't<00:02:46.880> actually<00:02:47.030> even<00:02:47.299> get<00:02:47.569> that

you<00:02:49.040> also<00:02:49.160> get<00:02:49.459> different<00:02:49.670> things<00:02:50.000> if<00:02:50.239> you

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
you also get different things if you

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.000 
you also get different things if you
