to the 40 when when you're done timing
the<00:02:41.980> minute<00:02:42.220> hand<00:02:42.430> will<00:02:42.640> have<00:02:42.760> moved

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
the minute hand will have moved

whichever number it is pointing to on
the<00:02:45.640> bezel<00:02:45.820> that's<00:02:46.180> how<00:02:46.360> much<00:02:46.540> time<00:02:46.840> has

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
the bezel that's how much time has

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.180 
the bezel that's how much time has
passed<00:02:47.380> so<00:02:48.070> let's<00:02:48.250> say<00:02:48.430> you're<00:02:49.330> timing<00:02:50.190> how

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
passed so let's say you're timing how

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.290 
passed so let's say you're timing how
long<00:02:51.250> it<00:02:51.400> takes<00:02:51.640> a<00:02:51.760> jog<00:02:51.940> around<00:02:52.060> your

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
long it takes a jog around your

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.390 
long it takes a jog around your
neighborhood<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:53.650> let's<00:02:53.890> say<00:02:53.980> takes<00:02:54.160> ten

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
neighborhood and let's say takes ten

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.520 
neighborhood and let's say takes ten
minutes<00:02:54.700> so<00:02:54.880> when<00:02:55.090> you're<00:02:55.330> done<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:56.140> minute

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
minutes so when you're done the minute

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.590 
minutes so when you're done the minute
hand<00:02:56.800> will<00:02:56.950> move<00:02:57.220> to<00:02:57.550> the<00:02:57.640> 10<00:02:57.850> MB<00:02:58.120> pointing<00:02:58.510> to

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
hand will move to the 10 MB pointing to

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.600 
hand will move to the 10 MB pointing to
the<00:02:58.690> 10<00:02:58.900> so<00:02:59.170> you<00:02:59.200> will<00:02:59.410> know<00:02:59.560> that's<00:02:59.830> how<00:03:00.070> long

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
the 10 so you will know that's how long

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.420 
the 10 so you will know that's how long
it<00:03:00.880> took<00:03:01.030> you<00:03:01.740> when<00:03:02.740> the<00:03:02.830> bezel<00:03:03.190> is<00:03:03.250> not<00:03:03.400> a

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
it took you when the bezel is not a

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.480 
it took you when the bezel is not a
noose<00:03:03.760> lined<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.360> arrow<00:03:04.540> up<00:03:04.840> by<00:03:05.320> the<00:03:05.380> 12<00:03:06.870> and

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
noose lined the arrow up by the 12 and

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.560 
noose lined the arrow up by the 12 and
then<00:03:09.490> you<00:03:10.090> have<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.630> numbers<00:03:11.020> by<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:12.640> hour

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
then you have the numbers by the hour

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.930 
then you have the numbers by the hour
marker<00:03:14.470> so<00:03:14.740> you<00:03:14.800> can<00:03:15.070> just<00:03:15.220> glance<00:03:15.430> down<00:03:15.730> and
