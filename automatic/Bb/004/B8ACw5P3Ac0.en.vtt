00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
your sense of style is and then if you

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.369 
your sense of style is and then if you

do want to buy a shirt its third dollars

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.959 
do want to buy a shirt its third dollars

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
so it's not only thirty dollars a month

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.110 
so it's not only thirty dollars a month
it's<00:01:03.390> basically<00:01:03.719> like<00:01:03.960> they<00:01:04.379> come<00:01:04.589> out<00:01:04.800> with

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.120 
it's basically like they come out with
44<00:01:06.120> new<00:01:06.479> shirts<00:01:06.810> every<00:01:07.260> month<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.770> it's

44 new shirts every month and it's
thirty<00:01:08.340> dollars<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.850> get<00:01:08.940> that<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.330> it's

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
thirty dollars to get that so it's

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.030 
thirty dollars to get that so it's
basically<00:01:09.690> thirty<00:01:10.200> dollars<00:01:10.500> per<00:01:10.680> month<00:01:10.710> but

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
basically thirty dollars per month but

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.460 
basically thirty dollars per month but

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
you don't have to get a shirt so it's

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.750 
you don't have to get a shirt so it's
really<00:01:13.650> like<00:01:13.830> three<00:01:14.070> dollars<00:01:14.370> whenever<00:01:14.640> you

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
how I thought my god my tea today like

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.820 
how I thought my god my tea today like
is<00:04:12.600> it's<00:04:13.470> dark<00:04:13.800> within<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:14.850> sleeves<00:04:15.830> from

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
is it's dark within the sleeves from

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.979 
is it's dark within the sleeves from
here<00:04:17.130> down<00:04:17.340> our<00:04:17.760> black<00:04:18.210> so<00:04:18.570> this<00:04:18.750> is<00:04:18.870> like

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
here down our black so this is like

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.960 
here down our black so this is like
charcoal<00:04:19.470> and<00:04:19.710> then<00:04:19.799> this<00:04:19.920> is<00:04:20.100> black<00:04:20.310> so<00:04:20.940> I

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
charcoal and then this is black so I

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.280 
charcoal and then this is black so I
think<00:04:21.150> that's<00:04:21.450> so<00:04:21.600> cool<00:04:21.810> because<00:04:21.870> it's<00:04:22.080> hold

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
think that's so cool because it's hold

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.450 
think that's so cool because it's hold
it<00:04:22.350> so<00:04:22.650> basically<00:04:22.950> what<00:04:23.160> I'm

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
it so basically what I'm

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.790 
it so basically what I'm
ring<00:04:23.580> is<00:04:23.880> I'm<00:04:24.240> just<00:04:24.419> wearing<00:04:24.630> my<00:04:25.020> styling

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
ring is I'm just wearing my styling

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.430 
ring is I'm just wearing my styling
t-shirt<00:04:26.300> and<00:04:27.300> I<00:04:27.389> like<00:04:27.569> how<00:04:27.690> it<00:04:27.810> scrapped<00:04:28.229> in

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
t-shirt and I like how it scrapped in

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.960 
t-shirt and I like how it scrapped in
the<00:04:28.530> front<00:04:28.830> and<00:04:29.039> then<00:04:29.160> it<00:04:29.250> gets<00:04:29.340> longer<00:04:29.580> in<00:04:29.880> the

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
the front and then it gets longer in the

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.029 
the front and then it gets longer in the
back<00:04:30.060> so<00:04:30.300> it<00:04:30.330> doesn't<00:04:30.630> expose<00:04:31.080> you<00:04:31.500> anywhere

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
back so it doesn't expose you anywhere

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:35.390 
back so it doesn't expose you anywhere
and<00:04:32.400> then<00:04:32.970> I<00:04:33.000> really<00:04:33.509> like<00:04:33.720> the<00:04:34.009> layering<00:04:35.009> look

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
and then I really like the layering look

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.159 
and then I really like the layering look
it<00:04:35.550> has<00:04:35.729> even<00:04:36.090> though<00:04:36.330> it's<00:04:36.479> all<00:04:36.660> one<00:04:36.870> shirt

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.040 
it has even though it's all one shirt
I'm<00:04:37.800> just<00:04:38.039> wearing<00:04:38.330> black<00:04:39.330> leggings<00:04:39.810> it's
