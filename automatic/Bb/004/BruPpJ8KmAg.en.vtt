00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
remember about the table read was having

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.770 
remember about the table read was having
to<00:02:06.080> hide<00:02:06.710> this<00:02:06.980> small<00:02:07.880> tape<00:02:08.090> recorder<00:02:08.119> in<00:02:08.629> it

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
to hide this small tape recorder in it

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.719 
to hide this small tape recorder in it
we<00:02:09.140> wanted<00:02:09.499> every<00:02:09.769> show<00:02:09.950> to<00:02:10.009> start<00:02:10.280> with<00:02:10.489> the

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
we wanted every show to start with the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.059 
we wanted every show to start with the
but<00:02:11.269> we<00:02:11.359> decided<00:02:11.780> that<00:02:11.810> after<00:02:12.079> Malin<00:02:12.650> bonding

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
but we decided that after Malin bonding

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.740 
but we decided that after Malin bonding
and<00:02:13.189> I<00:02:13.579> think<00:02:13.760> we<00:02:13.849> tried<00:02:14.120> to<00:02:14.299> make<00:02:14.540> it

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
and I think we tried to make it

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.140 
and I think we tried to make it
the<00:02:14.870> mail-in<00:02:15.350> bonding<00:02:15.830> but<00:02:16.280> yeah<00:02:16.790> I've<00:02:16.970> always

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
the mail-in bonding but yeah I've always

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.650 
the mail-in bonding but yeah I've always
always<00:02:17.270> very<00:02:17.750> big<00:02:17.930> on<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.110> uniformity<00:02:19.660> but

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
always very big on the uniformity but

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.390 
always very big on the uniformity but
there's<00:02:20.810> something<00:02:21.080> that<00:02:21.110> I<00:02:21.440> I<00:02:21.620> one<00:02:22.250> of<00:02:22.340> the

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
there's something that I I one of the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.980 
there's something that I I one of the
reasons<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:22.700> wanted<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.120> episodes<00:02:23.540> to<00:02:23.600> just<00:02:23.840> be

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
reasons I wanted the episodes to just be

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.680 
reasons I wanted the episodes to just be
the<00:02:24.550> something<00:02:25.550> because<00:02:26.150> I<00:02:26.240> didn't<00:02:26.480> want

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
the something because I didn't want

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.260 
the something because I didn't want
writers<00:02:27.140> wasting<00:02:27.920> time<00:02:28.160> on<00:02:28.490> clever<00:02:28.880> show

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270
