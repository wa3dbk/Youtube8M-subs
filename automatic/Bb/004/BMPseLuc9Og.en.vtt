00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.440
 hello to all and welcome 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.309
 on my youtube channel 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.130
 today presentation 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:18.330
 4-1 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:21.550
 crazy model with with a valve 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.529
 lower view with flow control 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.970
 on this valve can go up 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:31.419
 decrease the amount of molten metal 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.630
 to her son husband he is composed so 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:39.340
 someone rostain must go from sending 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.770
 January to October it's basic these 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.950
 diagnostics its end of chain 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:52.600
 so this model equipped with the sleeve like 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:57.910
 we saw here my action below fusion 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:00.060
 flowing very convenient say when you 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.710
 push your cartridges your balls 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.900
 fatally savings on production 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.790
 that will not get bored with 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.860
 Bullshit 30 40 euros economy 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.439
 so I totally understand that there is 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.140
 which are indicated is not a criticism 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.310
 but so if you if you can you 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.560
 allow to put a little more 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.289
 to have this system it is a lot 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:24.479
 less risk because you do not have to 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:27.329
 forget that melt pot fight and 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.039
 if you pour them on it because 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:31.210
 the wrong handling an accident with two 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.159
 intelligent accidents I still have 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.829
 never seen his balloon reduces the risk 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:39.460
 accident is simply because 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:43.659
 that I preferred I am optimistic 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.609
 and tissue time it's a little video 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.689
 alsace behind so that allows to 

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:52.060
 steer the climbs up and over 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.479
 the sides one simply attracts one 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.479
 support 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.580
 with his silhouette simply cost it 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.470
 goes for the records and the tax then 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.220
 I made it to be titled black on my 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:14.040
 pinch that that when I put it there the 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:21.900
 rain is directly above the well 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:24.780
 lobby power all that you 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:31.140
 must blood flow is a matter you have 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:33.209
 what to do next 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.560
 they were ordered to the is waiting dice 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.180
 see to the water and were ordered to 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.390
 united states was commissioned on a 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.360
 French shop and there are some beautiful 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.380
 powerful 110 volt models vote pro 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.180
 whether he arrives it is one or the other 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.510
 you take 220 of us at home 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.220
 la France 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.490
 whatever it is it is delivered without 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.070
 card so when you order defour 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:56.010
 you go shopping at the store 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.830
 commission think about taking a card from 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.959
 + Earth even clearer because there 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.239
 had a real middle girl there the 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.730
 hole is the earth so it's at a 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.750
 metal carcass 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.400
 it's metallic from all over these 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.560
 drivers everywhere and by all he has 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.030
 mesh to a current leak there to no 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.260
 you take full mouth what is 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.190
 what there really is nothing isolated 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.260
 so ebony ground police records 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.480
 to protect you and check your 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.070
 home electrical installation at 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.310
 know you have a circuit breaker 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.260
 interlocutors differential 30 min that's 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.280
 there if you take the twins that's 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.200
 the grip here or like that is to stick 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.489
 his mechanics they have tight and you 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.549
 can not get rid of this hold 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.780
 that's how we get electrocuted if 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.600
 you do like that you have occupied or 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.510
 no hold if you are like that and 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.860
 where it is repaired but will be much 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.890
 harder to break free so crisis 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:53.310
 so that's big point teach 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.900
 it's valve system in place at 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.480
 weak point is they nothing isolated 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.380
 site says al of everywhere if your 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:05.380
 electrical installation is during 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:07.080
 these means here screw settings so we 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.920
 waits one way or the other 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:13.030
 one way or the other 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:17.380
 it actually allows you to control the flow 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.940
 out of the ball very gently or 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.140
 much faster the universe to 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.220
 bottom and then and then that's going 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.350
 now we will move to another 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.720
 video the tutorial video of the 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.620
 making the cartridge slug go to 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.620
 immediately work
