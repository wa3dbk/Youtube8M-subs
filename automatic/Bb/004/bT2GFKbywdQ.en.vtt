00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.850
 the white tiger today can only be seen 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.450
 in zoos or parks but not Christmas 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.450
 wild 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.150
 they thought they were albinos but not the 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.189
 white tigers were for a long time 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.599
 an emblem for trophy hunters 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.599
 an enigma for scientists 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.220
 this is the initiative of chaos 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.379
 his white fur is produced by a 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.690
 only alteration of the pigment gene 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.579
 according to a study by researchers from the 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.559
 Peking University in China published 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.589
 in the current specialized magazine 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.660
 biology to clear the controversial 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.250
 speculation that the mutation has 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.620
 white is perhaps a genetic defect 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.300
 According to the study, 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.820
 scientists made the genome map 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.250
 from a family of 16 tigers of joe 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.449
 safari park including individuals 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.149
 whites and oranges 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.580
 then sequenced the genomes 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:11.649
 of the three parents in the family the 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.090
 results of genetic analyzes the 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:19.030
 led to a pigment gene the s lc 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.950
 45 to 2 whose polymorphism had been 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.500
 previously associated with coloration 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.509
 clear of modern Europeans in addition to 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.970
 other animals like horses chickens and 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.890
 mice 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.900
 the variant found on earth the 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.450
 white inhibits mainly the synthesis 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.220
 of the red and yellow pigment however 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.960
 has little or no effect on the color 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.250
 black what explains why the tigers 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.420
 Whites are still showing their 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.420
 features dark stripes 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.969
 even though the gene alterations 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.280
 sl c45 to 2 can cause a type 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:52.439
 specific to albinism having white 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.509
 is not a true albino since although 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.789
 there is absence of zeal meninas the 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.920
 eumelanin is present in the eyes and 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.360
 in the hair of the stripes 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.310
 according to the research the mutation 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.560
 white in the tiger genes occurred 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.950
 only once and its frequency was never 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.379
 high 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.599
 the white tigers used to inhabit the 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:12.069
 Indian subcontinent however the 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:16.120
 last individual seen in a natural state 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.769
 was hunted down and died in 1958 many of 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.870
 the white tigers that were trophies of 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.040
 hunting were mature adults what suggests 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.290
 that were apt to live in the 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.880
 nature, a fact not less than having 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.500
 account is that the deer one of the 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.200
 The main prey of the tiger are 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.640
 prone to color blindness today to see a 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.950
 white tiger you have to visit a 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.599
 zoo or a safari park given that already 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.660
 no individuals remain in habitats 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.010
 wild this is a crucial point of 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.260
 the research since the scientists 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.030
 they say it's worth considering the 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.550
 reintroduction of white tigers into their 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.020
 natural habitat 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.640
 the white knitting is part of the 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.620
 natural genetic diversity of the tiger 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.790
 which is worth keeping but now it 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.790
 go only in captivity
