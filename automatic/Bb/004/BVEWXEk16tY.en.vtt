00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.080
 you'll know why it's not 

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:08.660
 because I think that kind generous 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:09.920
 28 oh it's still going for your this 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.250
 pause before knowing who it was 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.250
 slower 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.400
 it's not nice for them that's 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.790
 still van peel you eat guys I 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.790
 will you ship 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:36.790
 fake paris 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:48.320
 attention to the house I loved him of course 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.239
 the hand but it is not to take 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.690
 it is demand and not before 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.910
 December if I have the heart on the hand 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.820
 it's because you're just from 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.230
 do not make it 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.420
 like one day realize that a child 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.470
 dismissed forgetting that he had so long 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.750
 wish we left only two by 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:12.590
 give up in need in a 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.180
 sidewalk subtly mess for that 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:19.100
 it was difficult to retromobile was something 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:23.570
 share but I picked you up 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:27.830
 my hand before putting it away in his 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.720
 wardrobe you pilot will be named i is 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.759
 not a proper story he asks 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.550
 filed in December if I'm having fun on 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:39.679
 the bench is because they put a 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:41.300
 just will remain like the boat drouet 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:42.950
 the plane depressurized the village 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.009
 contaminated and must be burned for 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.709
 save it was left somewhere 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.869
 abandoned in the dark at the bottom of a 

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:52.130
 light drawer of a lighthouse only by 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.340
 subtly guys it's me that we can 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.109
 to be found 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:04.909
 and I pick them up and you want to hold in 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:04.909
 the hand before tidying up descendants me 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:17.299
 it's because you just project 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.299
 laurence 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.430
 we are in front 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:45.370
 I know I will hold it before their 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:47.560
 blood to see I'll be dead to them but this 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.450
 Not until tonight two brats 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.160
 birth room I have the heart on the 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.290
 hand 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:57.700
 it's because you're just from 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:03.150
 November I should have said we lose that 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.150
 I was returned or exchanged 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.790
 personally I do not have to take either 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.150
 tonight or tomorrow in a wind of meaning 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.450
 if I see them it's because you come 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.450
 barely
