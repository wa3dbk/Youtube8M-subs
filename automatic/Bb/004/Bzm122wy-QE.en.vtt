of things around the Higgs if your
little<00:00:17.189> kids<00:00:17.430> get<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.760> hold<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.410> permanent

just take a orange peel rub the skin of
that<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.780> get<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:38.040> get<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.400> oils<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.940> start

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
that to get it to get the oils to start

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:47.060 
that to get it to get the oils to start
coming<00:00:39.780> out<00:00:43.340> and<00:00:44.450> then<00:00:45.450> as<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.410> can<00:00:46.560> see<00:00:46.740> that

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
coming out and then as you can see that

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.550 
coming out and then as you can see that
is<00:00:47.340> prime<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.670> marker<00:00:48.420> it's<00:00:48.720> not<00:00:48.990> coming<00:00:49.290> off

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:49.560 
is prime and marker it's not coming off

and you just just rub with the orange
peel<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:58.700> it<00:00:59.700> might<00:00:59.970> take<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.740> couple<00:01:01.740> of<00:01:01.980> tries

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:12.800 

to<00:01:05.460> get<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.659> whole<00:01:06.900> thing<00:01:06.930> off<00:01:09.200> and<00:01:11.240> in<00:01:12.240> some

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
to get the whole thing off and in some

to get the whole thing off and in some
cases<00:01:13.200> there<00:01:13.679> might<00:01:13.890> be<00:01:14.149> some<00:01:15.149> mess

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.020 

some<00:01:19.990> very<00:01:20.320> faint<00:01:20.770> the<00:01:21.840> marker<00:01:22.840> stains<00:01:23.260> left

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
some very faint the marker stains left

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:32.100 
some very faint the marker stains left
left<00:01:25.030> behind<00:01:27.810> but<00:01:28.810> in<00:01:29.020> a<00:01:29.140> lot<00:01:29.350> of<00:01:29.380> cases<00:01:31.110> it'll

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
left behind but in a lot of cases it'll

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:46.830 
left behind but in a lot of cases it'll
completely<00:01:32.920> remove

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.510 

it<00:01:47.840> takes<00:01:48.140> a<00:01:48.290> little<00:01:48.409> bit<00:01:48.680> elbow<00:01:49.190> grease

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
it takes a little bit elbow grease

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:57.430 
it takes a little bit elbow grease
sometimes<00:01:50.270> but<00:01:52.210> but<00:01:53.210> normally<00:01:55.990> most<00:01:56.990> of<00:01:57.290> it

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
sometimes but but normally most of it

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.920 
sometimes but but normally most of it
off<00:01:58.900> with<00:01:59.900> just<00:02:00.170> one<00:02:00.560> try
