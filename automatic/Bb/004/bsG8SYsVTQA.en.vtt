as far as you know TV versus internet
goes<00:03:55.629> I<00:03:55.870> think<00:03:56.259> that<00:03:56.530> you<00:03:56.889> know<00:03:56.979> television

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
goes I think that you know television

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.399 
goes I think that you know television
content<00:03:57.970> is<00:03:58.120> going<00:03:58.389> to<00:03:58.449> be<00:03:58.599> available<00:03:58.780> for

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:02.409 
decades down the line but I really do

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.800 
decades down the line but I really do
believe<00:04:02.620> that<00:04:02.680> you<00:04:03.159> know<00:04:03.909> 5<00:04:04.180> 10<00:04:04.449> years<00:04:04.689> from

your<00:04:37.830> computer<00:04:38.250> and<00:04:38.400> you<00:04:39.180> know<00:04:39.270> it's<00:04:39.419> not<00:04:39.539> that

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
your computer and you know it's not that

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.749 
your computer and you know it's not that
easy<00:04:40.020> that<00:04:40.350> I<00:04:40.380> see<00:04:40.590> it<00:04:40.680> becoming<00:04:41.039> that<00:04:41.280> easy<00:04:41.490> in

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 
easy that I see it becoming that easy in

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:44.029 
easy that I see it becoming that easy in
the<00:04:41.850> next<00:04:42.060> couple<00:04:42.210> years<00:04:42.539> and<00:04:42.810> TV<00:04:43.590> networks

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
the next couple years and TV networks

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:46.879 
the next couple years and TV networks
seeing<00:04:44.370> the<00:04:44.810> the<00:04:45.810> power<00:04:45.990> of<00:04:46.199> the<00:04:46.320> internet<00:04:46.680> and

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
seeing the the power of the internet and

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.110 
seeing the the power of the internet and
seeing<00:04:47.160> that<00:04:47.280> they<00:04:47.430> maybe<00:04:47.610> should<00:04:47.850> upload

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
seeing that they maybe should upload

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.450 
seeing that they maybe should upload
their<00:04:48.360> you<00:04:48.660> know<00:04:48.690> TV<00:04:49.259> shows<00:04:49.620> the<00:04:49.919> Internet<00:04:50.340> at

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
their you know TV shows the Internet at

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.890 
their you know TV shows the Internet at
the<00:04:50.550> same<00:04:50.729> time<00:04:50.940> they<00:04:51.060> have<00:04:51.210> them<00:04:51.330> going<00:04:51.570> on<00:04:51.690> TV

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
the same time they have them going on TV

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.499 
the same time they have them going on TV
because<00:04:52.860> you<00:04:53.100> know<00:04:53.370> it's<00:04:53.610> so<00:04:53.850> much<00:04:53.880> easier<00:04:54.449> to

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:54.509 
because you know it's so much easier to

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:56.689 
because you know it's so much easier to
just<00:04:54.900> have<00:04:55.080> one<00:04:55.110> screen<00:04:55.740> you<00:04:55.919> know<00:04:56.039> if<00:04:56.550> you

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
just have one screen you know if you

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.219 
just have one screen you know if you
could<00:04:56.880> if<00:04:57.000> you<00:04:57.090> don't<00:04:57.240> have<00:04:57.330> to<00:04:57.419> buy<00:04:57.570> you<00:04:58.139> know

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
could if you don't have to buy you know

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.129 
could if you don't have to buy you know
a<00:04:58.259> Comcast<00:04:58.830> box<00:04:59.160> or<00:04:59.490> a<00:04:59.630> Verizon<00:05:00.630> you<00:05:00.660> know<00:05:00.870> box

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
a Comcast box or a Verizon you know box

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:03.589 
a Comcast box or a Verizon you know box
to<00:05:02.039> have<00:05:02.190> you<00:05:02.370> know<00:05:02.460> good<00:05:02.610> cable<00:05:02.940> internet<00:05:03.150> and

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:03.599 
to have you know good cable internet and

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:05.749 
to have you know good cable internet and
then<00:05:03.870> a<00:05:03.900> TV<00:05:04.380> and<00:05:04.680> then<00:05:04.889> a<00:05:04.919> computer<00:05:05.280> and<00:05:05.639> then<00:05:05.729> a

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 
then a TV and then a computer and then a

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:07.100 
then a TV and then a computer and then a
computer<00:05:06.030> monitor<00:05:06.300> which<00:05:06.690> people<00:05:06.960> have

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
computer monitor which people have

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
computer monitor which people have
anyway

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
anyway

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.499 
anyway
you<00:05:08.430> know<00:05:08.520> it'd<00:05:08.639> probably<00:05:08.759> just<00:05:08.940> be<00:05:09.120> easier<00:05:09.479> to

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:09.509 
you know it'd probably just be easier to

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:11.089 
you know it'd probably just be easier to
wrap<00:05:09.780> it<00:05:09.900> all<00:05:09.990> up<00:05:10.050> in<00:05:10.259> one<00:05:10.289> and<00:05:10.650> I<00:05:10.710> really<00:05:10.830> think

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099 
wrap it all up in one and I really think

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:12.770 
wrap it all up in one and I really think
the<00:05:11.160> Internet<00:05:11.430> can<00:05:11.520> do<00:05:11.639> that<00:05:11.880> so<00:05:12.180> I<00:05:12.210> say<00:05:12.599> three

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
the Internet can do that so I say three

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.180 
the Internet can do that so I say three
to<00:05:12.870> four<00:05:13.020> years<00:05:13.259> from<00:05:13.380> now<00:05:13.470> you<00:05:13.830> know

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
to four years from now you know

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.439

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
computer monitor and TVs really aren't

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.260
