00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:09.080
 Atletico Madrid defeated 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:12.950
 Valencia with three goals that came in 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:18.010
 the second time much higher the table 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.010
 local in front of the djukic team 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.960
 that stays in the table with only 20 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.090
 points 43 has the athletic one of madrid to 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.029
 just like the barcelona this is a 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:31.039
 first play highlighted a center at 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.689
 Filipe Luis area 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.620
 that ends up clearing the defense of 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:39.140
 valencia a second option for the 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.500
 athletic and there's a forced finish of 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:46.510
 Diego Costa as always protagonist 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.980
 Diego Costa author of two goals 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.130
 failed a penalty 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.410
 we see now an attack of the letter of 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.989
 madrid with a shipment of thiago for diego 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.460
 coast that puts for the first time to test 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.460
 to diego alves 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.500
 let's see now a play of 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.500
 Valencia counterattack 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:16.360
 note that he is asking jonas receives it 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.360
 channels and ends up pulling out 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.250
 and the repetition of the action that culminates 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.570
 channels after a raid of 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.570
 bernat by the band 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.560
 and this is an action in which Villa 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.690
 I hope he gets to finish but the 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.000
 ball is there in the second 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.000
 where is it burning turan that throws out 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.320

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.670
 here takes the ball diego costa with 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.670
 the viz ruiz 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.560

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.150
 first of the night 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.070
 maybe I could have done something else the 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.319
 goalkeeper diego alves let's see the 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.269
 repetition 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.609
 -vallence- unprepared after 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.950
 a play in attack has a lot of field 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:18.140
 Diego Acosta tries to put up with him 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.690
 ruiz 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.280
 but in the end 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:28.450
 the forward of the athletic one of madrid- 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:32.349

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:36.650

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:38.629
 diego costa plus 4 in the champions 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.000

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.319

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:51.069
 to beat again 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:54.040
 to diego alves 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.590
 raul had just entered the field in the 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.329

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.569

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.330
 by víctor ruiz 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.250
 in the reduction of the play 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.250
 there is no doubt 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:34.250

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:37.340
