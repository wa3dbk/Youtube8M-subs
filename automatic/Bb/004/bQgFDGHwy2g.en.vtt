first<00:00:11.190> thing<00:00:11.429> we<00:00:11.519> need<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.670> do<00:00:11.759> is<00:00:11.940> actually

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
first thing we need to do is actually

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.879 
first thing we need to do is actually
remove<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.750> original<00:00:12.870> connector<00:00:13.440> that's<00:00:13.679> on

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.420 
our truck in this case the connector was
damaged<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.170> was<00:00:16.260> no<00:00:16.379> longer<00:00:16.560> usable<00:00:17.130> so<00:00:17.310> we're

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
damaged it was no longer usable so we're

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.980 
damaged it was no longer usable so we're
gonna<00:00:17.520> do<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.760> just<00:00:17.850> basically<00:00:18.180> copy<00:00:18.480> in<00:00:18.720> and

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
gonna do is just basically copy in and

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.019 
gonna do is just basically copy in and
start<00:00:19.230> with<00:00:19.350> fresh<00:00:19.560> wire<00:00:19.830> now<00:00:20.640> before<00:00:20.910> we

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
start with fresh wire now before we

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.310 
start with fresh wire now before we
install<00:00:21.060> our<00:00:21.390> wiring<00:00:21.600> one<00:00:21.960> thing<00:00:22.109> we're<00:00:22.230> going
