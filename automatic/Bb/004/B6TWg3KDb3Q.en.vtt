00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410

through it and um I almost feel like it
didn't<00:02:25.160> feel<00:02:25.489> it<00:02:26.000> didn't<00:02:26.510> feel<00:02:26.720> as<00:02:27.050> soft<00:02:27.349> as<00:02:27.590> I

didn't feel it didn't feel as soft as I
would<00:02:27.890> like<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:28.099> too<00:02:28.459> when<00:02:28.700> I<00:02:28.730> got<00:02:28.970> out<00:02:29.150> of<00:02:29.180> the

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
shower um but I guess when it's working

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.420 
shower um but I guess when it's working
that<00:02:32.959> you<00:02:33.050> can't<00:02:33.319> put<00:02:33.530> all<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.769> things<00:02:34.010> in<00:02:34.250> it

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
that you can't put all the things in it

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.220 
that you can't put all the things in it
that<00:02:34.700> you<00:02:35.030> usually<00:02:35.360> would<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:36.430> um<00:02:37.840> so<00:02:38.840> I<00:02:38.870> liked

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
that you usually would and um so I liked

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.470 
that you usually would and um so I liked
it<00:02:39.410> I<00:02:39.530> do<00:02:39.620> like<00:02:40.010> this<00:02:40.220> part<00:02:40.489> I<00:02:40.700> do<00:02:40.819> like<00:02:41.150> and

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
it I do like this part I do like and

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.120 
it I do like this part I do like and
it's<00:02:41.600> been<00:02:41.750> lasting<00:02:42.110> me<00:02:42.230> forever<00:02:42.650> I<00:02:42.739> didn't

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
it's been lasting me forever I didn't

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.220 
it's been lasting me forever I didn't
think<00:02:43.220> that<00:02:43.430> it<00:02:43.549> would<00:02:43.640> last<00:02:43.850> this<00:02:44.060> long<00:02:44.209> and<00:02:44.780> I

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
think that it would last this long and I

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.140 
think that it would last this long and I
like<00:02:45.410> that<00:02:45.440> it's<00:02:45.709> travel<00:02:46.130> size<00:02:46.340> basically

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
like that it's travel size basically

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.910 
like that it's travel size basically
because<00:02:47.720> it<00:02:47.959> fits<00:02:48.200> in<00:02:48.319> my<00:02:48.410> little<00:02:48.680> steve

that I do not like the cleanser I think

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.280 
that I do not like the cleanser I think
it<00:02:58.819> just<00:02:58.849> didn't<00:02:59.239> work<00:02:59.330> with<00:02:59.510> my<00:02:59.660> skin<00:02:59.989> it's

actually it's really nice it's
hypoallergenic<00:03:02.690> it's<00:03:03.560> um<00:03:03.890> you<00:03:04.880> can<00:03:05.090> smell<00:03:05.420> it

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
hypoallergenic it's um you can smell it

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.199 
hypoallergenic it's um you can smell it
smells<00:03:06.500> just<00:03:06.590> like<00:03:06.830> cucumbers<00:03:07.489> and<00:03:07.819> it's

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
smells just like cucumbers and it's

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.460 
smells just like cucumbers and it's
clear<00:03:08.750> and<00:03:10.209> there's<00:03:11.209> nothing<00:03:11.450> wrong<00:03:11.690> with<00:03:12.049> it

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
clear and there's nothing wrong with it

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.199 
clear and there's nothing wrong with it
I<00:03:12.650> just<00:03:12.829> didn't<00:03:13.130> think<00:03:13.160> that<00:03:13.549> it<00:03:13.730> worked<00:03:14.030> with

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
I just didn't think that it worked with

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.160 
I just didn't think that it worked with
my<00:03:14.329> skin<00:03:14.840> this<00:03:15.680> probably<00:03:16.010> like<00:03:16.790> is<00:03:16.940> it<00:03:17.540> says

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
my skin this probably like is it says

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.380 
my skin this probably like is it says
it's<00:03:18.320> a<00:03:18.410> daily<00:03:18.700> gentle<00:03:19.700> cleanser<00:03:20.090> and

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
it's a daily gentle cleanser and

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.080 
it's a daily gentle cleanser and
obviously<00:03:21.320> the<00:03:21.530> yes<00:03:21.709> to<00:03:21.950> tomatoes<00:03:22.489> are<00:03:22.850> more

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
obviously the yes to tomatoes are more

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.059 
obviously the yes to tomatoes are more
for<00:03:23.600> where<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:24.019> acid<00:03:24.410> comes<00:03:24.620> in<00:03:24.799> and<00:03:24.950> takes

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
for where the acid comes in and takes

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:27.970 
for where the acid comes in and takes
care<00:03:25.220> of<00:03:25.400> your<00:03:25.609> acting<00:03:25.940> stuff<00:03:26.150> but<00:03:26.870> this<00:03:27.049> I<00:03:27.290> was

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
care of your acting stuff but this I was

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.349 
care of your acting stuff but this I was
thinking<00:03:28.430> it<00:03:28.549> would<00:03:28.640> take<00:03:28.819> care<00:03:29.000> of<00:03:29.090> my<00:03:29.180> acne

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
thinking it would take care of my acne

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.330 
thinking it would take care of my acne
but<00:03:30.019> I<00:03:30.079> think<00:03:30.319> it<00:03:30.440> just<00:03:30.470> made<00:03:30.890> it<00:03:30.920> kind<00:03:31.190> of

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
but I think it just made it kind of

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.970 
but I think it just made it kind of
worse<00:03:31.700> because<00:03:32.510> I<00:03:32.569> didn't<00:03:33.140> take<00:03:33.530> care<00:03:33.769> of<00:03:33.859> it

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
worse because I didn't take care of it

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.430 
worse because I didn't take care of it
was<00:03:34.190> just<00:03:34.340> kind<00:03:34.519> of<00:03:34.579> there<00:03:34.640> um<00:03:35.139> this<00:03:36.139> probably

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
was just kind of there um this probably

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.270 
was just kind of there um this probably
would<00:03:36.859> go<00:03:37.010> very<00:03:37.250> well<00:03:37.370> with<00:03:37.609> if<00:03:38.150> you<00:03:38.389> did<00:03:38.660> um

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
would go very well with if you did um

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.020 
would go very well with if you did um
face<00:03:40.280> masks<00:03:40.940> and<00:03:41.120> let<00:03:41.690> them<00:03:41.900> sit<00:03:42.609> longer<00:03:43.609> than

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
face masks and let them sit longer than

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.059 
face masks and let them sit longer than
they<00:03:44.120> needed<00:03:44.329> to<00:03:44.450> and<00:03:44.930> then<00:03:45.019> wash<00:03:45.410> it<00:03:45.440> off<00:03:45.739> and

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
they needed to and then wash it off and

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:47.740 
they needed to and then wash it off and
then<00:03:46.100> apply<00:03:46.700> this<00:03:46.760> just<00:03:47.269> because<00:03:47.569> it's

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
then apply this just because it's

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.440 
then apply this just because it's
cucumbers<00:03:48.380> and<00:03:48.410> soothing<00:03:49.040> so<00:03:49.790> with<00:03:50.269> that

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
cucumbers and soothing so with that
