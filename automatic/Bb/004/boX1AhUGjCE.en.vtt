the<00:02:11.730> cocoa<00:02:12.090> beans<00:02:12.300> so<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.200> appears<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:13.590> we

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
the cocoa beans so it appears that we

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.800 
the cocoa beans so it appears that we
can<00:02:13.950> now<00:02:14.100> farm<00:02:14.520> cocoa<00:02:15.000> beans<00:02:15.270> which<00:02:15.540> is<00:02:15.660> pretty

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
can now farm cocoa beans which is pretty

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.200 
can now farm cocoa beans which is pretty
cool<00:02:16.110> I'm<00:02:16.380> surprised<00:02:17.250> it<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.580> add<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:18.000> in

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
cool I'm surprised it and add that in

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.850 
cool I'm surprised it and add that in
the<00:02:19.140> one<00:02:19.710> and<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.010> 0.8<00:02:21.000> update<00:02:21.540> I<00:02:21.810> guess<00:02:22.740> I

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
the one and the 0.8 update I guess I

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.350 
the one and the 0.8 update I guess I
just<00:02:22.890> didn't<00:02:23.280> have<00:02:23.430> time<00:02:23.640> for<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:24.000> but<00:02:24.270> it

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
just didn't have time for that but it

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.060 
just didn't have time for that but it
looks<00:02:24.540> like<00:02:24.600> we<00:02:24.810> can<00:02:24.960> farm<00:02:25.230> cocoa<00:02:25.620> beans<00:02:25.800> and

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
looks like we can farm cocoa beans and

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.340 
looks like we can farm cocoa beans and
there's<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.280> lot<00:02:26.580> of<00:02:26.610> new<00:02:26.880> blocks<00:02:27.350> pretty

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
there's a lot of new blocks pretty

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.100 
there's a lot of new blocks pretty
useful<00:02:28.560> for<00:02:28.950> building<00:02:28.980> in<00:02:29.690> this<00:02:30.690> next<00:02:30.930> tweet

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110

johann<00:02:31.440> says<00:02:31.650> he's<00:02:31.980> working<00:02:32.370> on<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.460> new

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
johann says he's working on the new

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.760 
johann says he's working on the new
world<00:02:32.970> generator<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:34.080> feature<00:02:34.530> that

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
world generator and the feature that

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.980 
world generator and the feature that
he's<00:02:34.920> added<00:02:35.280> here<00:02:35.520> isn't<00:02:35.880> really<00:02:36.150> too

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
he's added here isn't really too

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.800 
he's added here isn't really too
important<00:02:37.830> but<00:02:38.310> it's<00:02:38.460> still<00:02:38.700> pretty<00:02:38.970> cool<00:02:39.240> he

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
important but it's still pretty cool he

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.660 
important but it's still pretty cool he
added<00:02:40.050> pumpkins<00:02:40.710> that<00:02:41.220> are<00:02:41.370> allowed<00:02:41.640> to

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
added pumpkins that are allowed to

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.550 
added pumpkins that are allowed to
naturally<00:02:42.360> generate<00:02:42.810> so<00:02:43.020> it's<00:02:43.170> not<00:02:43.260> like<00:02:43.470> you

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
naturally generate so it's not like you

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.040 
naturally generate so it's not like you
now<00:02:43.710> have<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.070> go<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.640> nether<00:02:45.270> reactor<00:02:45.570> in

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
now have to go to the nether reactor in

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.900 
now have to go to the nether reactor in
order<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.350> get<00:02:46.500> pumpkins<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.520> can<00:02:47.700> walk

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
order to get pumpkins you can walk

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.810 
order to get pumpkins you can walk
around<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.450> world<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.870> try<00:02:49.080> finding<00:02:49.500> them<00:02:49.820> so

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
around the world and try finding them so

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.540 
around the world and try finding them so
I<00:02:50.850> guess<00:02:51.090> that's<00:02:51.330> pretty<00:02:51.480> useful<00:02:52.250> this<00:02:53.250> next

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
I guess that's pretty useful this next

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.240 
I guess that's pretty useful this next

person asks if Savannah biomes were
added<00:02:58.740> and<00:02:58.920> if<00:02:59.550> you<00:02:59.670> change<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.330> top<00:03:00.630> log

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
added and if you change the top log

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.920 
added and if you change the top log
texture<00:03:01.620> so<00:03:02.160> it's<00:03:02.310> like<00:03:02.490> it<00:03:02.640> in<00:03:02.760> pc<00:03:03.270> and<00:03:03.480> johann

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
texture so it's like it in pc and johann

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.320 
texture so it's like it in pc and johann
says<00:03:04.140> yes<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:04.650> both<00:03:04.770> of<00:03:05.010> them<00:03:05.130> so<00:03:05.730> Savannah

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
says yes to both of them so Savannah

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.960 
says yes to both of them so Savannah
biomes<00:03:06.690> are<00:03:06.780> now<00:03:06.900> confirmed<00:03:07.380> and<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:08.310> log

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
biomes are now confirmed and the log

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.180 
biomes are now confirmed and the log
texture<00:03:09.540> has<00:03:09.750> been<00:03:09.990> changed<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.740> last<00:03:10.890> week

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
texture has been changed the last week

texture has been changed the last week
for<00:03:11.340> this<00:03:11.430> video<00:03:11.730> is<00:03:11.940> another<00:03:12.210> question<00:03:12.600> for

Johann in this person asks if he can

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.610 
Johann in this person asks if he can
list<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.850> few<00:03:15.060> of<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.270> things<00:03:15.450> added<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:16.080> 0.9

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
list a few of the things added to 0.9

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.070 
list a few of the things added to 0.9
update<00:03:17.070> and<00:03:17.250> you<00:03:18.120> wants<00:03:18.420> to<00:03:18.510> see<00:03:18.630> doesn't<00:03:18.959> have

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
update and you wants to see doesn't have

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.949 
update and you wants to see doesn't have
a<00:03:19.110> complete<00:03:19.560> list<00:03:19.590> but<00:03:20.489> one<00:03:21.300> of<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.510> things<00:03:21.540> is

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
a complete list but one of the things is

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.050 
a complete list but one of the things is
infinite<00:03:22.470> walls<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:22.890> another<00:03:23.100> one<00:03:23.310> is<00:03:23.489> 50

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
infinite walls and another one is 50

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.080 
infinite walls and another one is 50
plus<00:03:24.360> new<00:03:24.690> biomes<00:03:25.140> so<00:03:25.890> 50<00:03:26.280> plus<00:03:26.489> new<00:03:26.670> biomes<00:03:26.970> is

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
plus new biomes so 50 plus new biomes is

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.120 
plus new biomes so 50 plus new biomes is
pretty<00:03:27.420> cool<00:03:27.630> I<00:03:27.900> didn't<00:03:28.500> expect<00:03:28.560> there<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.010> be

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
pretty cool I didn't expect there to be

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.280 
pretty cool I didn't expect there to be
that<00:03:29.400> many<00:03:29.610> new<00:03:29.790> biomes<00:03:30.180> but<00:03:30.360> I<00:03:30.390> guess<00:03:30.660> with

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
that many new biomes but I guess with

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.570 
that many new biomes but I guess with
1.7<00:03:32.250> they<00:03:32.640> did<00:03:32.880> add<00:03:33.090> a<00:03:33.150> lot<00:03:33.600> of<00:03:33.840> new<00:03:34.800> biomes<00:03:35.280> to

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
1.7 they did add a lot of new biomes to

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.340 
1.7 they did add a lot of new biomes to
the<00:03:35.820> PC<00:03:36.239> update<00:03:36.600> and<00:03:36.780> those<00:03:36.870> are<00:03:37.050> all<00:03:37.170> being

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
the PC update and those are all being

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.490 
the PC update and those are all being
added<00:03:37.739> to<00:03:37.830> pocket<00:03:38.190> edition<00:03:38.600> so<00:03:39.600> there's<00:03:40.320> also

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
added to pocket edition so there's also

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.930 
added to pocket edition so there's also
different<00:03:40.739> variations<00:03:41.459> of<00:03:41.580> them<00:03:41.760> which

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
different variations of them which

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.780 
different variations of them which
explains<00:03:42.420> why<00:03:42.630> there's<00:03:42.900> 50<00:03:43.260> plus<00:03:43.500> biomes<00:03:44.010> but

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
explains why there's 50 plus biomes but

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.520 
explains why there's 50 plus biomes but
that's<00:03:45.330> pretty<00:03:45.630> cool<00:03:45.900> that<00:03:46.110> they're<00:03:46.200> adding

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
that's pretty cool that they're adding
