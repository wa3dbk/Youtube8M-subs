00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
but still he's doing a great job and

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.680 
but still he's doing a great job and
possibly<00:02:24.440> one<00:02:24.650> of<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.770> best<00:02:24.830> players<00:02:25.220> of<00:02:25.690> the

possibly one of the best players of the
game<00:02:26.720> right<00:02:27.200> now

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
game right now

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.950 
game right now
and<00:02:28.340> that's<00:02:28.610> just<00:02:28.700> because<00:02:28.910> he's<00:02:29.270> finding

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
and that's just because he's finding

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.070 
and that's just because he's finding
trends<00:02:30.440> to<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:31.700> analyzing<00:02:32.390> them<00:02:32.540> and<00:02:32.750> seeing

the<00:02:33.680> way<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:34.070> game<00:02:34.220> works<00:02:34.460> in<00:02:34.730> his<00:02:34.880> best

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
the way the game works in his best

the way the game works in his best
matchups<00:02:35.570> or<00:02:35.660> what<00:02:35.840> have<00:02:35.990> you<00:02:36.020> what<00:02:36.950> does<00:02:37.040> that

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
matchups or what have you what does that

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.200 
matchups or what have you what does that
really<00:02:37.400> mean<00:02:37.520> for<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.060> game<00:02:38.270> though<00:02:40.210> what

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
really mean for the game though what

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.970 
really mean for the game though what
does<00:02:41.300> that<00:02:41.330> mean<00:02:41.600> that<00:02:41.840> means<00:02:42.110> that<00:02:42.530> this<00:02:42.740> game

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
does that mean that means that this game

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.830 
does that mean that means that this game
can<00:02:43.220> be<00:02:43.250> studied<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:43.910> there<00:02:44.150> is<00:02:44.270> a<00:02:44.300> method<00:02:44.540> to

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
can be studied and there is a method to

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.900 
can be studied and there is a method to
it<00:02:45.020> now<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.440> issue<00:02:45.650> for<00:02:46.010> me<00:02:46.160> is<00:02:46.340> right<00:02:46.790> now

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
it now the issue for me is right now

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.030 
it now the issue for me is right now
there's<00:02:47.210> a<00:02:47.450> new<00:02:47.660> trend<00:02:47.870> setting<00:02:48.260> up<00:02:48.410> that

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
there's a new trend setting up that

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.610 
there's a new trend setting up that
basically<00:02:49.610> says<00:02:50.120> that<00:02:50.150> luck<00:02:50.810> is<00:02:50.840> way<00:02:51.410> more

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
basically says that luck is way more

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.930 
basically says that luck is way more
important<00:02:51.950> than<00:02:52.010> it<00:02:52.130> has<00:02:52.280> been<00:02:52.310> i<00:02:52.640> would<00:02:52.760> say

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
important than it has been i would say

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.880 
important than it has been i would say
luck<00:02:53.540> is<00:02:53.690> probably<00:02:54.080> forty<00:02:54.440> percent<00:02:54.710> of<00:02:54.830> the

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
luck is probably forty percent of the

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.390 
luck is probably forty percent of the
game<00:02:55.070> right<00:02:55.250> now<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:56.320> no<00:02:57.320> that's<00:02:57.890> a<00:02:58.130> little

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
game right now and no that's a little

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.710 
game right now and no that's a little
high<00:02:58.520> 35<00:02:59.060> 35<00:02:59.510> 30<00:03:00.140> something<00:03:00.709> like<00:03:00.830> that<00:03:01.720> but

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
high 35 35 30 something like that but

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.480 
high 35 35 30 something like that but
still<00:03:03.020> it's<00:03:03.320> it's<00:03:03.560> a<00:03:03.680> lot<00:03:03.860> of<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.040> game<00:03:04.250> more

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
still it's it's a lot of the game more

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.190 
still it's it's a lot of the game more
so<00:03:04.670> than<00:03:04.790> it<00:03:04.910> has<00:03:05.090> been<00:03:05.120> in<00:03:05.360> recent<00:03:05.660> years<00:03:05.840> i

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
so than it has been in recent years i

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.449 
so than it has been in recent years i
would<00:03:06.290> say<00:03:06.410> in<00:03:06.500> recent<00:03:06.800> years<00:03:06.830> has<00:03:07.100> been<00:03:07.250> only

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
would say in recent years has been only

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.390 
would say in recent years has been only
about<00:03:07.670> twenty<00:03:08.060> twenty-five<00:03:08.990> percent<00:03:09.200> max<00:03:10.040> and

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
about twenty twenty-five percent max and

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.770 
about twenty twenty-five percent max and
even<00:03:11.390> that<00:03:11.600> is<00:03:11.630> pretty<00:03:12.080> high<00:03:13.090> and<00:03:14.090> i'm<00:03:14.630> just

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
even that is pretty high and i'm just

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.260 
even that is pretty high and i'm just
saying<00:03:15.050> that<00:03:15.230> because<00:03:15.380> more<00:03:16.220> and<00:03:16.250> more<00:03:16.459> is<00:03:16.880> it

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
saying that because more and more is it

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.480 
saying that because more and more is it
important<00:03:17.690> that<00:03:17.720> you<00:03:17.870> draw<00:03:18.220> rabbit<00:03:19.220> first

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
important that you draw rabbit first

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:20.740 
important that you draw rabbit first
term<00:03:19.700> more<00:03:19.940> and<00:03:20.060> more<00:03:20.150> as<00:03:20.240> important<00:03:20.600> that<00:03:20.690> you

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
term more and more as important that you

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.480 
term more and more as important that you
get<00:03:20.900> your<00:03:20.959> dragonfly<00:03:21.680> when<00:03:21.980> you<00:03:22.070> need<00:03:22.220> to<00:03:22.250> you

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
get your dragonfly when you need to you

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.430 
get your dragonfly when you need to you
top<00:03:22.700> deck<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.060> dragonfly<00:03:23.540> without<00:03:24.140> having<00:03:24.350> to

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
top deck the dragonfly without having to

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.290 
top deck the dragonfly without having to
do<00:03:24.560> anything<00:03:24.770> more<00:03:25.340> and<00:03:25.490> more<00:03:25.640> as<00:03:25.760> tour<00:03:26.060> guide

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
do anything more and more as tour guide

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.440 
do anything more and more as tour guide
getting<00:03:26.780> better<00:03:26.959> and<00:03:27.080> better<00:03:27.490> as<00:03:28.490> just

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
getting better and better as just

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.940 
getting better and better as just
another<00:03:29.600> bait<00:03:30.440> pretty<00:03:30.950> much<00:03:31.930> things<00:03:32.930> that<00:03:33.920> are

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
another bait pretty much things that are

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.040 
another bait pretty much things that are
happening<00:03:34.190> because<00:03:34.910> there's<00:03:35.630> not<00:03:35.780> enough

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
happening because there's not enough

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.590 
happening because there's not enough
thalers<00:03:36.470> does<00:03:36.680> not<00:03:36.890> enough<00:03:37.160> mechanics<00:03:37.850> to

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
thalers does not enough mechanics to

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.330 
thalers does not enough mechanics to
protect<00:03:38.959> yourselves<00:03:39.320> and<00:03:39.530> then<00:03:40.100> there<00:03:40.310> are

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
protect yourselves and then there are

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.250 
protect yourselves and then there are
times<00:03:40.459> where<00:03:41.090> you<00:03:41.150> draw<00:03:41.450> only<00:03:41.690> protection

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
times where you draw only protection

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.840 
times where you draw only protection
because<00:03:42.890> you<00:03:43.100> have<00:03:43.220> to<00:03:43.370> run<00:03:43.519> so<00:03:43.730> much

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
because you have to run so much

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.180 
because you have to run so much
protection<00:03:44.239> and<00:03:44.600> then<00:03:45.530> you<00:03:45.650> don't<00:03:45.830> have<00:03:45.980> any

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
protection and then you don't have any

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.400 
protection and then you don't have any
ways<00:03:46.550> to<00:03:46.730> make<00:03:46.880> place<00:03:47.090> and<00:03:47.450> that's<00:03:48.080> just<00:03:48.260> the

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
ways to make place and that's just the

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.990 
ways to make place and that's just the
way<00:03:48.500> the<00:03:48.650> game<00:03:48.680> is<00:03:48.860> going<00:03:49.130> right<00:03:49.370> now<00:03:49.550> it's<00:03:49.820> not

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
way the game is going right now it's not

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.960 
way the game is going right now it's not
a<00:03:50.030> very<00:03:50.269> good<00:03:50.450> meta<00:03:51.410> there's<00:03:52.040> too<00:03:52.310> much<00:03:52.489> built

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
a very good meta there's too much built

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.280 
a very good meta there's too much built
on<00:03:53.209> negative<00:03:54.200> player<00:03:54.519> playing<00:03:55.519> experiences

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
on negative player playing experiences

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.310 
on negative player playing experiences
and<00:03:58.180> less<00:03:59.180> and<00:03:59.420> less<00:03:59.510> is<00:03:59.720> built<00:03:59.930> off<00:04:00.080> of<00:04:00.140> other

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
and less and less is built off of other

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.920 
and less and less is built off of other
ideas<00:04:00.709> but<00:04:01.370> even<00:04:01.640> then<00:04:01.820> like<00:04:02.390> the<00:04:02.570> game<00:04:02.750> is

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
ideas but even then like the game is

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.140 
ideas but even then like the game is
still<00:04:03.019> lots<00:04:03.980> and<00:04:04.160> lots<00:04:04.310> of<00:04:04.400> fun<00:04:04.549> and<00:04:04.790> I<00:04:04.910> love

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
still lots and lots of fun and I love
