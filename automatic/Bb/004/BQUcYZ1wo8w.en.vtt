00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.980 
player I don't think he's worth the
money<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.530> he<00:01:43.560> got<00:01:44.119> he<00:01:45.119> doesn't<00:01:45.450> show<00:01:45.750> up<00:01:45.780> a

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
money that he got he doesn't show up a

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.389 
money that he got he doesn't show up a
lot<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.350> playoffs<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.040> things<00:01:47.189> like<00:01:47.340> that

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
lot in the playoffs and things like that

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.179 
lot in the playoffs and things like that
but<00:01:47.820> market<00:01:48.360> value<00:01:48.689> right<00:01:48.899> now<00:01:49.110> they<00:01:49.799> had<00:01:50.040> to

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
but market value right now they had to

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.740 
but market value right now they had to
sign<00:01:50.399> him<00:01:50.549> for<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.790> because<00:01:51.090> if<00:01:51.299> they<00:01:51.390> didn't

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
sign him for that because if they didn't

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.929 
sign him for that because if they didn't
they<00:01:52.710> would<00:01:52.829> have<00:01:52.920> lost<00:01:53.040> him<00:01:53.280> because

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
they would have lost him because

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.940 
they would have lost him because
remember<00:01:54.149> when<00:01:54.390> he<00:01:54.509> was<00:01:54.630> left<00:01:54.960> Atlanta<00:01:55.590> he<00:01:55.829> was

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
remember when he was left Atlanta he was

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.889 
remember when he was left Atlanta he was
getting<00:01:56.159> booed<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.700> stuff<00:01:56.909> like<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.149> as<00:01:57.659> far

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
getting booed and stuff like that as far

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.350 
getting booed and stuff like that as far
as<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.110> last<00:01:58.520> games<00:01:59.520> in<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.759> playoffs<00:01:59.880> they

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
as the last games in the playoffs they

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.480 
as the last games in the playoffs they
were<00:02:00.450> getting<00:02:00.630> booed<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.170> know<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.130> he<00:02:02.369> was

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
were getting booed you know so he was

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.969 
were getting booed you know so he was
very<00:02:02.549> upset<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.270> if<00:02:04.259> they<00:02:04.500> didn't<00:02:04.770> give<00:02:04.890> him

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
very upset and if they didn't give him

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.679 
very upset and if they didn't give him
the<00:02:05.009> max<00:02:05.250> contract<00:02:05.790> Joe<00:02:06.119> Johnson<00:02:06.299> would've

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
the max contract Joe Johnson would've

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.330 
the max contract Joe Johnson would've
left<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.020> think<00:02:07.079> Atlanta<00:02:07.530> did<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.890> good

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
left so I think Atlanta did it a good

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.680 
left so I think Atlanta did it a good
thing<00:02:08.399> doing<00:02:08.879> that<00:02:09.000> because<00:02:09.179> they<00:02:09.479> couldn't

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
thing doing that because they couldn't

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.170 
thing doing that because they couldn't
they<00:02:10.560> wouldn't<00:02:10.890> got<00:02:11.009> another<00:02:11.250> max<00:02:11.520> guy<00:02:11.730> now

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
they wouldn't got another max guy now

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.700 
they wouldn't got another max guy now
