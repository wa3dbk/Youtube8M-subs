to be very very volatile over the next

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.109 
to be very very volatile over the next
two<00:01:27.780> or<00:01:27.810> three<00:01:27.929> weeks<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:29.399> know<00:01:29.880> i<00:01:30.000> can't

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
two or three weeks so you know i can't

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.999 
two or three weeks so you know i can't
as<00:01:30.659> i<00:01:30.810> said<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.140> morning<00:01:31.409> it's<00:01:31.560> difficult<00:01:31.859> to

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
as i said this morning it's difficult to

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.359 
as i said this morning it's difficult to
discern<00:01:32.310> whether<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:32.999> a<00:01:33.030> new<00:01:33.270> trend<00:01:34.369> you

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
discern whether this is a new trend you

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.310 
discern whether this is a new trend you
know<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.490> think<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.909> macro<00:01:36.329> trend<00:01:36.689> for<00:01:37.049> next

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
know I think the macro trend for next

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.200 
know I think the macro trend for next
year<00:01:37.499> we'll<00:01:37.710> we'll<00:01:38.249> probably<00:01:38.460> still<00:01:38.909> create

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
year we'll we'll probably still create

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.480 
year we'll we'll probably still create
headwinds<00:01:39.630> for<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.869> metals<00:01:40.189> but<00:01:41.189> short-term

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
headwinds for the metals but short-term

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.609 
headwinds for the metals but short-term
I<00:01:41.670> think<00:01:42.149> there's<00:01:42.359> potentially<00:01:43.289> some<00:01:43.320> more

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
I think there's potentially some more

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.529 
I think there's potentially some more
lift<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.100> Peter<00:01:44.429> offline<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.240> were<00:01:45.299> telling

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
lift and Peter offline you were telling

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:46.609 
lift and Peter offline you were telling
me<00:01:45.600> something<00:01:45.899> interesting<00:01:46.049> you're<00:01:46.409> saying

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
me something interesting you're saying

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.080 
me something interesting you're saying
that<00:01:46.679> since<00:01:46.979> gold<00:01:47.219> and<00:01:47.399> platinum<00:01:47.579> are<00:01:47.789> trading

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
that since gold and platinum are trading

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.209 
that since gold and platinum are trading
so<00:01:48.240> closely<00:01:48.539> right<00:01:48.840> now<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.590> investors

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:50.219 
so closely right now that investors

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:51.770 
so closely right now that investors
could<00:01:50.429> potentially<00:01:50.909> use<00:01:50.939> these<00:01:51.299> metals<00:01:51.600> as<00:01:51.749> a

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
could potentially use these metals as a

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.559 
could potentially use these metals as a
tax<00:01:52.170> law<00:01:52.590> strategy<00:01:53.100> mm-hmm<00:01:53.609> I<00:01:53.789> mean<00:01:54.450> that's

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:54.569 
tax law strategy mm-hmm I mean that's

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:55.669 
tax law strategy mm-hmm I mean that's
something<00:01:54.929> you<00:01:55.020> want<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.259> speak<00:01:55.469> to<00:01:55.590> your

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
something you want to speak to your

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.219 
something you want to speak to your
accountant<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.909> find<00:01:57.539> out<00:01:57.659> what<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.899> exact

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
accountant and find out what the exact

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.069 
accountant and find out what the exact
rules<00:01:58.439> are<00:01:58.740> but<00:01:58.979> generally<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.639> rule<00:01:59.789> is<00:02:00.079> if

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
rules are but generally the rule is if

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.410 
rules are but generally the rule is if
you<00:02:01.289> sell<00:02:01.560> an<00:02:01.740> investment<00:02:02.340> from<00:02:02.819> a<00:02:02.969> tax<00:02:03.179> loss

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
you sell an investment from a tax loss

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.599 
you sell an investment from a tax loss
perspective<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.259> can't<00:02:04.499> re-enter<00:02:04.679> that<00:02:05.219> same

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:05.609 
perspective you can't re-enter that same

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:09.169 
perspective you can't re-enter that same
investment<00:02:06.179> for<00:02:06.929> 30<00:02:07.200> days<00:02:07.490> and<00:02:08.490> that<00:02:09.060> would

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
investment for 30 days and that would

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.730 
investment for 30 days and that would
allow<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.690> tax<00:02:09.929> laws<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.500> know

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
allow you the tax laws so you know

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.350 
allow you the tax laws so you know

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.830 
the market you know a good strategy for
that<00:02:26.280> would<00:02:26.459> be<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.730> consider<00:02:27.120> selling<00:02:27.420> gold

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
that would be to consider selling gold

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.170 
that would be to consider selling gold
and<00:02:28.110> buying<00:02:28.620> platinum<00:02:29.159> platinum<00:02:29.849> zone

gold<00:02:41.430> so<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.060> could<00:02:42.239> sell<00:02:42.480> your<00:02:42.629> goal<00:02:42.840> take

your tax loss by platinum so you're

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.809

still in the market wait the 30 days and
then<00:02:47.879> reverse<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.780> trade<00:02:49.049> so<00:02:49.769> you<00:02:49.829> still<00:02:50.129> have

same<00:03:14.670> apply<00:03:14.909> for<00:03:15.120> silver<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.689> gold<00:03:15.870> it<00:03:16.109> is

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
same apply for silver and gold it is

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.220 
same apply for silver and gold it is
it's<00:03:16.500> just<00:03:16.650> a<00:03:16.769> little<00:03:16.920> bit<00:03:17.129> more<00:03:17.280> risky

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
it's just a little bit more risky

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.720 
it's just a little bit more risky
currently<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.439> you<00:03:19.920> know<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.159> racial<00:03:20.489> still

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
currently the you know the racial still

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.720 
currently the you know the racial still
trading<00:03:21.000> around<00:03:21.150> 70<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:21.840> 72<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.799> one<00:03:22.980> so<00:03:23.250> it's

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
trading around 70 to 72 to one so it's

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.420 
trading around 70 to 72 to one so it's
worth<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.540> risk<00:03:24.569> in<00:03:25.079> my<00:03:25.349> opinion<00:03:25.650> so<00:03:26.310> if

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
worth the risk in my opinion so if

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.430 
worth the risk in my opinion so if
you're<00:03:26.549> holding<00:03:26.970> silver<00:03:27.419> at<00:03:27.569> a<00:03:27.599> significant

they've saved now at the gas pumps so I

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.150 
they've saved now at the gas pumps so I

think retail sales coming in through the

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.520 
think retail sales coming in through the
balance<00:05:41.520> of<00:05:41.610> the<00:05:41.730> year<00:05:41.880> should<00:05:42.060> be<00:05:42.270> more<00:05:42.690> to

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
balance of the year should be more to

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.350 
balance of the year should be more to
the<00:05:43.620> upside<00:05:43.950> on<00:05:44.190> a<00:05:44.250> surprise<00:05:44.490> basis<00:05:45.150> than

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
the upside on a surprise basis than

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.510 
the upside on a surprise basis than
disappointing<00:05:46.260> well<00:05:46.590> I<00:05:46.620> think<00:05:46.950> we<00:05:47.040> can<00:05:47.130> expect

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520
