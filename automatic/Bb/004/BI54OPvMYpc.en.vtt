but i'm going to show you what I did

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.820 
but i'm going to show you what I did
because<00:00:12.509> as<00:00:12.809> you<00:00:12.900> can<00:00:12.960> see<00:00:13.049> /<00:00:13.380> hear<00:00:13.410> what<00:00:13.740> you

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
because as you can see / hear what you

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:14.959 
because as you can see / hear what you
got<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:13.980> do<00:00:14.160> is<00:00:14.280> you<00:00:14.340> need<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.519> make<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.759> actual

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
got to do is you need to make the actual

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.380 
got to do is you need to make the actual
physical<00:00:15.540> space<00:00:15.839> where<00:00:16.789> your<00:00:17.789> doors<00:00:18.119> are

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
physical space where your doors are

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.109 
physical space where your doors are
going<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.720> be<00:00:18.930> because<00:00:19.369> when<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.460> use<00:00:20.789> poly

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
going to be because when you use poly

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.029 
going to be because when you use poly
objects<00:00:21.570> it's<00:00:21.810> not<00:00:22.020> like<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.260> direct<00:00:22.560> action

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
objects it's not like a direct action

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.210 
objects it's not like a direct action
like<00:00:23.189> normal<00:00:23.640> doing<00:00:23.850> two<00:00:23.970> functions<00:00:24.420> so<00:00:25.220> you

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
like normal doing two functions so you

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.250 
like normal doing two functions so you
can<00:00:26.340> see<00:00:26.519> here<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:27.119> know<00:00:27.150> I've<00:00:27.359> just<00:00:27.390> got<00:00:27.750> some

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
can see here you know I've just got some

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.269 
can see here you know I've just got some
some<00:00:28.619> basic<00:00:29.039> fucking<00:00:30.920> texturing<00:00:31.920> going<00:00:32.160> on

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
some basic fucking texturing going on

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.370 
some basic fucking texturing going on
i'm<00:00:32.430> going<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.640> switch<00:00:32.759> these<00:00:33.140> it<00:00:34.140> looks

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
i'm going to switch these it looks

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.680 
i'm going to switch these it looks
better<00:00:35.360> but<00:00:36.360> um<00:00:37.640> so<00:00:38.640> I've<00:00:38.820> created<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.480> doors

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
better but um so I've created the doors

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.440 
better but um so I've created the doors
themselves<00:00:40.250> ok<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.489> they<00:00:42.030> just<00:00:42.239> need<00:00:42.420> to

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
themselves ok and they just need to

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.630 
themselves ok and they just need to
exist<00:00:42.870> somewhere<00:00:43.320> outside<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.219> map<00:00:44.370> area

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
exist somewhere outside of the map area

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.869 
exist somewhere outside of the map area
ok<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.690> then<00:00:46.100> you<00:00:47.100> can<00:00:47.219> see<00:00:47.399> over<00:00:47.579> here<00:00:47.610> I've

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
ok and then you can see over here I've

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.209 
ok and then you can see over here I've
got<00:00:47.940> two<00:00:48.329> separate<00:00:48.809> sectors<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.890> are<00:00:49.950> the

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
got two separate sectors that are the

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.209 
got two separate sectors that are the
same<00:00:50.430> size<00:00:50.489> as<00:00:50.940> my<00:00:51.059> doors<00:00:51.590> which<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.980> also

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
same size as my doors which is also

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.260 
same size as my doors which is also
necessary<00:00:53.660> so<00:00:54.660> I've<00:00:55.020> got<00:00:55.320> those<00:00:55.559> here

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.990 

now<00:00:59.930> we<00:00:59.990> need<00:01:00.230> to<00:01:00.470> put<00:01:00.590> some<00:01:00.950> things<00:01:01.220> in<00:01:01.490> so

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
now we need to put some things in so

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.720 
now we need to put some things in so
this<00:01:02.900> is<00:01:03.050> an<00:01:03.200> anchor<00:01:03.560> point<00:01:03.590> which<00:01:04.250> means<00:01:04.520> you

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730 
this is an anchor point which means you

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.210 
this is an anchor point which means you
know<00:01:04.879> it's<00:01:05.089> gonna<00:01:05.320> this<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:06.620> left<00:01:06.830> side<00:01:07.010> poly

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
know it's gonna this the left side poly

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.650 
know it's gonna this the left side poly
object<00:01:07.400> is<00:01:07.730> going<00:01:07.910> to<00:01:07.970> anchor<00:01:08.060> the<00:01:08.210> door<00:01:08.390> here

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:08.660 
object is going to anchor the door here

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.540 
object is going to anchor the door here
so<00:01:08.840> it<00:01:08.960> closes<00:01:09.380> this<00:01:09.920> is<00:01:10.100> going<00:01:10.250> to<00:01:10.340> anchor<00:01:10.430> it

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
so it closes this is going to anchor it

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.990 
so it closes this is going to anchor it
there<00:01:11.050> and<00:01:12.050> then<00:01:12.110> this<00:01:12.470> is<00:01:12.770> our<00:01:13.100> poly<00:01:13.790> object

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
there and then this is our poly object

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.640 
there and then this is our poly object
start<00:01:14.510> spot<00:01:14.780> and<00:01:15.050> I<00:01:15.979> just<00:01:16.190> set<00:01:16.850> my<00:01:17.060> grid<00:01:17.380> 28<00:01:18.380> I

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
start spot and I just set my grid 28 I

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.560 
start spot and I just set my grid 28 I
believe<00:01:18.920> yet<00:01:19.250> and<00:01:19.520> just<00:01:19.550> make<00:01:20.150> sure<00:01:20.270> I<00:01:20.330> put<00:01:20.360> a

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
believe yet and just make sure I put a

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:21.940 
believe yet and just make sure I put a
dead<00:01:20.780> center<00:01:21.080> in<00:01:21.110> there<00:01:21.380> cuz<00:01:21.590> I<00:01:21.650> didn't<00:01:21.830> want

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
dead center in there cuz I didn't want

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.230 
dead center in there cuz I didn't want
to<00:01:22.040> have<00:01:22.340> any<00:01:22.520> fuck-ups<00:01:24.850> all<00:01:25.850> right<00:01:25.940> and<00:01:26.150> then

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
to have any fuck-ups all right and then

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.120 
to have any fuck-ups all right and then
this<00:01:26.979> is<00:01:28.090> our<00:01:29.090> poly<00:01:29.300> object<00:01:29.510> start<00:01:30.020> line<00:01:31.420> its

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
this is our poly object start line its

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.630 
this is our poly object start line its
action<00:01:34.130> number<00:01:34.369> one<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:35.440> I<00:01:36.440> assign<00:01:36.770> this<00:01:37.070> poly

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
action number one and I assign this poly

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.670 
action number one and I assign this poly
object<00:01:37.850> number<00:01:38.180> one<00:01:38.540> and<00:01:38.810> it<00:01:39.110> mirrors<00:01:39.320> poly

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
object number one and it mirrors poly

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.030 
object number one and it mirrors poly
object<00:01:39.860> number<00:01:40.160> two<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:40.790> this<00:01:40.820> one<00:01:41.660> is<00:01:42.040> poly

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
object number two and this one is poly

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.499 
object number two and this one is poly
object<00:01:43.190> number<00:01:43.490> two<00:01:43.729> that<00:01:43.970> mirrors<00:01:44.270> poly

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
object number two that mirrors poly

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.540 
object number two that mirrors poly
object<00:01:44.660> number<00:01:44.990> one<00:01:45.290> so<00:01:45.560> it's<00:01:45.770> not<00:01:46.250> difficult

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
object number one so it's not difficult

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.270 
object number one so it's not difficult
to<00:01:46.850> do<00:01:47.090> or<00:01:48.020> at<00:01:48.170> least<00:01:48.200> that's<00:01:48.500> not<00:01:48.680> hard<00:01:48.950> to<00:01:49.040> set

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
to do or at least that's not hard to set

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.940 
to do or at least that's not hard to set
up<00:01:49.430> when<00:01:50.060> it<00:01:50.210> comes<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.479> actual<00:01:50.840> switch<00:01:51.200> which

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
up when it comes the actual switch which

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.130 
up when it comes the actual switch which
activates<00:01:52.520> it<00:01:53.410> they<00:01:54.410> have<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:54.649> same<00:01:56.140> same

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
activates it they have the same same

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.300 
activates it they have the same same
fucking<00:01:57.740> setup<00:01:58.550> as<00:01:58.850> each<00:01:59.000> other<00:01:59.210> and<00:02:00.310> you're

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
fucking setup as each other and you're

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.590 
fucking setup as each other and you're
really<00:02:01.550> just<00:02:01.700> controlling<00:02:02.180> poly<00:02:02.420> object

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
really just controlling poly object

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.540 
really just controlling poly object
number<00:02:02.869> one<00:02:03.200> but<00:02:03.470> it's<00:02:03.590> just<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:03.950> second<00:02:04.459> one

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
number one but it's just the second one

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.279 
number one but it's just the second one

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:11.659 
doors are going to be horizontal so you

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.089 
doors are going to be horizontal so you

can keep your movement angle is only
eight<00:04:13.310> and<00:04:13.519> then<00:04:13.670> set<00:04:14.139> the<00:04:15.139> way<00:04:15.290> to<00:04:15.650> whatever

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
the length of your door is so you could

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.240 
the length of your door is so you could
have<00:04:17.630> a<00:04:18.470> 64<00:04:19.190> split<00:04:19.970> door<00:04:20.769> sliding<00:04:21.769> door<00:04:22.039> like
