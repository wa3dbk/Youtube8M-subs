tools to add mods to the game now the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.639 
tools to add mods to the game now the
reason<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.879> bring<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.329> back<00:00:42.629> up<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.440> because

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
reason I bring this back up is because

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.639 
reason I bring this back up is because
it<00:00:43.890> seems<00:00:44.340> like<00:00:44.489> 4j<00:00:45.210> Studios<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:46.079> actually

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
it seems like 4j Studios is actually

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.830 
it seems like 4j Studios is actually
releasing<00:00:47.219> updates<00:00:47.430> more<00:00:48.030> frequently<00:00:48.719> now

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
releasing updates more frequently now

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.990 
releasing updates more frequently now
and<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.530> can't<00:00:49.829> help<00:00:50.010> but<00:00:50.219> thinking<00:00:50.699> that<00:00:50.879> they

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
and I can't help but thinking that they

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.720 
and I can't help but thinking that they
actually<00:00:51.239> have<00:00:51.600> something<00:00:51.840> big<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.859> the<00:00:52.920> works

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
actually have something big in the works

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.360 
actually have something big in the works
in<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.269> background<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.440> think<00:00:55.530> they<00:00:55.980> might

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
in the background so I think they might

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.939 
in the background so I think they might
actually<00:00:56.699> be<00:00:56.940> releasing<00:00:57.390> smaller<00:00:57.930> updates<00:00:58.500> to

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
actually be releasing smaller updates to

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.470 
actually be releasing smaller updates to
kind<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.280> distract<00:00:59.789> us<00:00:59.969> from<00:01:00.179> something

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
kind of distract us from something

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.840 
kind of distract us from something
bigger<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.379> they<00:01:01.559> have<00:01:01.769> planned<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.519> more

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
bigger that they have planned and more

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.090 
bigger that they have planned and more
and<00:01:03.090> particularly<00:01:03.600> why<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.110> bring<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.680> up<00:01:04.769> now

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
and particularly why I bring it up now

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.520 
and particularly why I bring it up now
is<00:01:05.640> because<00:01:06.060> there's<00:01:06.299> going<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.600> be<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.869> huge

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
is because there's going to be a huge

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.670 
is because there's going to be a huge
gaming<00:01:08.159> event<00:01:08.520> called<00:01:09.119> Gamescom<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.590> is

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
and even if 4j Studios doesn't go

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.700 
and even if 4j Studios doesn't go
Mojang<00:01:23.820> actually<00:01:24.360> goes<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:25.170> considering

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
Mojang actually goes and considering

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.429 
Mojang actually goes and considering
that<00:01:25.740> microsoft<00:01:26.640> now<00:01:27.030> owns<00:01:27.420> Mojang<00:01:28.170> and

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
that microsoft now owns Mojang and

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.210 
that microsoft now owns Mojang and
microsoft<00:01:29.159> also<00:01:29.400> owns<00:01:30.149> xbox<00:01:30.990> it's<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.920> safe<00:01:32.189> bet

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
microsoft also owns xbox it's a safe bet

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.440 
microsoft also owns xbox it's a safe bet
that<00:01:32.820> if<00:01:33.000> either<00:01:33.360> 4j<00:01:34.110> Studios<00:01:34.170> or<00:01:34.950> Mojang<00:01:35.700> goes

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
that if either 4j Studios or Mojang goes

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.770 
that if either 4j Studios or Mojang goes
to<00:01:36.780> Gamescom<00:01:37.530> we<00:01:38.189> will<00:01:38.369> likely<00:01:38.729> hear<00:01:39.270> some<00:01:39.540> new
