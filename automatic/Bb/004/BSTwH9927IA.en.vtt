 all colors aqua color of those that 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.530
 dry and are perfect to use by 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.680
 example in children this makeup would be 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.930
 a super easy example to make in a 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.850
 I only have a little bit of color 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.059
 little intensity does not take anything else no longer 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.350
 no product plus blood are the 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.930
 artificial blood is a product that 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.250
 is created to be able to eat is sweet 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.980
 so that there would be no problem is 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.510
 perfect so if you do not have any 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.100
 type of material that you do not want to use 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.200
 buy it you do not want to buy products 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.030
 special effects you do not have the hand 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.870
 to do special effects or is it for 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.460
 a kid so it's perfect if you want 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.300
 see how we make this makeup too 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.300
 we are seeing 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.030
 we have started, you will see that it is very easy 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.310
 is I'm going to use this time to 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.759
 four colors to create the entire base and 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.799
 also the appearance of the eyes in color 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.359
 purple and blue to dry and last 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.729
 more time that's why it's perfect for 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:31.979
 children or people who will use a 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.929
 makeup for many hours or if not 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.030
 you are an expert aspect in effects 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:38.159
 special then I'm going to take a 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.860
 blank color I will show only 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.630
 a sponge and I will catch very little 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.670
 color and start applying it we do not want 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.349
 create a completely white base 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.210
 we simply want our skin 

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:52.210
 be more clear 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.210
 now 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.030
 the area that we teach neck shoulders 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.100
 everything we teach and we will take 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.119
 directly a blue color also at 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.920
 what color are we going to do exactly? 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.990
 the same thing this time I'm going to take more 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.450
 product because we want more 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.890
 compacted and denser the color and I'm going to 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.840
 Apply it all over the eye area 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.720
 extending a little bit towards 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.010
 around the eye the nose 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.470
 little further down the barrier and 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.330
 going up a bit too in the eyebrow and 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.640
 we are going to blur if we need 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.220
 you can catch a little more white or 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.530
 once again in the sponge and start 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.970
 blur the border the jaqua color has 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.400
 the problem that once they dry up if 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.860
 we started using more wet colors 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.450
 we're going to lose the color of 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.280
 down so we have to be careful 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.560
 and apply it quickly and we're going to 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.630
 apply a little purple in the area more 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.420
 extensive arriving a little bit more 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.300
 apply it for the rest of the face in a 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.950
 way a little non-uniform to make it 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.950
 a little more realistic this effect 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.480
 to be able to work more depth I'll 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.519
 to take a green color are about 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.319
 colors that do not dry give more 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.760
 pigmentation I'm not going to take a black one and 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.040
 Do exactly what we have done 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.310
 made with our previous colors in 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.080
 purple and blue and apply it around 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.970
 of the eye and blur the edges in this 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.790
 occasion we're not going to do it the edges 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.129
 as dense as the area that can be 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.260
 to be in around more central of the 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:32.060
 Eye like the mobile eyelid or line 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.099
 bottom of tabs because we want that 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.380
 below you see a little the purple and the 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.630
 blue that we have applied previously 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.360
 concentrates the most opaque black color in the 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.069
 mobile eyelid area and do not worry 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.790
 that it is well integrated is not a 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:49.220
 zombie so the more evil in between 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.260
 quotes this done better and we have 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.870
 used this color than in color queens 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.150
 instead of water that's why we want 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.590
 make it more dense and if we apply a 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.750
 color water on top of all those that already 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.090
 we have applied we can lose that effect 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.879
 of intensity we are going to paint all the 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.350
 lips of black and blur it like 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.800
 you are seeing in a little way 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.220
 controlled a little 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:14.250
 and we're going to touch up the edges of this 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.570
 black color of the lips and 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.760
 also from the eyes with a little bit of 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.450
 purple so that you see that color of 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.450
 down purple 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.080
 and now 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.620
 in this type of makeup are those that 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.330
 the details do not take too much work 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.340
 they are important for example to create 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.470
 purple lines on the neck 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.240
 to create the effect of the bones that 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.250
 be noticed and also apply a 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.780
 little white in the areas you can 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.000
 see how the hands can be 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.150
 ears the rest of the neck whatever you go 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.460
 to teach in disguise with a red 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.110
 we are going to give very light touches around 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.300
 from the mouth as if it were blood and the 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.979
 final touch would be simply add a 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.139
 little artificial blood both in the 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.330
 area of ​​the lips as well as in the 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.590
 teeth in artificial blood is 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.840
 edible so there would not be any 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.639
 problem using it in children adds some 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.250
 contact lenses if you want and that's it 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.780
 we have finished the color water dries 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.110
 so it's perfect to use in 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.110
 children 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.330

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.130
 we can all be disguised as 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:28.170
 zombie this this halloween a little bit of 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.960
