 Hello everyone and today, analysis of one 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.739
 unpretentious spanish body mup usually 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.460
 such 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:04.620
 music of this genre like everything therefore 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:07.850
 it makes sense to learn it and so push 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.850
 here is a court 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:16.130
 this is the first string clamped on the fourth 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:19.160
 fret third country clamped on fourth 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.370
 fret and the fifth country sandwiched on the second 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.370
 year 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:31.230
 and just spend on all then on 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:37.200
 the first string 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:42.780
 we hold the fifth fret the seventh fret 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.780
 in the twelfth year we do vibrato 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.180
 then the first string on 8 water 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.610
 7 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.040
 I am there 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.550
 four 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.290
 pen 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.290
 and open 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:22.400
 then we press on and make Courtney's 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:25.260
 do this sorting over all the strings and 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:29.000
 then play the first and second string 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.000
 first on the first and then on the second 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:41.210
 so once then shifting mccartney on 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:43.430
 one way and play the same bust 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:47.799
 once 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:53.049
 then we shift back again we transfer 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:53.049
 transfer back again 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:15.660
 then again and brother on 12 string 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:20.850
 then do hamar on the first string 4 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.850
 llodra 5 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:33.440
 hamar is such a thing as 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.440
 pull the string and 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:42.890
 At this time, hit the second finger on 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.890
 fifth fret 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.750
 and immediately drop it 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:56.450
 then we clamp the first string on the first 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:04:00.210
 fret 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:03.960
 then open 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:05.610
 than open again then pinch on 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.270
 first fret 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.450
 on the fourth 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.560
 again at first 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.560
 and open again 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:19.510
 then fight 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:23.550
 mine goes on the same chords on 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.550
