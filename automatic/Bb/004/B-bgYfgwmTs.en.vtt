running<00:01:35.359> out<00:01:35.630> of<00:01:35.659> hair<00:01:36.049> so<00:01:37.039> I<00:01:37.609> was<00:01:38.299> like<00:01:38.479> let<00:01:38.659> me

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
running out of hair so I was like let me

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.039 
running out of hair so I was like let me
go<00:01:38.869> I<00:01:38.899> hit<00:01:39.170> a<00:01:39.200> British<00:01:39.590> straight<00:01:39.829> back<00:01:40.039> so<00:01:40.399> I

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
go I hit a British straight back so I

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:47.099 
go I hit a British straight back so I
did<00:01:42.049> the<00:01:42.229> size<00:01:42.469> bigger<00:01:43.209> so<00:01:44.209> both<00:01:44.450> sides<00:01:44.750> have

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:47.109 
did the size bigger so both sides have

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:52.300 
did the size bigger so both sides have
bigger<00:01:48.109> part<00:01:48.500> in<00:01:48.829> the<00:01:49.179> middle<00:01:50.859> like<00:01:51.859> right<00:01:52.159> at

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
bigger part in the middle like right at

00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:03.580 
bigger part in the middle like right at
the<00:01:52.459> middle<00:01:52.640> of<00:01:52.819> parts<00:01:53.149> of<00:01:53.299> smaller<00:02:01.929> I<00:02:02.929> guess

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
the middle of parts of smaller I guess

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.069 
the middle of parts of smaller I guess
put<00:02:03.829> the<00:02:03.979> crochet<00:02:04.399> braids<00:02:04.729> and<00:02:05.270> tighten<00:02:05.959> it

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
put the crochet braids and tighten it

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.800 
put the crochet braids and tighten it
real<00:02:06.319> tight<00:02:06.590> so<00:02:06.890> that<00:02:06.920> my<00:02:07.610> bracelet<00:02:08.239> pick<00:02:08.599> up

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
real tight so that my bracelet pick up

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.860 
real tight so that my bracelet pick up
and<00:02:09.019> this<00:02:09.140> is<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.530> result<00:02:09.979> I<00:02:10.329> probably<00:02:11.329> I

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
and this is the result I probably I

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.530 
and this is the result I probably I
probably<00:02:12.290> won't<00:02:12.799> do<00:02:13.040> any<00:02:13.250> style<00:02:13.579> it'll<00:02:14.209> win<00:02:14.390> an

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
probably won't do any style it'll win an

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.240 
probably won't do any style it'll win an
opponent's<00:02:14.989> Hillier<00:02:15.170> anything<00:02:15.680> because<00:02:16.099> of

opponent's Hillier anything because of

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.530 
opponent's Hillier anything because of
