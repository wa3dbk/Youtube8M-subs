you're<00:00:44.489> like<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.329> 2nd<00:00:45.750> 2nd<00:00:46.649> floor<00:00:47.210> you

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
you're like in the 2nd 2nd floor you

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.290 
you're like in the 2nd 2nd floor you
couldn't<00:00:48.570> run<00:00:48.719> up<00:00:48.870> there<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:50.090> this<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.149> a

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
couldn't run up there and this is a

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.420 
couldn't run up there and this is a
really<00:00:51.510> good<00:00:51.690> spot<00:00:51.840> that's<00:00:52.199> not<00:00:52.260> its<00:00:53.010> best<00:00:53.219> if

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
really good spot that's not its best if

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.130 
really good spot that's not its best if
you're<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.610> cold<00:00:53.879> block<00:00:54.090> but<00:00:54.360> it's<00:00:54.660> good<00:00:54.989> if

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
you're a cold block but it's good if

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.500 
you're a cold block but it's good if
you're<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.320> snow<00:00:55.739> block<00:00:55.949> -<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.340> if<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.300> want

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
you're a snow block - and if you want

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.610 
you're a snow block - and if you want
you<00:00:57.750> can<00:00:57.899> jump<00:00:58.399> one<00:00:59.399> jump<00:01:00.289> and<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.500> will

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
you can jump one jump and you will

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.500 
you can jump one jump and you will
become<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.010> block<00:01:02.219> above<00:01:03.030> there

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
become the block above there

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.080 
become the block above there
so<00:01:04.129> yeah<00:01:05.129> that's<00:01:05.400> better<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.729> think<00:01:05.939> that's

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
so yeah that's better I think that's

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.770 
so yeah that's better I think that's
better<00:01:06.240> for<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.630> snow<00:01:06.810> block<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:08.630> and<00:01:09.630> if<00:01:09.750> you

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
better for the snow block and and if you

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.600 
better for the snow block and and if you
run<00:01:09.990> down<00:01:10.200> here<00:01:10.409> it's<00:01:10.619> probably<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.430> best

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
run down here it's probably the best

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.499 
run down here it's probably the best
places<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.299> can<00:01:12.450> hide<00:01:12.479> either<00:01:12.960> air<00:01:13.670> and<00:01:14.670> you

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
places you can hide either air and you

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.520 
places you can hide either air and you
can<00:01:16.040> in<00:01:17.040> those<00:01:17.580> plots<00:01:18.060> places<00:01:18.689> they're<00:01:18.930> really

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
can in those plots places they're really

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:28.010 
can in those plots places they're really
good<00:01:20.689> and<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:22.200> can<00:01:22.229> also<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:25.909> like<00:01:26.909> all<00:01:27.810> around

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.270 
it's also good to hear is still in
second<00:04:17.989> it's<00:04:18.989> in<00:04:19.169> second<00:04:19.530> floor<00:04:19.709> and<00:04:19.889> you<00:04:20.130> hide

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
second it's in second floor and you hide

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.000 
second it's in second floor and you hide
here<00:04:20.489> so<00:04:20.850> this<00:04:21.810> will<00:04:22.049> also<00:04:22.169> it<00:04:22.470> look<00:04:22.740> really

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
here so this will also it look really

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.480 
here so this will also it look really
good<00:04:23.040> and<00:04:23.660> when<00:04:24.660> you're<00:04:24.840> here<00:04:25.020> this<00:04:25.490> sometimes

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
good and when you're here this sometimes

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.909 
good and when you're here this sometimes
it<00:04:26.699> will<00:04:26.760> only<00:04:26.910> be<00:04:27.150> one<00:04:27.330> block<00:04:27.900> there<00:04:28.169> then<00:04:28.830> you

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
it will only be one block there then you

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.650 
it will only be one block there then you
can<00:04:28.979> jump<00:04:29.280> on<00:04:29.639> top<00:04:29.820> of<00:04:29.970> that<00:04:30.060> block<00:04:30.270> into<00:04:30.479> him

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
can jump on top of that block into him

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.900 
can jump on top of that block into him
on<00:04:30.810> top<00:04:31.020> of<00:04:31.169> that<00:04:31.290> so<00:04:31.590> that<00:04:32.220> is<00:04:32.340> also<00:04:32.520> good<00:04:32.760> or

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
on top of that so that is also good or

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.780 
on top of that so that is also good or
you<00:04:33.030> can<00:04:33.150> just<00:04:33.300> stay<00:04:33.510> there<00:04:34.340> okay<00:04:35.340> so<00:04:35.400> that<00:04:35.699> was

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
you can just stay there okay so that was

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.520 
you can just stay there okay so that was

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
the beacon and I was time for what I

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.590 
the beacon and I was time for what I
