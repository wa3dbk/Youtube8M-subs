00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:10.509
 totally because it seemed like an 8 course 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.910
 I like to make a coke video 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:14.910
 hereby Korea women 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.530
 the most important thing is of course 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:28.570
 chocolate standing in this recipe use 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:30.220
 he can mix the brownie mix of flour 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.670
 packaging of the brownie mix that too 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.810
 this kind of not but I was scared 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.810
 it's not tasty so I have this one 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.530
 you have to grease the edges well and the 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.190
 soil, but there is something else there as well 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.190
 paste very quickly 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.670
 now 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.390
 had to pack number two to logical 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:21.369
 only one but two you could put in 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.369
 and that hears corner and chocolate 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.180
 then you have to mix with that he 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.690
 mix it first with a fork or else 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.720
 had the powder of a chocolate COVOG 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:51.340
 flying everywhere to so first with 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.340
 mix the fork and tables 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.510
 I forgot to tell me under 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.700
 is that oreo also needs me and me 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:09.220
 just grabbed a few and a small one 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.220
 pieces of minced meat and daenerys in the bowl 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.680
 it ears well so that all oreos don't 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.680
 is divided 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.340
 now grab the chocolate small pieces and 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.340
 three out of 5 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.470
 distribute the dough well over the entire bake 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.470
 of them that is the same everywhere 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:18.970
 and then you put the baking tin in the oven 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.970
 at 200 degrees 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.430
 I had my kitchen timer 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.790
 now the other bag you're through than mine 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.829
 a small piece of chocolate and that is 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.599
 but the top so that going to escape 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.720
 with some extra searching after i left 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.720
 had 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:49.730
 must stop briefly every 30 seconds 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.560
 and for a moment 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.739
 and I think something is wrong with my 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.739
 microwave 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.439
 20 minutes work 40 minutes because he was 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.340
 not yet cooked or 20 minutes 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:06.340
 now it goes well 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:24.200
 when completely cooled that lets you 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:28.250
 chocolate molten chocolate credit or one 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:31.130
 then it looks like this 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.980
 what my dear sister has lessons from rio 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:38.990
 so I had to eat oreo chocolate 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:40.550
 but you can also just do this 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.650

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.650
