00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
fake biomes because it's something I

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.689 
fake biomes because it's something I
mentioned<00:00:19.289> quite<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.710> bit<00:00:19.949> especially<00:00:20.369> my

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
the video then shall we so the most

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.889 
the video then shall we so the most
basic<00:00:40.920> definition<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.940> crime<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.540> biome

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
basic definition of a crime is a biome

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.240 
basic definition of a crime is a biome
that's<00:00:43.079> not<00:00:43.260> real<00:00:43.530> but<00:00:43.739> I'm<00:00:43.829> sure<00:00:44.010> that

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
that's not real but I'm sure that

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.220 
that's not real but I'm sure that
doesn't<00:00:44.489> help<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.730> all<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.539> most<00:00:45.750> simple<00:00:46.170> way

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
doesn't help you all the most simple way

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.630 
doesn't help you all the most simple way
to<00:00:46.260> think<00:00:46.500> about<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.039> if<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.280> have<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
to think about it is if you have the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.010 
to think about it is if you have the
blocks<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.180> by<00:00:48.329> him<00:00:48.420> because<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.780> world

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
blocks of a by him because the world

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.779 
blocks of a by him because the world
will<00:00:49.140> generate<00:00:49.500> with<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.860> blocks<00:00:50.219> based<00:00:50.579> on

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
will generate with the blocks based on

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.250 
will generate with the blocks based on
the<00:00:50.910> blind<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.300> then<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.750> don't<00:00:51.989> have<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
the blind and then you don't have the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.450 
the blind and then you don't have the
biome<00:00:52.500> underneath<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.100> let's<00:00:53.280> say<00:00:53.370> you

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
biome underneath it so let's say you

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.740 
biome underneath it so let's say you
have<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.610> mushroom<00:00:53.820> biome<00:00:54.210> like<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.480> do<00:00:54.539> right

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
have a mushroom biome like I do right

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.040 
have a mushroom biome like I do right
here

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
here

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.389 
here
but<00:00:55.289> really<00:00:55.620> it's<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.860> Plains<00:00:56.129> biome

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
but really it's a Plains biome

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.860 
but really it's a Plains biome
underneath<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.180> can<00:00:57.360> happen<00:00:57.570> because

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
underneath and this can happen because

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.869 
underneath and this can happen because
what<00:00:58.590> used<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.829> happen<00:00:58.890> before<00:00:59.129> title<00:00:59.670> update

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
what used to happen before title update

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.689 
what used to happen before title update
14<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.539> until<00:01:01.109> about<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.500> year<00:01:01.559> ago<00:01:02.100> now<00:01:02.309> year

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
14 so until about a year ago now year

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.280 
14 so until about a year ago now year
and<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.820> half<00:01:02.940> ago<00:01:03.059> now<00:01:03.149> what<00:01:03.840> used<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.019> actually

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
and a half ago now what used to actually

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.460 
and a half ago now what used to actually
happen<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.769> when<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.339> generated<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:06.000> world

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
happen is when you generated a world

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.840 
happen is when you generated a world
every<00:01:07.470> time<00:01:07.500> an<00:01:07.799> update<00:01:08.070> came<00:01:08.250> out<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.700> would

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
every time an update came out it would

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.340 
every time an update came out it would
regenerate<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.570> biomes<00:01:09.900> underneath<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
regenerate the biomes underneath the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.570 
regenerate the biomes underneath the
world<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:10.650> even<00:01:10.830> if<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:10.950> have<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.250> mushroom

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
world so even if you have this mushroom

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.340 
world so even if you have this mushroom
I'll<00:01:11.760> like<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.119> have<00:01:12.299> here<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.810> could<00:01:13.080> still<00:01:13.290> be

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
I'll like I have here it could still be

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.960 
I'll like I have here it could still be
a<00:01:13.470> Plains<00:01:13.860> biome<00:01:14.159> or<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> desert<00:01:14.580> or<00:01:14.790> anything

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
a Plains biome or a desert or anything

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.340 
a Plains biome or a desert or anything
like<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.240> underneath<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.170> might<00:01:16.320> think

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
like that underneath and you might think

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.899 
like that underneath and you might think
why<00:01:16.770> does<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:17.040> matter<00:01:17.159> what's<00:01:17.460> underneath<00:01:17.729> if

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
why does it matter what's underneath if

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.609 
why does it matter what's underneath if
you<00:01:18.030> have<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.270> block<00:01:18.479> survive<00:01:18.840> well<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.259> lot<00:01:19.530> of

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
you have the block survive well a lot of

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.260 
you have the block survive well a lot of
biomes<00:01:19.920> do<00:01:20.130> have<00:01:20.340> interesting<00:01:20.729> effects<00:01:21.119> so

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
biomes do have interesting effects so

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.060 
biomes do have interesting effects so
the<00:01:21.420> mushroom<00:01:21.720> biome<00:01:21.930> only<00:01:22.320> spawns<00:01:22.590> mushrooms

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
the mushroom biome only spawns mushrooms

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.560 
the mushroom biome only spawns mushrooms
and<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.369> stops<00:01:23.610> over<00:01:23.759> Mulsanne<00:01:24.090> spawning<00:01:24.360> if

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
and it stops over Mulsanne spawning if

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.300 
and it stops over Mulsanne spawning if
this<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.170> know<00:01:25.290> stop<00:01:25.530> being<00:01:25.710> here<00:01:25.950> then<00:01:26.159> that

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
this you know stop being here then that

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.950 
this you know stop being here then that
would<00:01:26.400> be<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.549> thing<00:01:26.790> if<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.509> desert<00:01:27.810> for

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
would be a thing if the desert for

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.390 
would be a thing if the desert for
instance<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.409> doesn't<00:01:28.710> rain<00:01:28.890> there<00:01:29.100> but<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.310> my

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
instance it doesn't rain there but in my

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.740 
instance it doesn't rain there but in my
let's<00:01:29.640> play<00:01:29.790> world<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.150> have<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.329> desert<00:01:30.659> which

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
let's play world I have a desert which

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.630 
let's play world I have a desert which
has<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.320> many<00:01:31.560> sandbox<00:01:32.100> all<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.400> sort<00:01:32.610> of

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
has so many sandbox all that sort of

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.550 
has so many sandbox all that sort of
stuff<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.240> rains<00:01:33.600> inside<00:01:34.049> my<00:01:34.200> desert

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
stuff but it rains inside my desert

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.749 
stuff but it rains inside my desert
there's<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.829> lot<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.070> downsides<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.549> lot<00:01:35.700> of

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
there's a lot of downsides a lot of

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.789 
there's a lot of downsides a lot of
upsides<00:01:36.180> um<00:01:36.450> but<00:01:36.900> yeah<00:01:37.049> that's<00:01:37.200> basically<00:01:37.409> the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
upsides um but yeah that's basically the

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.109 
upsides um but yeah that's basically the
main<00:01:38.009> way<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.250> can<00:01:38.340> happen<00:01:38.520> if<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.970> have<00:01:39.000> a

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
main way it can happen if you have a

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.480 
main way it can happen if you have a
world<00:01:39.390> from<00:01:39.720> before<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.470> 14<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:41.040> lot<00:01:41.400> of

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
world from before to you 14 a lot of

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.010 
world from before to you 14 a lot of
your<00:01:41.610> biomes<00:01:41.939> when<00:01:42.060> we<00:01:42.150> fake<00:01:42.360> biomes<00:01:42.689> because

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
your biomes when we fake biomes because

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.749 
your biomes when we fake biomes because
they've<00:01:43.200> regenerated<00:01:43.860> underneath<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.460> which

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
they've regenerated underneath you which

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.160 
they've regenerated underneath you which
is<00:01:44.909> kind<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.180> weird<00:01:45.329> kind<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.689> cool<00:01:45.899> but<00:01:46.049> I'm

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
is kind of weird kind of cool but I'm

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.020 
is kind of weird kind of cool but I'm
glad<00:01:46.320> they<00:01:46.590> have<00:01:46.740> fixed<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.159> now<00:01:47.340> because<00:01:47.759> it

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
glad they have fixed that now because it

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.399 
glad they have fixed that now because it
was<00:01:48.149> just<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.420> know<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.659> part<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.110> way<00:01:49.200> they

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
was just you know a part of the way they

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.899 
was just you know a part of the way they
are<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.710> know<00:01:49.799> cut<00:01:50.009> for<00:01:50.130> around<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.399> coat<00:01:50.610> and

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
are you know cut for around the coat and

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.969 
are you know cut for around the coat and
let's<00:01:51.240> start<00:01:51.450> talking<00:01:51.810> about<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.530> second<00:01:52.890> way

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
let's start talking about the second way

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.590 
let's start talking about the second way
you<00:01:53.009> can<00:01:53.220> get<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:53.549> which<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:53.939> now<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.210> only

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
you can get this which is now the only

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.179 
you can get this which is now the only
way<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.750> do<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.439> if<00:01:55.680> someone<00:01:56.009> just

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
way to do and that is if someone just

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.740 
way to do and that is if someone just
does<00:01:56.369> this<00:01:56.460> by<00:01:56.640> default<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.119> why<00:01:57.509> would<00:01:57.630> you

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
does this by default so why would you

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.270 
does this by default so why would you
want<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.200> make<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.380> fake<00:01:58.649> plan<00:01:58.829> because<00:01:59.130> you

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
want to make a fake plan because you

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.530 
want to make a fake plan because you
know<00:01:59.369> if<00:01:59.549> you've<00:01:59.700> noticed<00:01:59.850> I<00:02:00.180> made<00:02:00.390> this

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
know if you've noticed I made this

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.719 
know if you've noticed I made this
myself<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:01.170> even<00:02:01.500> made<00:02:01.680> over<00:02:02.100> here<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.369> can<00:02:02.520> see

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
myself I even made over here you can see

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.550 
myself I even made over here you can see
I've<00:02:03.060> made<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.299> Mesa<00:02:03.570> biome<00:02:03.930> which<00:02:04.140> isn't<00:02:04.409> even

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
I've made a Mesa biome which isn't even

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.810 
I've made a Mesa biome which isn't even
an<00:02:04.649> upper<00:02:04.979> blind<00:02:05.189> we<00:02:05.280> have<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.579> current

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
an upper blind we have in the current

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.100 
an upper blind we have in the current
update<00:02:06.090> yet<00:02:06.299> oh<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.600> I've<00:02:06.689> also<00:02:06.840> made<00:02:06.960> a

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
update yet oh and I've also made a

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.819 
update yet oh and I've also made a
referral

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
referral

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.410 
referral
why<00:02:08.310> would<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.550> want<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.819> do<00:02:09.000> this<00:02:09.149> so

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
why would you want to do this so

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.969 
why would you want to do this so
obviously<00:02:09.899> in<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.080> case<00:02:10.200> of<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.410> Mesa<00:02:10.649> and

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
obviously in the case of the Mesa and

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.380 
obviously in the case of the Mesa and
the<00:02:11.039> roof<00:02:11.220> forests<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.670> can<00:02:11.879> do<00:02:12.030> this<00:02:12.180> so<00:02:12.330> you

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
the roof forests you can do this so you

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.640 
the roof forests you can do this so you
can<00:02:12.629> simulate<00:02:12.900> having<00:02:13.230> a

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
can simulate having a

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.780 
can simulate having a
should<00:02:13.769> buy<00:02:13.920> him<00:02:13.980> in<00:02:14.129> your<00:02:14.220> current<00:02:14.549> world

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
should buy him in your current world

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.429 
should buy him in your current world
this<00:02:15.329> is<00:02:15.450> pretty<00:02:15.599> cool<00:02:15.840> especially<00:02:15.959> in<00:02:16.349> the

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
this is pretty cool especially in the

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:17.569 
this is pretty cool especially in the
case<00:02:16.560> of<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.769> Mesa<00:02:16.980> plan<00:02:17.129> because<00:02:17.340> it's<00:02:17.459> just

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
case of the Mesa plan because it's just

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.610 
case of the Mesa plan because it's just
so<00:02:17.909> i<00:02:18.209> catching<00:02:18.480> an<00:02:18.720> eye<00:02:18.780> drew<00:02:18.989> there's<00:02:19.439> just

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
so i catching an eye drew there's just

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.809 
so i catching an eye drew there's just
kind<00:02:19.769> of<00:02:19.799> cool<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.040> look<00:02:20.159> at<00:02:20.340> so<00:02:20.489> yeah<00:02:20.640> that's

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
kind of cool to look at so yeah that's

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.460 
kind of cool to look at so yeah that's
one<00:02:21.030> thing<00:02:21.180> you<00:02:21.269> can<00:02:21.390> do<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.510> bit<00:02:21.689> the<00:02:22.110> reverse

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
one thing you can do a bit the reverse

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.600 
one thing you can do a bit the reverse
is<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.709> same<00:02:22.890> thing<00:02:23.099> if<00:02:23.220> you<00:02:23.280> want<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.459> just

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
is the same thing if you want to just

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.920 
is the same thing if you want to just
you<00:02:23.700> know<00:02:23.819> have<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.030> really<00:02:24.269> cool<00:02:24.480> bind<00:02:24.720> that's

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
you know have a really cool bind that's

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.330 
you know have a really cool bind that's
something<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.230> can<00:02:25.349> do<00:02:25.470> but<00:02:25.829> the<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.280> know

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
something you can do but the you know

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.679 
something you can do but the you know
the<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.700> reason<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.090> I<00:02:27.150> think<00:02:27.540> is<00:02:27.659> the

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
the the reason that I think is the

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.780 
the the reason that I think is the
coolest<00:02:27.930> one<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.379> do<00:02:28.500> make<00:02:28.829> fake<00:02:29.040> bombs<00:02:29.250> is<00:02:29.459> if

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
coolest one to do make fake bombs is if

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.520 
coolest one to do make fake bombs is if
you<00:02:29.909> have<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.359> really<00:02:30.720> cool<00:02:30.870> bomb<00:02:31.109> underneath

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
you have a really cool bomb underneath

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.839 
you have a really cool bomb underneath
that<00:02:31.709> you<00:02:31.890> want<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.340> turn<00:02:32.489> into<00:02:32.640> something

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
that you want to turn into something

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.640 
that you want to turn into something
else<00:02:33.060> so<00:02:33.329> if<00:02:33.569> you<00:02:33.750> have<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:33.930> desert<00:02:34.349> but<00:02:34.560> you

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
else so if you have a desert but you

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.020 
else so if you have a desert but you
don't<00:02:34.859> you<00:02:35.040> know<00:02:35.129> because<00:02:35.519> in<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.790> desert

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
don't you know because in the desert

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.220 
don't you know because in the desert
sand<00:02:36.180> doesn't<00:02:36.299> rain<00:02:36.480> like<00:02:36.629> I<00:02:36.659> mentioned<00:02:37.019> but

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230

you want to get like a you know a

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.670 
you want to get like a you know a
Savannah<00:02:39.540> kind<00:02:39.870> of<00:02:39.959> like<00:02:40.109> Plains<00:02:40.439> place

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
Savannah kind of like Plains place

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.869 
Savannah kind of like Plains place
that's<00:02:41.069> something<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:41.340> can<00:02:41.459> do<00:02:41.579> you<00:02:41.730> can<00:02:41.849> just

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879

get it all the you know the sand blocks
and<00:02:43.739> replace<00:02:44.040> them<00:02:44.250> of<00:02:44.340> dirt<00:02:44.549> looks<00:02:44.790> like<00:02:45.030> sub

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
and replace them of dirt looks like sub

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.599 
and replace them of dirt looks like sub
and<00:02:45.739> there's<00:02:46.739> a<00:02:46.829> bunch<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:47.040> cool<00:02:47.190> reasons<00:02:47.519> you

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
and there's a bunch of cool reasons you

and there's a bunch of cool reasons you
can<00:02:47.790> do<00:02:47.879> this<00:02:48.060> for<00:02:48.239> but<00:02:48.480> you<00:02:48.720> know<00:02:48.810> that's<00:02:49.049> like

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
can do this for but you know that's like

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.809 
can do this for but you know that's like
I<00:02:49.470> mentioned<00:02:49.799> the<00:02:49.859> main<00:02:49.980> reason<00:02:50.310> is<00:02:50.459> so<00:02:50.760> you

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
I mentioned the main reason is so you

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.460 
I mentioned the main reason is so you
can<00:02:51.030> get<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.299> biome<00:02:51.569> effects<00:02:51.870> from<00:02:51.989> one<00:02:52.230> place

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
can get the biome effects from one place

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.500 
can get the biome effects from one place
and<00:02:52.500> take<00:02:52.920> them<00:02:53.099> somewhere<00:02:53.340> else<00:02:53.489> so<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:54.329> full

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
and take them somewhere else so the full

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.539 
and take them somewhere else so the full
of<00:02:54.599> sublime<00:02:54.870> effects<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.409> really<00:02:56.099> really<00:02:56.340> big

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
of sublime effects is really really big

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.520 
of sublime effects is really really big
but<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:56.909> give<00:02:57.209> you<00:02:57.299> the<00:02:57.450> short<00:02:57.900> list<00:02:58.079> basically

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
but to give you the short list basically

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.289 
but to give you the short list basically
in<00:02:58.889> Plains<00:02:59.220> biomes<00:02:59.609> you'll<00:02:59.760> have<00:02:59.909> a<00:02:59.939> lot<00:03:00.269> of

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
in Plains biomes you'll have a lot of

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.360 
in Plains biomes you'll have a lot of
stuff<00:03:00.900> spawning<00:03:01.230> including<00:03:01.560> horses<00:03:01.769> so<00:03:02.310> if

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
you want to see you know horses spawning

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:04.849 
you want to see you know horses spawning

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
of you can totally do if you you know in

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.240 
of you can totally do if you you know in
the<00:03:06.569> extreme<00:03:06.870> Hill<00:03:07.019> biomes<00:03:07.379> a<00:03:07.590> very<00:03:07.859> few<00:03:08.069> mobs

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
the extreme Hill biomes a very few mobs

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.520 
the extreme Hill biomes a very few mobs
will<00:03:08.430> spawn<00:03:08.639> and<00:03:08.879> you'll<00:03:09.120> also<00:03:09.470> get<00:03:10.470> a

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
will spawn and you'll also get a

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.929 
will spawn and you'll also get a
different<00:03:10.859> colors<00:03:11.069> the<00:03:11.159> grass<00:03:11.370> that's<00:03:11.730> same

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:11.939 
different colors the grass that's same

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:13.009 
different colors the grass that's same
with<00:03:12.030> actually<00:03:12.239> all<00:03:12.329> the<00:03:12.420> blinds<00:03:12.629> everything

with actually all the blinds everything
kind<00:03:13.139> of<00:03:13.200> crosses<00:03:13.590> so<00:03:13.709> you<00:03:13.799> can<00:03:13.920> take<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.250> bunch

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
kind of crosses so you can take a bunch

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.800 
kind of crosses so you can take a bunch
of<00:03:14.519> that<00:03:14.670> for<00:03:15.000> instance<00:03:15.120> I've<00:03:15.359> turned<00:03:15.540> out<00:03:15.720> one
