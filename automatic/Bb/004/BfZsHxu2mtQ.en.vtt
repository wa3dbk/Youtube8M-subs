00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.820
 maquens and its 100 years of history is 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.500
 a visionary group he has been to 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.529
 the origin of big advertising saga 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:27.310
 historic l'oréal and famous sofac 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.849
 because our sites coca cola nespresso on 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.460
 what else 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:33.010
 finally if that because it is also with opel 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:38.290
 deutsch qualicode calicots at alta tu 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:40.090
 have you got there a lot 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.820
 and we could also talk about Santa Claus 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.960
 we could talk about the first 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.640
 campbell soup can 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.559
 well, that's all the universe of my 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.079
 cane and that's what we want to do 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:53.109
 come out here is all these brands 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.890
 historical that we have known that exists 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:56.499
 still today 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.989
 and then all the ones we know 

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:00.579
 the stories were going to chorus is by 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:04.629
 against we never knew it was my 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:06.460
 cane they had created we decided 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.710
 to say to yourself ok what can we do 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.570
 to help our mc hale down friends 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.010
 we will apply the truth and we will 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.409
 apply truth to all levels 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.810
 that means that already in the brief of 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.150
 departure we thought we would do 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.770
 an audit of all that the agencies in the 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.180
 world do because we know that the 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.610
 receptions from all com agencies 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.070
 are absolutely fabulous and then we have 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.410
 defined several objectives in terms of 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.630
 design and from this logic 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.520
 we wanted we wanted the customers 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.040
 can in this position there and see 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.870
 also this truth soon as we 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:42.910
 has always shown the concept design 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.840
 flow source is American myth 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.610
 french touch 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.230
 the building in which we are and 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.300
 it is exceptional it is the old ones 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.850
 warehouses du 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.490
 of spring it's a buildings that 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.380
 date from the early 20th and at the time he has 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.650
 was created by the architects Papineau and 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.710
 simonet and with a new technique 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.930
 to create by the engineer françois 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.550
 hennebique and he is the inventor of the 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:11.260
 reinforced concrete so this building where we have 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.540
 does the local makan can be said 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.260
 that it was created with the first 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.070
 part of reinforced concrete made in France with 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.480
 this structure 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.920
 so we can say that it's solid 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.110
 because we wanted to find here 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.490
 it was we wanted to strip the 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.100
 building and we wanted to find the 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.050
 original structure in ipn as it 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.340
 was conceived at the time that means 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.050
 that we wanted to find the walls in 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.300
 brick we wanted to find the structure 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.930
 and we especially wanted to find this style 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:44.320
 american loft because at mccann we 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.470
 wanted to give back that american dream side 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.900
 in Paris and when we see the corvette 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.850
 when we see all the elements of 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.520
 design that we have integrated to know the 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.320
 40's club armchairs 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.989
 the step of charles eames or the 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.000
 armchairs the marshmallows the sofas 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.370
 the marshmallows of george mason 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.010
 the idea was to find that spirit 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.700
 loft americans and especially this side a 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.350
 little kind casual elegance but that 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.580
 does not prevent us from working what we 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.310
 wanted the customers when they 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.959
 arrive at the age already they are 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.270
 pleasantly surprised by the welcome 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.370
 that they do not have the impression of being 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.820
 in the hospital lobby and 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.470
 we especially wanted the creative and 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.510
 all the employees of the group take 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.580
 pleasure to return then of course we 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.190
 was pleased of course we put the 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.110
 corvette we put walls written to the 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.090
 chalk why because we wanted 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.950
 first corvette had a customer 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.690
 historical if chevrolet in the group 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.820
 does the com but especially what 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.820
 I'm interested is what we liked 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.980
 in it is this true side bagnols 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.080
 American what and stop looking at 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.190
 to make my cam france a box a little 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.830
 french franco what 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.110

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.160

 international pole is with you we're going 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.800
 to make you grow what fat 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.570
 difference that we made with respect to 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.520
 others welcome advertising agencies 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.140
 is that we did not hesitate to 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.640
 show all brands for 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.620
 which we have worked for 100 years 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.420
 there is no agency in the world 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.190
 that he does no one present his 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.630
 references and that's the big thing 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.549
 difference compared to others it's 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.680
 we want our other customers 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.810
 know the sagas we've managed 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.260
 for his other clients and sometimes even 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.490
 for competitors 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.810
 you understand it we do not often 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.150
 the opportunity to twice good 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.980
 print so all this design we have 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.660
 does it is there to serve the customers 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.330

 somewhere today the welcome we 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.870
 created it's a digest of all 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.410
 the history of the brand and all that 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.410
 is able to do
