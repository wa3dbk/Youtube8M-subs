00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.370
 sony vegas is a video for newbies for 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.950
 those who first included a sony vegas 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.080
 and does not know what to start so for a start we 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.460
 need would be logical to download here 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.870
 our video which we will 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.340
 you can edit it through 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.920
 the up on button or through the file cop 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.830
 either drag me more like 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.199
 dragging so i did so on 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.710
 timeline on the timeline and so we have 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.710
 there was a video and audio track well 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.170
 now we can how you change it or 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.910
 start editing the example i need 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.329
 here's the data here 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:47.879
 fragment what's up and click on the track 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:51.710
 pressing the key with and example cut video 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.480
 here again here with this key 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.739
 the track is now a little bit small i can 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.809
 move to another place 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.270
 put it here and there to me more 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.850
 It's interesting to delete it by clicking 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.900
 on scissors or by pressing david key 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.869
 Now this site I just mean 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.460
 by doing this so pay attention that 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.729
 best when you will work 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.500
 here is the key 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.650
 responsible for correctness 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.850
 overlaying one video to another one that is 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.490
 if you have it turned on 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.479
 fit there crooked a little bit better 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.840
 what was included 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.189
 well what else can you show here 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.549
 to be quick 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:36.450
 and it is clear that these are two keys that 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.579
 We are responsible for focusing on 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.659
 your video or your location 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:45.740
 videos and effects that you can 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.640
 impose here let's click on the example 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.860
 focus and see what happens here 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.409
 man naked you bath appeared with us and 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.310
 let's see what I can 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.270
 move 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.700
 focus change more higher lower that is 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.240
 clear move left right either 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.670
 leave it the same as it is 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.860
 magic button mask with a mask 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.230
 we cut off the waste part 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.840
 yes, on the contrary, we leave some 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.160
 In general, it is logical but that I do 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.370
 I will also not, in principle, such a set 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.140
 toolbox appears here 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.910
 effects that can be applied 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:34.620
 on your video knowledge data practically 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:38.310
 I personally have enough to very 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.720
 many very often edit video and 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.910
 perform certain functions 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.180
 if you have multiple video tracks then 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.950
 there they are simply inserted like this 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.870
 Here are the new tracks and insert 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.250
 here is a new track with your video and 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:56.530
 separately and and also can edit 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.000
 That's basically all if you like 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.400

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.739
