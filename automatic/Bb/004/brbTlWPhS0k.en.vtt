00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:38.000
 save with a french school that is 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.670
 namely this ds 4 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.510
 the letters ds are from French 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.100
 word 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:48.050
 la ds what stands for the goddess and we must 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.700
 said the car has a contemporary and 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.500
 scratched full of design 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.120
 I have tried Citroen next to it 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.950
 chassis 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.260
 also the overall driving quality of the car 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.560
 to make it sporty in order to be better 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.420
 can compete with 1000 counterparts 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.720
 the car we drive has a one 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.890
 princess that hdi diesel engine and that 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.229
 engine delivers 115hp quite a hefty 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.520
 7200 meters of torque and with that the 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.560
 excellent performance 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.710
 wants me 100 goes and just over twelve 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.600
 seconds and it is on snow at 190 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.390
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.399
 and that's all very neat yet 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.289
 more remarkable is how the engine with its 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.119
 fuel 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:31.940
 the neighborhood where already broke on an average 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.229
 out of five minutes on under kilometers 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.080
 that is made possible by 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.030
 stop and start system and by system 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.979
 that energy recovers at a time when 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.730
 the car delayed after a term you 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.070
 often belong back to you 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:47.220
 the design of cars is form follows 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.470
 function at the shuttle and is that at 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.630
 this ds 4 literally the other way around 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.280
 as far as the appearance of the car the 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.290
 rear them because very porting 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.570
 tight forms a loop worked out point 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.020
 to the door I opened there 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.400
 by hidden door handles in the car 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.980
 the passage to the inside is something to do 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.220
 the tight side by coat note together 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.960
 should also be eligible for membership car ring 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.880
 What is even more striking is that the windows and 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.530
 cannot open the back papers 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.600
 CitroÃ«n already indicates that with the 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.160
 development of the car design 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.170
 receives more attention 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.180
 and actually had priorities 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.710
 compared to a practical utility 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.500
 and then we arrive at the positioning 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.000
 of the car because there is DS4 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.220
 very much like a more complete one 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.170
 special rear doors 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.960
 the weather cabinets stand out even more 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.640
 along with the well behind mine 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.640
 we also see the sporty character 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.170
 the interior with its aluminum pedals 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.320
 excellent seats with 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.850
 exceptionally good lateral support 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.880
 and then also an accelerated pastry with 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.920
 short and clear strokes and a steering wheel 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.709
 is good and then air and sufficient 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.420
 Gives feedback from the front wheels if you want 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.680
 enjoy nature more or just more 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.600
 have more light in the interior 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.030
 then they can do without jokes 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.090
 be pushed back but by the 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.739
 huge before it becomes visible 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.630
 that is an element very recognizable for 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.790
 cheater and some things just that 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.600
 creative approaches 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.180
 have more than one 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.260
 navigation system that did a great job 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.790
 is doing 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.670
 and the operation of the navigation system 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.739
 now still with buttons on the dashboard 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.020
 but in the near future so that through 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.520
 touch-screen go of the steering wheel 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.500
 actually earns a manual 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.580
 itself for it is really littered with 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.260
 buttons 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.280
 it takes some getting used to but as your terms 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.490
 you can master it 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.660
 actually all blindly serve 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.600
 and it actually has a very logical one 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.250
 layout is the seating position in the car 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.930
 fine that is due to the adjustment 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.860
 possibilities of controlling the 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.050
 seats 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.900
 In addition, the view or 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.030
 it is fine with regard to the front 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.110
 to the rear, on the other hand, is one 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.390
 a lot less 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.650
 and it comes through a small one again 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.070
 backwards 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.180
 a wide b-styles a hefty c-style 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.220
 but again offer the 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.130
 rear parking sensors and it 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.590
 sam system outcome sam what stands for 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.840
 surveillance angles tomorrow 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.950
 that is translated into Dutch dead 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.450
 angle sensor 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.860
 well it's a fairly long ferry ride 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.210
 therefore tend to be strong 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.400
 accelerate 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.320
 his nose adding and for 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.390
 ceramic diving considerably 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.070
 maybe it is and e-hdi has car though 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.890
 a bit apart from the turbo hole 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.470
 but once the turbo comes in then 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.120
 there is one the great acceleration 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.530
 well the remains good study and curves 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.110
 and that is something I actually didn't have 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.720
 expected and grip, the car is very capable 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.040
 the broad michelin energy saver that below 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.780
 sit in the car 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.610
 have a high band for a long time making the 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.010
 grip and the car will not soon 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.720
 send because we also have money 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.060
 so the control because it delivers enough 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.410
 comment about the ship's level 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.940
 front wheels 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.830
 the switch goes fine through 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.770
 a six speed gearbox with short and 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.680
 clear strokes and sixth gear 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.480
 money really when an oven turns the old one 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.370
 the sporty can be driven but the 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.040
 ds4 can also be driven purely for comfort 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:04.370
 are then made possible 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.670
 by well insulated interior dick 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.190
 upholstered seats that 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.050
 excellent set and also good 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.430
 adjustable 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.290
 and the can also be en route 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.760
 massaged both front seats 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.180
 so that becomes praying for them in between 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.180
 can sit 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:18.680
 The DS4 is a car that looks like premium 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.690
 can be great due to a powerful appearance 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.160
 and excellent equipment and a very successful one 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.930
 interior 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.820
 the car has that sporting qualities 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.850
 they certainly point to my opinion more 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.200
 focused on comfort than on sportiness 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:34.800
 the car offers great comfort long 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.750
 distances is economical has a large 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.090
 range and it is pleasant to put on 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.950
 boarding and sporting driving 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:43.770
 made possible by men with 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:47.460
 a lot of grip with stuck sitting chairs 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:49.110
 with excellent lateral support and 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.020
 clear control and tight 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.880
 switching six-sided clarity 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.590
 backwards, but somewhat reduced 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.229
 inside again the parking sensors 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:00.150
 and the sam system outcome 

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:02.700
 the ds4 usually try harder 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:05.700
 splits comfort to sportsmanship 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:07.830
 Combining the balance that took him away 

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:11.370
 to comfort and there a fruit cars 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:12.990
 and works great but the sporty 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:16.370
 drivers would make themselves a litter french 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.370
 Godendo feel great at home 

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:19.969
 of the
