00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello friends in this is my first top 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.049
 I will show you the 5 online fps games 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.269
 action with what you can spend 10 years 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.280
 locked in your house telling you all 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.170
 the days I want to clarify that they are not 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.860
 uglier to the best but I put the ones that 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.609
 I liked them 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.699
 the first one is operation 7 operation 7 is 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.590
 undoubtedly the most famous fps of the genre and 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.560
 it's like that because of its captivating graphic environment 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.300
 and auditory play operation 7 is to feel 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.730
 the tension of being in the field of 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.430
 battle with a rifle shotgun or revolver 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.130
 in your hands you have a realistic combat and 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.960
 has more than 10 scenarios to go up 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.300
 range you have to kill people as 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.559
 that you go killing you are winning 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.570
 experience and gold with which you will buy 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.059
 armament and equipment and climb this 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.039
 range you can also avoid weapons 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.200
 that you bought as long as you have 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.820
 enough money the only thing that I do not 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.860
 liked the game is the voice of the one who 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.570
 translated the audio into Spanish since it has 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.149
 fagot's voice but the truth is 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.730
 I highly recommend the second one is the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.680
 combat arms combat arms is a fps 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.409
 action set in modern times 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.630
 with very good graphics combat in 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.030
 different maps and has up to 6 modes 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.680
 different gameplay its gameplay is 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.719
 similar to counter strike 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.700
 you have to get new ranges and win 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:16.740
 games to buy new weapons and 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.720
 equipment the weapons are not 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.640
 permanent and a week disappear 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.890
 because the creators of the game are very 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.570
 stingy but thank God for 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.520
 give us a gift since the new ones 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.549
 players start with enough money 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.380
 to buy weapons this game does not 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.210
 I played it a lot because the very fucking ones do not 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.970
 they gave me no time to start that I already 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.849
 charged the third is wah rock 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.189
 war rock is also a tactical fps 

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:42.750
 military owns small maps and very maps 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.289
 great in which you can play 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.729
 games of 16 players maximum 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:49.860
 characterized by the armament the game 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.259
 individual or group and good missions 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.270
 and maps what I liked most about the games 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.490
 is that you can drive motorcycle cars 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.549
 helicopters aircraft and so on 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.340
 something like battlefield 2 fourth is the 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.829
 point blank probably the fps more 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.989
 similar to the counter strike as in all 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.690
 the fps you have to gain experience and 

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:11.579
 buy different types of weapons one of 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.500
 the advantages is that the rounds are for 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:16.080
 missions and you do not have waiting time 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.840
 when you're killed, you only wait 4 seconds 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.120
 and you start one of its modes at your base 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.890
 most famous is the dinosaur mode but 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.110
 the very birds creators of the game 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.030
 they shit the way because now the kids 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.160
 can enter anywhere that before 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.040
 it was impenetrable to them but outside 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.470
 of that the game is very good and the fifth 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.140
 and last is the golf that andy wolfe you 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.000
 ames obviously another fps the look that 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.800
 what makes it unique is that the player can 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.510
 alter its appearance between a marine in 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.610
 first person and a werewolf in 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.220
 third person by simply pressing a 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.650
 button the game is fast and balanced and 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.840
 like the rest of the fps, you also have to 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.940
 earn gold to buy weapons edit your 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.130
 wolf or marine and experience to climb 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.020
 of rank may not know them many 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.750
 but I recommend them because it has some 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.530
 graphics of the fucking good mother friends 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.480
 that was it 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.670
 do not forget to comment score and 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.709

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.709
