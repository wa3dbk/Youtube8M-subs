00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.690
 Or by anointing with oil or 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:53.010
 through forgiveness of sins or through 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:56.970

 let them and they should pray for him and 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.550
 In doing so, add anointing with oil in the name of 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.010
 Lord and the field of faith for 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.140

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.080

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.970
 will be saved 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.790
 but he who does not believe will be damned 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.519
 these signs will be the ones 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.320
 to accompany the believers in 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.220
 in my name they will demonize 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.940
 cast out 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.709
 you will speak in new languages 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.420
 they will pick up snakes and if 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.880
 she would drink something deadly 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.220
 they do not hurt them 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:09.720
 Put your hands up and they will 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:12.060

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.350
 but they went out and 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.810
 preached everywhere and therefore worked 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:25.250
 with you and reinforces the word 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.250
