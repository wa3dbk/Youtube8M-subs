animation<00:02:57.210> so<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:58.470> then<00:02:58.590> you<00:02:58.650> just<00:02:58.770> keep

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
animation so and then you just keep

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.410 
animation so and then you just keep
battling<00:02:59.160> back<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.520> forth<00:02:59.730> until<00:03:00.210> you're

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
projectile better okay it's as easy as

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.840 
projectile better okay it's as easy as
that<00:04:57.000> and<00:04:57.120> then<00:04:57.600> using<00:04:58.410> backhand<00:04:59.100> and<00:04:59.310> any<00:04:59.699> of

that and then using backhand and any of
the<00:04:59.940> directions<00:05:00.320> will<00:05:02.720> well<00:05:03.720> for<00:05:03.840> example<00:05:04.200> so

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
the directions will well for example so

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.530 
the directions will well for example so
there<00:05:04.860> I<00:05:04.889> just<00:05:05.160> intercepted<00:05:05.580> his<00:05:05.940> projectile

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
there I just intercepted his projectile

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.280 
there I just intercepted his projectile
in<00:05:06.810> midair<00:05:07.520> back<00:05:08.520> and<00:05:08.850> down<00:05:09.090> for<00:05:09.330> example<00:05:09.450> will

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
in midair back and down for example will

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.460 
in midair back and down for example will
do<00:05:10.530> this<00:05:10.680> kind<00:05:10.889> of<00:05:10.919> attack<00:05:11.220> back<00:05:12.120> and<00:05:12.389> up<00:05:12.540> will

intercepted me in the middle my special

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.820 
intercepted me in the middle my special
move<00:05:17.010> there<00:05:17.250> alright<00:05:18.090> and<00:05:18.389> you<00:05:19.260> can<00:05:19.289> also<00:05:19.500> make

example you could do that while you're
jumping<00:05:23.130> I<00:05:24.110> mean<00:05:25.110> let<00:05:25.289> me<00:05:25.320> jump<00:05:26.389> you<00:05:27.389> can<00:05:27.600> you

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
jumping I mean let me jump you can you

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.189

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 
can jump and attack forward so it's

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.340 
can jump and attack forward so it's
going<00:05:31.979> to<00:05:32.100> be<00:05:32.190> a<00:05:32.630> very<00:05:33.630> intuitive<00:05:33.930> battle
