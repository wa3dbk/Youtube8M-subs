00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
and that's now saying sold out because I

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.580 
and that's now saying sold out because I
only<00:01:57.090> had<00:01:57.300> one<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.660> those<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.200> defended

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
down here are mint and gum selections

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.930 
down here are mint and gum selections
here<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.800> what<00:02:04.920> these<00:02:05.070> things<00:02:05.130> do<00:02:05.550> is<00:02:05.700> pull

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
here and what these things do is pull

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.910 
here and what these things do is pull
down<00:02:06.180> it's<00:02:06.510> got<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.660> weight<00:02:06.900> that's<00:02:06.930> on<00:02:07.320> top<00:02:07.590> the

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
down it's got a weight that's on top the

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.430 
down it's got a weight that's on top the
mints<00:02:08.250> would<00:02:08.429> go<00:02:08.580> in<00:02:08.729> here<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.630> then<00:02:10.290> the

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
mints would go in here and then the

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.310 
mints would go in here and then the
weight<00:02:10.619> would<00:02:11.280> fall<00:02:11.730> down<00:02:12.020> and<00:02:13.020> apply

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
weight would fall down and apply

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.830 
weight would fall down and apply
pressure<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:14.150> make<00:02:15.150> sure<00:02:15.270> that<00:02:15.450> they've<00:02:15.570> end

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
pressure to make sure that they've end

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.540 
pressure to make sure that they've end
out<00:02:16.050> properly<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:18.980> you'll<00:02:19.980> see<00:02:20.190> here<00:02:20.430> when

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
out properly and you'll see here when

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.700 
out properly and you'll see here when
you<00:02:20.640> actually<00:02:20.820> pull<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.360> selection<00:02:22.020> what

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
you actually pull the selection what

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:23.930 
you actually pull the selection what
it's<00:02:22.860> going<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.040> do<00:02:23.250> is<00:02:23.400> it's<00:02:23.430> actually<00:02:23.640> going

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
it's going to do is it's actually going

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.449 
it's going to do is it's actually going
to<00:02:24.030> drop<00:02:24.270> these<00:02:24.540> out<00:02:24.810> so<00:02:27.830> so<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:28.950> bottom<00:02:29.310> will

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
to drop these out so so the bottom will

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.540 
to drop these out so so the bottom will
fall<00:02:29.670> out<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:32.209> the<00:02:33.209> candy<00:02:33.660> would<00:02:33.780> obviously

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
fall out and the candy would obviously

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.030 
fall out and the candy would obviously
drop<00:02:35.550> from<00:02:35.880> there<00:02:38.060> at<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.270> bottom<00:02:39.630> there

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
drop from there at the bottom there

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.100 
drop from there at the bottom there

see<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:24.310> bottom<00:03:24.700> here<00:03:25.030> will<00:03:25.630> rotate<00:03:26.140> sooo<00:03:26.290> i

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
see the bottom here will rotate sooo i

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.250 
see the bottom here will rotate sooo i
get<00:03:26.560> to<00:03:26.620> get<00:03:26.740> shot<00:03:26.980> on<00:03:27.130> that<00:03:27.540> will<00:03:28.540> rotate<00:03:29.050> back

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
get to get shot on that will rotate back

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.730 
get to get shot on that will rotate back
and<00:03:29.440> forth<00:03:30.480> well<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:32.680> last<00:03:34.200> slot<00:03:35.200> up<00:03:35.440> here

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
and forth well the last slot up here

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.760 
and forth well the last slot up here
would<00:03:36.250> actually<00:03:36.960> if<00:03:37.960> i<00:03:38.140> can<00:03:38.290> get<00:03:38.350> it<00:03:38.410> up<00:03:38.590> there

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
would actually if i can get it up there

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.319 
would actually if i can get it up there
real<00:03:38.980> quick<00:03:39.630> right<00:03:40.630> exactly

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
pressure to this once this last one

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.649 
pressure to this once this last one
drops<00:03:51.379> out<00:03:51.590> of<00:03:51.680> the<00:03:51.739> way<00:03:52.329> there's<00:03:53.329> nothing

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
left to apply pressure on this and it

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.270 
left to apply pressure on this and it
reads<00:03:57.260> sold<00:03:57.499> out<00:03:57.680> and<00:03:58.129> it<00:03:58.700> will<00:03:58.879> no<00:03:59.090> longer

from probably the mid 30s throughout the

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:36.850 
from probably the mid 30s throughout the
50s<00:04:34.190> I<00:04:34.820> started<00:04:35.449> using<00:04:35.599> vending<00:04:36.139> counters<00:04:36.590> on

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
50s I started using vending counters on

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.219 
50s I started using vending counters on
the<00:04:37.460> late<00:04:37.639> 50s<00:04:38.180> so<00:04:38.449> it<00:04:38.780> would<00:04:38.900> have<00:04:38.930> started

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
the late 50s so it would have started

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:41.279 
the late 50s so it would have started
phasing<00:04:39.470> them<00:04:39.650> out<00:04:39.830> these<00:04:40.130> would<00:04:40.310> have<00:04:40.340> been<00:04:40.460> a

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.289 
phasing them out these would have been a

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:46.360 
phasing them out these would have been a
teal<00:04:42.289> red<00:04:43.099> yellow<00:04:43.970> blue<00:04:44.570> ish<00:04:44.900> this<00:04:45.889> one<00:04:46.099> as<00:04:46.220> you

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
and won't stay that way very long so

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.240
