00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:17.439

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.960
 I was really a source of bacteria there 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.859
 only physically I am going to need people so not clean 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.619
 at the start there was the plague in diepenbeek the holiday is still thinking 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:33.730
 sold on childcare 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.210
 9 from this industry 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.670

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.860

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.860

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.440
 so he goes 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.580

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.030
 you can't help it if you do 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.250
 8 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.250
 at the expo that here 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.150

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.740
 and I saw this week rise 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.260
 I can try again with the file

 yes rb class a3t shampoo 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.340
 Baby shampoo itself but does not kill bacteria and detergent 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.820
 therefore closed a number of highways for research 8 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.530
 before that you have the quantities of football stadium seems to be the best 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.570
 super combination 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.200
 very well 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.200
 I've never had them 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.060
 I do have more nec and you could have done it because the sentiment is under it 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.420
 always up 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.440
 whatever you want but nice 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.440
 But if you mua that is almost gone 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.250
 just take away from forging 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.000

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:10.549

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:13.659
 I also know you quite a bit what actually 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.659
 and then look at it with your class just like that 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.329
 jack clarke 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.339
 then let you 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:27.339
 they shut up 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:30.649
 clean in hair 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:34.039
 on your hand 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:36.699
 take shelter spain 

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:39.569
 and soon 8 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.249
 that usually comes too premature 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:45.249
 I actually only used it once 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.949
 2 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:51.609

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:58.019

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.880
 that data from the uv that 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.109

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.149
 okay in his house in a hotel 

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:07.149
 Yes of course 

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:26.549
 afterwards they can be dug up 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:27.949
 you have that par excellence 

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:31.819
 I got your steak fries at the Keukenhof last night 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:34.409
 the people from Eindhoven 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:36.699
 we have 

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:39.149
 to delete the shoot 

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:41.459
 I work 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.489

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.489
 because Hoogeveen 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.889
 trijntje mh 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:04.720
 you just have 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.319
 now it seems to do it 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.279
 desperate office items 

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:14.749
 nothing if not the drop and aunt cor pot let me in the 2 0 

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:18.590
 and that shows with goal line 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.340
 that makes the start of the nma 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.210
 or worse 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.210
 it is nothing for every 250 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.289
 the one does not find it easy yes I find or sometimes not happy with the 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.879
 buy the results of something 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:36.879
 on the other hand, it's not about being more powerful 

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:42.219
 Watercourse along the way back but it stopped at Koksijde many more bags 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:45.460
