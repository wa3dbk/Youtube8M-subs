now we've been tracking this in several
different<00:00:29.490> places<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.679> it's<00:00:31.679> been<00:00:31.920> appearing

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
different places and it's been appearing

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.069 
different places and it's been appearing
and<00:00:32.969> disappearing<00:00:33.030> off<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.489> various<00:00:35.489> software

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
and disappearing off of various software

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.580 
and disappearing off of various software
in<00:00:37.079> terms<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.530> its<00:00:37.680> flight<00:00:37.829> plans<00:00:38.540> but<00:00:39.590> now

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
in terms of its flight plans but now

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.900 
in terms of its flight plans but now
we've<00:00:40.770> captured<00:00:41.010> some<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.610> but<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:41.850> is

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
we've captured some of it but this is

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.569 
we've captured some of it but this is
probably<00:00:42.239> one<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.629> better<00:00:42.780> ones<00:00:43.489> now<00:00:44.489> if

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
probably one of the better ones now if

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
on tracking right here but let's go back

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.910 
on tracking right here but let's go back
to<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.510> grand

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
to the grand

to the grand
Kaneria<00:02:13.370> real<00:02:13.670> quick<00:02:15.819> say<00:02:16.819> words<00:02:17.239> here<00:02:17.989> we<00:02:18.080> go

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
Kaneria real quick say words here we go

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.809 
Kaneria real quick say words here we go
so<00:02:19.190> we'll<00:02:19.280> follow<00:02:19.489> it<00:02:19.670> down<00:02:21.160> and<00:02:22.160> you<00:02:22.190> can<00:02:22.489> see

so we'll follow it down and you can see

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.930 
so we'll follow it down and you can see
where<00:02:23.569> the<00:02:23.720> flight<00:02:23.989> started<00:02:24.530> out<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:25.610> notice
