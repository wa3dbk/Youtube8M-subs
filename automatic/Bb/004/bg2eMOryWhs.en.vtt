 I commented that here it is there I already commented 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.030
 This is on the channel, but I did not say 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:39.039
 a lot about it so I decided to do 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:41.829

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:43.870

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.640

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.109
 give a standard note 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:04.809
 and there for example he took between 9 and 10 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.990
 tufik first scare took between 7 and 8 and 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.940
 9 15 and one knows then can have many 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.490
 first may not have any first 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.560
 only a second is very new, but it is 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.310
 legal at least do not confess one with 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.080
 another knows everything depends on you he and I 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.160
 I'll show you a little bit of my essay. 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:27.910
 now 28th on Thursday and then I go 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:30.910
 show the backstage there so this is it 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:34.630
 Look, if I show you mine. 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.670
 This is my costume. 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.480
 as much as I do ballet I go 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:44.520
 attend in freestyle 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:48.070
 You and I were looking here 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.880
 by the site they released something from the south 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:55.210
 in dance and at least if you number 109 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:59.320
 introduce myself but it's a style group 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.870
 free and the first time I 'm going to compete 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.620
 with an adult people because they have juvenile 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.410
 advanced juvenile child 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:11.400
 adult master and advanced adult 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:13.740
 so I'm not that old and so is this 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.580
 That's because the focus shows more to you. 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.580
 think like this 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:28.989
 people here on Tuesday were very 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.439
 windy and that business was 17 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.689
 but in the middle of the road they face said 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:37.260
 she 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:37.260
 arriving and 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:03:06.030
 so that there has already got 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:07.769
 and that's it, I do not know, I think 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:18.480
 I'm recording and cutting the deputy 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:21.540
 My cool face , here we are. 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.959
 in a room with this floor because people 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:28.019
 you are not in a shoe and not with 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.659
 sneaker because as I said 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:39.150
 We're going to release a second book, you know. 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:42.030
 hence it is with a man if not show of 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:47.459
 little nothing to dance known he is 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:50.870
 permeable and there the ground for power 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.870
 download the jump 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.260
 although I think there in the south in 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.989
 dance will not be so it will be smaller and the 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:02.760
 that for those who do not know something black 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:04.859
 As soon as it's on the floor, I'll see if the 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.139
 as in our horrible face I'll see if 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:09.440
 I 'll show you some of the essay. 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.440
 OK 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:20.110

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:20.110
