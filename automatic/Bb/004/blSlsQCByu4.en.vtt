00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:14.669
 I have 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.840
 welcome to the fifa-wm forecast 2010 Germany against Ghana is the 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.629
 Game what is on the program today is an eminently important one for both teams 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.140
 Game is about to move into the second round who wins here is next 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.120
 that is the formation of Ghana 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.190
 and then of course we know kevin-prince Boateng from midfield 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.300
 The Ballack has tasted the World Cup, he overlooked a hot game in front of him 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.690
 and the lineup of Germany that Cacau into the team 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.499
 everything else in the old we get started 

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:01.600
 and that's just Goller that's a good block that can hold its own on PCP 

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:05.330
 a lot of space trying to flank but Friedrich is alert is wide awake 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.840
 and that's annoying but again with the exception of the left back 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.990
 In the meantime, I think, right behind a stop-loss brand 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.100
 Ott FCK APA 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.450
 what a chance Yogi's team 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.940
 her order from Germany 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.090
 I do not care that it's here in Germany and Laden has the ball on 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.180
 Müller, which is feasible, is actually fast with work processes 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.620
 the topic proves quite bitter at loss 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.829
 and now Asamoah does not care about Mertesacker God 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.870
 we had alone before new what does the 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.790
 Theater Chur 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.490
 the new Galatasaray Istanbul 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.190
 the one can easily slip past new ones at Mertesacker and 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:42.850
 Friedrich 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.770
 not the reason for this is careless ball loss of Müller 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.710
 in the midfield 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.720
 and very bitter for Germany 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.750
 Next year, Germany's elsewhere the beauty brings know now 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.160
 that it Podolski Podolski back on Badstuber Badstuber Schweinsteiger the 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.909
 offers itself 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.840
 and two we also before and quirky none of pass on ozil the 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.850
 a dream pass 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.659
 also Schweinsteiger Schweinsteiger against two man that may like 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.880
 but one loses the ball but just as clearly loses 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.629
 Downhill in the forest pool that he was there as Schweinsteiger 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.629
 two ec cards Holzheim II 2 a 

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:14.919
 a free country 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:17.919
 what a flop to Bastian 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:20.809
 directly under the bar 

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:24.259
 literally «an insane gate of Bastian Schweinsteiger just always 

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:27.099
 more valuable for the German national team since Ballacks 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.809
 from literally the undisputed boss in the midfield is and now even the 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:33.469
 makes important goals 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:37.229
 1zu1 Germany against Ghana all open again by a great goal of 

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:39.609
 Bastian Schweinsteiger 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:40.759
 I do not care 

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:44.389
 Ghana Ghana's main castle next to Boateng now has the ball 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:47.009
 is a bit free but huge and what makes Boateng 

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:49.669
 can assert himself and further strengthen the ball what he does 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.629
 Dieter Kempf at the cash market 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.709
 later he parried a penny what an act of Manuel newer 

00:02:56.249 --> 00:03:00.290
 Spokesman Afflecks because he keeps his team in the game and that's great 

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:02.069
 Goalkeeper from all the time 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.259
 properly demanded and then if need be they are there to the point 

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:08.259
 next scene again Germany more beautiful than when the pass from Friedrich 

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:09.790
 on Müller and he has the ball 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.900
 Nice pass on selling what makes the Charité actually he is fast 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.149
 he dares the duo suitable as against a betrayal of the bankruptcy bank 

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:17.909
 Schweinsteiger met 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.499
 so little pressure a little too much of the load because he has no more pressure 

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:22.539
 can build up 

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:26.119
 and that was the last action of the first half we speak directly into the 

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:30.319
 second half in the 57 Tamino Tonda gp-winner out for him, it came into play 

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:34.099
 much optimistic runs let's hope hopefully brings fun 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:36.519
 and that he is back Germany Germany is now pushing for the 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.639
 Baldi's drives were more self-sufficient except Podolski what was 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.829
 Podolski out on Holger Badstuber the developer as she comes forward 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.230
 what math or strong attack on GameStar de Santis Germany 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.019
 but weakly shot 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.199
 no problem for shiny he has quite loose 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:56.199
 But this can not be a problem for Ghana's keeper at all 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:01.230
 Deußer das Badstuber was Schweinsteiger the next scene again 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.900
 out on big that came to big law firms nice flank Bas Magath 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.759
 Jakob Ortlieb 1 1 

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:08.419
 later over it 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:11.519
 Reingard Berger the deep in the Brazilian bag of tricks when one 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:12.789
 Casting provided 

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:15.779
 scheduled like him a monument in Germany 

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:18.060
 and the next scene again Germany must now slow 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.329
 sometimes the next goal shoot otherwise it will be pretty tight 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.710
 that's what they came up for on Lamla Massmart Gerd Blome 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.120
 Cantatas and then the lattice gate 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.449
 Geißler as third from 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:31.879
 Obama is 

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:34.499
 Germany one lap further 

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:38.360
 Flank of Philipp Lahm or Mario Barth that must then also turn his head 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.800
 see further 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.849
 and next scene again Germany Ghana can not live anymore 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:46.129
 liberating has no chance this is Toni Kroos but Nico past two men 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:49.229
 Toni Toss has revised 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:50.800
 Geithner already 3 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.800
 Red out 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.270
 Germany stands 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.159
 the World Cup 2010 he should return to the staff selection 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:04.509
 off periodically 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:07.509
 hand-crafted against them this time was mirror-smooth 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.599
 We did not stop all guests 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:15.699
 Performance of Jogi Löw that was the fifa-wm forecast 2010 thank you 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:16.969
 sack Sarah Baganz
