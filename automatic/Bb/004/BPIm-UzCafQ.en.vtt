00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
controller because there's no way of

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.700 
controller because there's no way of
mapping<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.660> controller<00:00:54.989> as<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.350> do<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.590> like

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
mapping the controller as you do it like

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.250 
mapping the controller as you do it like
hand<00:00:56.070> by<00:00:56.250> hand<00:00:56.460> like<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.789> takes<00:00:57.000> ages<00:00:57.239> but<00:00:58.079> if<00:00:58.170> I

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
hand by hand like it takes ages but if I

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.360 
hand by hand like it takes ages but if I
open<00:00:58.410> up<00:00:58.559> Virtual<00:00:58.949> DJ<00:00:59.100> now<00:01:01.100> I'll<00:01:02.100> show<00:01:02.340> you

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.219 

you

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.270 

basically<00:01:13.100> our<00:01:13.219> moving<00:01:13.759> my<00:01:13.939> controller

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
basically our moving my controller

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.420 
basically our moving my controller
pressing<00:01:16.280> buttons<00:01:16.670> I<00:01:17.860> drag<00:01:18.860> a<00:01:18.890> song<00:01:19.159> in<00:01:19.369> a

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
pressing buttons I drag a song in a

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.080 
pressing buttons I drag a song in a
press<00:01:19.610> play<00:01:20.799> they<00:01:21.799> won't<00:01:22.039> play<00:01:22.219> and<00:01:22.729> moving

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
press play they won't play and moving

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.060 
press play they won't play and moving
the<00:01:23.179> turntable<00:01:23.810> tune<00:01:24.409> everything<00:01:24.799> up<00:01:24.950> and

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
the turntable tune everything up and

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.249 
the turntable tune everything up and
down<00:01:25.250> all<00:01:26.149> the<00:01:26.210> knowledge<00:01:26.570> but<00:01:26.719> making<00:01:26.990> a<00:01:27.049> whip

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
down all the knowledge but making a whip

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.889 
down all the knowledge but making a whip
and<00:01:28.189> that's<00:01:28.939> obviously<00:01:29.299> because<00:01:29.569> it's<00:01:29.720> not

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
and that's obviously because it's not

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.169 
and that's obviously because it's not
maps<00:01:30.170> and<00:01:30.439> at<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.340> moment<00:01:31.700> numark<00:01:32.149> mixtrack

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:32.179 
maps and at the moment numark mixtrack

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:34.809 
maps and at the moment numark mixtrack
pro<00:01:32.509> 2<00:01:32.720> is<00:01:32.990> not<00:01:33.110> compatible<00:01:33.409> with<00:01:33.679> it<00:01:33.799> so<00:01:34.549> I

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:34.819 
pro 2 is not compatible with it so I

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:36.190 
pro 2 is not compatible with it so I
went<00:01:35.030> online<00:01:35.119> and<00:01:35.270> I<00:01:35.509> managed<00:01:35.840> to<00:01:35.869> find<00:01:35.990> a

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
went online and I managed to find a

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.760 
went online and I managed to find a
website<00:01:36.409> here<00:01:36.950> it's<00:01:37.880> on<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.119> Newmark<00:01:38.770> website

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.069 
and it allowed me to just download files

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:45.669 
and it allowed me to just download files
install<00:01:43.579> my<00:01:43.759> computer<00:01:44.179> so<00:01:44.479> that<00:01:44.509> I<00:01:44.780> have<00:01:45.110> it

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679
