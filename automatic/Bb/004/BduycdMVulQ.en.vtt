00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.750
 we spoke earlier 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.019
 for a long time they have to take advantage of it 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.630
 brice ollivier would be that for 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:37.290
 the moment it is much better than in 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:41.010
 much of it replaced the re-entering it 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.750
 puts behind practice 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:52.199
 just behind them a good slap 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:01:10.530
 here it is the shot in the foot 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:01:11.180
 done that will go superb do it all 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.380

 we know that his services have a lot 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.790
 embarrassed brisseau since the beginning of the match 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.780
 five-seater everywhere 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.970
 otherwise there are a few movies served 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:02:05.180
 the fecq web languages well done it's 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:07.410
 also because we speed because 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.149
 sometimes it's a bit slow at 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.830
 level of displacements a lot 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:24.959
 a lot of efficiency in everything he 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:30.240
 did he bring back rim brought back observe 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:34.340
 of a wagon he was caught up and 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.340
 win this set france this way there 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:03:24.959
 it also happens good game could 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:24.959
 conclude I prefer to take this ball 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.920
 on duty 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.280
 but it's won for brice ollivier who 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:56.280
 allows romagna
