basic<00:00:13.760> theory<00:00:14.030> behind<00:00:14.120> using<00:00:14.990> the<00:00:15.290> needle

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:15.530 
basic theory behind using the needle

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.410 
basic theory behind using the needle
threader<00:00:15.889> is<00:00:16.420> pulling<00:00:17.420> the<00:00:17.510> tab<00:00:18.040> the<00:00:19.040> tab

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.420 
threader is pulling the tab the tab

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.410 
threader is pulling the tab the tab
comes<00:00:20.420> down<00:00:20.720> and<00:00:21.050> there<00:00:21.890> is<00:00:22.070> this<00:00:22.340> hook<00:00:22.730> that

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
comes down and there is this hook that

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.880 
comes down and there is this hook that
will<00:00:23.779> be<00:00:23.900> really<00:00:24.170> difficult<00:00:24.200> to<00:00:24.680> see<00:00:24.860> on

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
will be really difficult to see on

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.060 
will be really difficult to see on
camera<00:00:25.279> but<00:00:25.700> it's<00:00:25.820> there<00:00:26.119> trust<00:00:26.419> me<00:00:27.070> slides

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
camera but it's there trust me slides

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.790 
camera but it's there trust me slides
through<00:00:28.580> the<00:00:29.509> eye<00:00:29.540> of<00:00:29.779> the<00:00:29.869> needle<00:00:29.899> and<00:00:30.349> waits

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
through the eye of the needle and waits

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.610 
through the eye of the needle and waits
to<00:00:31.160> grab<00:00:31.579> onto<00:00:31.790> the<00:00:32.090> thread<00:00:32.390> so<00:00:32.599> the<00:00:33.230> thread<00:00:33.500> is

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
to grab onto the thread so the thread is

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.639 
to grab onto the thread so the thread is
going<00:00:33.739> to<00:00:33.890> be<00:00:33.980> coming<00:00:34.309> from<00:00:34.850> this<00:00:35.090> guide

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:35.649 
going to be coming from this guide

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.459 
going to be coming from this guide
around<00:00:36.649> this<00:00:37.399> guide<00:00:37.930> it's<00:00:38.930> going<00:00:39.140> to<00:00:39.230> sit

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
around this guide it's going to sit

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:42.100 
around this guide it's going to sit
under<00:00:39.680> here<00:00:40.250> and<00:00:40.940> at<00:00:41.239> that<00:00:41.450> point<00:00:41.690> the<00:00:41.899> hook

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
under here and at that point the hook

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.040 
under here and at that point the hook
will<00:00:42.290> grab<00:00:42.590> it<00:00:42.800> and<00:00:42.980> pull<00:00:43.940> it<00:00:44.090> through<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:45.020> eye

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
will grab it and pull it through the eye

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.250 
will grab it and pull it through the eye
of<00:00:45.410> the<00:00:45.500> needle<00:00:45.530> so<00:00:49.539> the<00:00:50.539> thread<00:00:50.809> is<00:00:50.929> coming

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
of the needle so the thread is coming

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.729 
of the needle so the thread is coming
around<00:00:51.350> this<00:00:51.769> guide<00:00:52.480> under<00:00:53.480> here<00:00:53.899> and<00:00:54.530> then<00:00:54.620> if

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
around this guide under here and then if

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.049

I gently let go you can see that the

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.989 
I gently let go you can see that the
hook<00:00:59.469> has<00:01:00.469> pulled<00:01:00.859> the<00:01:00.980> thread<00:01:01.309> through<00:01:01.909> the

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:01.999 
hook has pulled the thread through the

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:03.700 
hook has pulled the thread through the
eye<00:01:02.269> of<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:02.659> needle<00:01:02.690> now<00:01:03.199> you<00:01:03.260> can<00:01:03.530> reach
