00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
now this is actually helped me quite a

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.430 
now this is actually helped me quite a
lot<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.270> I've<00:00:48.539> been<00:00:48.660> noticing<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.200> quite<00:00:49.410> a

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
lot and I've been noticing it quite a

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.650 
lot and I've been noticing it quite a
lot<00:00:49.680> on<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.829> web<00:00:49.980> app<00:00:50.129> whether<00:00:50.430> all<00:00:50.700> sort<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.539> a

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
lot on the web app whether all sort of a

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.630 
lot on the web app whether all sort of a
stay<00:00:51.870> for<00:00:52.230> when<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.649> actual<00:00:53.219> game<00:00:53.280> on<00:00:53.550> the

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
stay for when the actual game on the

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.920 
stay for when the actual game on the
console<00:00:53.940> comes<00:00:54.090> out<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.539> different<00:00:54.840> matter

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
console comes out is a different matter

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.549 
console comes out is a different matter
I<00:00:55.260> think<00:00:55.469> it'll<00:00:55.620> kind<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:55.860> flip<00:00:57.170> but<00:00:58.170> when<00:00:58.440> it's

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
I think it'll kind of flip but when it's

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.099 
I think it'll kind of flip but when it's
been<00:00:58.710> late<00:00:58.859> at<00:00:58.980> night<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.370> maybe<00:01:00.300> like<00:01:00.570> 12<00:01:00.840> in

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
been late at night and maybe like 12 in

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.209 
been late at night and maybe like 12 in
the<00:01:01.170> morning<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.680> I've<00:01:01.739> been<00:01:01.859> on<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.070> market

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
the morning and I've been on the market

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.250 
the morning and I've been on the market
there's<00:01:03.090> quite<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.359> few<00:01:03.449> players<00:01:03.809> which<00:01:04.080> were

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
there's quite a few players which were

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.020 
there's quite a few players which were
you<00:01:04.799> know<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:05.070> little<00:01:05.280> bit<00:01:05.430> more<00:01:05.580> expensive

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
you know a little bit more expensive

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.820 
you know a little bit more expensive
than<00:01:06.180> they<00:01:06.360> would<00:01:06.540> be<00:01:06.720> during<00:01:07.200> peak<00:01:07.530> times

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
than they would be during peak times

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.859 
than they would be during peak times
which<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.760> my<00:01:08.939> opinion<00:01:09.060> when<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.570> kids<00:01:09.750> get

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
which is in my opinion when the kids get

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.390 
which is in my opinion when the kids get
back<00:01:10.020> when<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.650> know<00:01:10.740> people<00:01:11.010> get<00:01:11.070> back<00:01:11.250> from

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
back when you know people get back from

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.710 
back when you know people get back from
school<00:01:11.720> so<00:01:12.720> I'd<00:01:12.810> say<00:01:13.049> from<00:01:13.110> around<00:01:13.710> 4pm<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.880> 9pm

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
school so I'd say from around 4pm to 9pm

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.280 
school so I'd say from around 4pm to 9pm
is<00:01:16.020> probably<00:01:16.560> peak<00:01:16.799> times<00:01:17.090> and<00:01:18.090> for<00:01:18.689> example<00:01:18.780> I

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
is probably peak times and for example I

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.320 
is probably peak times and for example I
will<00:01:19.350> go<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.680> have<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.890> look<00:01:20.070> now<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.850> put

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
will go and have a look now I put
