set for 75 percent but as you can see

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.539 
set for 75 percent but as you can see
you<00:01:21.900> can<00:01:22.080> put<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.530> anywhere<00:01:22.680> between<00:01:23.250> zero

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
you can put it anywhere between zero

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.830 
you can put it anywhere between zero
percent<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.509> one<00:01:24.869> hundred<00:01:25.200> percent<00:01:26.840> this

percent and one hundred percent this

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.789 
percent and one hundred percent this
determines<00:01:28.290> when<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.450> ul<00:01:30.450> will<00:01:30.930> be<00:01:31.110> deemed<00:01:31.350> as<00:01:31.619> a

determines when a ul will be deemed as a
duplicate<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.700> another<00:01:33.150> UL<00:01:33.570> let's<00:01:34.320> leave<00:01:34.560> it

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
duplicate of another UL let's leave it

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.170 
duplicate of another UL let's leave it
around<00:01:34.950> for<00:01:35.189> 75<00:01:35.520> percent<00:01:36.119> for<00:01:36.509> now

around for 75 percent for now

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.510 
around for 75 percent for now
then<00:01:38.750> we<00:01:38.930> have<00:01:39.050> some<00:01:39.350> possibilities<00:01:40.280> to

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
then we have some possibilities to

you<00:04:56.720> can<00:04:56.960> as<00:04:57.260> well<00:04:58.060> enable<00:05:00.250> authorization<00:05:01.250> if

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
you can as well enable authorization if

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.050 
you can as well enable authorization if
you<00:05:02.450> have<00:05:03.040> let's<00:05:04.040> say<00:05:04.250> a<00:05:04.280> website<00:05:04.760> that's

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
you have let's say a website that's

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.630 
you have let's say a website that's
online<00:05:05.570> but<00:05:06.110> price<00:05:06.350> were<00:05:06.560> protected<00:05:07.160> for<00:05:07.460> some

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
online but price were protected for some

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.530 
online but price were protected for some
reason<00:05:08.030> you<00:05:08.180> can<00:05:08.660> actually<00:05:10.330> bypass<00:05:11.330> this

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
reason you can actually bypass this

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.060 
reason you can actually bypass this
password<00:05:11.810> by<00:05:12.380> entering<00:05:12.830> it<00:05:13.040> here

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
password by entering it here

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.360 
password by entering it here
that's<00:05:14.340> pretty<00:05:14.700> easy<00:05:14.760> as<00:05:15.060> well<00:05:16.160> you<00:05:17.160> can

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
that's pretty easy as well you can

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.500 
that's pretty easy as well you can
enable<00:05:17.730> explicit<00:05:18.390> URLs<00:05:19.520> that<00:05:20.520> means<00:05:21.030> that<00:05:21.300> if

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
enable explicit URLs that means that if

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.010 
enable explicit URLs that means that if
you<00:05:21.660> have<00:05:21.900> let's<00:05:22.410> say<00:05:22.560> you<00:05:22.620> have<00:05:22.950> a<00:05:22.980> UL<00:05:24.020> let's

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
you have let's say you have a UL let's

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:37.310 
you have let's say you have a UL let's
say<00:05:25.460> www<00:05:26.460> site<00:05:29.600> com<00:05:31.070> /<00:05:33.050> content<00:05:34.790> /<00:05:35.990> if<00:05:36.990> you<00:05:37.110> put

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
say www site com / content / if you put

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.930 
say www site com / content / if you put
that<00:05:37.470> in<00:05:39.260> DC<00:05:40.260> fiber<00:05:40.500> will<00:05:41.040> stay<00:05:41.430> in<00:05:41.670> the

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
that in DC fiber will stay in the

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.630 
that in DC fiber will stay in the
subfolder<00:05:42.570> named<00:05:43.350> content<00:05:43.890> and<00:05:44.070> will<00:05:44.460> only

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
subfolder named content and will only

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.640 
subfolder named content and will only
scan<00:05:45.390> content<00:05:46.140> within<00:05:46.590> that<00:05:46.920> sub<00:05:47.160> folder<00:05:47.580> and

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
scan content within that sub folder and

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.190 
scan content within that sub folder and
that<00:05:49.650> is<00:05:49.830> basically<00:05:50.250> how<00:05:50.820> to<00:05:51.270> set<00:05:51.750> up<00:05:51.780> a<00:05:52.020> new

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
that is basically how to set up a new

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.200 
that is basically how to set up a new
website<00:05:53.360> so<00:05:55.040> you<00:05:56.040> give<00:05:56.220> it<00:05:56.340> a<00:05:56.490> session<00:05:57.060> name

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
website so you give it a session name

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:03.350 
website so you give it a session name
you<00:05:58.080> give<00:05:58.290> it<00:05:58.410> a<00:05:58.500> UL<00:05:58.920> be<00:05:59.270> ww<00:06:00.860> amazon<00:06:01.880> com<00:06:02.880> that's

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
you give it a UL be ww amazon com that's

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.980 
you give it a UL be ww amazon com that's
a<00:06:03.480> good<00:06:03.660> example<00:06:03.780> actually<00:06:04.290> and<00:06:05.660> you<00:06:06.660> can<00:06:06.810> set

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
a good example actually and you can set

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.840 
a good example actually and you can set
all<00:06:07.110> the<00:06:07.260> settings<00:06:07.620> here<00:06:07.860> again<00:06:08.370> and<00:06:08.580> when

all the settings here again and when
you're<00:06:08.970> done<00:06:09.180> you<00:06:09.450> can<00:06:10.050> save<00:06:10.410> and<00:06:10.590> scan<00:06:10.830> I

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.040 
you're done you can save and scan I

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.860 
you're done you can save and scan I

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 
is the DC fiber basic this you find the

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.960 
is the DC fiber basic this you find the
basic<00:06:57.420> well<00:06:57.930> there<00:06:58.680> are<00:06:58.800> a<00:06:58.920> few<00:06:59.280> things<00:06:59.640> yet

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:05.040 
general settings you have a default

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.870 
general settings you have a default
threshold<00:07:05.580> of<00:07:05.760> seventy-five<00:07:06.750> percent

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:07.880 
threshold of seventy-five percent
