00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
do order Freddie's from local farmers so

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.780 
do order Freddie's from local farmers so
these<00:01:31.260> are<00:01:31.440> these<00:01:31.620> are<00:01:31.650> induction<00:01:32.490> stoves

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
these are these are induction stoves

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.550 
these are these are induction stoves
with<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.210> huge<00:01:33.390> electromagnetic<00:01:34.080> energy

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
with a huge electromagnetic energy

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.290 
with a huge electromagnetic energy
that's<00:01:35.010> incredible<00:01:35.670> if<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:35.850> exciting<00:01:36.240> two

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
that's incredible if I exciting two

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.450 
that's incredible if I exciting two
molecules<00:01:36.750> can<00:01:36.900> heat<00:01:37.020> stuff<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.230> lot<00:01:37.380> faster<00:01:37.860> so

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
molecules can heat stuff a lot faster so

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.800 
molecules can heat stuff a lot faster so
it<00:01:38.520> doesn't<00:01:38.760> require<00:01:38.970> as<00:01:39.120> much<00:01:39.210> effort<00:01:39.450> where

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
it doesn't require as much effort where

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.290 
it doesn't require as much effort where
we<00:01:39.870> can<00:01:40.020> experiment<00:01:40.580> technologies<00:01:41.580> and<00:01:41.880> see

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
we can experiment technologies and see

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.730 
we can experiment technologies and see
which<00:01:42.510> ones<00:01:42.750> can<00:01:42.930> really<00:01:43.170> make<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.320> difference

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
which ones can really make a difference

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.500 
which ones can really make a difference
and<00:01:43.890> then<00:01:44.370> we<00:01:44.460> can<00:01:44.610> roll<00:01:44.760> that<00:01:44.790> back<00:01:45.090> out<00:01:45.270> into
