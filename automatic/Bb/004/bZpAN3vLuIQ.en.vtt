00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.190
 This will come in this format here in the 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.170
 format makes it well I liked it low 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.050
 and right-click 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.270
 mouse to open to be able to open 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:08.610

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.799
 it will take a while to download later 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.380
 to have nothing to download will stay here 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:18.600
 red part that will stay with the name 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:21.750

 You come here to open their doors. 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.799
 an era will appear in in downloads 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.040
 This is where you're the creep to 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.670
 work and now you open daemon tools 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.670
 online 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:45.689

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.370
 install now but I'm not going to vote 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.020

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.319

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.220
