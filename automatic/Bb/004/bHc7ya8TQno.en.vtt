00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.959
 unforgettable moment that marked their lives 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.270
 subconscious we realize that what 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:21.000
 changed the life of the Espanyol player 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.310

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.180
 World Incas lived in lands I stay 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.399
 with everything with the friendship that I have with 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.440
 many team mates when 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.839
 the championship with the satisfaction that you 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.760
 we gave a whole country being away 

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:40.949
 being in Peru we did not realize what 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.109
 than what was generated in Mexico and the 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.120
 moment we returned from the championship 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:47.999
 we say in the turn in good turibus 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.370
 with the feeling that something not to forget 

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:51.839
 never in my life one of the figures 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.999
 keys to obtaining said 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:55.319
 championship was chucho ramírez who was 

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:57.960
 the coach of that selection 

00:00:55.319 --> 00:01:00.210
 Dorada worked a lot with the proposal 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.729
 elemental worked a lot with the aspects 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.309
 that they had prepared for that is 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:07.590
 fundamental as you say at that age to 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.130
 to a large extent the offer is so young 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.899
 that maybe you have to idolize people 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.130
 you have people who see them playing in 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.170
 first division this wants to be like 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.570
 there are if they speak the factors that can be 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.119
 better than them someone who teaches you 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.590
 that mentality and well I think that that 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.020
 true that he has supported me and that he gave me 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.179
 quite at that time today pooch 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.820
 Ramírez continues to provide this support to 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:32.460
 young Mexicans through projects 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.229
 as a course to the bbv league to which is the 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.329
 seed for future triumphs of the 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.240
 tryp I think that I do have the confidence 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.159
 because we have the headquarters club of knowing 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.959

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.610
 and the talent that is being seen now 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:48.920
 with young people in Mexican soccer 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.360
 the fact of having achieved it is already more 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.790
 easy not to have that you have also given 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.860
 realize that it is possible and I believe that 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.870
 that I had a bad time so that 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.490
 be done not obviously on our part 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.500
 we will do everything so that so that is 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.260
 you have to help he likes the track 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.750
 American a path to success for 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.360
 Mexican football that this new litter 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.600
