00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.400
 hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.590
 Climb we held a vote on bf4. 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.440
 some point py and you decided to throw 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.759
 we have a little hard work today 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.830
 dmr rifle guide 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.259
 I decided to tell you about the last 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.570
 rifle in this proscar class with in 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:25.210
 the scar family has long been called 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.450
 legendary battlefield weapons 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.750
 equal ak &amp; m 16 since first time scar 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:34.000
 appeared in battlefield 2 back in 2005 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.800
 year since the scar appeared in all 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.230
 parts of the modern war on 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.420
 over the long 9 years to us 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.730
 demonstrated only two variants of this 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.100
 rifle with corel out of the garage in the face 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.839
 assault rifles or carbines but 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.269
 sniper version was always in the shadows 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:52.120
 its automatic twins but 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:54.489
 battlefield changed absolutely all places 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.530
 easy scar-l gave us scores in 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.600
 which is a dmr rifle 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.089
 to open this new items you need 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.629
 sweat hard and now listen 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:07.270
 score unrealistic 82 thousand points with 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.310
 using dmr for hamster for full 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.579
 unlock most classes of weapons you need 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.049
 score an average of 42 thousand points 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:15.549
 despite the fact that the difference between 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.439
 present and skorge 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.140
 his sniper option is 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.930
 only in the length of the barrel in the sniper game 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.549
 option has standard 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.799
 characteristics for class d mayor damage 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.590
 fully standard for high 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:33.750
 home dmr maximum 45 minimum 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.920
 38 rate of fire 260 shots per minute 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.930
 tactical recharge will take one 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.469
 a whole eighty-five hundredths of a second 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.119
 full 2 point and three tenths of a second at 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:45.549
 opening this rifle I was expecting a little 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.159
 other for example the best performance in 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:50.409
 class but it turned out to be a measure of distinctive 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.759
 a rifle that still has a pair 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.619
 positive sides 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.409
 Let's start with the fact that this rifle I 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.479
 immediately began to compare with the m39 which 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.000
 very quick and heavy in terms of 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.280
 control I was a little surprised and scores 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.280
 you possesses a very soft return on 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.380
 numbers scores in and out disappeared in possesses 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.750
 the lowest recoil in class is high 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.060
 home home and coupe with a rate of fire and 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.890
 and generally no what makes this rifle 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.770
 very effective at medium 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.630
 long distance is not m39 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.970
 which is with a rate of fire of 300 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.510
 minute shots will kill like mad 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.030
 stallion 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.250
 second major plus scores in this 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.410
 recharge rate which is 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.570
 the fastest in a damer class if you 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.959
 love to go enemy arches then this 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.150
 a trick can help you more than once 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.670
 third plus most hooked 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.830
 positional war lovers rather your 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.810
 has the lowest variation at 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.030
 shooting in aimed mode at 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.280
 installing a thickened stem scatter 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.470
 almost zero but not worth it 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.810
 delude myself narrow there are in my mind two 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.760
 minus which is crossed out absolutely 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.850
 all first and foremost speed 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.709
 the flight of the bullet is 500 meters in 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.050
 second that is quite bad for a rifle 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.540
 which is designed for long distances 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.220
 for example at a distance of over 120 meters 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.220
 you can only hit static 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.010
 targets therefore high accuracy is not so 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.650
 so plus a well and the second minus refers to 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.840
 soon dys and class dmr we are all 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.209
 recognized that dmr is the poorest class 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.340
 weapons in the game but days besides weakness 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:24.130
 We were given the longest pumping tree 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.769
 for the opening let's say all padawan to you 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.290
 need to score 48 thousand points for 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:33.340
 opening the exact same amount of home 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.560
 iraq you spend 82 thousand points and on 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.560
 my opinion is very bad 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.360
 that scores in the most inaccessible gun in 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.489
 game for efficiency 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.530
 I recommend the following modules sight 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.150
 put anyone to rush tactics 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.850
 collimator for medium and long 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.730
 distances of 3 and 4 multiple sights 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.680
 But for the plant map I recommend 311 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.390
 try and aim at send and 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.970
 accessories we have a choice between 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.950
 additional sights and alsu for 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.989
 rush tactics are still better to install 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.780
 lc which has less scatter when 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.790
 shooting from the hip by 25 percent if 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.590
 it's hard for you to aim at melee with 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.750
 using four briefly on the distant 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.030
 distances with a collimator but here 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.760
 better use extra sight 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.739
 dresses for the trunk put a thickened chair 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.840
 for minimum variance in the sighting 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.390
 mode or blank for most 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.310
 situations handle angular to reduce 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:28.460
 initial recoil which is above one and a half 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:32.030
 than standard scores in general scores in 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.669
 good drk certainly not better than the same m39 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.530
 or sks but quite comfortable and pleasant and 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.930
 some aspects for example given 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.580
 rifle is very effective at 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.230
 positional shootout in assault mode 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.210
 but I think that's all thanks that 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.730
 watched subscribe comment 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.100
 put the huskies see you on the battlefield bye 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.340
