so<00:00:02.010> today<00:00:02.310> I'm<00:00:02.460> going<00:00:02.639> to<00:00:02.730> be<00:00:02.820> disassembling

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
so today I'm going to be disassembling

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.880 
so today I'm going to be disassembling
one<00:00:03.570> of<00:00:03.659> my<00:00:03.780> electric<00:00:04.140> organs<00:00:04.470> it's<00:00:04.830> a<00:00:06.890> rather

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
one of my electric organs it's a rather

one of my electric organs it's a rather
1970s<00:00:08.820> or<00:00:08.970> 60s<00:00:09.389> can't<00:00:09.630> remember

main amplification and slide power board
and<00:01:26.189> then<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.520> believe<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.240> awesome

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
and then I believe this is the awesome

oscillator board the keyboard sends
signal<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.579> board<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.450> produces<00:01:36.900> the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
using these transistors from Texas

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.450 
using these transistors from Texas
Instruments<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.180> it's<00:01:48.930> fed<00:01:49.110> into<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.710> one<00:01:50.310> of

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.060 

finally<00:01:55.170> got<00:01:55.290> all<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.410> screws<00:01:55.710> off<00:01:55.890> this

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
finally got all the screws off this

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:07.120 
finally got all the screws off this
little<00:01:57.000> chain<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:57.990> lights

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.600 

well<00:02:08.130> nice<00:02:08.430> little<00:02:08.670> light<00:02:08.790> bulb<00:02:09.000> in<00:02:10.430> I'm<00:02:11.430> sure

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
well nice little light bulb in I'm sure

00:02:11.610 --> 00:03:02.180 
well nice little light bulb in I'm sure
I<00:02:11.640> could<00:02:11.820> pry<00:02:11.940> pennies<00:02:12.330> for<00:02:12.480> them<00:02:12.600> tomorrow

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:16.530 

and<00:03:03.190> I<00:03:03.340> saw<00:03:03.580> a<00:03:03.610> compact<00:03:04.060> unit

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.850 

I'm<00:03:17.540> surprised<00:03:17.900> at<00:03:18.080> all<00:03:18.200> everything<00:03:18.620> I'll

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
I'm surprised at all everything I'll

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.770 
I'm surprised at all everything I'll
plugged<00:03:19.129> in<00:03:20.200> easy<00:03:21.200> have<00:03:21.379> to<00:03:21.470> cut<00:03:21.650> cables

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
plugged in easy have to cut cables

00:03:22.780 --> 00:04:01.370 
plugged in easy have to cut cables
asshole<00:03:23.780> connectors<00:03:24.200> to

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.950 

here<00:04:02.380> we<00:04:02.500> have<00:04:02.620> the<00:04:02.830> oscillator<00:04:03.520> boards<00:04:03.960> came

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 
here we have the oscillator boards came

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.860 
here we have the oscillator boards came
out<00:04:05.080> quite<00:04:05.260> nicely

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
out quite nicely

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.650 
out quite nicely
all<00:04:07.440> right<00:04:07.650> nicely<00:04:08.190> colored<00:04:08.400> cables<00:04:08.700> too<00:04:09.060> with

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
all right nicely colored cables too with

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:18.199 
all right nicely colored cables too with
connectors<00:04:10.340> become<00:04:11.340> really<00:04:11.640> in<00:04:11.760> handy

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.170 

but<00:04:19.209> uh<00:04:19.239> sighs<00:04:19.570> kind<00:04:19.870> of<00:04:19.989> mundane<00:04:20.910> so<00:04:21.910> I<00:04:21.940> love

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
but uh sighs kind of mundane so I love

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:55.090 
but uh sighs kind of mundane so I love
to<00:04:22.300> colorize<00:04:23.160> tables

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.770 

now<00:04:56.100> that's<00:04:56.370> kind<00:04:56.580> of<00:04:56.670> cool<00:04:56.970> I<00:04:57.330> didn't<00:04:57.720> know

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
now that's kind of cool I didn't know

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.690 
now that's kind of cool I didn't know
that<00:04:58.200> whole<00:04:58.410> thing<00:04:58.440> would<00:04:58.680> come<00:04:58.920> out<00:04:58.950> I<00:05:01.700> got

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
that whole thing would come out I got

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:34.070 
that whole thing would come out I got
this<00:05:02.850> part<00:05:03.090> I've<00:05:03.180> disconnected<00:05:03.480> now

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.290 

there's<00:05:35.080> an<00:05:35.230> in<00:05:35.350> control<00:05:35.740> thing<00:05:35.950> the<00:05:36.910> power

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
there's an in control thing the power

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.990 
there's an in control thing the power
switch<00:05:37.990> with<00:05:38.350> the<00:05:38.470> worlds<00:05:38.770> are<00:05:38.860> all<00:05:38.980> go<00:05:39.130> heavy

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
switch with the worlds are all go heavy

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:53.190 
switch with the worlds are all go heavy
cool<00:05:40.270> to<00:05:40.360> keep<00:05:46.050> weird<00:05:51.570> now<00:05:52.570> I<00:05:52.630> would<00:05:52.960> call<00:05:53.170> that

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200 
cool to keep weird now I would call that

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.600 
cool to keep weird now I would call that

is my fifth electric organ I've ever

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:20.280 
is my fifth electric organ I've ever
taken<00:06:05.140> apart<00:06:18.540> they're<00:06:19.540> a<00:06:19.570> great<00:06:19.840> source<00:06:20.080> of

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:20.290 
taken apart they're a great source of

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.140 
taken apart they're a great source of
vintage<00:06:20.650> parts<00:06:20.890> especially<00:06:21.610> transistors
