modification so I've loaded it up into

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.859 
modification so I've loaded it up into
Photoshop<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.730> the<00:00:26.730> first<00:00:27.090> thing<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.300> we

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
Photoshop and the first thing that we

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.189 
Photoshop and the first thing that we
need<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.050> do<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:29.039> duplicate<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.970> layer<00:00:30.199> so

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
need to do is to duplicate the layer so

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.160 
need to do is to duplicate the layer so
I'm<00:00:31.560> just<00:00:31.710> going<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.920> press<00:00:32.070> ctrl<00:00:32.369> +<00:00:32.790> J<00:00:33.090> on<00:00:33.329> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
I'm just going to press ctrl + J on the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.360 
I'm just going to press ctrl + J on the
keyboard<00:00:34.590> with<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.920> background<00:00:35.070> layer

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
keyboard with the background layer

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.330 
keyboard with the background layer
selected<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.239> that's<00:00:36.989> created<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.800> duplicate

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
selected and that's created a duplicate

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.150 
selected and that's created a duplicate
layer<00:00:38.690> now<00:00:39.690> up<00:00:39.960> on<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.140> menu<00:00:40.530> go<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.860> filter

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
layer now up on the menu go to filter

layer now up on the menu go to filter
blur<00:00:42.410> and<00:00:44.090> Gaussian<00:00:45.090> blur<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:46.850> then<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:48.000> want

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
blur and Gaussian blur and then you want

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.680 
blur and Gaussian blur and then you want
to<00:00:48.210> select<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.809> blair<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.910> radius<00:00:51.270> level

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
to select a blair that the radius level

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.680 
to select a blair that the radius level
for<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.350> blur<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:53.340> want<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.820> make<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:54.629> you

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
for the blur you want to make it so you

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.720 
for the blur you want to make it so you
can<00:00:54.899> still<00:00:55.110> sort<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.770> identify<00:00:56.399> what<00:00:56.610> the

of radius that you want to use depends

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.469 
of radius that you want to use depends
on<00:01:17.130> how<00:01:17.310> large<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:18.479> image<00:01:18.960> sizes<00:01:20.479> sounds

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
on how large the image sizes sounds

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.070 
on how large the image sizes sounds
going<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.750> click<00:01:21.930> OK<00:01:22.500> on<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.600> and<00:01:24.600> now<00:01:24.930> we've

going to click OK on that and now we've

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.530 
going to click OK on that and now we've
gotten<00:01:25.380> our<00:01:25.439> blood<00:01:25.710> layer<00:01:25.979> here<00:01:26.340> now<00:01:27.240> we<00:01:27.299> want

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
gotten our blood layer here now we want

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.990 
gotten our blood layer here now we want
to<00:01:27.689> change<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.140> blend<00:01:28.740> mode<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.729> blurred

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
to change the blend mode of the blurred

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.140 
to change the blend mode of the blurred
layer<00:01:30.710> soft<00:01:31.710> light<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.189> sometimes<00:01:32.610> work<00:01:32.850> well

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
layer soft light can sometimes work well

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.850 
layer soft light can sometimes work well
but<00:01:33.869> most<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.320> time<00:01:34.500> you'll<00:01:34.680> probably

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
but most of the time you'll probably

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.520 
but most of the time you'll probably
want<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.159> use<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.549> overlay<00:01:36.000> blend<00:01:36.210> mode<00:01:36.600> so

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
want to use the overlay blend mode so

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.929 
want to use the overlay blend mode so
it's<00:01:37.710> going<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.890> click<00:01:38.100> on<00:01:38.220> an<00:01:38.340> overlay<00:01:38.700> there

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
it's going to click on an overlay there

it's going to click on an overlay there
and<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:40.110> can<00:01:40.229> see<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.380> gives<00:01:40.740> quite<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.130> nice

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430

and you can see that gives quite a nice
sort<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.759> dreamy<00:01:42.299> glow<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.470> photo<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.780> the

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
sort of dreamy glow to the photo and the

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.810 
here I'm going to create a
hue/saturation<00:01:58.320> adjustment<00:01:59.210> layer<00:02:00.979> and<00:02:01.979> I'm

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
hue/saturation adjustment layer and I'm

hue/saturation adjustment layer and I'm
going<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.060> clip<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.710> blurred<00:02:05.040> layer

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
going to clip that to the blurred layer

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.419 
going to clip that to the blurred layer
do<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.750> by<00:02:06.930> holding<00:02:07.079> down<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.590> Alt<00:02:07.829> key<00:02:07.979> on

do that by holding down the Alt key on
the<00:02:08.759> keyboard<00:02:08.970> what<00:02:09.750> would<00:02:09.929> be<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.229> option

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
the keyboard what would be the option

as you can see when I move the cursor
between<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.950> two<00:02:15.460> layers<00:02:15.700> between<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.360> hue

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
between the two layers between the hue

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.750 
between the two layers between the hue
saturation<00:02:16.720> layer<00:02:17.350> and<00:02:17.620> a<00:02:17.770> blurred<00:02:17.980> layer<00:02:18.250> it

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
saturation layer and a blurred layer it

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.080 
saturation layer and a blurred layer it
changes<00:02:19.270> into<00:02:19.480> two<00:02:19.900> overlapping<00:02:20.560> circles<00:02:21.090> so

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
changes into two overlapping circles so

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.200 
changes into two overlapping circles so
it's<00:02:22.270> going<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.450> click<00:02:22.750> and<00:02:23.970> that's<00:02:24.970> now

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
it's going to click and that's now

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.380 
it's going to click and that's now
clipped<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.990> hue/saturation<00:02:26.620> adjustment<00:02:27.390> to

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
clipped the hue/saturation adjustment to

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.160 
clipped the hue/saturation adjustment to
a<00:02:28.420> blurred<00:02:28.840> layer<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.430> we<00:02:30.430> can<00:02:30.840> reduce<00:02:31.840> the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
a blurred layer and we can reduce the

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.690 
a blurred layer and we can reduce the
saturation<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:34.390> reduce<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:35.080> effect<00:02:35.440> if<00:02:36.340> we<00:02:36.520> go

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
saturation to reduce the effect if we go

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.480 
saturation to reduce the effect if we go
down<00:02:36.730> to<00:02:37.120> zero<00:02:37.420> you<00:02:37.540> can<00:02:37.870> see<00:02:38.280> it's<00:02:39.280> still

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
down to zero you can see it's still

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.870 
down to zero you can see it's still
quite<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.730> nice<00:02:40.000> photo<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:42.190> as<00:02:42.370> we<00:02:42.520> increase

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
quite a nice photo and as we increase

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.390 
quite a nice photo and as we increase
the<00:02:43.060> saturation<00:02:43.860> you<00:02:44.860> get<00:02:45.040> more<00:02:45.220> of<00:02:45.370> that<00:02:45.550> yo

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
the saturation you get more of that yo

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.700 
the saturation you get more of that yo
affecting<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.520> colors<00:02:49.230> obviously<00:02:50.230> you<00:02:50.560> can

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
affecting the colors obviously you can

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.110 
affecting the colors obviously you can
play<00:02:50.890> around<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.310> other<00:02:51.430> things<00:02:51.670> as<00:02:51.790> well<00:02:51.850> but

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
play around the other things as well but

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.810 
play around the other things as well but
that's<00:02:52.390> it<00:02:52.660> really
