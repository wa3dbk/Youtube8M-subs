00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:23.050
 new tutorial I'm going to show you how 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:26.019
 solve the problem of search error 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:29.910
 this if you have just done 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:32.489
 an installation of confi weezer 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.390
 and this marks them what has been 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.930
 this error 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.970
 so this disappears as you see here in the 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.000
 screen 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:46.020
 Mark the error of marking this window 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.770
 you only have to give him of smith 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.320
 and if you mark the error that is in the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.970
 bottom part of the right side nothing more 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.690
 that will be updating right now is 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.239
 some arons 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.880

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.280

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.990

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.390
 being you the program have a 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.010
 program this is not a problem what 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.530
 happens is that you are trying to update 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.200
 what is being communicated with one 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.670
 of the rings 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.780
 I give you what is being him 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.950
 the configurator only that we're going to go to 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.490
 do to solve this problem 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.320
 let's go where the system is after 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.390
 let's go to add-ons 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:39.110
 then let's go where this says 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.909
 to active supplements 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.130
 enabled 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.060
 then we will go in the bottom 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.090
 where those services 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.070
 and let's see what is going on let's go 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.750
 here to see where is twitter 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.050
 when we are here a destroyer me 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.000
 we're just going to click 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.000
 and we 're going to turn it off 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:08.140
 what happens is that this is this hoop not 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.390
 is of service so that you do not mark that 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.000
 error you have to be connected you have 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.370
 to be connected to al 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.150
 twitter but not the reality not what 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.160
 we are only going to pay and as you see 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.010
 this has already been removed what has been the 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:29.110
 error only after that only 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:33.120
 what we are going to do is close this 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.120
 in the code program 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.530
 and we open it again and you'll see that this 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.630
 the problem has already been solved 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:44.069
 and as you see here it is already open 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:46.860
 again the code and it's already not me 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.330
 mark the error also because that is all 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.310
