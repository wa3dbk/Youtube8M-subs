00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello youtube people I am you want the play 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.029
 cowboy and welcome to a new 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.550
 gameplay today I bring you a game of 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.370
 call of duty 4 the modern warfare 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.440
 original the number 1 and we're going to play in 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.780
 the showdown map a map that 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.000
 I deserved to be in some other call of duty 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.109
 remastered and good I wanted to bring you 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.180
 this example and why many 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.880
 subscribers have consulted me bar 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.580
 asked because he considered that this 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.920
 call of duty the call of duty 4 was 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.810
 considered to me the best call of 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.219
 duty that had existed the truth that 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.829
 the reasons are many we have 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.850
 maybe I'll miss some of the time but 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.680
 I want to know what you think 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.020
 You can also agree or disagree with 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.510
 what I say in this video and what 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.210
 you think, leaving your comment in 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.700
 the comment box of course not 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.520
 let's start first and foremost what 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.230
 happens for the first time is unique and 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.940
 unrepeatable in our life obviously 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.969
 our life because nothing can happen to us 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.399
 something I do not know to say something to put a goal 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.100
 half-court or score a goal 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.979
 'chilena' rabona heads or volley what 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.500
 be and may never be repeated ever 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.180
 in your life I want to say with this 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.400
 that when I first play this 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.280
 call of duty I fell in love immediately 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.530
 this saga both for the campaign and for the 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.130
 multiplayer mode of this game does not 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.840
 there existed neither expectations after 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.300
 would come by the hand of treyarch in the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.490
 conduit 5 web to word and then in the 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.010
 harassment obviously and the cespe with in the 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.840
 warfare mode 2 and in modern warfare 3 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.270
 and I really fell in love immediately with this 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.860
 game really is a great game for me is 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.229
 the best call of duty I'll say it again 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.180
 and I will give the reasons in this video and 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.890
 well I tell you as between a friend 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.600
 just the year 2007 when I had 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.300
 bought the play 3 we were when 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.880
 resistance was the shooter of 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.950
 fashion at that time and well told me 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.750
 that buy the call of duty 4 that I 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.729
 He said it was very good and I said good 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.200
 I'm going to collect money to buy what 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.149
 I had seen the videos and I think 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.220
 interesting and good when it was like that is 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.770
 something completely different to see a 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.690
 video is really spectacular this 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.880
 game and I really think it's the best 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.369
 for several reasons the first for the 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.899
 balance or be nothing else there were three king 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.840
 web web and radar 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.780
 the bomb attack the precision strike 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.079
 and with 7 kills in the helicopter the 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.540
 driver that went down a lot because 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:25.629
 there was no park hiding you from 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.390
 the helicopters was to die or try to 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.519
 get off by helicopter that simple 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.319
 nothing of hiding nothing of campeo 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.769
 practically always there is one that 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:38.319
 the only negative thing that is obvious is 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.120
 all the conduits were in the basket nor 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.980
 the party that the party in the call of 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.510
 duty 4 looks like a nuclear bomb was like 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.750
 the theme of handel modern warfare 3 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:50.530
 that is, it exploded and took 40 chabones 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.269
 that is something unprecedented they never changed 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.819
 this neither they threw it neither patch nor to 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:57.790
 the party had never been changed 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.319
 but that is, he considered that this call of 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.700
 duty is the best also for weapons 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.000
 because almost all weapons are 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.400
 used we have the ak-47 the m4a1 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.930
 plate 74 although they were also the 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.930
 modern warfare 3 but for some reason 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.790
 the infinity ward lords did not decide 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.829
 put it in multiplayer mode on 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.870
 reason we do not know but it is so much in 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.920
 the campaign like in mission mode 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.990
 special 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.640
 I really do not understand that because I do not 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.560
 they put that gun that is very good 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.900
 also the black ops is for example the 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.209
 multiplayer really is super good 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.599
 It was just one of my favorites in 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:34.180
 that color 24 and good also another point 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:37.000
 positive to rescue was the system of 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.730
 respawn that in all was affable 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.170
 in quotes it was generally good 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.260
 except in some ways like 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.819
 example a domination that we say no 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.040
 you are in the flag 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.709
 is not captured by the enemy 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.690
 contrary that flag and little al dente 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.550
 mind is to capture for example to which 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.019
 is to take and the boys of the month 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.480
 they responded to the opposite flag or 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.549
 would be 12 cee olave responded ban 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.620
 they kept on answering in the same flag 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.350
 to so it was practically 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.480
 impossible to capture a flag inside 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.819
 the whole system respond team 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.950
 deathmatch I do not know what other way I played 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.660
 the search and destroy 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.580
 search and destroy no but team 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.680
 deathmatch or remember that the modes 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.079
 what else he played at that moment was 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.630
 pretty good really quite 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.340
 remarkable and also the most 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.100
 positive of this game for me alone 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.980
 so the maps are spectacular 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.419
 all except for a map that was in a 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.400
 boat that was all dark and was 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:37.510
 practically see someone we had to 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.550
 put on our night glasses to see 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.139
 some enemy that changed but 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.389
 really all the maps are great 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:46.500
 as for example to name a few 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:49.290
 hits meant strike 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.540
 those who were mastered in the 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.760
 modern warfare2 and good really me 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.410
 It seems that this call of duty takes 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.900
 all the palms because obviously 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.990
 when you try something for the first time it 's 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.450
 the best that can happen for example 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.790
 if you played in the warfare2 world and you 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.980
 I liked obviously I'm not going to tell you 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.740
 play with the duty 4 but for me in his 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:13.080
 moment in 2007 was the best 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.970
 shooter and the most played by all 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.310
 Argentineans who had playstation3 in 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.350
 that moment so guys I hope you 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.090
