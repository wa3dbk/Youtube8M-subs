00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.100
 so hello to all dear friends with you 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.230
 extreme 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.800
 and we are now in the open spaces of my 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.019
 wonderful desktop and this 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.340
 since I would like to make such a little 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.340
 mini guide 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.109
 day sign name lesson tutorial in essence 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.449
 it doesn't matter with the study they faced the other day 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.939
 in elder scrolls v skyrim with some 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.980
 problem i mean i had a few 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.009
 save files and there were different 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.290
 characters for completely different purposes then 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.899
 there are about four screenshots somewhere 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.270
 do somewhere on the passage still there 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.899
 I have a character that I have for 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.300
 individual videos also involved will study 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.480
 playing for another character I happen to 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.320
 overwritten the save file with our 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.690
 passage that is i am very upset 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.649
 everything was bad sad at home how so 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.469
 what the hell is generally nothing good from 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.180
 I did n't even try it 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.460
 download some programs on 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.380
 recover deleted files but to 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.600
 unfortunately nothing helped 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:15.900
 I started digging through folders and found something 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.250
 what an interesting solution and so first 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.159
 let 's figure out where we are 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.240
 accordingly, the preservation is usually on 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.430
 mostly drives 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.750
 where our users is stored that 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.829
 family is a local drive c users 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.350
 according to your user 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.770
 refused you play where are you here 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:39.630
 immersed so on further on my 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.329
 documents may games and this daddy 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.320
 skyrim and here we have treasured 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:50.430
 daddy with our save safe here 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.799
 we have 3 extensions three formats of these 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:58.439
 the preservation that is, the first is e. 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:02:00.869
 this is the main save file further se 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.030
 such file saved appears in those 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.790
 who actually uses the extender 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.520
 for mods and dreams use mods 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.950
 and here we have different 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.749
 scripts 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.700
 fashion and so on in general all that we have 

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:18.120
 is loaded all this is hammered into 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.340
 saving and saving and further i 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.620
 dug dug thought what are you for 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.849
 a bug that this may very well be to what he 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.400
 applies and then I thought and in fact tank 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:33.000
 that is, the backup is obtained from us 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.450
 a copy of our preservation normal with and here 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.700
 backup is our copy goes jesus than 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.269
 when i rewrote my main 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.760
 preservation 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:49.199
 there is a chance if you have not played for a long time 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:53.370
 saving then return the old save 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:56.340
 with an old character with an old world without 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.909
 any loss bitch like this we 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.590
 doing 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:01.919
 here you can even date time 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.169
 change here to see the course 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:05.549
 we still have a very old backup 

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:07.919
 but in this example 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:11.639
 but still and say if we lost 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:13.709
 some important character well be it 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:18.739
 insulting there is loss quests but still we 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:22.500
 we can get him back as you are here 0 7 0 3 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:25.199
 2015 is now let's say I overwritten 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.019
 by chance for example yes but here this one 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:30.720
 us backup stayed ie our copy 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.280
 she is not registered before that is not yet 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.129
 managed them too did not play it 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.799
 saving long after rewriting what we 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:40.439
 in this case, we make the main file 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.629
 We take out throw out court and here is this 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:46.259
 our backup with old character old 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:49.290
 save just rename vss then 

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:51.900
 there is in the main safe agree with 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.109
 change yes that is, we changed the format 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.340
 and all strictly speaking that is now 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:00.129
 it is with us 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:04.540
 will will be will be where it disappeared 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:06.550
 Here it is our main safe in fact we 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:11.950
 simply returned our old ones 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:14.590
 saving done a kind of rollback from 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:18.970
 new settings and brought back our old 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:21.250
 character of us the old world happens again 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.800
 I do not know how often this is all 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.419
 the case is recorded can he there for a couple 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.100
 minutes ago can write down there 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:31.360
 few days do not overwrite not 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:34.110
 I do nâ€™t know how to make a copy how it works 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.550
 but if we say for example now 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.880
 accidentally overwritten something from and 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.590
 accidentally deleted some save 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.290
 right at the same moment run into this 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.410
 Daddy I mean , I repeat 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.770
 computer 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:52.270
 Our users drive your name 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:56.310
 my documents may games skyrim from the safe 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:59.440
 and in this daddy are already looking for our safe 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:03.610
 accordingly, the main safe, we say 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.500
 here we take out as if our copy 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.270
 safe our backup we just 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.510
 rename the air force 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:13.360
 that is, we delete this prefix run and 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.669
 . also we get what we 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.880
 just done roll let's say here 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:21.970
 also one number is worth and roll back only 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.039
 20 minutes will say here we have little 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:29.080
 lose even experienced a quest will perform not 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:32.110
 so scary such things are solved here 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:35.650
 just not enough i always work 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:38.590
 I know but still, if by chance 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:41.110
 something is overwritten or deleted there is still 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.479
 The chance to return this character is a chance 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.800
 come back this saving so don't 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:49.240
 cheer try 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:51.599
 maybe it will happen why not so 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.120
 what if I ran into such a problem 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:57.010
 here actually speak this decision 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.020
 thanks for watching in the next video i 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:05.289
 I will write one more small tutorial on 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:08.469
 about departures and mods not working 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:10.630
 when you play something long save 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:12.909
 you cost a lot of mods in one moment 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.590
 You start this phone stupidly crashes and 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:17.530
 I'll talk about this problem but in 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.690
 next video but for now everyone thanks for 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.750
 viewing I hope this video in at least somehow 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:24.610
 it will be useful to decide though a couple of people 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:28.990
 this problem someone will save his 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:31.080
 characters your world all good luck and all 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.080
 until 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.590
 this
