00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.900
 an eleven-year-old student and every student possible with planes and such 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.900
 I have more to be stocked 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:18.440

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.320

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.369
 Student 1 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.880
 but as a designer education should not be invested as a trigger 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.880
 for seniors women and youth 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.360
 I thought of the world 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.360
 apa / red 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.440
 There come surprisingly 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.440
 Drawing Celtic folk - at 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.940
 RÃ¼ttgers was a painter and professional painter 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.810
 unsuccessful 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.190
 and that's also my championships so far the car picture is as women 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.760
 it is now our honor for us it is nice to work at Mercedes 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.400
 that's not propaganda either, that's something we actually do 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.210
 feel and for our cars are in the sense of the selection decision 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.210
 reflected 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.210
 the customs office but generally on the Automobile Sander is as I said connect this 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.210
 house-technical there maneuverability only the possibilities 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.159
 yes, the participant to a sensual experience is one of tune one in the 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.159
 town hall 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.260
 be yourself it's nice to me it starts 20 miles around 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.850
 different out as if the cards were playing 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.970
 Round of 16 quarter-finals semi-finals running disc into the plus and thus also 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.970
 Designer from this large plaster that out 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.810
 That was our first car to be employed 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:00.980
 our utmost 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.610
 From the customer's point of view for years 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.630
 Buy this car early because that should be a long time 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.379
 and the Irish outside 7 still riding by car at the beginning 

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:13.439
 there is hectic down here 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:14.829
 which moves her 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:17.209
 they should deal with it for a long time and maybe then 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.689
 at some point in the course of time statements 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.689
 who stood up and that's really something 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.159
 started today started immediately 

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:36.989
 Justice friendly the referee team Anette has said 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:40.809
 but much more organic 

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:43.759
 the request must be driven 

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:44.850
 such a thing is just what 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:45.819
 At first it was there 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.819
 And so the lights in Guangzhou seemed international 

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:52.869
 Already tune Mercedes 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.849
 we were then on calculator we have more status 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.829
 In the end you will come back to the permitted music of this knowledge 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.829
 the defendant must have the assured of 

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:08.799
 we are to restore our car 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.689
 to happen if these are still some details different 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:13.949
 but one recognizes very well 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:17.519
 quite positive area ca but she does not want that provider and 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.519
 rich 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.319
 in Dulliken river Steiner she is washed white 

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:35.189
 He knows that I can imagine a good one as the usual one 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:36.419
 expected to see 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:39.809
 but the state has become exciting in spite of this centuries long 

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:44.309
 Form and edge shows 

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:47.269
 this writing 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.489
 Environment in advance that this part of the country is still one of themselves 

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:54.989
 also against the current 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.989
 ready to put 

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:02.379
 Schmidt sees it 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:04.979
 the SVWW not completely full 

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:07.979
 want to be distinctive as Eichin run an icon 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.489
 the mass damn crap then moves 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:22.059
 independent 

00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:22.929
