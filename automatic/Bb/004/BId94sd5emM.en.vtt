the NES game but of course it looks a

the NES game but of course it looks a
little<00:03:44.220> bit<00:03:44.370> better<00:03:44.610> because<00:03:44.850> it's<00:03:45.180> on<00:03:45.269> the

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
little bit better because it's on the

this<00:03:50.690> was<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:50.870> game<00:03:51.110> I<00:03:51.350> had<00:03:51.560> I<00:03:51.740> had<00:03:51.770> this<00:03:52.040> game

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
this was the game I had I had this game

this was the game I had I had this game
when<00:03:52.430> I<00:03:52.490> was<00:03:52.610> a<00:03:52.640> kid<00:03:52.700> so<00:03:52.970> I'm<00:03:53.270> more<00:03:53.480> familiar

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
when I was a kid so I'm more familiar

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.790 
when I was a kid so I'm more familiar
with<00:03:53.960> it<00:03:54.260> I<00:03:55.810> mean<00:03:56.810> she<00:03:56.960> the<00:03:57.080> NES<00:03:57.380> play<00:03:57.590> is<00:03:57.710> the

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
with it I mean she the NES play is the

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.800 
with it I mean she the NES play is the
same<00:03:58.040> but<00:03:58.280> it's<00:03:58.400> it<00:03:58.610> looks<00:03:58.910> as<00:03:59.390> a<00:03:59.420> different

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
same but it's it looks as a different

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.220 
same but it's it looks as a different
style<00:04:00.230> to<00:04:00.560> it<00:04:00.590> sort<00:04:00.980> of<00:04:01.510> only<00:04:02.510> because<00:04:02.780> of<00:04:02.930> the

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
style to it sort of only because of the

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.820 
style to it sort of only because of the
limitations<00:04:04.160> of<00:04:04.310> the<00:04:04.460> system<00:04:05.560> I'm<00:04:06.560> not<00:04:06.710> sure

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
limitations of the system I'm not sure

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.560 
limitations of the system I'm not sure
what<00:04:06.950> that<00:04:06.980> ledge<00:04:07.310> is<00:04:07.490> therefore<00:04:10.000> but<00:04:11.000> it

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
what that ledge is therefore but it

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.870 
what that ledge is therefore but it
doesn't<00:04:11.870> matter<00:04:12.020> and<00:04:12.320> I<00:04:13.010> get<00:04:13.310> groped<00:04:13.580> by<00:04:13.730> the

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
doesn't matter and I get groped by the

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:22.480 
doesn't matter and I get groped by the
wall<00:04:14.210> master<00:04:14.660> way<00:04:15.230> to<00:04:15.290> go<00:04:20.560> and<00:04:21.560> that<00:04:21.739> takes

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
wall master way to go and that takes

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.820 
wall master way to go and that takes
care<00:04:22.640> of<00:04:22.730> the<00:04:22.850> daytime<00:04:23.180> seen<00:04:26.560> every<00:04:27.560> level

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.530 
care of the daytime seen every level
where<00:04:28.250> every<00:04:28.490> scene<00:04:28.760> is<00:04:28.940> split<00:04:29.150> into<00:04:29.270> two

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
where every scene is split into two

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.720 
where every scene is split into two
levels<00:04:30.169> daytime<00:04:30.680> and<00:04:30.860> nighttime<00:04:31.070> if<00:04:31.550> you

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
levels daytime and nighttime if you

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.750 
levels daytime and nighttime if you
haven't<00:04:31.940> figured<00:04:32.060> that<00:04:32.210> out<00:04:32.360> already<00:04:35.050> and

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
haven't figured that out already and

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.100 
haven't figured that out already and
this<00:04:37.760> is<00:04:37.880> the<00:04:37.970> best<00:04:38.120> weapon<00:04:38.450> in<00:04:38.540> the<00:04:38.600> game<00:04:38.750> and

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
this is the best weapon in the game and

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.920 
this is the best weapon in the game and
double<00:04:39.440> rocks<00:04:43.180> like<00:04:44.180> the<00:04:44.330> rocks<00:04:44.540> it<00:04:44.750> just

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
double rocks like the rocks it just

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.370 
double rocks like the rocks it just
throws<00:04:45.350> them<00:04:45.530> straight<00:04:45.860> ahead<00:04:47.050> but<00:04:48.050> it's

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
throws them straight ahead but it's

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.620 
throws them straight ahead but it's
twice<00:04:48.590> as<00:04:48.620> powerful<00:04:48.950> because<00:04:49.880> there<00:04:50.120> are

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
twice as powerful because there are

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.040 
twice as powerful because there are
twice<00:04:50.900> as<00:04:50.960> many<00:04:51.230> rocks<00:04:52.600> the<00:04:53.600> other<00:04:53.720> weapons

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
twice as many rocks the other weapons

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.900 
twice as many rocks the other weapons
