time<00:03:17.980> this<00:03:18.980> team<00:03:19.250> shrunk<00:03:20.120> didn't<00:03:20.450> put<00:03:20.600> up<00:03:20.750> much

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
time this team shrunk didn't put up much

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.910 
time this team shrunk didn't put up much
in<00:03:21.170> fun<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.650> try<00:03:21.920> then<00:03:22.550> they<00:03:22.730> directly<00:03:23.239> but

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
in fun to try then they directly but

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.620 
in fun to try then they directly but
pretty<00:03:24.920> much<00:03:25.010> chop<00:03:25.550> them<00:03:25.790> down<00:03:25.820> at<00:03:26.180> every

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
pretty much chop them down at every

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.240 
pretty much chop them down at every
corner

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.370 

I<00:03:29.310> guys<00:03:30.300> should<00:03:30.540> have<00:03:30.630> totally<00:03:30.840> killed<00:03:31.230> me

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
I guys should have totally killed me

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.350 
I guys should have totally killed me
right<00:03:31.530> there<00:03:31.740> I<00:03:32.100> think<00:03:32.580> you<00:03:32.670> actually<00:03:32.850> bring

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
right there I think you actually bring

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.140 
right there I think you actually bring
out<00:03:33.600> of<00:03:33.720> ammo<00:03:34.430> because<00:03:35.430> I'm<00:03:35.580> run<00:03:35.760> down<00:03:35.790> here

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
out of ammo because I'm run down here

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.870 
out of ammo because I'm run down here
try<00:03:36.360> to<00:03:36.420> revive<00:03:36.720> this<00:03:36.930> dude<00:03:37.310> try<00:03:38.310> to<00:03:38.370> fire<00:03:38.640> off

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
try to revive this dude try to fire off

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.200 
try to revive this dude try to fire off
a<00:03:38.910> couple<00:03:39.150> shots<00:03:39.330> and<00:03:40.550> see<00:03:41.550> his<00:03:41.670> gun<00:03:41.880> is<00:03:42.060> empty

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.210 
a couple shots and see his gun is empty

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.170 
a couple shots and see his gun is empty
so<00:03:42.540> I<00:03:42.630> think<00:03:42.930> that's<00:03:43.110> why<00:03:43.290> I<00:03:43.320> believe<00:03:43.920> that

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
so I think that's why I believe that

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.250 
so I think that's why I believe that
killing<00:03:45.180> there<00:03:45.980> but<00:03:47.840> yeah<00:03:48.840> like<00:03:48.990> I<00:03:49.080> said

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
killing there but yeah like I said

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.540 
killing there but yeah like I said
before<00:03:49.350> I'm<00:03:49.680> wonder<00:03:49.920> what<00:03:50.070> the<00:03:50.959> f2000<00:03:51.959> I<00:03:52.550> mean

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
before I'm wonder what the f2000 I mean

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.910 
before I'm wonder what the f2000 I mean
this<00:03:53.730> is<00:03:53.840> one<00:03:54.840> of<00:03:54.870> my<00:03:55.020> favorite<00:03:55.380> bones<00:03:55.620> for

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
this is one of my favorite bones for

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.620 
this is one of my favorite bones for
close-quarter<00:03:56.640> stuff<00:03:56.880> like<00:03:57.120> this<00:03:57.300> I<00:03:57.480> mean

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
close-quarter stuff like this I mean

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.170 
close-quarter stuff like this I mean
people<00:03:58.200> can<00:03:58.350> arguably<00:03:59.100> say<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.610> OGG<00:03:59.820> is

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
people can arguably say the OGG is

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.560 
people can arguably say the OGG is
better<00:04:00.480> for<00:04:00.810> close-quarter<00:04:01.560> combat<00:04:01.590> but<00:04:02.570> you

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
better for close-quarter combat but you

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.990 
better for close-quarter combat but you
know<00:04:03.690> it's<00:04:03.870> all<00:04:04.050> pretty<00:04:04.560> much<00:04:04.880> it's<00:04:05.880> all

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
know it's all pretty much it's all

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.699 
know it's all pretty much it's all
preference<00:04:06.330> because<00:04:06.720> I<00:04:07.110> like<00:04:07.290> this<00:04:07.470> better

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
preference because I like this better

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.290 
preference because I like this better
than<00:04:07.920> all<00:04:08.130> to<00:04:08.400> be<00:04:08.550> honest<00:04:09.000> with<00:04:09.150> you

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
than all to be honest with you

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.970 
than all to be honest with you
especially<00:04:10.050> after<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.440> buffer<00:04:10.770> just

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
especially after the buffer just

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.449 
especially after the buffer just
received<00:04:11.600> definitely<00:04:12.600> feels<00:04:12.870> more<00:04:13.770> you<00:04:14.310> know

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
received definitely feels more you know

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.020 
received definitely feels more you know
like<00:04:14.610> a<00:04:14.670> balanced<00:04:15.360> weapon<00:04:16.850> but<00:04:17.850> it's

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
like a balanced weapon but it's

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.699 
like a balanced weapon but it's
definitely<00:04:18.239> not<00:04:18.540> a<00:04:18.600> long<00:04:18.870> range<00:04:19.109> if<00:04:19.560> you're

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
definitely not a long range if you're

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.800 
definitely not a long range if you're
going<00:04:19.829> long<00:04:20.100> range<00:04:20.430> and<00:04:21.000> stay<00:04:21.299> away<00:04:21.480> from<00:04:21.510> this

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
going long range and stay away from this

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.640 
going long range and stay away from this
at<00:04:22.620> all<00:04:22.800> costs<00:04:23.360> it's<00:04:24.360> pretty<00:04:24.510> crappy<00:04:24.990> but<00:04:25.290> if

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
at all costs it's pretty crappy but if

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.030 
at all costs it's pretty crappy but if
you<00:04:25.830> own<00:04:25.890> from<00:04:26.130> mid<00:04:26.310> too<00:04:26.520> short<00:04:27.680> it's<00:04:28.680> a<00:04:28.800> great
