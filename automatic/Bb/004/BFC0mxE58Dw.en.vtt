00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:07.359
 from the white mérida yucatán the 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:08.200
 stunning of maría jose rosa maria 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:10.570
 José 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.290
 the applicant maria jose 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.680
 to know 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.800
 city 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:23.730
 my secret weapon is going to be the attitude of 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.520
 take my body to the limit 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.650
 is going to be moving little by little I know 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.689
 that I will go grabbing things much more 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.850
 complicated that's going to be my challenge 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.010
 personal to all I see them as great 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.579
 competitors for me so I see them to 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:42.379
 all and well then with great force 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.379
 and you are watching at will 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.700
 elevated and decorated 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.740
 is the first nervous that I felt like with 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.890
 want to take everything I want you have 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.380
 to get out but very contained of everything 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.710
 looking a lot at the floor that's where 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:08.890
 they get lost if this is very internal 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:12.340
 Flamenco dance is internal with strength yes 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.010
 with projection in the eyes that is very 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.490
 important then you can not go all 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:22.320
 for in all civil time 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.320
 breathe happiness is good job 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.009
 you said it right you're starting but 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.930
 I still quite agree with 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.180
 they were very content movements 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.360
 they were well danced but missed 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.710
 lacked strength was very concentrated on 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.600
 what you had to do because it was missing 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.560
 maybe maybe listen to this for the first 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.450
 Once you have to give strength to give 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.070
 No does not contain them but if 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.450
 control them to see how far they have 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.340
 to get your arms to look 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.470
 amplitude and that there really slow down 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.450
 with the necessary force to impact 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.950
 you have to let your body dance 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.850
 so then it feels and feels 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.580
 so the flamenco rumba is a dance that 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.050
 dance with the waist down 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.479
 breaking the tabloid or breaking the 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.190
 plank with great force 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.869
 then they study the genres when they 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.910
 they give it what tango is about 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.250
 it's about the flamenco rumba, then you 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.130
 you do not have to do anything because you have 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.890
 a scenic impressive presence your 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.980
 body speaks for itself and has a 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.239
 innate net force you have everything to 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.250
 shine on this track and in this 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.080
 I congratulate you on stage 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.660
 It is not easy to dance, much less a 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.390
 Flemish rumba but this guy is good 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.130
 study what is the strength of each gender 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.250
 and will know that you will succeed 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:42.690
 they 're going to cry too is not that I'm 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:45.030
 with the adrenaline to the thousand and for me this 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.340
 it's a great learning and I'm for 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.310
 stay here to stay and I'm going to 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.200
 do because that's me 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.670
 that's Maria Jose 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.670
 with the qualification there 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.210
 7 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.770
 6.5 from Kalimba 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.710
 polished has the hidden vote of the night 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.660
 now if there is the qualification but 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.550
 I see the calderón family that 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.740
 it seemed the presentation of maría jose 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:22.700
 pink 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:22.700
 the movement looked very piece and the 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.010
 Ghana and have more public because yes 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.459
 that we have 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.660
 and that follow 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.510
 throwing more desire 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.650
 we give you an 8 18 they want to give you to see 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.870

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.120
 They want a lot but there is always a lack 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.120
 little more
