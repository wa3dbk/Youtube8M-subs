is known as formalin and the question
was<00:03:13.440> what<00:03:14.340> is<00:03:15.020> HCHO

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.360 

oh<00:03:21.500> I<00:03:22.220> see<00:03:22.640> I<00:03:22.970> chose<00:03:23.420> acidic<00:03:23.810> acid<00:03:24.070> duh<00:03:25.070> of
