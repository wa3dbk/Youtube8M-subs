update<00:00:19.480> video<00:00:20.250> we<00:00:21.250> finally<00:00:21.550> have<00:00:21.700> another

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.270 
update video we finally have another

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.110 
update video we finally have another
change<00:00:22.690> in<00:00:23.020> our<00:00:23.530> texture<00:00:24.010> pack<00:00:24.250> so<00:00:24.790> this<00:00:24.970> will

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:25.120 
change in our texture pack so this will

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.370 
change in our texture pack so this will
probably<00:00:25.420> be<00:00:25.720> labeled<00:00:26.289> 1.7<00:00:27.220> point<00:00:27.490> for<00:00:28.380> again

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
probably be labeled 1.7 point for again

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.519 
probably be labeled 1.7 point for again
not<00:00:29.590> all<00:00:29.619> textures<00:00:30.310> are<00:00:30.880> done<00:00:31.510> but<00:00:32.349> we<00:00:32.499> have

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
not all textures are done but we have

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.910 
not all textures are done but we have
had<00:00:33.159> some<00:00:33.460> changes<00:00:33.969> I<00:00:34.409> told<00:00:35.409> you<00:00:35.530> in<00:00:35.679> the<00:00:35.710> last

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
had some changes I told you in the last

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.419 
had some changes I told you in the last
update<00:00:36.519> or<00:00:37.210> the<00:00:37.359> update<00:00:37.719> before<00:00:38.429> eventually

00:00:39.419 --> 00:00:39.429 
update or the update before eventually

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:41.430 
update or the update before eventually
we<00:00:39.879> would<00:00:40.030> have<00:00:40.239> to<00:00:40.449> make<00:00:40.600> the<00:00:40.780> switch<00:00:41.019> over<00:00:41.409> to

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
we would have to make the switch over to

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.059 
we would have to make the switch over to
the<00:00:41.859> hardened<00:00:42.249> clay<00:00:42.399> and<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:44.260> switch<00:00:44.620> out<00:00:44.829> the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:45.069 
the hardened clay and and switch out the

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:47.130 
the hardened clay and and switch out the
wall<00:00:45.309> so<00:00:46.089> that's<00:00:46.300> what<00:00:46.510> I've<00:00:46.600> done<00:00:46.870> I've

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
wall so that's what I've done I've

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.880 
wall so that's what I've done I've
switched<00:00:47.530> all<00:00:47.859> my<00:00:47.920> shifts<00:00:48.339> over<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:50.079> the<00:00:50.379> to

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
switched all my shifts over to the to

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.689 
switched all my shifts over to the to
the<00:00:50.920> new<00:00:51.100> hardened<00:00:51.519> clay<00:00:51.670> and<00:00:52.059> this<00:00:52.899> is<00:00:53.050> the

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
the new hardened clay and this is the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.209 
the new hardened clay and this is the
texture<00:00:54.699> in<00:00:55.030> this<00:00:55.510> texture<00:00:55.960> pack<00:00:56.229> that<00:00:57.069> I've

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
texture in this texture pack that I've

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:59.219 
texture in this texture pack that I've
been<00:00:57.399> using<00:00:57.579> for<00:00:57.999> the<00:00:58.299> past<00:00:58.569> several<00:00:59.079> weeks

00:00:59.219 --> 00:00:59.229 
been using for the past several weeks

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:01.709 
been using for the past several weeks
and<00:00:59.649> I<00:01:00.370> think<00:01:00.729> it<00:01:00.879> might<00:01:01.269> have<00:01:01.389> been<00:01:01.569> in<00:01:01.690> the

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
and I think it might have been in the

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.850 
and I think it might have been in the
last<00:01:01.929> update<00:01:02.350> but<00:01:02.530> I<00:01:02.559> cannot<00:01:03.100> remember<00:01:03.399> and

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
last update but I cannot remember and

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.260 
last update but I cannot remember and
that's<00:01:05.860> what<00:01:06.100> it<00:01:06.220> looks<00:01:06.400> like<00:01:06.580> on<00:01:06.850> all<00:01:06.910> the

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
that's what it looks like on all the

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.640 
that's what it looks like on all the
ships<00:01:07.570> so<00:01:07.810> I<00:01:07.840> was<00:01:07.960> just<00:01:08.050> going<00:01:08.170> to<00:01:08.260> kind<00:01:08.470> of<00:01:08.530> do

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
ships so I was just going to kind of do

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.700 
ships so I was just going to kind of do
a<00:01:08.710> little<00:01:08.920> fly<00:01:09.190> over<00:01:09.520> here<00:01:09.850> and<00:01:09.970> show<00:01:10.690> you<00:01:10.750> what

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
a little fly over here and show you what

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.220 
a little fly over here and show you what
it<00:01:11.800> looks<00:01:11.830> like<00:01:12.250> it<00:01:12.610> definitely<00:01:13.510> looks<00:01:13.810> a<00:01:13.900> lot

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.230 
it looks like it definitely looks a lot

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.390 
it looks like it definitely looks a lot
better<00:01:14.470> it's<00:01:14.800> very<00:01:15.040> bright<00:01:16.050> so<00:01:17.050> I'm<00:01:17.400> overall

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
the the glimmers steampunk texture for

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.060 
the the glimmers steampunk texture for
the<00:01:24.040> wall<00:01:24.220> but<00:01:25.140> running<00:01:26.140> to<00:01:26.290> some<00:01:26.830> other

problems<00:01:27.730> with<00:01:27.940> interior<00:01:28.930> designing<00:01:29.410> he<00:01:30.130> has

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
problems with interior designing he has

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.570 
problems with interior designing he has
something<00:01:30.640> I<00:01:30.880> don't<00:01:31.120> do<00:01:31.440> in<00:01:32.440> my<00:01:33.010> main<00:01:33.250> city

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580

doesn't look fucking good so fade it was
time<00:01:41.110> to<00:01:41.260> go<00:01:41.380> ahead<00:01:41.500> and<00:01:41.890> make<00:01:42.040> the<00:01:42.220> switch<00:01:42.520> get

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
time to go ahead and make the switch get

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.910 
time to go ahead and make the switch get
all<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.630> ships<00:01:43.930> switched<00:01:44.410> over<00:01:44.740> to<00:01:44.770> the

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
all the ships switched over to the

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.410 
all the ships switched over to the
hardened<00:01:45.880> clay<00:01:46.080> sand<00:01:47.080> and<00:01:47.560> just<00:01:47.830> deal<00:01:47.980> with<00:01:48.160> it

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
hardened clay sand and just deal with it

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.150 
hardened clay sand and just deal with it
so<00:01:49.420> anyways<00:01:50.230> this<00:01:50.410> is<00:01:50.470> what<00:01:50.680> they<00:01:50.800> all<00:01:50.950> look

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.600 
think it's time to make the changeover
and<00:05:04.720> get<00:05:05.720> things<00:05:05.960> where<00:05:06.290> the<00:05:06.410> pack<00:05:06.650> is<00:05:07.010> a<00:05:07.340> lot
