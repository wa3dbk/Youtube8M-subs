00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.930
 man that's what we call going to play 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.650

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.359

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.779

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.980
 at 90 I have never played with it 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.810
 the game it is one of favorite 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.640
 real life weapons I hope there too 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.779
 to shoot again in the real 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.710
 because I have never been with one 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.969
 weapon shot 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.410
 I intend to do it sometime 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.860

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.149
 times they just have 5 packs in it 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.920
 real life shooting it 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.329
 seems super cool to do but until 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.590
 follow me quite a lot of money to do that 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.450
 and I don't have that right now 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.530
 so we keep it nice oh call of duty 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.780
 we are going to have a nice call of duty with the 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.980

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.119

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.709
 succeed 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.060
 do n't know where he came from and 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.830
 tried it out with him , he didn't succeed 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.209
 so I'm going to call in my helicopter soon 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.310

 the weapon shoots wonderfully young and this 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.150
 don't play so hot on this thing before 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.070
 do I use quite a lot of call or 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.720

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.440
 time on this game is really chill game too 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.550
 play 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.959
 I've never been with the pen 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.610
 shot in that thing shoots nice 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.440
 boy he just shoots straight ahead 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.510
 the button sounds too simple and wonderful 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.930
 sound you must now also from nine countries 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.550
 to sit 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.900
 he kills that thunder then tick here 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.120
 not like the game that kills people 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.860
 not to have but visually tasty 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.180
 such a boy ten killstreak or something like that 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.200
 visiting wet finger is also not fun 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.640
 to get this game they don't die 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.170
 but we got him hard on me too 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.549
 almost but luckily I got it on time 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.930
 shared 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.920
 ruben had namely get extra half 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.750
 so you have three four bullets 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.709
 shoot someone to get someone 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.329
 that comes from the sky too 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.430
 shoot sheep at him department 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.410
 that broken can she left the bottle started 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.970
 you cannot find medicopter pieces at retail 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.049
 nice I have a meal machine again 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.150

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.560

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.549
 things shot from the sky medicopter 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.870
 but I don't care 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.250
 we can't get a new one on this 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.600
 life must first die of way too 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.799
 but we can probably do it 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.060
 even without a helicopter rescue I hear 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.739
 someone make a claim when he goes 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.150
 expired with his claim spill 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.500
 I saw him walking I saw them 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.060
 claim claim drop and then you are used to 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.530

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.660
 such a theme of the stee because they are almost 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.950
 out of ammo 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.150
 we shoot still I touch turns 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.010

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.930
