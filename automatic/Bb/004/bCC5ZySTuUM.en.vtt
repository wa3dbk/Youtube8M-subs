00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
repetitions you also have two different

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.740 
repetitions you also have two different
handles<00:00:43.129> it's<00:00:44.129> going<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.340> have<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> more<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.660> a

palms<00:00:46.050> facing<00:00:46.410> versus<00:00:46.980> palms<00:00:47.250> down<00:00:47.579> it's

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
palms facing versus palms down it's

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.400 
palms facing versus palms down it's
going<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.239> attack<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.660> muscles<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.079> little<00:00:49.200> bit

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
going to attack the muscles a little bit

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.900 
going to attack the muscles a little bit
differently<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.129> should<00:00:50.340> use<00:00:50.610> both

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
differently and you should use both

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.850 
differently and you should use both
positions<00:00:51.480> for<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.719> variety<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.530> when<00:00:52.649> using

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
positions for a variety and when using

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.860 
positions for a variety and when using
this<00:00:53.100> machine

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.779 

first<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.949> all<00:00:59.010> let's<00:00:59.219> talk<00:00:59.370> about<00:00:59.430> the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
first of all let's talk about the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.340 
first of all let's talk about the
characteristics<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.780> strength<00:01:01.050> training

characteristics of the strength training
circuit<00:01:01.829> each<00:01:02.640> machine<00:01:02.910> has<00:01:03.360> some

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
circuit each machine has some

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.329 
circuit each machine has some
characteristics<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.470> are<00:01:04.650> common<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:05.309> every

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
characteristics that are common to every
