 the photo frame's traction 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.110

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.980

 pens are of course also not possible 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.010
 missing because yes pens needed and then 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.309

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.830
 I don't care if it is fun or 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.830

 and so you can give it as a gift 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.400
 or you can keep it yourself 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.330
 if you just think it's too nice to leave 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.090
 to give 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:01.160
 i love myself because i have fun and hang out 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.160
 it also inspires me such a plate 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.510
 this is a very simple do it yourself 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.730
 are messages that you stuck 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.250
 blinked and it actually is 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.900
 so it does have meaning, therefore 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.669
 I like it extra 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.370
 it's easy to make and I think so 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:21.709
 everyone like to get some 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.440
 you all have to do is yes you cut 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.690
 just some nice pictures and not 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.610
 slice on a clothespin you can big 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.820
 clothespins use small clothespins 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.210
 encountering a challenge is simply quite 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.550
 simple 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.510
 and you may need a clothes peg if you need 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.090
 have done that 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.850
 write your nice messages on one 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:44.570
 paper or on a colored paper 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:47.810
 be creative and just be creative 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:50.240
 I say and then you attach them to the 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.340
 clothespins it is very simple 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.320
 as I said before but it 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.449
 is fun and it has meaning 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.699
