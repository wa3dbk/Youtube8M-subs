00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
coffee and or tea in these and just put

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.840 
coffee and or tea in these and just put
a<00:01:00.449> little<00:01:00.510> bit<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.079> jiffy<00:01:01.410> mix<00:01:01.670> soil<00:01:02.670> mix

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
a little bit of the jiffy mix soil mix

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.759 
a little bit of the jiffy mix soil mix
just<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.420> very<00:01:03.600> top<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.840> help<00:01:04.199> germinate<00:01:04.650> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
just the very top to help germinate the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.560 
just the very top to help germinate the
seeds<00:01:04.799> I'm<00:01:05.159> thinking<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.270> going<00:01:06.479> to

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
seeds I'm thinking that this is going to

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.810 
seeds I'm thinking that this is going to
be<00:01:06.659> much<00:01:06.930> too<00:01:07.170> acidic<00:01:07.530> for<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.310> seeds<00:01:08.549> but<00:01:08.700> it

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
be much too acidic for the seeds but it

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.700 
be much too acidic for the seeds but it
was<00:01:08.970> an<00:01:09.090> experiment<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.900> in<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.530> just

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
was an experiment and in that I just

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.230 
was an experiment and in that I just
briefly<00:01:10.920> put<00:01:11.250> down<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.460> have<00:01:11.700> some<00:01:11.880> more<00:01:12.000> sue

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
briefly put down I have some more sue

Sheryl pepper also and those that's what
I've<00:01:27.479> planted<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:28.110> far<00:01:28.530> now<00:01:29.189> I've<00:01:29.520> used<00:01:29.549> in

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
I've planted so far now I've used in

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.660 
I've planted so far now I've used in
them<00:01:30.600> just<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.110> can<00:01:31.229> see<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.799> jiffy<00:01:32.280> seeds

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
them just so you can see the jiffy seeds

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.240 
them just so you can see the jiffy seeds
starting<00:01:33.240> organic<00:01:33.960> if<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.380> mix<00:01:34.740> the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
starting organic if you mix the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.999 
starting organic if you mix the
directions<00:01:35.700> on<00:01:35.880> this<00:01:36.470> state<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.500> put<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.799> soil

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
directions on this state I put the soil

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.109 
directions on this state I put the soil
in<00:01:38.420> the<00:01:39.420> Jiffy<00:01:39.960> Pop<00:01:39.990> things<00:01:40.590> first<00:01:41.130> then<00:01:41.850> add

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
in the Jiffy Pop things first then add

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.870 
in the Jiffy Pop things first then add
water<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.869> then<00:01:43.290> add<00:01:43.619> your<00:01:43.740> seeds<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.310> water

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
water and then add your seeds and water

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.929 
water and then add your seeds and water
again<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.479> find<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.159> very<00:01:47.399> messy<00:01:47.759> because

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
again I find that is very messy because

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.289 
again I find that is very messy because
the<00:01:48.329> soil<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.470> very<00:01:49.649> fluffy<00:01:50.159> when<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:50.939> put<00:01:51.180> it

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
the soil is very fluffy when you put it

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.569 
the soil is very fluffy when you put it
in<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.780> yeah<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.200> water<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.770> tends<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.310> push

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
in and yeah the water it tends to push

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.039 
in and yeah the water it tends to push
the<00:01:53.610> water<00:01:53.970> right<00:01:54.180> out<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.509> cake<00:01:54.689> up<00:01:54.899> so

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
the water right out of the cake up so

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.469 
the water right out of the cake up so
what<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.229> did<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.710> took<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.310> good<00:01:56.759> old<00:01:56.939> standee

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
what I did I took a good old standee

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.490
