00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
20 passes I know that's a lot of passes

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.050 
20 passes I know that's a lot of passes
for<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.300> test<00:00:24.710> but<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:26.039> is<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.279> lot<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.820> sand

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
this is like an extreme test for a

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.720 
this is like an extreme test for a
vacuum<00:00:31.259> alright<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.130> think<00:00:32.189> that's<00:00:32.550> about

vacuum alright so I think that's about
I'm<00:00:33.000> good<00:00:33.980> all<00:00:34.980> right<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.970> has<00:00:36.150> automatic

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
I'm good all right it has automatic

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.230 
I'm good all right it has automatic
height<00:00:36.900> adjustment<00:00:37.610> so<00:00:38.610> we're<00:00:38.940> going<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.090> go

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:39.240 
height adjustment so we're going to go

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:57.740 
height adjustment so we're going to go
over<00:00:39.680> 20<00:00:40.680> passes<00:00:41.220> slow<00:00:42.030> passes<00:00:42.900> and<00:00:43.610> see<00:00:44.610> if<00:00:44.790> it
