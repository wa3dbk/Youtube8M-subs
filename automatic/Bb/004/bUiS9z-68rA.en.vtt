seemingly<00:01:14.640> more<00:01:14.970> indie<00:01:15.330> game<00:01:15.540> type<00:01:15.869> projects

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
seemingly more indie game type projects

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.660 
seemingly more indie game type projects
now<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.650> think<00:01:16.799> one<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.130> biggest<00:01:17.280> factors

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
now I think one of the biggest factors

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.039 
now I think one of the biggest factors
here<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.150> development<00:01:18.540> cycle<00:01:18.900> of

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
here is the development cycle of

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.690 
here is the development cycle of
BioShock<00:01:19.500> Infinite<00:01:19.650> my<00:01:20.040> friend<00:01:20.250> Larry<00:01:20.400> from

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
BioShock Infinite my friend Larry from

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.789 
BioShock Infinite my friend Larry from
put<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:20.970> best<00:01:21.119> he<00:01:21.600> said<00:01:21.840> dick<00:01:22.320> ken<00:01:22.500> Levine

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
put it best he said dick ken Levine

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.770 
put it best he said dick ken Levine
raised<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.310> bar<00:01:23.460> too<00:01:23.729> high<00:01:23.759> for<00:01:24.180> himself<00:01:24.330> and

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
raised the bar too high for himself and

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.990 
raised the bar too high for himself and
I<00:01:25.080> think<00:01:25.140> he<00:01:25.409> did<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:26.100> bioshock<00:01:26.700> infinite

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
I think he did the bioshock infinite

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.510 
I think he did the bioshock infinite
development<00:01:27.600> cycle<00:01:27.930> was<00:01:28.409> very<00:01:28.890> long<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.369> was<00:01:29.460> a

high-profile<00:01:36.750> people<00:01:36.900> leaving<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.409> studio

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
high-profile people leaving the studio

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.190 
high-profile people leaving the studio
for<00:01:37.950> another<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.490> just<00:01:38.729> was<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.880> big<00:01:39.270> messy<00:01:39.900> game

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
for another it just was a big messy game

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.899 
for another it just was a big messy game
development<00:01:40.590> cycle<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.250> at<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.640> end<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:41.850> the

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
development cycle and at the end of the

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.850 
development cycle and at the end of the
day<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.240> did<00:01:42.420> go<00:01:42.540> on<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.720> sell<00:01:42.990> 4<00:01:43.259> million<00:01:43.500> units

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
day it did go on to sell 4 million units

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.219 
day it did go on to sell 4 million units
but<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.579> may<00:01:44.820> not<00:01:44.850> be<00:01:45.060> good<00:01:45.270> enough<00:01:45.689> for<00:01:45.750> 2k

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
but that may not be good enough for 2k

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.260 
but that may not be good enough for 2k
considering<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.009> budget<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.520> game<00:01:48.090> it

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
considering the budget of the game it

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.550 
considering the budget of the game it
was<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.390> huge<00:01:48.689> budget<00:01:49.020> game<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.409> know<00:01:49.530> that

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
was a huge budget game so know that

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.020 
was a huge budget game so know that
whole<00:01:49.860> big<00:01:50.070> chaos<00:01:50.280> has<00:01:50.610> had<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:50.850> whole

whole big chaos has had that whole
chaotic<00:01:51.450> development<00:01:51.930> now<00:01:52.020> I'm<00:01:52.380> looking<00:01:52.710> at

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
chaotic development now I'm looking at

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.310 
chaotic development now I'm looking at
as<00:01:53.009> did<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.700> tire<00:01:54.000> out<00:01:54.270> ken<00:01:54.570> Levine<00:01:54.869> does<00:01:55.110> he

as did that tire out ken Levine does he

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.590 
as did that tire out ken Levine does he
just<00:01:55.530> not<00:01:55.740> into<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.610> anymore<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.450> just

just not into it anymore that that just

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.030 
just not into it anymore that that just
changes<00:01:57.960> whole<00:01:58.170> thought<00:01:58.409> process<00:01:58.469> on<00:01:59.009> the

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
changes whole thought process on the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.679 
changes whole thought process on the
thing<00:01:59.219> on<00:01:59.340> Triple<00:01:59.670> A<00:01:59.729> game<00:01:59.939> title<00:02:00.240> development

thing on Triple A game title development
he<00:02:00.810> probably<00:02:00.960> got<00:02:01.110> his<00:02:01.229> ass<00:02:01.409> beat<00:02:01.619> making<00:02:01.829> this

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
he probably got his ass beat making this

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.859 
he probably got his ass beat making this
game<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.490> then<00:02:02.640> he<00:02:02.759> looked<00:02:02.969> at<00:02:03.180> something

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
game and then he looked at something

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.260 
game and then he looked at something
like<00:02:03.990> brothers<00:02:04.350> or<00:02:04.680> journey<00:02:05.070> or<00:02:05.399> other<00:02:05.820> in<00:02:06.119> de

today's whole thing was like holy shit
Bioshock<00:02:23.050> did<00:02:23.230> not<00:02:23.350> make<00:02:23.530> a<00:02:23.560> lot<00:02:23.650> of<00:02:23.770> money<00:02:23.890> and

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
Bioshock did not make a lot of money and

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.460 
Bioshock did not make a lot of money and
in<00:02:24.550> turn<00:02:24.820> ran<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.540> studio<00:02:25.900> into<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.230> ground

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
in turn ran the studio into the ground

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.900 
in turn ran the studio into the ground
but<00:02:26.830> that<00:02:26.950> doesn't<00:02:27.220> seem<00:02:27.340> totally<00:02:27.580> like<00:02:27.880> the

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
but that doesn't seem totally like the

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.060 
but that doesn't seem totally like the
case<00:02:28.210> it<00:02:28.570> could<00:02:28.780> have<00:02:28.900> been<00:02:28.990> a<00:02:29.050> factor<00:02:29.320> to<00:02:29.860> Kate

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
case it could have been a factor to Kate

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.380 
case it could have been a factor to Kate
could<00:02:30.220> have<00:02:30.280> been<00:02:30.460> putting<00:02:30.730> pressure<00:02:30.970> on<00:02:31.120> him

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
could have been putting pressure on him

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.330 
could have been putting pressure on him
because<00:02:31.570> of<00:02:31.780> that<00:02:32.110> but<00:02:32.320> time<00:02:32.740> will<00:02:32.890> tell<00:02:32.950> this

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
because of that but time will tell this

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.860 
because of that but time will tell this

the full details as of yet but right now

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.760 
the full details as of yet but right now
it<00:02:37.120> doesn't<00:02:37.150> seem<00:02:37.510> like<00:02:38.020> the<00:02:38.200> worst<00:02:38.410> thing<00:02:38.530> in

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
it doesn't seem like the worst thing in

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.890 
it doesn't seem like the worst thing in
the<00:02:38.830> world<00:02:38.860> especially<00:02:39.840> considering<00:02:40.840> the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
the world especially considering the

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.540 
the world especially considering the
people<00:02:41.170> who<00:02:41.260> work<00:02:41.410> for<00:02:41.440> irrational<00:02:42.160> will

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
people who work for irrational will

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.850 
people who work for irrational will
still<00:02:43.000> be<00:02:43.180> able<00:02:43.330> to<00:02:43.540> get<00:02:43.840> help<00:02:44.080> and<00:02:44.290> hopefully

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
still be able to get help and hopefully

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.260 
still be able to get help and hopefully
find<00:02:45.040> better<00:02:45.340> jobs<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:45.850> land<00:02:45.970> on<00:02:46.060> their<00:02:46.240> feet

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
find better jobs and land on their feet

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.699 
find better jobs and land on their feet
God<00:02:46.900> willing<00:02:47.140> but<00:02:47.380> I<00:02:47.410> think<00:02:47.590> that's

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
God willing but I think that's

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:48.990 
God willing but I think that's
definitely<00:02:47.830> worth<00:02:48.130> taking<00:02:48.340> a<00:02:48.610> step<00:02:48.790> back<00:02:48.970> and

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
definitely worth taking a step back and

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.090 
definitely worth taking a step back and
thinking<00:02:49.450> about<00:02:49.590> irrational<00:02:50.590> games<00:02:50.620> the

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
thinking about irrational games the

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.100 
thinking about irrational games the
studio<00:02:51.400> that<00:02:51.550> brought<00:02:51.580> us<00:02:51.730> Bioshock<00:02:52.330> that's<00:02:52.990> a

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
studio that brought us Bioshock that's a

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.690 
studio that brought us Bioshock that's a
big<00:02:53.290> deal<00:02:53.500> that<00:02:54.070> is<00:02:54.190> something<00:02:54.490> to<00:02:54.550> be

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
big deal that is something to be

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.370 
big deal that is something to be
thankful<00:02:54.850> for<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.270> I<00:02:55.510> think<00:02:55.540> we<00:02:55.840> all<00:02:55.990> owe<00:02:56.020> them

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
thankful for and I think we all owe them

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.990 
thankful for and I think we all owe them
a<00:02:56.410> great<00:02:56.740> deal<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.250> especially<00:02:57.670> now<00:02:57.970> that

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
a great deal and especially now that

down to the roots the creativity the

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.009 
down to the roots the creativity the
kind<00:03:21.220> of<00:03:21.340> indie<00:03:21.700> mentality<00:03:22.390> and<00:03:22.510> I<00:03:22.840> think

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:26.640 
might see a lot more of that that's
going<00:03:25.360> to<00:03:25.420> be<00:03:25.510> a<00:03:25.540> growing<00:03:25.810> trend<00:03:26.050> but<00:03:26.380> like<00:03:26.530> I
