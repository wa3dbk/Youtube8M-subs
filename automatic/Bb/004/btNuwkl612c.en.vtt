 before I start I want to tell you that in 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.740
 the description will find what it would be 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.200

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.570

 leave the link of me being adapted from 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.010
 to download what they would be is 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.950
 the minecraft pocket edition 0.9 point 2 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.989
 and also what would be the blog launcher 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.170
 pro with its latest version ok 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.000
 good still on whether to start ok 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.309
 this good mode the first mode is treated 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.289
 of garage so that what we're going to have 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.769
 what to do is grab our sword 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:00.710
 sides a few sticks for now while 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.800
 and ready with this we are going to select in 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.269
 where we want what would be our 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.240
 our door ok they 're going to have to do 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.620
 how is 33 this structure that does not force 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.860
 force is the force you have to 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.300
 put what would be the salt with that you 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.440
 put the opposite side all 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.140
 they would be ok 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.470
 then we put selected here 1 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.360
 and you ok when we post this with 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.979
 As you can see I put a block in 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.710
 irak and that means like it's the 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.619
 ok button with the voice I'm going to put what 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.979
 I'm going to activate ok then as long as you can 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.450
 see has been opened and it's already like that 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.000
 I wanted to do it inside as they can 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.000
 see here is my card and then the main 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.470
 Well, I think I think it 's good 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.690
 also already once we have 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.700
 put with the voice we can close it already 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.090
 with your hand and open it with your hand as 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.160
 can see is more or less like that and no longer 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.070
 they need to do anything else as you can see 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.770
 change block then I'll go 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.360
 again to be able to pass and ready by 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.600
 this part we will have what is ours 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.500
 minecraft or our car or that this is 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.619
 the second mod 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.440
 the mod is about cars mode or cars 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.000
 how do I want to say to you ok 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.880
 what we are going to do is select with 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.070
 the stick what will be our car and 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.580
 ready as you can see we are full 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.819
 mere up where 100% says a s 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.890
 down this and once 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.889
 good football is what will be the 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.799
 gasoline the efe is to move towards 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:32.290
 go ahead this is good because it is to stop and 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:34.150
 see is to go backwards to how 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.069
 it works so very simple we do not get on 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.349
 when dialing and ready when we are in 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:42.879
 our part we are going to give you that as 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:45.099
 can see do not move a bit now now 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.780
 we can go out I 'm not going to give a 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.879
 come back here to see that 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.420
 works perfectly right now let's 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:54.340
 see if this car is proof of everything 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.170
 what do I mean with this right now they 're going to 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.880
 see below ok as you can see 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.170
 our gasoline starts to drop what 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.140
 only thing that we are going to have to do is 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.360
 stationed here and it's just going to start 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.520
 regenerate good to fill what would be 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.120
 our gasoline ok as you can see it's worth 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:12.130
 97 was already up 98 and so no more or less like that 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.700
 it would be then and we as 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.860
 simple let's move on to the first test 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.620
 of minecraft as you can see here is 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.300
 as if it were a lake then what 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.720
 we're going to do what we're going to do 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:29.130
 select it again we are going to upload 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.830
 This can start moving forward 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.890
 I'm not going to start moving forward as ready 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.870
 can see in the water it was supposed to be 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.180
 that you can not but we'll see 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.970
 session, let's go for a spin 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.920
 here we are going to drop to the water as 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.980
 can see does not leave us like that is that good 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.040
 we're here and it's good that 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.770
 try to float but can not use as 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.300
 that is accelerated not then well let's 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.270
 move on to the second test that would be 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.820
 climbing mountains we will not spend 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.250
 over here we select again our 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.090
 my card and ready 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.360
 again we got on and again 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.630
 we advance 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.480
 this series 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.900
 because this did not have it right then 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.320
 how can you see 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.320
 he went crazy 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.440
 as you can see it's a bit difficult to 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:36.530
 control 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:36.530
 but I'm bad to drive 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:43.250
 reverse 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.840
 we are going to try to climb this mountain 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.259
 and as it is as you can see we started 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.120
 upload 1 2 3 4 as you can see if 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:53.150
 it works climbing mountains then 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.729
 let's stop here let's go down let's go 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.940
 get off and now let's try with 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:01.340
 this my car to go up how would it be 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.710
 waterfall then we selected them the 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.560
 we go up perfect we have to move forward 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.949
 very well finally that fails me 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.410
 to see no, you can not comment 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:14.810
 again as you can see we are doing 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.419
 years of fall and how can you see if you have 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.430
 uploaded what would be the water cascade 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.710
 so I think if that SUV 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:24.110
 another thing we could do to 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.840
 have fun in our minecraft would be 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.550
 this we are going to get through this part of the 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.240
 close the door so they do not come out 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.240
 the villagers 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:38.529
 this we take a michael we put it 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:40.659
 here perfect we select it 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:42.729
 there is how you can see I do not know why 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:44.769
 but it got there the villager comes in 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:48.929
 we select the car then we 

00:05:44.769 --> 00:05:48.929
 we will be able to do this in return 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:53.389
 Amen barÃ¡ibar 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.490
 as you can see wearing in the village not 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.490
 I'm going to put it extreme 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.840
 how cool is linear no longer 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.520
 as you can see it's fun like that 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:21.330
 we can fish the villagers and 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.330
 take them wherever 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:37.620
 they are opposite as you can see it works 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.620
 under water 

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:47.079
 and us 

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.400
 or 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.600
 Well, you know more or less how is the 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.640
 Michael 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.560
 and how is the garage mode ok but 

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.600
 well this has been all I hope that you 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.970
 I liked it if you liked it, do not forget 

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:09.950
