00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
going on here and then I see I'd see

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.110

believe<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.579> raised<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.059> entire<00:00:48.420> data<00:00:49.100> so<00:00:50.100> I

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
believe I raised this entire data so I

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.029 
believe I raised this entire data so I
went<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.910> looked<00:00:51.600> on<00:00:51.899> google<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.620> see<00:00:52.829> what

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
went and looked on google and see what

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.860 
went and looked on google and see what
they<00:00:53.160> had<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.399> say<00:00:53.550> about<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.030> situation<00:00:54.059> and

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
they had to say about the situation and

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.930 
they had to say about the situation and
apparently<00:00:55.500> when<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.770> go<00:00:56.010> online<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.489> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
apparently when you go online and the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.119 
apparently when you go online and the
burnout<00:00:57.270> paradise<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:58.079> may<00:00:58.260> erase<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.890> save

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
data sounds like ah shit i just decided

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.450 
data sounds like ah shit i just decided
you<00:01:03.600> know<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:03.780> wasn't<00:01:04.049> got<00:01:04.290> my<00:01:04.439> backup<00:01:04.650> file<00:01:05.129> and

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
I backed up the file so i decided that

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.710 
I backed up the file so i decided that
i'm<00:01:08.580> probably<00:01:08.790> not<00:01:08.970> gonna<00:01:09.180> do<00:01:09.390> too<00:01:09.570> much
