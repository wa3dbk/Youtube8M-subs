00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.060
 they pointed more and more to want to be 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:15.350
 not just big machines 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:18.510
 the exterior like the 108 the new peugeot 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.920
 108 presents a great news from 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.740
 a technological point of view 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.330
 it's called a mirror screen and that's it 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.439
 great touchscreen that you 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.410
 lets have it all 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.179
 entertainment on board for the big one 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.850
 driving pleasure not only for the driver 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.180
 but obviously also for passengers 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.760
 I show some menus of this 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.750
 new system that makes a small car 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.090
 a little more we say beautiful to drive and has 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.980
 used absolutely beautiful purpose 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.420
 of of this car of this system of 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.820
 infotainment that to really bring 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.140
 inside the car all that 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.329
 which we usually have in our pockets 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.280
 inside our smartphone 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.320
 first of all information on the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.579
 trip then the car information ti 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.140
 lets you have all those that are 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.559
 information about the trip you are on 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.090
 doing very very very very very simple 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.939
 very effective however in terms of 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.770
 time consumption of average speed and so on 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.080
 saying with a simple button a lot 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.240
 practical is very easy to use 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.280
 especially even when the car in 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.200
 movement returns to the menu at least 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.090
 initial audio source allows you to 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.189
 listen to music obviously with the 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.380
 radio fm am or to connect 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.680
 directly with a device through 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.229
 usb which can be an iphone as can 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.400
 be a usb stick loaded by 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.259
 music and therefore also this kind of 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.060
 of users and then the possibility 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.070
 obviously I say to connect via 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.229
 bluetooth audio and then to download 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.939
 let's say your own music compilation 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.799
 through bluetooth 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.810
 but it is not only this of course one can 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.079
 give away through the setup rate 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.880
 enter one in a secondary menu that 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.439
 allows you to adjust what they are 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.950
 audio functions, functions and 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.409
 bluetooth 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.649
 the display and therefore also here of 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.079
 deepening of the regulations there is the 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.850
 ability to adjust the phone away 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.890
 bluetooth we think for example of those 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.989
 users who are always less than not 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.760
 they have a smartphone and so anyway 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.990
 via bluetooth can connect the 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.970
 own phone to have 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.040
 the music if they have it on the phone 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.810
 or certainly use it anyway 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.910
 with a speakerphone so you can do 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.990
 all the function of phone calls but the 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.180
 real news 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.040
 at this point of this mirror screen is 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.110
 just the name itself aimed screen it 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.680
 that is to say a mirror is a mirror 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.000
 that is to say that it shows all that 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.920
 which is the information that can be 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.170
 that we have on our smartphone 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.430
 because by connecting and here now not 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.590
 we still did it but we can 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.570
 connect our smartphone via cable 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.580
 and then report on this 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.470
 screen use on this screen 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.090
 all the functions that are 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.500
 we have on our smartphone then 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.690
 we obviously think of phone calls 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.730
 obviously the phone book however the music 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.710
 what are the images also the 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.660
 management of the navigator, for example 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.190
 residing on our smartphone too 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.810
 because this is the easiest way to 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.210
 the people who are now used to 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.000
 use mobile phones to interact 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.500
 with the car we see how we are in front of the 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.750
 demonstrator because here at the salon of 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.430
 geneva on the cars exhibited the system 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.860
 it doesn't work as it should 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.750
 because because you have to download the app 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.570
 on the phone so if a system 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.860
 android download the mirror link that is 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.050
 the app you need for 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.960
 connect to the mirror screen and instead 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.880
 on the ios system you can download apps in 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.680
 the phone with those downloaded with the 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.320
 own phone then with the cable there 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.810
 connects to the mirror screen and all that 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.460
 point we say that from the phone everything 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.930
 is transferred to the screen 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.330
 let's see how the system works for them 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.610
 android we had said before in the car 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.990
 you crush and connect with the 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.790
 connect button and we see that the 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.490
 applications that we have for example 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.110
 are shown on the phone as you see 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.600
 that you see it on the phone directly 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.220
 on the screen we can maneuver it on 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.260
 phone obviously but it becomes that 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.060
 much more comfortable and more natural point 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.070
 do it on the machine screen there 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.020
 for example interested in navigation 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.210
 we click on the navigation and it 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.920
 screen appears and therefore also here 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.540
 there is a real duplication 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.010
 mirror between what the navigation that 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.959
 we already have a resident on ours 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.880
 phone becomes resident on ours 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.590
 screen and this can be navigated 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.840
 quietly puts in the destination 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.580
 and making it go away and that's a nice thing 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.799
 step forward especially on a machine 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.020
 very popular as a city ​​car like the 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:26.120
 108 because it will make it much easier 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.120
 use of the smartphone in the car
