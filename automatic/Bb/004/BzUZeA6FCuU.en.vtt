00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
with grid poles sticking up out of the

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.110 
with grid poles sticking up out of the
snow<00:00:34.890> follow<00:00:35.890> these<00:00:36.220> two<00:00:36.520> get<00:00:36.670> up<00:00:36.790> to<00:00:37.000> the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.450 

protip<00:00:45.390> we're<00:00:46.020> on<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.140> mountain<00:00:46.650> here<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.310> it's

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
protip we're on a mountain here so it's

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.060 
protip we're on a mountain here so it's
very<00:00:47.760> important<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.810> have<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.320> map<00:00:49.710> a

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
very important that you have a map a

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.470 
very important that you have a map a
compass<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.300> perhaps<00:00:51.870> even<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.350> GPS<00:00:52.920> unit<00:00:53.330> in<00:00:54.330> a

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
compass and perhaps even a GPS unit in a

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.600 
compass and perhaps even a GPS unit in a
situation<00:00:55.080> like<00:00:55.200> this<00:00:55.440> can<00:00:55.770> be<00:00:55.860> very<00:00:56.190> hard<00:00:56.460> to

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
situation like this can be very hard to

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.880 
situation like this can be very hard to
follow<00:00:56.820> someone<00:00:57.300> else's<00:00:57.390> footprints<00:00:58.320> so

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
follow someone else's footprints so

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.260 
follow someone else's footprints so
you're<00:00:59.130> gonna<00:00:59.280> want<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.610> be<00:00:59.730> able<00:00:59.760> to<00:01:00.000> make

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
you're gonna want to be able to make

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.450 
you're gonna want to be able to make
your<00:01:00.480> own<00:01:00.629> path<00:01:00.930> if<00:01:01.170> necessary<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:02.340> know<00:01:02.430> a

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
your own path if necessary you know a

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.680 
your own path if necessary you know a
lot<00:01:02.610> of<00:01:02.640> people<00:01:02.879> think<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.180> mountaineering

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
lot of people think that mountaineering

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.040 
lot of people think that mountaineering
is<00:01:03.900> a<00:01:03.930> highly<00:01:04.620> specialized<00:01:05.220> sport<00:01:05.540> it<00:01:06.540> can<00:01:06.840> be

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
is a highly specialized sport it can be

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.050 
is a highly specialized sport it can be
but<00:01:07.320> really<00:01:07.710> what<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:07.950> boils<00:01:08.250> down<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.490> is

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
but really what it boils down to is

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.500 
but really what it boils down to is
slowly<00:01:10.050> going<00:01:10.380> one<00:01:10.680> step<00:01:10.979> at<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.160> time

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
slowly going one step at a time

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.740 
slowly going one step at a time
calculating<00:01:12.510> each<00:01:13.050> one<00:01:14.360> over<00:01:15.360> my<00:01:15.479> right

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
calculating each one over my right

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.630 
calculating each one over my right
shoulder<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:16.350> can<00:01:16.650> see<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.979> remnants<00:01:17.610> of
