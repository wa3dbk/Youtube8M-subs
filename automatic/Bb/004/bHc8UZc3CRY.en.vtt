 My name is Vincent Everts and on 11 June I will be your day chairman wherever we go 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.130
 look into the world of virtual reality. We have been there for years 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.390
 talked about and we have seen how the Oculus Rift was purchased by Facebook before 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.940
 two billion euros. After it has been on the market for 1 year. What is this? Is this madness? 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.630
 Or is this just the new reality? The digital reality is perhaps where we are 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.180
 spend most of our lives in. And on June 11 we are going to see how they expanded 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.140
 will become. What will happen at a given moment? How can that intensity still be 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.190
 increase much more. 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.390
 I always walk around with my Google Glass. I am constantly working on my smartphone. 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.590
 The digital reality is actually just as high as what I am now in. 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.600
 How are we going to use that? In games it is already clear. But 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.590
 how do we use that in business? We are just going to be extremely interesting 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.200
 show ballet of applications And we are just going to be a very special one 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.180
 play game. June 11, I will give a nice overview. And we just go there 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.750
 make a fantastic evening together. 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.730
 Until 11 June!
