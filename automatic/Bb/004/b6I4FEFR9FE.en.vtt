00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410 
you how to do it okay for this trick you

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.640 
you how to do it okay for this trick you
will<00:01:04.620> need<00:01:04.890> some<00:01:05.850> tape<00:01:06.120> it<00:01:07.050> doesn't<00:01:07.410> need<00:01:07.530> to

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
will need some tape it doesn't need to

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.040 
will need some tape it doesn't need to
be<00:01:07.680> double-sided<00:01:08.340> tape<00:01:08.790> but<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.330> can<00:01:09.750> use<00:01:09.930> it

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
be double-sided tape but you can use it

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.600 
be double-sided tape but you can use it
if<00:01:10.140> you're<00:01:10.290> not<00:01:10.320> sure<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:11.010> might<00:01:11.190> be<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.430> bit

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
if you're not sure it might be a bit

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:31.319 
if you're not sure it might be a bit
better<00:01:12.470> sure<00:01:13.470> I'll<00:01:14.190> just<00:01:14.250> find<00:01:14.760> what<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.300> was

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:33.719 

yeah<00:01:31.869> I<00:01:31.930> think<00:01:32.109> that's<00:01:32.320> it<00:01:32.500> yeah<00:01:33.399> that's<00:01:33.520> right

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
yeah I think that's it yeah that's right

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.919 
yeah I think that's it yeah that's right
it<00:01:34.049> should<00:01:35.049> be<00:01:35.200> like<00:01:35.380> that<00:01:35.409> with<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.070> tape<00:01:36.929> so

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
it should be like that with the tape so

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:40.200 
it should be like that with the tape so
there<00:01:38.170> is<00:01:38.619> the<00:01:38.829> nine<00:01:38.979> of<00:01:39.159> Spades<00:01:39.520> and<00:01:40.000> it's

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
there is the nine of Spades and it's

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.069 
there is the nine of Spades and it's
stuck<00:01:40.630> on<00:01:40.659> the<00:01:40.960> back<00:01:41.110> of<00:01:41.320> the<00:01:41.860> eight<00:01:42.070> of<00:01:42.130> clubs

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
stuck on the back of the eight of clubs

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.499 
stuck on the back of the eight of clubs
those<00:01:44.079> are<00:01:44.229> all<00:01:44.469> you<00:01:45.189> need<00:01:45.340> to<00:01:45.579> do<00:01:45.759> you<00:01:46.299> don't

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
those are all you need to do you don't

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.389 
those are all you need to do you don't
have<00:01:46.659> double<00:01:47.079> sided<00:01:47.259> tape<00:01:47.380> just<00:01:47.920> get<00:01:48.130> a<00:01:48.159> bit<00:01:48.310> of

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
have double sided tape just get a bit of

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.340 
have double sided tape just get a bit of
normal<00:01:48.819> tape<00:01:49.060> and<00:01:49.890> then<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:52.049> stick<00:01:53.049> about

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
normal tape and then you stick about

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.719 
normal tape and then you stick about
half<00:01:54.009> of<00:01:54.280> it<00:01:54.429> down<00:01:54.670> and<00:01:55.319> then<00:01:56.459> fold<00:01:57.459> it<00:01:57.640> over

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
half of it down and then fold it over

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.270 
half of it down and then fold it over
the<00:01:57.880> side<00:01:58.030> sticky<00:01:58.479> side<00:01:58.689> still<00:01:58.959> up<00:01:59.140> you<00:02:00.039> just

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
the side sticky side still up you just

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.569 
the side sticky side still up you just
go<00:02:00.399> through<00:02:00.429> and<00:02:01.270> get<00:02:01.450> them<00:02:01.600> to<00:02:01.719> pick<00:02:01.929> a<00:02:01.959> card

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
go through and get them to pick a card

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.850 
go through and get them to pick a card
put<00:02:03.579> it<00:02:03.610> down<00:02:03.819> as<00:02:04.060> evenly<00:02:04.720> as<00:02:04.899> you<00:02:05.049> can<00:02:05.229> on

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
put it down as evenly as you can on

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.800 
put it down as evenly as you can on
there<00:02:06.250> and<00:02:06.989> then<00:02:08.280> once<00:02:09.280> you're<00:02:09.549> going<00:02:09.810> and

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
there and then once you're going and

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.009 
there and then once you're going and
then<00:02:11.260> you<00:02:11.489> just<00:02:12.489> shuffle<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.060> cards<00:02:13.480> but<00:02:13.690> be

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
then you just shuffle the cards but be

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.080 
then you just shuffle the cards but be
careful<00:02:14.470> when<00:02:14.560> you're<00:02:14.709> shuffling<00:02:15.190> I<00:02:15.459> would

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
careful when you're shuffling I would

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.550 
careful when you're shuffling I would
I'm<00:02:16.930> only<00:02:17.200> doing<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.769> shuffle<00:02:19.200> because<00:02:20.200> I

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
I'm only doing the shuffle because I

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.000 
I'm only doing the shuffle because I
don't<00:02:20.799> want<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.099> break<00:02:21.730> it<00:02:21.790> so<00:02:22.329> be<00:02:22.930> careful<00:02:23.560> if

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
don't want to break it so be careful if

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.430 
don't want to break it so be careful if
you're<00:02:24.910> going<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.180> do<00:02:25.299> a<00:02:25.329> riffle<00:02:25.810> shuffle<00:02:25.840> be

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
you're going to do a riffle shuffle be

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.229 
you're going to do a riffle shuffle be
careful<00:02:26.980> when<00:02:27.160> you<00:02:27.310> do<00:02:27.489> that<00:02:27.670> because<00:02:27.880> it

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
careful when you do that because it

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.690 
careful when you do that because it
might<00:02:28.390> break<00:02:28.840> it<00:02:29.170> turn<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:30.129> then<00:02:30.250> you<00:02:30.370> just<00:02:30.579> go

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
might break it turn and then you just go

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.059 
might break it turn and then you just go
through<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.239> say<00:02:31.450> tell<00:02:31.720> me<00:02:31.900> when<00:02:32.049> you<00:02:32.170> see<00:02:32.440> the

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
through and say tell me when you see the

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:40.240 
through and say tell me when you see the
nine<00:02:33.310> of<00:02:33.489> Spades

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.230 

oh<00:02:40.280> yeah<00:02:40.970> here<00:02:42.230> that<00:02:43.160> was<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.640> double-sided

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
oh yeah here that was the double-sided

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.690 
oh yeah here that was the double-sided
tape<00:02:44.390> make<00:02:44.900> sure<00:02:45.170> it<00:02:45.290> stays<00:02:45.560> like<00:02:45.770> that<00:02:45.830> so<00:02:46.640> I

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
tape make sure it stays like that so I

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.420 
tape make sure it stays like that so I
just<00:02:46.850> keep<00:02:46.970> doing<00:02:47.240> it<00:02:47.420> quickly<00:02:48.070> so<00:02:49.070> once<00:02:49.250> you

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
just keep doing it quickly so once you

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.160 
just keep doing it quickly so once you
do<00:02:49.580> that<00:02:49.610> and<00:02:50.030> then<00:02:50.270> you<00:02:50.390> find<00:02:50.630> it<00:02:50.750> just<00:02:50.900> keep

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
do that and then you find it just keep

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.470 
do that and then you find it just keep
