00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
I would say is the weight they are the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.180 
I would say is the weight they are the
age<00:01:50.520> X<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.210> ax8<00:01:51.780> okay<00:01:52.560> now<00:01:52.679> can't<00:01:52.860> even<00:01:53.009> talk

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190

feel like you're wearing it and and this

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.580 
feel like you're wearing it and and this
is<00:01:59.610> just<00:01:59.819> that<00:01:59.940> the<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.720> polycarbonate<00:02:01.200> one

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
is just that the the polycarbonate one

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.789 
is just that the the polycarbonate one
if<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.830> can<00:02:02.130> get<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.459> carbon<00:02:02.850> fiber<00:02:03.090> version

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
if you can get the carbon fiber version

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.930 
if you can get the carbon fiber version
which<00:02:04.799> is<00:02:06.079> quite<00:02:07.079> expensive<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.799> mean<00:02:08.070> if<00:02:08.340> I

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
which is quite expensive I mean if I

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.020 
which is quite expensive I mean if I
bought<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.420> for<00:02:09.920> 185<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.280> think<00:02:11.519> the<00:02:11.610> cheapest

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
bought this for 185 I think the cheapest

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.090 
bought this for 185 I think the cheapest
that<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.180> could<00:02:12.360> find<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:13.079> carbon<00:02:13.470> fiber<00:02:13.799> one

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
that I could find the carbon fiber one

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.600 
that I could find the carbon fiber one
was<00:02:14.400> trimmed<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.910> quit<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.360> I<00:02:16.280> didn't<00:02:17.280> want<00:02:17.489> to

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
was trimmed to quit and I didn't want to

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.550 
was trimmed to quit and I didn't want to
spend<00:02:17.940> trying<00:02:18.239> to<00:02:18.359> quit<00:02:18.600> on<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.780> helmet<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.530> I

range it's bullshit AGVs

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.159 
range it's bullshit AGVs
absolute<00:05:12.380> bullshit<00:05:12.830> and<00:05:13.870> so<00:05:14.870> that's<00:05:15.020> the

it's not pin lock accessible at all it's

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.670 
it's not pin lock accessible at all it's

some people have read reviews on this
helmet<00:05:37.730> and<00:05:37.940> some<00:05:38.120> people<00:05:38.420> think<00:05:38.660> it<00:05:38.780> doesn't

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
helmet and some people think it doesn't

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.040 
helmet and some people think it doesn't
need<00:05:39.260> pin<00:05:39.530> lock<00:05:39.740> that<00:05:40.040> because<00:05:40.520> the<00:05:40.700> the<00:05:41.360> visor

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
need pin lock that because the the visor

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.640 
need pin lock that because the the visor
is<00:05:42.410> so<00:05:42.620> far<00:05:42.890> away<00:05:43.220> from<00:05:43.280> your<00:05:43.580> face<00:05:44.470> that<00:05:45.470> it

is so far away from your face that it

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.600 
is so far away from your face that it
doesn't<00:05:46.100> get<00:05:46.190> affected<00:05:46.810> by<00:05:48.100> by<00:05:49.100> fogging<00:05:49.370> up

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
doesn't get affected by by fogging up

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.540 
doesn't get affected by by fogging up
but<00:05:50.270> it<00:05:50.450> fucking<00:05:50.840> does<00:05:51.020> it<00:05:51.590> absolutely<00:05:52.100> does

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.810 

another<00:06:02.720> downside<00:06:03.020> that<00:06:03.710> I<00:06:04.280> should<00:06:04.490> point<00:06:04.640> out

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
another downside that I should point out

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.820 
another downside that I should point out
about<00:06:04.970> dual<00:06:05.480> sport<00:06:05.720> helmets<00:06:06.110> are<00:06:06.350> is<00:06:06.650> the

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
about dual sport helmets are is the

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.860 
about dual sport helmets are is the
noise<00:06:07.010> because<00:06:07.880> it's<00:06:08.060> a<00:06:08.180> it's<00:06:08.420> a<00:06:08.540> bigger

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
noise because it's a it's a bigger

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.510 
noise because it's a it's a bigger
helmet<00:06:09.860> it<00:06:10.390> this<00:06:11.390> is<00:06:11.540> a<00:06:11.570> bigger<00:06:11.810> lid<00:06:12.130> the<00:06:13.130> air

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
helmet it this is a bigger lid the air

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.020 
helmet it this is a bigger lid the air
tends<00:06:14.390> to<00:06:14.690> get<00:06:15.020> in<00:06:15.170> underneath<00:06:16.030> because

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 
tends to get in underneath because

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.760 
tends to get in underneath because
you've<00:06:17.270> got<00:06:17.420> more<00:06:17.450> space<00:06:17.900> between<00:06:18.140> your<00:06:18.500> chin

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
you've got more space between your chin

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.940 
you've got more space between your chin
and<00:06:18.800> the<00:06:19.400> on<00:06:20.000> the<00:06:20.150> chin<00:06:20.330> bar<00:06:20.480> oh<00:06:20.810> look<00:06:21.770> at<00:06:21.860> this

and the on the chin bar oh look at this

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:27.160 
and the on the chin bar oh look at this
view<00:06:22.190> so<00:06:25.030> there<00:06:26.030> is<00:06:26.210> quite<00:06:26.660> a<00:06:26.690> bit<00:06:26.900> of<00:06:26.930> wind

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:27.170 
view so there is quite a bit of wind

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:31.690 
view so there is quite a bit of wind
noise<00:06:29.290> it's<00:06:30.290> not<00:06:30.380> it's<00:06:30.920> not<00:06:31.010> the<00:06:31.070> quietest
