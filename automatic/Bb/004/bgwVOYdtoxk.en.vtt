just by doing his presidential duty of

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.949 
just by doing his presidential duty of
course<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.700> Romney<00:02:09.030> was<00:02:09.209> what<00:02:09.509> he<00:02:09.599> was<00:02:09.690> doing

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
course and Romney was what he was doing

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.270 
course and Romney was what he was doing
was<00:02:10.080> strictly<00:02:10.289> for<00:02:10.470> political<00:02:10.860> gain<00:02:11.039> of

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
was strictly for political gain of

this type of thing strictly for

this type of thing strictly for
political<00:02:15.330> gain<00:02:15.510> he<00:02:15.900> probably<00:02:16.170> would<00:02:16.500> have

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
political gain he probably would have

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.480 
political gain he probably would have
gone<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:16.980> swing<00:02:17.220> state<00:02:17.340> right<00:02:17.820> so<00:02:18.890> clearly<00:02:19.890> I

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
gone to a swing state right so clearly I

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.700 
gone to a swing state right so clearly I
think<00:02:20.760> Obama<00:02:21.180> has<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.960> advantage<00:02:22.350> here<00:02:22.500> know

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
what this made me think of because this

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.450 
what this made me think of because this

would rather the hurricane have not

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
think it's it's illogical for us to

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.960 
think it's it's illogical for us to
simply<00:03:22.770> ignore<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:23.250> effect<00:03:23.580> that<00:03:23.640> it<00:03:23.820> might

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
have right yeah it happened so we can

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.100 
have right yeah it happened so we can
talk<00:03:26.940> about<00:03:27.090> what<00:03:27.300> happened<00:03:27.600> as<00:03:27.660> a<00:03:27.720> result<00:03:27.870> of

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110
