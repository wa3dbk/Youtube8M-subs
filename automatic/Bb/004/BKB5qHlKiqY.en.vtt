00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570

inside of this as you squeeze it out it

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.219 
inside of this as you squeeze it out it
doesn't<00:01:25.560> continue<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.979> hold<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.689> volume<00:01:27.689> it

doesn't continue to hold the volume it

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.170 
doesn't continue to hold the volume it
actually<00:01:28.560> squeezes<00:01:28.890> out<00:01:28.979> like<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.180> tuba

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.230 
toothpaste I like that there's two sizes
this<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.280> 8<00:01:32.490> ounce<00:01:32.670> version<00:01:33.000> they<00:01:33.090> also

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
this is the 8 ounce version they also

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.850 
this is the 8 ounce version they also
come<00:01:33.420> with<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.630> 5<00:01:33.900> ounce<00:01:34.140> version<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:34.680> it's<00:01:34.799> a

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
come with a 5 ounce version so it's a

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.770 
come with a 5 ounce version so it's a
little<00:01:35.159> bit<00:01:35.280> smaller<00:01:35.579> for<00:01:35.880> shorter<00:01:36.570> races

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
little bit smaller for shorter races

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.780 
little bit smaller for shorter races
maybe<00:01:37.079> like<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.259> 5k<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.860> mean<00:01:38.220> if<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.400> even<00:01:38.579> need

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
maybe like a 5k I mean if you even need

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.510 
maybe like a 5k I mean if you even need
gel<00:01:39.060> for<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> 5k<00:01:39.509> maybe<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> 10k<00:01:40.500> but<00:01:41.250> this<00:01:41.400> is

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
gel for a 5k maybe a 10k but this is

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.249 
gel for a 5k maybe a 10k but this is
definitely<00:01:41.640> suited<00:01:42.329> for<00:01:42.570> anything<00:01:43.020> longer

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
definitely suited for anything longer

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.620 
definitely suited for anything longer
than<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.530> 10k<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.220> have<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> dislike<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.210> it's<00:01:45.540> a

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
than a 10k I have a dislike and it's a

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.179 
than a 10k I have a dislike and it's a
pretty<00:01:45.810> major<00:01:46.049> dislike<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.770> I'm<00:01:46.829> sure<00:01:47.009> it's

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
pretty major dislike and I'm sure it's

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.370 
pretty major dislike and I'm sure it's
something<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.579> they'll<00:01:47.729> design<00:01:48.030> an<00:01:48.810> answer

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
something that they'll design an answer

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.340 
something that they'll design an answer
to<00:01:49.560> at<00:01:49.680> some<00:01:49.890> point<00:01:49.950> but<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.820> wish<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:52.079> had

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
to at some point but I wish this had

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.980 
to at some point but I wish this had
some<00:01:52.649> sort<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:52.950> strap<00:01:53.490> yeah<00:01:54.240> some<00:01:54.750> sort<00:01:54.930> of

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
some sort of strap yeah some sort of

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.749 
some sort of strap yeah some sort of
stuff<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.380> connected<00:01:56.009> from<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.189> top<00:01:56.430> here

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
stuff that connected from the top here

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.190 
stuff that connected from the top here
to<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.000> bottom<00:01:57.360> there<00:01:57.540> so<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.750> could<00:01:57.899> hold<00:01:58.079> it

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
to the bottom there so I could hold it

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.690 
to the bottom there so I could hold it
in<00:01:58.290> my<00:01:58.380> hand<00:01:58.590> but<00:01:58.770> not<00:01:58.920> have<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.250> hold<00:01:59.490> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
in my hand but not have to hold the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.940 
in my hand but not have to hold the
flask<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.600> could<00:02:00.750> relax<00:02:01.020> my<00:02:01.290> hand<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.710> just

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
flask so I could relax my hand and just

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.620 
flask so I could relax my hand and just
run<00:02:02.159> with<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.549> in<00:02:02.700> my<00:02:02.969> hand

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
run with it in my hand

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.510 
run with it in my hand
let<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.290> strap<00:02:04.619> actually<00:02:04.890> do<00:02:05.130> all<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.310> the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
let the strap actually do all of the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.800 
let the strap actually do all of the
work<00:02:05.670> because<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:06.149> would<00:02:06.329> actually<00:02:06.450> take

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
work because this would actually take

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.169 
work because this would actually take
the<00:02:06.930> place<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.140> my<00:02:07.409> water<00:02:07.680> bottle<00:02:08.069> on<00:02:08.190> races<00:02:08.729> so

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
the place of my water bottle on races so

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.669 
the place of my water bottle on races so
I<00:02:09.209> could<00:02:09.330> carry<00:02:09.479> this<00:02:09.690> with<00:02:09.840> on<00:02:09.989> my<00:02:10.110> gels<00:02:10.349> not

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
I could carry this with on my gels not

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.620 
I could carry this with on my gels not
have<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.069> fill<00:02:11.280> up<00:02:11.400> all<00:02:11.489> my<00:02:11.670> pockets<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.239> use

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
have to fill up all my pockets and use

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.050 
have to fill up all my pockets and use
the<00:02:12.780> water<00:02:13.080> stops<00:02:13.500> along<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:13.980> way<00:02:14.130> to<00:02:14.700> refuel

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
the water stops along the way to refuel

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.199 
the water stops along the way to refuel
on<00:02:15.209> water<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.750> use<00:02:15.959> this<00:02:16.140> for<00:02:16.349> my<00:02:16.819> actual<00:02:17.819> gel

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
on water and use this for my actual gel

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.540 
on water and use this for my actual gel
fuel<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:19.530> would<00:02:19.620> be<00:02:19.709> awesome<00:02:19.830> I<00:02:20.250> actually

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
fuel that would be awesome I actually

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.460

that would take it over the top let it

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.410 
that would take it over the top let it
be<00:02:52.560> really<00:02:52.830> usable<00:02:53.220> price<00:02:53.580> five<00:02:54.000> out<00:02:54.180> of<00:02:54.209> five
