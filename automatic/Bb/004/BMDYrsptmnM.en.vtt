00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.780
 very good fashion facas here I bring my 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:12.310
 first tutorial in this case how 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:14.920
 use an ipad or a remote 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.920
 the computer game 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.920
 edwards 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.289
 And here 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.580
 although I think it can work for 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:32.119
 anybody then good first 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.870
 we have to check 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.610
 in the control panel that he detects 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:43.399
 sometimes it does not detect and it works but good 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:47.900
 just in case good control 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:50.270
 to printing devices 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.960
 here he detects it is this has to follow 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.960
 an image like that 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.159
 we see that the text 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.970
 we open 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.890
 the visual boy advance 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.890
 we open any game 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.430
 again this 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.720
 and well, it looks like it works 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:35.659
 and you have to give the ipad configure 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.110
 the first and good here is what fails 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.110
 people 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.240
 For example, above, in the bat you have 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.640
 to give the button that you want then for 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.820
 example I give the arrow up 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.310
 select the button and already had low only 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.870
 and you go to the button you want left 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.870
 right on the p 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.760
 r 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.760
 what are they 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.540
 and well, it should work for example 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.540
 we give you here it works 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.770
 one day perfectly 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:33.610
 for example if you are driving now 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.610
 I'm using the ipad and if it works 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.080
 good for the tutorials that you want 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.450
 to know 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.700
 things so let us out then in the 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.640
 comments you can not ask 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.110
 and I do it myself 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.590
 Subscribe that it does not cost 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.830
 there is not 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.830
 two 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.900
 Y 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.450
 two 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.450
 Y
