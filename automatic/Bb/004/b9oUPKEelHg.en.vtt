 I remember eight the elegant of the band 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.210
 from last season because it goes up to 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.540
 the semifinal and then I think he missed 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.540
 something original 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:22.600

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.489

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.870
 then more chubby friend the night 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.340
 but I think that this program is not 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.500
 to lose weight but to be 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.390

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.290
 that I come to demonstrate here I wrote this 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.870
 song a few days ago 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.190
 specifically for this semifinal and 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.200
 eduardo ochoa is going to look at the great 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.200

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:30.970

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.970
