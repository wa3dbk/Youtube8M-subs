00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.740
 all parents need to feel 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.870
 proud of their children not only for their 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.400
 progress in school but also by 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.500
 the things that make them unique 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.930
 the parents of people with disorder 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.000
 of the autistic spectrum also 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.250
 what others see as obsessions 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.170
 useless rituals or manias can be 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.289
 ways of communicating and doing 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.390
 world more manageable and logical for them 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.670
 today we are going to attend a school 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.170
 particularly where our kids 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.310
 will teach to look and understand of a 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.250
 different way 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:46.710
 today is a special day today is the end of 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.710

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.910
 day and these are my friends from school 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.360

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.090

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.479
 now I can locate and delete all 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.479
 the lint in a room 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.890
 no no 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.189
 in our doubts 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.960
 tell him to learn any song 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.960
 just go to once you have super ear 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:11.500

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.500

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.610
 academy we do not need a calendar 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:36.420

 Thursday 6 June fee right Monday to 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.570
 Sometimes too many things come into the 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.570
 time and we have to close the doors 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.430
 Martin is the champion in closing doors 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.020
 if there is someone who knows many 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:12.370
 dinosaurs that raise your hand safe 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.370
 what catalina if there is much more 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.510
 He is a specialist in said 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.140
 is the master of doing could he challenged the 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.770
 backwards and without looking at the photo for not 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.770
 get distracted 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.360
 Is a crack 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.720
 when we eat we are calm we have 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.319
 ordered things so that everything is in 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.319
 your site 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.209
 Y 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.320
 and you are very clueless 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.239
 my friend gabriel is a genius of the mid 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.240
 America can imitate more than 100 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:13.650
 hello people hello hello 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.650
 Hello Hello 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.340
 Maria Korta her paper for the 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.640
 bisector with a formula that only knows 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.640
 she 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.360
 it's super ready 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:01.030
 for bertha I am the color number 3 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.669
 green and you order people with numbers and 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.669
 colors 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:05.669
 two 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.600
 i 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:16.020
 Y 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.020
 and never make a mistake 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.500
 i 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:24.110
 all these super powers allow us 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.300
 see things that you do not see and thanks 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.540
 we felt safe and 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.540
 protected 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.830
 these skills to imitate memorize 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.050
 and ordering them also serve to 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.850
 defend yourself from the daily chaos to 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.830
 orient yourself in a society with too much 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.249
 information and to put a little bit of 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.289
 logic in everything that surrounds them 

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:46.880
 the autism spectrum disorder is not 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:49.760
 an illness 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.350
 it is a different form of development and 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.050
 to help them with the difficulties that 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:56.540
 that entails we should give them some time their 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:59.030
 measure a space where they sit 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.730
 happy and calm because everything is in 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.920
 a logical order and a shared way 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:06.050
 to communicate trying not to give them 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.500
 too many stimuli at the same time so that 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:12.010
 do not end up disconnecting 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:15.160
 people with tea are more skilled than 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.660
 we in some things see and feel 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.200
 in the world in a different way to the 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:21.490
 our who are with them 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.790
 we must listen to them and try 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:27.940
 understand them but above all do that 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:30.390
 feel loved that is all the 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.390
 secret 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.120
 or 

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.110
 and 

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.130
 Y
