now it's gonna be too hard actually
let's<00:00:18.359> go<00:00:18.449> do<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:18.630> okay<00:00:19.410> so<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:20.010> all<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.250> races

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
let's go do it okay so of all the races

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.700 
let's go do it okay so of all the races
i<00:00:20.850> chose<00:00:21.270> i<00:00:21.630> went<00:00:22.080> for<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.350> one<00:00:22.500> in<00:00:22.619> the

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
i chose i went for the one in the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.980 
i chose i went for the one in the
driving<00:00:23.100> range<00:00:23.310> apparently<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.269> was<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.630> it

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
driving range apparently it was the it

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.720 
driving range apparently it was the it
was<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.170> first<00:00:25.470> one<00:00:25.769> on<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.010> list<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.430> hadn't

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
was the first one on the list I hadn't

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.990 
was the first one on the list I hadn't
done<00:00:27.109> so<00:00:28.109> this<00:00:28.800> counts<00:00:29.010> as<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.279> line<00:00:29.460> race<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.970> I

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
done so this counts as a line race and I

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.930 
done so this counts as a line race and I
