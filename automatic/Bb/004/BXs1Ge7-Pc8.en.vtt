00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.870
 hello dear friends with you three 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.300
 belt.ru sevens 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.320
 video channel on 6 three sevens belt.ru 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:18.660
 return tell how to charge 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:22.140
 car battery car means we 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.779
 a switch like this is 60 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:31.230
 ampere 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:34.830
 a charger such 6 and 12 volts I will show 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:39.000
 connection process to charge us 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:41.660
 battery status but surely it on 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.680
 the case should not have to be connected 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:57.780
 plug socket more precisely plug in 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:01:02.690
 plug sticking play on here we are 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.690
 We look to have 12 volts exposed 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:15.409
 here we are not 690 switches connect 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.409
 minus first 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:31.689
 then we connect plus and still forgot 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.399
 say that if you have ok mixing meter 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:37.060
 keep warm for a while 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:39.700
 that he froze inside you can insert 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.920
 Stasik with warm water not with hot with 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.200
 warm water to put it 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.659
 warmed up but in no case rashly 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:51.250
 because hot can all lowered 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.969
 for what it can hull we all 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.849
 hooked up 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:58.209
 subsequent showed accordingly 

00:01:54.849 --> 00:02:02.849
 We look at the indication when I will have 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:06.549
 burn 1 pack maximum 10 percent 

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:07.289
 starting minimum but fifty percent 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.630
 percent 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:12.910
 75100 and maximum respectively when 1 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.799
 a pack will give you a battery 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.920
 charged 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:18.819
 Here is another thing in my opinion that the charger allows 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.090
 support 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:24.540
 at the maximum it just doesnâ€™t support 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.540
 charges 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:28.920
 let's say so support on the same 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.120
 level 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:36.130
 battery all each battery discharge current 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:40.569
 self-discharge and accordingly the charger 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:43.030
 helps to keep this one up 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.579
 on this I want to finish but the outsiders 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:50.010
 its was three seven wind video channel 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:50.010
 our three sevens bits. see you soon
