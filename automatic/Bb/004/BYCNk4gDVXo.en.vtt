00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.920 
two inches that will go around each one
of<00:01:58.200> these<00:01:58.409> drawers<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.670> you'll<00:02:00.479> be<00:02:00.659> able<00:02:00.750> to

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
of these drawers and you'll be able to

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.530 
of these drawers and you'll be able to
reach<00:02:01.140> just<00:02:01.560> behind<00:02:01.890> them<00:02:02.189> like<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.610> so

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
reach just behind them like that so

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.440 
reach just behind them like that so
there<00:02:03.750> may<00:02:03.990> be<00:02:04.020> no<00:02:04.530> need<00:02:04.560> for<00:02:04.890> knobs<00:02:05.450> although

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
there may be no need for knobs although

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.470 
there may be no need for knobs although
I<00:02:06.479> found

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
I found

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.630 
I found
a<00:02:07.600> pool<00:02:08.110> that<00:02:08.410> I<00:02:08.470> like<00:02:08.740> that<00:02:08.770> I<00:02:09.070> think<00:02:09.340> we<00:02:09.460> may

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
a pool that I like that I think we may

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.460 
a pool that I like that I think we may
end<00:02:09.820> up<00:02:09.940> using<00:02:10.210> now<00:02:10.750> here's<00:02:10.960> a<00:02:11.020> mistake

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
end up using now here's a mistake

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.250 
end up using now here's a mistake
these<00:02:11.740> were<00:02:11.920> wrapped<00:02:12.160> up<00:02:12.810> notice<00:02:13.810> this<00:02:13.930> is<00:02:14.080> an

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
these were wrapped up notice this is an

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.010 
these were wrapped up notice this is an
external<00:02:14.770> hinge<00:02:15.310> here<00:02:15.850> and<00:02:16.030> that's<00:02:16.540> one<00:02:16.780> way

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
external hinge here and that's one way

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.010 
external hinge here and that's one way
to<00:02:17.050> hinge<00:02:17.860> cabinet<00:02:18.760> doors<00:02:19.030> but<00:02:19.660> what<00:02:19.870> we

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
to hinge cabinet doors but what we

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.360 
to hinge cabinet doors but what we
really<00:02:20.530> wanted<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:20.920> go<00:02:21.100> for<00:02:21.400> is<00:02:22.210> one<00:02:22.480> like<00:02:22.720> this

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
really wanted to go for is one like this

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.820 
really wanted to go for is one like this
where<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.670> hinging<00:02:25.270> is<00:02:25.660> on<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:25.990> inside<00:02:26.440> here

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
where the hinging is on the inside here

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.860 
where the hinging is on the inside here
and<00:02:26.860> here<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.460> if<00:02:27.880> you<00:02:28.000> look<00:02:28.150> closely<00:02:28.450> you'll

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
and here and if you look closely you'll

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.050 
and here and if you look closely you'll
see<00:02:28.960> that<00:02:29.260> matches<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:29.950> cabinet<00:02:30.370> hinges<00:02:30.580> that

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
see that matches the cabinet hinges that

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.800 
see that matches the cabinet hinges that
we<00:02:31.180> picked<00:02:31.450> up<00:02:31.630> at<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:32.440> BRE<00:02:32.800> store<00:02:33.150> so<00:02:34.150> once<00:02:34.630> we

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
we picked up at the BRE store so once we

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.840 
we picked up at the BRE store so once we
have<00:02:34.990> the<00:02:35.110> appliances<00:02:35.800> laid<00:02:36.130> out<00:02:36.400> and<00:02:36.610> we<00:02:36.670> knew

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
have the appliances laid out and we knew

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.550 
have the appliances laid out and we knew
how<00:02:37.030> much<00:02:37.180> space<00:02:37.450> we<00:02:37.660> had<00:02:37.870> we<00:02:38.050> could<00:02:38.170> go<00:02:38.320> along

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
how much space we had we could go along

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.310 
how much space we had we could go along
and<00:02:39.100> figure<00:02:39.400> out<00:02:39.550> exactly<00:02:39.850> what<00:02:40.420> size<00:02:40.630> units

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
and figure out exactly what size units

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.160 
and figure out exactly what size units
that<00:02:41.770> we<00:02:41.890> could<00:02:42.040> bind<00:02:42.280> pre-made<00:02:43.210> cabinets<00:02:43.630> to

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
that we could bind pre-made cabinets to

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.570 
that we could bind pre-made cabinets to
keep<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.470> costs<00:02:44.800> down<00:02:44.830> for<00:02:45.160> instance<00:02:45.250> this

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
keep the costs down for instance this

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
keep the costs down for instance this
unit<00:02:45.940> is<00:02:46.030> one<00:02:46.270> foot<00:02:46.900> wide<00:02:47.170> this<00:02:47.920> unit<00:02:48.370> is<00:02:48.600> two

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
unit is one foot wide this unit is two

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.720 
unit is one foot wide this unit is two
feet<00:02:50.020> wide<00:02:50.350> this<00:02:51.190> unit<00:02:51.700> is<00:02:52.150> well<00:02:53.730> fourteen

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
feet wide this unit is well fourteen

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.060 
feet wide this unit is well fourteen
inches<00:02:55.150> wide<00:02:55.390> and<00:02:55.810> so<00:02:56.260> you<00:02:56.350> just<00:02:56.590> have<00:02:56.710> to<00:02:56.950> do

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
inches wide and so you just have to do

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.220 
inches wide and so you just have to do
the<00:02:57.220> math<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:57.700> fill<00:02:58.030> in<00:02:58.240> all<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.630> spaces<00:02:58.660> that

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
the math and fill in all the spaces that

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.980 
the math and fill in all the spaces that
you<00:02:59.500> have<00:02:59.770> and<00:03:00.310> you<00:03:00.820> have<00:03:00.850> to<00:03:01.000> think<00:03:01.240> about<00:03:01.420> how

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
you have and you have to think about how

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.130 
you have and you have to think about how
many<00:03:02.200> drawers<00:03:02.560> you<00:03:02.890> need<00:03:03.100> versus<00:03:03.790> how<00:03:04.000> many

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
many drawers you need versus how many

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.440 
many drawers you need versus how many
cabinets<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:05.350> so<00:03:05.530> forth<00:03:05.830> like<00:03:06.100> that<00:03:06.130> so<00:03:06.850> hey

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
cabinets and so forth like that so hey
