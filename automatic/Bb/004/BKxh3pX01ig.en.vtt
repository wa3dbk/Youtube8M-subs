00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.870
 before I did not believe people somehow not 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.450
 I had it with them 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.330
 another thing dragons they didn't kill 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.809
 surreptitiously and solved problems 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.590
 honest duel so i dreamed 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.949
 get to the vein there fought the best of 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:27.029
 best and to earn the right to fight 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.769
 they needed to become famous my friend and I 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.239
 spinning as best they could 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.270
 they brought down the monsters rescued the merchants and 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:40.170
 in every way ran into adventure 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:42.530
 worked we hit the arena and here it is 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.530
 began 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.310
 you got a miracle though take a breath 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.860
 but it was not there that cronies were 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.230
 saluted with might and main 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.290
 then I realized that dragons can be 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.900
 no better than people 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:08.770
 exhausted on the 8th followed the most evil 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:12.460
 villains and did not trust anyone except a friend 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:16.720
 probably my friend would have died somewhere 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:20.800
 if there were no enemies in the soul 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:24.759
 covered us back together we founded 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:28.259
 new guild to lie and who only with 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.460
 we have no impenetrable blessing 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.210
 healers 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:37.320
 officer legendary ancient dragons 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:42.540
 you know what I understood when humans and dragons 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:47.370
 not best friends but when they are together 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:51.620
 but did not win it seemed the whole world lay in 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:53.670
 of our feet we won dozens of tournament 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.060
 seized a pair of locks 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.120
 gained title armor conquered 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.320
 legendary dungeons and played 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.320
 clean the world from minions 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.320
 is covered 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.910
 yes these were glorious times 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:18.710
 until joe is gone 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:23.180
 such is life people always go a 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.180
 dragons remain 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.800
 and
