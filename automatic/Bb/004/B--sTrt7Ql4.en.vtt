00:00:01.759 --> 00:00:06.390
 Meyer learns about the essence of the thing of the person of the animal about that 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.069
 how to talk 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:09.429
 then the information was essential 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:12.129
 and so we can analyze the reasons 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.049
 a good reason says something more about the essence of the history of the weir 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.140
 speech 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.329
 and a second reason does not tell me what did not know 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.489
 I know it's rude but that's not a reason but I do not know 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:27.649
 why I did not know the nature of the thing 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:31.340
 When they say what have I newly learned about the essence of the thing 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.340
 then they can divide witnesses reasons separate 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.640
 and if they have the courage 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.990
 in Utah have to do a self-experiment 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.450
 like a researcher 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.830
 who a researcher 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.690
 and once a day in the much phone their only one from Arte 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.690
 it is enough if you do that with No or Siegwart 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.570
 because the other two young men are next if they ask before 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.770
 For example, if they have customers bothering to warn the weather, say so 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.940
 I record this 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.870
 Although today many customers say yes no topic many come to conferences 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.280
 the small the devices are no longer an issue 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.760
 but suppose we do not want to ask it is enough if they share their shares 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.500
 to have 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.980
 and if you have to listen to it for a longer period of time because they are very good for others 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.980
 him such a device automatically when they continue to govern 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.600
 there we just have their stuff on it 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.600
 and I'll do that later on the radio more often 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.000
 another footnote 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.280
 if you have just such a small voice recorder in the office 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.840
 and then the canes do not hear car overloads because the author plant 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.080
 then they are wrong 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.440
 there is a cable for portals cd player that goes at one percent 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.160
 Headphones off 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.649
 and there is something about it like a dark side because they are in the wrong 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.130
 be on the system and then plays the portable cd player 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.600
 about the author situation quite normal 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.900
 if you go to a shop now and say I do not have a cd 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.469
 Player but compares the RIMC to make that say he did not have one 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.510
 but there is not 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.960
 buy the cd player even if you do not want it 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.770
 he has the same formula as he 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.419
 voice recorder 

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:12.199
 And then you can also here is the pill device any kind of accessory 

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:14.219
 that has the small headphone jack 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:16.619
 we can put the Outer plant on April 

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:19.069
 and then they can listen to each other critically 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.569
 At the first entry, they are very surprised what they are there for 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.569
 have said second things 

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:30.329
 can repeat a third fourth times away 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:31.769
 bit on the 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.399
 Pay attention to strategy 

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:37.509
 At least learn to say consecration or similar words 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.859
 what comes next 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:43.279
 and then start getting traffic animals Ziemer cares few minutes 

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:47.229
 That was a real reason 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:51.389
 when is real reason he has to go about the essence of the thing because Aland it 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:52.479
 told 

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:56.019
 if you say because I have to read photocopiers I have to read all the songs 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.019
 are 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.169
 she proves bath 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:03.649
 because that's not what Marlon says at all 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:10.590
 because I said that many parents say that's no reason 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:14.869
 the child knows that already said otherwise 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.949
 said on Friday why do not say that 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:21.169
 Sonja Weis provide 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:23.689
 while the Taliban abducted two children 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:26.169
 I try to convince them 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:29.029
 "I'm not forcing her 

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:32.439
 then mail it though 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:35.559
 So we go back so the rapper of the story that was all in 

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:37.019
 Connection with it 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.019
 So we have the robber then with which one must not play 

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:43.839
 and we just have to form the areas tourism 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:47.489
 both had tour we say you can not and threatens with draconian punishments 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.779
 at the switch we say 

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:53.609
 i would like you to be only and play and give a reason to 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.579
 is traceable for the child 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.180
 sourly done at the moment the experimenter of I made that up 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.779
 Has 

00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:01.530
 has the first step 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.440
 the kids are brought to a room in a room a way mirror the iPad 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.249
 brought out unity to do that 

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:12.269
 and let the citizens solve small task has told him through that 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:13.979
 sing robots are not allowed to play 

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:16.680
 once soft once depending on which group 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.459
 Group always holds each one individually 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.639
 everybody does it 30 times it's a group we did it with 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:27.369
 angry and then you have to leave the room and what do you mean, how big 

00:04:27.369 --> 00:04:29.849
 was the difference between hard and soft 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:33.050
 Do not play with spells 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.050
 what do you appreciate 

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:39.099
 what do you appreciate 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:41.389
 Nolle difference 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.219
 have here today and today 

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:47.659
 This is a reason connoisseurs have given the man the five 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:50.619
 Minutes out over the robot not handsomely inward they closed 

00:04:50.619 --> 00:04:52.479
 will not do that 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.050
 the other Vidal chronic punishments 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.490
 we will not 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.499
 the awareness of the 

00:04:58.499 --> 00:04:59.919
 Surf as it is 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.270
 but to be caught the fear is relatively big what he just 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.570
 has been threatened 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.900
 you do not know the meeting finds Weckbecker Kagawa 5 seconds again 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:09.710
 come 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.580
 So we did not play any more 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.419
 almost all 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.729
 but the really important part of the experiment is six weeks later 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:18.650
 instead of 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.100
 and there came a young lady Aires taz woman on moderate speed or 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.740
 more quickly 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.229
 and there also did something with the children 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:28.900
 nothing has been said robot Altona did other things 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.909
 and then has to leave the room for a moment 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:32.770
 this means 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.990
 today has not been banned 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.029
 today has not been threatened 

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:40.059
 come today is theoretical play with it 

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:42.659
 that's 77 percent 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:45.659
 By the way, when all the boys do not say that, the girls finally do not 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:46.449
 stronger 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:50.050
 77 percent have done so, the team ranking is not there yet 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.710
 to tea or train together robots have so there 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.770
 finally can 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.630
 But only 31 percent of Binder played with the robot 

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:03.570
 See the others back then six weeks ago 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.820
 inwardly decided that they accept this reason 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.480
 and therefore did not play with the robot and that was why it was six weeks 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.849
 later for her Unitas Haan 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:16.379
 that means Werner has a soft tour the successful one is the white one 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:20.689
 and we see exactly the same as the first evening 

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:23.769
 then as I said when they have lyrics by the way a nice question of 

00:06:23.769 --> 00:06:26.769
 Wall newspaper get the Vechte calculates answer 

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:31.549
 im said if you need to read texts you have Dexter it was the same length he 

00:06:31.549 --> 00:06:34.259
 longer of the just spoke 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:38.369
 Dexter has been rewritten, Expedia is absolutely true 

00:06:38.369 --> 00:06:39.659
 almost were 

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:43.020
 rewritten on Weidmann has so out of percent 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.969
 pours one could made his and so on 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:49.559
 for example, the question of a wall newspaper was so if I take a text now 

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:52.689
 Science history because we have been the example 

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:56.589
 then he becomes like that soft quartz ostrich he can not do that at all 

00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:59.319
 he knows textbook who still be looking 

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:02.990
 So when I say there is a certain tendency for this queen to be in 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.689
 who has killed the bellies 

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:09.189
 and say so accept subjunctive Andersson did not take place that is so 

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:11.199
 and bring after that 

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:15.419
 a few reasons that suggest that it was so 

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:18.159
 then I brought the facts very well 

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:20.759
 "I honestly said that was the point 

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:22.509
 absolute 

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:26.259
 if the rooms say it could be so, volunteer work starts thinking what 

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:27.600
 could still be 

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.539
 and now thinks the SEC were all arguments for reason 

00:07:32.539 --> 00:07:35.050
 and otherwise it is learned 

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.749
 then we do not remember anything 

00:07:36.749 --> 00:07:41.599
 because our go with absolutely intact in the nothing that can be contract 

00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:45.410
 Our brain does not do it productively for absolutely respondents 

00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:46.240
 set up 

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.390
 just for him relativized hosed out directly 

00:07:49.949 --> 00:07:53.219
 which has the bow between first huge ones 

00:07:53.219 --> 00:07:54.979
 and here we see exactly the same thing 

00:07:54.979 --> 00:07:55.960
 if we are in the field
