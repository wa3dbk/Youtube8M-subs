course there's probably 50 variations of
that<00:01:22.310> but<00:01:23.310> they're<00:01:23.520> all<00:01:23.670> kind<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.420> same

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
that but they're all kind of the same

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.580 
that but they're all kind of the same
thing<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:26.280> relax<00:01:26.990> your<00:01:27.990> throat<00:01:28.020> your

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
chest and you feel that cold air moving

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.390 
chest and you feel that cold air moving
and<00:01:31.890> when<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.369> don't<00:01:32.640> feel<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.210> practice

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
and when you don't feel it in practice

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.920 
and when you don't feel it in practice
right<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.700> stop<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.299> get<00:01:36.479> back<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.810> that

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
right you stop and you get back to that
