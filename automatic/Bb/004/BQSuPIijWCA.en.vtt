approach main rank and I have just hid

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.000 
approach main rank and I have just hid
around<00:00:36.329> three<00:00:36.600> round<00:00:36.930> four<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.590> top<00:00:37.829> rank

the future and give her more stuff is
another<00:00:41.219> kind<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.640> question<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:42.000> remains<00:00:42.360> to

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
another kind of question that remains to

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.940 
another kind of question that remains to
be<00:00:42.450> seen<00:00:42.540> but<00:00:43.050> for<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.290> time<00:00:43.440> being<00:00:43.469> there<00:00:43.829> are

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
be seen but for the time being there are

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.680 
be seen but for the time being there are
four<00:00:44.160> ranks<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.579> total<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.180> I've<00:00:45.329> kind<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.570> got

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
four ranks in total so I've kind of got

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.119 
four ranks in total so I've kind of got
a<00:00:45.719> little<00:00:45.960> way<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.050> go<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.739> probably<00:00:47.010> take

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
a little way to go to probably take

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.619 
a little way to go to probably take
another<00:00:47.280> say<00:00:47.579> three<00:00:47.879> four<00:00:48.180> days<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.480> kind<00:00:48.539> of

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
another say three four days to kind of

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.840 
another say three four days to kind of
get<00:00:48.780> through<00:00:48.960> but<00:00:49.350> for<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.860> time<00:00:50.010> being<00:00:50.039> when

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
get through but for the time being when

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.490 
get through but for the time being when
you<00:00:50.969> get<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.180> rank<00:00:51.360> three<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.840> unlock<00:00:52.260> the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
you get to rank three you unlock the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.860 
you get to rank three you unlock the
following<00:00:52.739> first<00:00:53.370> up<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.820> will<00:00:54.030> unlock<00:00:54.210> this

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
following first up you will unlock this

colors<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.360> saw<00:01:24.509> prefer<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
colors and I saw prefer this to the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.560 
colors and I saw prefer this to the
second<00:01:25.470> one<00:01:25.560> but<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.000> mid<00:01:27.180> day<00:01:27.330> one

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
second one but this is the mid day one

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.289 
second one but this is the mid day one
which<00:01:28.530> if<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.860> go<00:01:28.979> out<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.220> here<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.759> or<00:01:30.180> like

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
which if I go out of here is or like

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.120 
which if I go out of here is or like
green<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.320> basic<00:01:31.619> colors<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:31.860> like<00:01:31.979> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
green and the basic colors I like the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.440 
green and the basic colors I like the
green<00:01:32.310> I'm<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:32.820> not<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> massive<00:01:33.210> fan<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.360> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
green I'm just not a massive fan of the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.880 
green I'm just not a massive fan of the
beige<00:01:33.600> but<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.900> think<00:01:34.110> once<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.439> have<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.680> full

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
beige but I think once I have the full

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.590 
beige but I think once I have the full
raid<00:01:35.130> set<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.729> rate<00:01:35.909> chest<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.240> think<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.479> looks

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
raid set the rate chest I think it looks

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.060 
raid set the rate chest I think it looks
a<00:01:36.659> lot<00:01:36.750> better<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.229> raid<00:01:37.380> legs<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:37.890> with

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
a lot better and the raid legs but with

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.200 
a lot better and the raid legs but with
this<00:01:38.220> or<00:01:38.400> Vanguard<00:01:38.820> gear<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.150> middle

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
this or Vanguard gear in the middle

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.819 
this or Vanguard gear in the middle
doesn't<00:01:39.900> look<00:01:40.079> quite<00:01:40.170> as<00:01:40.259> good<00:01:40.380> but<00:01:40.710> either

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
doesn't look quite as good but either

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.010 
doesn't look quite as good but either
way<00:01:41.009> this<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.759> mid<00:01:42.000> day<00:01:42.150> one<00:01:42.329> so<00:01:42.540> there

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
way this is the mid day one so there

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.870 
way this is the mid day one so there
isn't<00:01:43.140> actually<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.770> know<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:43.890> find<00:01:44.399> these<00:01:44.610> are

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
isn't actually you know I find these are

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.520 
isn't actually you know I find these are
these<00:01:45.060> shaders<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.420> little<00:01:45.630> bit<00:01:45.720> weird<00:01:45.899> their

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
these shaders a little bit weird their

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.080 
these shaders a little bit weird their
colors<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.159> orb<00:01:47.340> like<00:01:47.460> icon<00:01:47.850> don't

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
colors in this orb like icon don't

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.789 
colors in this orb like icon don't
actually<00:01:48.570> really<00:01:48.869> kind<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.110> depict<00:01:49.350> what<00:01:49.680> they

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
actually really kind of depict what they

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.260 
actually really kind of depict what they
look<00:01:49.950> like<00:01:49.979> because<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.640> don't<00:01:50.820> actually<00:01:50.970> see

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
look like because I don't actually see

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.760 
look like because I don't actually see
any<00:01:51.299> red<00:01:51.540> on<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.780> apart<00:01:52.110> from<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.290> tiny<00:01:52.500> bit<00:01:52.680> on

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
any red on this apart from a tiny bit on

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.410 
any red on this apart from a tiny bit on
the<00:01:52.829> cape<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.159> back<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.640> same<00:01:54.149> kind<00:01:54.329> of

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
the cape of the back and same kind of

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.270 
the cape of the back and same kind of
goes<00:01:54.570> for<00:01:54.899> this<00:01:55.409> one<00:01:55.470> here<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.860> know<00:01:55.950> given

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
goes for this one here you know given

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.539 
goes for this one here you know given
that<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.630> largely<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:58.290> know<00:01:58.409> green<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.159> red

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
that is largely you know green and red

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.560 
that is largely you know green and red
it<00:01:59.700> doesn't<00:01:59.939> really<00:02:00.060> look<00:02:00.180> like<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.420> but

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
it doesn't really look like that but

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.760 
it doesn't really look like that but
either<00:02:00.719> way<00:02:00.899> that's<00:02:01.140> not<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.380> hit<00:02:01.530> on<00:02:01.619> there

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
either way that's not the hit on there

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.130 
either way that's not the hit on there
so<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.219> is<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.820> shader<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.149> get<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.960> let

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
so that is the shader you get that let

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.480 
so that is the shader you get that let
me<00:02:04.229> equip<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:04.829> just<00:02:04.920> off<00:02:05.040> go<00:02:05.219> out<00:02:05.310> here

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
me equip that and just off go out here

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.459 
me equip that and just off go out here
you<00:02:05.610> can<00:02:05.729> see<00:02:05.850> like<00:02:05.880> in<00:02:06.780> this<00:02:06.960> orb<00:02:07.170> natural

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
you can see like in this orb natural

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.309 
you can see like in this orb natural
light<00:02:07.819> that's<00:02:08.819> what<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.060> looks<00:02:09.179> like<00:02:09.300> as<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.140> say

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
light that's what it looks like as I say

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.960 
light that's what it looks like as I say
it<00:02:10.410> does<00:02:10.500> look<00:02:10.649> quite<00:02:11.310> cool<00:02:11.430> off<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.700> lot<00:02:11.910> of

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
it does look quite cool off a lot of

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.120 
it does look quite cool off a lot of
these<00:02:12.060> shaders<00:02:12.270> look<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.540> little<00:02:12.660> bit<00:02:12.840> better

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
these shaders look a little bit better

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.770 
these shaders look a little bit better
the<00:02:13.190> Titans<00:02:13.550> because<00:02:13.790> there<00:02:14.300> are<00:02:14.420> machines<00:02:14.690> to

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
the Titans because there are machines to

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.900 
the Titans because there are machines to
resolve<00:02:15.050> like<00:02:15.140> design<00:02:15.410> sir<00:02:15.650> you<00:02:16.370> know<00:02:16.490> look

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
resolve like design sir you know look

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:17.860 
resolve like design sir you know look
really<00:02:17.090> cool<00:02:17.180> with<00:02:17.300> them<00:02:17.420> but<00:02:17.570> either<00:02:17.690> way

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
really cool with them but either way

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.900 
really cool with them but either way
movie<00:02:18.830> on<00:02:18.950> these<00:02:19.310> glass<00:02:19.520> items<00:02:19.640> you've

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
movie on these glass items you've

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.310 
movie on these glass items you've

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
obviously still got access to for rank

obviously still got access to for rank
two<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:21.740> this<00:02:22.130> one<00:02:22.280> you<00:02:22.400> don't<00:02:22.490> get<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.790> a<00:02:22.820> rank

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000

ones here at the end I'll talk about in

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.550 
ones here at the end I'll talk about in
a<00:02:31.730> second<00:02:32.060> but<00:02:32.450> for<00:02:32.570> time<00:02:32.750> being<00:02:32.780> these<00:02:33.260> are

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
a second but for time being these are

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.400 
a second but for time being these are
the<00:02:33.710> first<00:02:33.920> four<00:02:34.220> items<00:02:34.430> so<00:02:35.210> ruin<00:02:35.930> core<00:02:36.140> is<00:02:36.320> the

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
the first four items so ruin core is the

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.540 
the first four items so ruin core is the
one<00:02:36.530> that<00:02:36.620> I<00:02:36.650> mentioned<00:02:36.920> before<00:02:37.010> it's<00:02:37.340> used

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
one that I mentioned before it's used

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.250

we hit that and boom a lon a liar so if
I<00:03:30.800> now<00:03:30.920> open<00:03:31.070> this<00:03:31.310> up<00:03:31.480> that<00:03:32.480> common-looking

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
I now open this up that common-looking

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.320 
I now open this up that common-looking
Auto<00:03:33.380> rifle<00:03:33.620> that<00:03:34.250> wasn't<00:03:34.670> very<00:03:34.700> powerful<00:03:35.210> has

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
Auto rifle that wasn't very powerful has

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.510 
Auto rifle that wasn't very powerful has
now<00:03:35.540> turned<00:03:35.600> into<00:03:36.020> a<00:03:36.320> legendary<00:03:37.010> Auto<00:03:37.250> rifle

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
now turned into a legendary Auto rifle

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.550 
now turned into a legendary Auto rifle
with<00:03:38.120> based<00:03:38.390> or<00:03:38.600> a<00:03:38.660> semi<00:03:38.870> to<00:03:39.020> attack<00:03:39.290> but

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
with based or a semi to attack but

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.780 
with based or a semi to attack but
obviously<00:03:39.890> if<00:03:39.980> I<00:03:40.010> go<00:03:40.130> back<00:03:40.310> here<00:03:40.490> you<00:03:40.550> can<00:03:40.670> see

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
obviously if I go back here you can see

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.300 
obviously if I go back here you can see
the<00:03:41.120> potential<00:03:41.510> for<00:03:41.720> that<00:03:42.080> will<00:03:42.650> be<00:03:42.830> a<00:03:42.860> three

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
the potential for that will be a three

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.680 
the potential for that will be a three
to<00:03:43.340> four<00:03:43.880> so<00:03:44.090> that<00:03:44.120> is<00:03:44.270> actually<00:03:44.330> pretty<00:03:44.600> good

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
to four so that is actually pretty good

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.720 
to four so that is actually pretty good
damage<00:03:45.050> at<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:45.950> moment<00:03:46.220> is<00:03:46.310> still<00:03:46.400> deal<00:03:46.700> with

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
damage at the moment is still deal with

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.370 
damage at the moment is still deal with
kinetic<00:03:47.120> damage<00:03:47.360> once<00:03:47.630> this<00:03:47.780> goes<00:03:47.990> to<00:03:48.260> the

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
kinetic damage once this goes to the

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.199 
kinetic damage once this goes to the
necrochasm<00:03:48.860> which<00:03:49.220> is<00:03:49.340> the<00:03:49.459> exotic<00:03:49.760> version

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
necrochasm which is the exotic version

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.000 
necrochasm which is the exotic version
it<00:03:50.420> will<00:03:50.540> deal<00:03:50.750> out<00:03:51.080> damage<00:03:51.440> but<00:03:51.740> for<00:03:51.830> the<00:03:51.890> time

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
it will deal out damage but for the time

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.830 
it will deal out damage but for the time
being<00:03:52.040> is<00:03:52.340> still<00:03:52.520> kinetic<00:03:52.880> but<00:03:53.600> it's<00:03:53.690> going

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
being is still kinetic but it's going

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.970 
being is still kinetic but it's going
through<00:03:53.990> the<00:03:54.050> trees<00:03:54.260> you've<00:03:54.530> got<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:54.770> usual

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
through the trees you've got the usual

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.290

taken<00:05:15.740> up<00:05:15.830> I<00:05:15.920> can<00:05:16.160> still<00:05:16.400> use<00:05:16.580> this<00:05:16.730> because

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
taken up I can still use this because

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.430 
taken up I can still use this because
the<00:05:17.180> rate<00:05:17.330> of<00:05:17.420> fire<00:05:17.600> is<00:05:17.750> really<00:05:17.870> good<00:05:18.140> the

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
the rate of fire is really good the

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.350 
the rate of fire is really good the
impact<00:05:18.770> is<00:05:18.920> appalling<00:05:19.550> as<00:05:19.790> atrocious<00:05:20.000> it's

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
impact is appalling as atrocious it's

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.990 
impact is appalling as atrocious it's
horrendous<00:05:20.570> but<00:05:21.410> it<00:05:21.710> is<00:05:21.950> still<00:05:22.250> a<00:05:22.460> fast<00:05:22.790> rate

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
horrendous but it is still a fast rate

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.940 
horrendous but it is still a fast rate
of<00:05:23.030> fire<00:05:23.090> weapon<00:05:23.600> is<00:05:23.690> effectively<00:05:24.050> the<00:05:24.170> you

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
of fire weapon is effectively the you

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.290 
of fire weapon is effectively the you
know<00:05:25.070> the<00:05:25.340> legendary<00:05:25.700> version<00:05:25.940> of<00:05:26.030> this<00:05:26.090> is

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
know the legendary version of this is

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.790 
know the legendary version of this is
effectively<00:05:26.630> akin<00:05:26.930> to<00:05:27.080> that<00:05:27.110> of<00:05:27.290> the<00:05:27.650> 8th

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
effectively akin to that of the 8th

shards<00:06:32.720> or<00:06:32.930> you<00:06:33.050> know<00:06:33.170> one<00:06:33.290> way<00:06:33.410> or<00:06:33.470> the<00:06:33.500> other

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 
shards or you know one way or the other

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.960 
shards or you know one way or the other
so<00:06:33.920> it's<00:06:34.040> kind<00:06:34.220> of<00:06:34.250> nice<00:06:34.370> to<00:06:34.520> have<00:06:34.640> a<00:06:34.700> training

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:34.970 
so it's kind of nice to have a training

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.700 
so it's kind of nice to have a training
mechanic<00:06:35.360> so<00:06:35.750> this<00:06:35.900> way<00:06:36.020> if<00:06:36.230> you<00:06:36.320> go<00:06:36.470> into<00:06:36.620> the

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 
mechanic so this way if you go into the

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.230 
mechanic so this way if you go into the
raid<00:06:36.860> for<00:06:37.010> example<00:06:37.340> and<00:06:37.520> you<00:06:37.610> get<00:06:37.760> nothing<00:06:37.970> but

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 
raid for example and you get nothing but

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.940 
raid for example and you get nothing but
energy<00:06:38.390> all<00:06:38.810> day<00:06:38.840> long<00:06:39.169> you're<00:06:39.380> like<00:06:39.470> ah<00:06:39.590> this

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:39.950 
energy all day long you're like ah this

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:40.940 
energy all day long you're like ah this
is<00:06:40.100> no<00:06:40.220> use<00:06:40.370> to<00:06:40.490> me<00:06:40.520> I'm<00:06:40.640> trying

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:40.950 
is no use to me I'm trying

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.950 
is no use to me I'm trying
Ryoma<00:06:41.610> you<00:06:41.880> then<00:06:42.000> just<00:06:42.030> go<00:06:42.240> to<00:06:42.300> Aris<00:06:42.630> and<00:06:42.840> you

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
Ryoma you then just go to Aris and you

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.380 
Ryoma you then just go to Aris and you
trade<00:06:43.200> in<00:06:43.320> all<00:06:43.470> your<00:06:43.590> energies<00:06:43.890> for<00:06:44.460> charge

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:45.390 
trade in all your energies for charge

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:46.970 
trade in all your energies for charge
instead<00:06:45.600> and<00:06:45.990> you<00:06:46.050> can<00:06:46.200> do<00:06:46.260> it<00:06:46.350> vice<00:06:46.500> versa<00:06:46.740> so

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:46.980 
instead and you can do it vice versa so

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.050 
instead and you can do it vice versa so
this<00:06:47.100> way<00:06:47.220> you'll<00:06:47.370> never<00:06:47.550> be<00:06:47.640> left<00:06:47.820> with<00:06:47.940> you

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
this way you'll never be left with you

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.250 
this way you'll never be left with you
know<00:06:48.090> copious<00:06:48.510> amounts<00:06:48.750> of<00:06:48.810> shards<00:06:49.200> or

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:49.260 
know copious amounts of shards or

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.720 
know copious amounts of shards or
energies<00:06:49.680> you<00:06:50.070> can<00:06:50.190> always<00:06:50.310> kind<00:06:50.490> of<00:06:50.580> like

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:50.730 
energies you can always kind of like

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:51.920 
energies you can always kind of like
swap<00:06:50.940> between<00:06:51.030> them<00:06:51.360> and<00:06:51.510> sort<00:06:51.600> of<00:06:51.660> like<00:06:51.780> make

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:51.930 
swap between them and sort of like make

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.420 
swap between them and sort of like make
them<00:06:52.080> useful<00:06:52.680> or<00:06:52.860> kind<00:06:53.040> of<00:06:53.100> like<00:06:53.190> applicable

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.430 
them useful or kind of like applicable

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.280 
them useful or kind of like applicable
to<00:06:53.760> whatever<00:06:53.940> situation<00:06:54.240> you're<00:06:54.600> in<00:06:54.720> and<00:06:55.170> then

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:55.290 
to whatever situation you're in and then

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.420 
to whatever situation you're in and then
obviously<00:06:55.530> once<00:06:55.680> you<00:06:55.770> hit<00:06:55.860> rank<00:06:56.070> four<00:06:56.250> you've

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:56.430 
obviously once you hit rank four you've

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:57.950 
obviously once you hit rank four you've
obviously<00:06:56.520> got<00:06:56.850> the<00:06:56.880> final<00:06:57.570> shader<00:06:57.750> which

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 
obviously got the final shader which

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.600 
obviously got the final shader which
I'll<00:06:58.110> talk<00:06:58.260> about<00:06:58.320> later<00:06:58.470> on<00:06:58.770> and<00:06:59.280> all<00:06:59.460> the

I'll talk about later on and all the

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.820 
I'll talk about later on and all the

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.830 
class items so as I'm gonna hit a rank 4

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.110 
class items so as I'm gonna hit a rank 4
which<00:07:01.980> will<00:07:02.070> be<00:07:02.190> later<00:07:02.370> on<00:07:02.520> this<00:07:02.580> week<00:07:02.760> I<00:07:02.910> will
