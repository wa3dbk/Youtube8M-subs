00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
video I guess you'd say I have a very

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.720 
video I guess you'd say I have a very
interesting<00:00:39.420> theory<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.899> very<00:00:40.379> mind<00:00:40.980> twisting

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
interesting theory a very mind twisting

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.520 
interesting theory a very mind twisting
theory<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.000> guess<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.329> could<00:00:42.450> say<00:00:42.530> essentially

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
theory I guess you could say essentially

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.220 
theory I guess you could say essentially
I<00:00:43.559> believe<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:45.090> Bonnie<00:00:45.329> actually<00:00:45.960> caused

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
I believe that Bonnie actually caused

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.170 
I believe that Bonnie actually caused
the<00:00:46.469> bite<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.710> 87<00:00:47.039> I'm<00:00:47.550> gonna<00:00:47.670> tell<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:47.910> why<00:00:48.030> in

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
the bite of 87 I'm gonna tell you why in

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.119 
the bite of 87 I'm gonna tell you why in
just<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.450> second<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.750> know<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.980> guys<00:00:50.070> are

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
just a second I know that you guys are

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.529 
just a second I know that you guys are
all<00:00:50.399> gonna<00:00:50.550> tell<00:00:50.789> me<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.000> Bonnie<00:00:51.239> didn't

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
all gonna tell me that Bonnie didn't

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.880 
all gonna tell me that Bonnie didn't
actually<00:00:51.660> have<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.899> face<00:00:52.170> when<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.500> bite<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.800> 87

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
actually have a face when the bite of 87

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.760 
actually have a face when the bite of 87
actually<00:00:53.789> did<00:00:54.090> occur<00:00:54.449> he<00:00:54.870> only<00:00:55.110> had<00:00:55.230> like<00:00:55.440> half

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
actually did occur he only had like half

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.049 
actually did occur he only had like half
of<00:00:55.860> his<00:00:56.010> mouth<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.370> guess<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.610> could<00:00:56.730> say<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:56.910> we

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
of his mouth I guess you could say so we

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.670 
of his mouth I guess you could say so we
couldn't<00:00:57.329> really<00:00:57.420> have<00:00:57.570> done<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.840> bite<00:00:58.140> back

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
couldn't really have done a bite back

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.770 
couldn't really have done a bite back
then<00:00:59.070> but<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.370> think<00:00:59.789> that<00:01:00.210> maybe<00:01:00.480> he<00:01:00.690> actually

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
then but I think that maybe he actually

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.299 
then but I think that maybe he actually
didn't<00:01:01.170> get<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.410> front<00:01:01.680> part<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:01.949> his<00:01:02.100> jaw

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
didn't get the front part of his jaw

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.310 
didn't get the front part of his jaw
removed<00:01:02.520> until<00:01:03.059> after<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.570> bite<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.719> 87<00:01:03.870> maybe

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
removed until after the bite of 87 maybe

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.500 
removed until after the bite of 87 maybe
got<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.680> jar<00:01:04.890> moved<00:01:05.189> because<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.330> bite<00:01:06.479> of

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
got the jar moved because of the bite of

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.600 
got the jar moved because of the bite of

up and down with his mouth that's why I

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.670 
up and down with his mouth that's why I
think<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:23.430> maybe<00:01:23.640> maybe<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:25.140> body<00:01:25.409> is

liver he got bitten in the frontal lobe

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.010 
liver he got bitten in the frontal lobe
so<00:02:00.030> he's<00:02:00.329> having<00:02:00.450> like<00:02:00.630> weird<00:02:00.869> memory

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
so he's having like weird memory

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.780 
so he's having like weird memory
problems<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.100> weird<00:02:02.369> attention

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
problems and and weird attention

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.609 
problems and and weird attention
problems<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.299> other<00:02:03.719> bad<00:02:03.990> stuff<00:02:04.020> like<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.590> I

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
problems and other bad stuff like that I

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.719 
problems and other bad stuff like that I
was<00:02:04.740> about<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.920> say<00:02:05.009> cool<00:02:05.189> stuff<00:02:05.399> but<00:02:05.490> it's

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
was about to say cool stuff but it's

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.010 
was about to say cool stuff but it's
actually<00:02:05.969> bad<00:02:06.149> stuff<00:02:06.390> that's<00:02:06.509> all<00:02:06.630> bad<00:02:06.780> stuff

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
actually bad stuff that's all bad stuff

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.749 
actually bad stuff that's all bad stuff
so<00:02:07.320> I'm<00:02:07.649> thinking<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.069> maybe<00:02:08.399> Bonnie

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
so I'm thinking that maybe Bonnie

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.699 
so I'm thinking that maybe Bonnie
actually<00:02:09.300> did<00:02:09.450> cause<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.690> bite<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.050> 87<00:02:10.229> guys

actually did cause the bite of 87 guys

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.080 
actually did cause the bite of 87 guys
and<00:02:10.950> know<00:02:11.069> in<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.340> previous<00:02:11.489> like<00:02:11.940> their

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
and know in the previous like their

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.520 
and know in the previous like their
videos<00:02:12.239> with<00:02:12.480> other<00:02:12.629> people's<00:02:12.870> channels

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
videos with other people's channels

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.990 
videos with other people's channels
and<00:02:13.620> in<00:02:13.800> all<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.070> other<00:02:14.130> previous<00:02:14.400> games<00:02:14.820> it

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
and in all the other previous games it

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.130 
and in all the other previous games it
doesn't<00:02:15.030> look<00:02:15.330> like<00:02:15.390> he<00:02:15.570> actually<00:02:15.720> caused<00:02:16.020> the

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
doesn't look like he actually caused the

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.880 
doesn't look like he actually caused the
bite<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:16.350> 87

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
bite of 87

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.470 
bite of 87
but<00:02:17.130> right<00:02:17.340> now<00:02:17.520> from<00:02:17.760> this<00:02:17.910> five<00:02:18.120> nights<00:02:18.360> at

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
but right now from this five nights at

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.970 
but right now from this five nights at
freddy's<00:02:18.690> 4<00:02:18.720> trailer<00:02:19.140> least<00:02:19.380> what<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:19.530> can<00:02:19.710> see

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.950 
freddy's 4 trailer least what I can see
from<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.310> trailers<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:20.850> far<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.180> do<00:02:21.390> believe

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
from the trailers so far I do believe

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.290 
from the trailers so far I do believe
that<00:02:22.440> body<00:02:22.710> actually<00:02:23.010> caused<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.790> bite<00:02:23.970> of<00:02:24.000> 87

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
rows of teeth through as a medicine

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.170 
rows of teeth through as a medicine
teeth<00:03:16.290> just<00:03:16.800> coming<00:03:17.190> straight<00:03:17.220> at<00:03:17.610> them<00:03:18.000> their

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
their nightmare I think it definitely

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.610 
their nightmare I think it definitely
means<00:03:21.090> they're<00:03:21.239> a<00:03:21.269> Lisa<00:03:21.570> it<00:03:21.840> makes<00:03:22.049> sense<00:03:22.320> that

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
means they're a Lisa it makes sense that

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.130 
means they're a Lisa it makes sense that
that<00:03:23.370> this<00:03:23.549> victim<00:03:23.970> of<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.360> bite<00:03:24.480> of<00:03:24.570> 87<00:03:24.660> or

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
that this victim of the bite of 87 or

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.240 
that this victim of the bite of 87 or
maybe<00:03:25.380> someone<00:03:25.620> who<00:03:25.650> witnessed<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.100> bite<00:03:26.220> of

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
maybe someone who witnessed the bite of

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.949 
maybe someone who witnessed the bite of
87<00:03:26.400> if<00:03:26.820> they<00:03:26.970> are<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.269> playable<00:03:27.600> character

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
87 if they are the playable character

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.229 
87 if they are the playable character
actually<00:03:28.410> saw<00:03:28.920> her<00:03:29.070> actually<00:03:29.250> experience<00:03:30.000> a

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
actually saw her actually experience a

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.449

Bonnie tearing outer earth chomping on

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.130 
Bonnie tearing outer earth chomping on
the<00:03:32.610> brains<00:03:32.880> either<00:03:33.209> themselves<00:03:33.480> or<00:03:33.900> someone

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
the brains either themselves or someone

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.840 
the brains either themselves or someone
that<00:03:34.230> they<00:03:34.380> were<00:03:34.440> actually<00:03:34.769> watching<00:03:34.920> in<00:03:35.340> the

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
that they were actually watching in the

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.400 
that they were actually watching in the
frats<00:03:36.090> bears<00:03:36.330> pizza<00:03:36.750> so<00:03:36.810> essentially<00:03:37.290> that's

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
frats bears pizza so essentially that's

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.199 
frats bears pizza so essentially that's
what<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:37.530> think<00:03:37.920> that<00:03:38.100> is<00:03:38.370> just<00:03:38.489> my<00:03:38.820> theory

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
what I think that is just my theory

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.670 
what I think that is just my theory
though<00:03:39.239> you<00:03:39.390> guys<00:03:39.600> are<00:03:39.810> all<00:03:39.930> entitled<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.470> your

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
though you guys are all entitled to your

though you guys are all entitled to your
own<00:03:40.739> opinions<00:03:41.400> as<00:03:41.519> well<00:03:41.549> that<00:03:42.239> is<00:03:42.360> why<00:03:42.450> these

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
own opinions as well that is why these

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.850 
own opinions as well that is why these
are<00:03:42.660> theory<00:03:43.049> videos<00:03:43.260> we<00:03:43.350> guys<00:03:43.470> don't<00:03:43.709> agree

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
are theory videos we guys don't agree

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.319 
are theory videos we guys don't agree
with<00:03:43.980> my<00:03:44.100> theory<00:03:44.400> that<00:03:44.430> is<00:03:44.730> perfectly<00:03:45.239> fine

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
with my theory that is perfectly fine

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:46.580 
with my theory that is perfectly fine
you<00:03:45.660> can<00:03:45.750> let<00:03:45.840> me<00:03:45.870> know<00:03:45.959> any<00:03:46.019> of<00:03:46.260> your<00:03:46.410> theories

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
you can let me know any of your theories

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.259 
you can let me know any of your theories

love to really reply to every single one
of<00:03:50.459> those<00:03:50.880> theories<00:03:51.209> but<00:03:51.450> I<00:03:51.480> think<00:03:51.630> it's<00:03:51.720> gonna

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
of those theories but I think it's gonna

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.660 
of those theories but I think it's gonna
be<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.079> end<00:03:52.290> of<00:03:52.620> today's<00:03:52.950> video<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.340> guys<00:03:53.489> did
