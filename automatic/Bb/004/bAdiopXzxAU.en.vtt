playing evil minecraft I've been

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.569 
playing evil minecraft I've been

following this since 1.7 point 3 and I

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:28.400 
following this since 1.7 point 3 and I
always<00:00:26.789> like<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.150> play<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.779> with<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.020> aether

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.819 
always like to play it with the aether
but<00:00:29.070> sadly<00:00:29.310> that's<00:00:29.700> not<00:00:29.820> updated<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:31.079> i<00:00:31.559> guess

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:31.829 
but sadly that's not updated so i guess

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:34.729 
but sadly that's not updated so i guess
this<00:00:31.980> will<00:00:32.130> do<00:00:32.719> once<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.989> comes<00:00:34.140> out<00:00:34.350> i<00:00:34.410> will

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
this will do once it comes out i will

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.200 
this will do once it comes out i will
put<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.670> aether<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.149> but<00:00:36.480> yeah<00:00:37.250> so<00:00:38.250> we<00:00:39.090> have

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
put the aether in but yeah so we have

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.450

our<00:00:39.239> Start<00:00:39.750> menu<00:00:40.050> which<00:00:40.230> has<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.190> bit

different<00:00:44.719> layout<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:46.020> guess<00:00:46.440> but<00:00:48.020> here<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.140> is

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
different layout I guess but here it is

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.229 
different layout I guess but here it is
a<00:00:49.620> human<00:00:50.280> which<00:00:51.090> that's<00:00:51.570> me<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:53.239> character

different<00:01:05.250> advantages<00:01:05.659> by<00:01:06.659> logging<00:01:07.110> out<00:01:07.470> and

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
different advantages by logging out and

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.340 
different advantages by logging out and
switching<00:01:08.399> them<00:01:08.610> if<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:09.299> want<00:01:09.479> but<00:01:09.750> I'm

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
switching them if you want but I'm

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.870 
switching them if you want but I'm
probably<00:01:10.649> not<00:01:10.920> going<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.159> be<00:01:11.220> switching<00:01:11.729> them

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
probably not going to be switching them

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.850 
probably not going to be switching them
that<00:01:12.030> much<00:01:12.240> be<00:01:12.810> just<00:01:13.140> because<00:01:13.409> it's<00:01:13.590> kind<00:01:13.740> of

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
that much be just because it's kind of

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.730 
that much be just because it's kind of
cheap<00:01:14.130> cuz<00:01:15.030> like<00:01:15.750> some<00:01:16.079> of<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.290> stuff<00:01:16.530> is

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
cheap cuz like some of this stuff is

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.530 
cheap cuz like some of this stuff is
like<00:01:16.770> test<00:01:17.219> if<00:01:17.399> get<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.700> could<00:01:17.969> start<00:01:18.210> off<00:01:18.360> with

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
like test if get I could start off with

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.780 
like test if get I could start off with
text<00:01:18.840> test<00:01:19.320> if<00:01:19.530> akit<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:19.950> spawn<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.460> village

and melee damage I also minds faster so
I<00:02:25.770> guess<00:02:25.890> that's<00:02:26.190> pretty<00:02:26.340> much<00:02:26.520> it<00:02:26.580> I<00:02:26.940> hope<00:02:27.420> you

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
I guess that's pretty much it I hope you

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.180

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.110 

okay<00:02:38.780> so<00:02:38.840> I<00:02:39.019> guess<00:02:39.230> we<00:02:39.530> spawned<00:02:39.890> in<00:02:40.099> a<00:02:40.250> ice

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
okay so I guess we spawned in a ice

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.890 
okay so I guess we spawned in a ice
volume<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:42.790> there<00:02:43.790> was<00:02:44.060> fancy<00:02:44.599> blocks

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
volume and there was fancy blocks

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.710 
volume and there was fancy blocks
earlier<00:02:45.650> but<00:02:46.040> just<00:02:46.519> because<00:02:46.700> lag<00:02:47.209> and<00:02:47.450> stuff

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
earlier but just because lag and stuff

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:55.270 
earlier but just because lag and stuff
what<00:02:47.989> does<00:02:48.319> heck<00:02:52.780> but<00:02:53.780> I<00:02:53.810> guess<00:02:54.140> blocks<00:02:54.860> day

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
what does heck but I guess blocks day

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:03.820 
what does heck but I guess blocks day
like<00:02:58.209> cracked<00:02:59.209> I<00:02:59.540> guess<00:02:59.810> in<00:03:00.080> this<00:03:02.650> here<00:03:03.650> I'll

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
like cracked I guess in this here I'll

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.180 
like cracked I guess in this here I'll
show<00:03:03.860> you<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.459> fancy<00:03:04.970> blocks<00:03:05.739> but<00:03:06.739> this<00:03:07.010> will

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
show you the fancy blocks but this will

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.850 
show you the fancy blocks but this will
probably<00:03:07.400> crash<00:03:07.730> or<00:03:08.030> something<00:03:08.060> I<00:03:08.569> don't<00:03:08.629> know

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
probably crash or something I don't know

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:16.110 
probably crash or something I don't know
but<00:03:10.120> it<00:03:11.120> looks<00:03:11.180> pretty<00:03:11.690> cool<00:03:12.140> look<00:03:12.620> at<00:03:12.739> that

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:24.089 

but<00:03:17.120> it<00:03:17.209> gets<00:03:17.329> really<00:03:17.569> like<00:03:17.840> as<00:03:18.079> you<00:03:18.290> see<00:03:18.709> here

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:34.930 

so<00:03:25.540> I'm<00:03:27.489> set<00:03:28.489> that<00:03:28.730> back<00:03:31.180> okay<00:03:33.670> and<00:03:34.670> of<00:03:34.910> course

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
so I'm set that back okay and of course

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:43.410 
so I'm set that back okay and of course
this<00:03:35.360> blood<00:03:35.720> and<00:03:37.599> stuff<00:03:38.709> stupid<00:03:39.709> music<00:03:41.139> okay

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
this blood and stuff stupid music okay

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:50.340 
this blood and stuff stupid music okay
so<00:03:44.420> um<00:03:46.120> you<00:03:47.120> die<00:03:47.780> with<00:03:48.170> that<00:03:48.440> so<00:03:49.010> that's<00:03:49.250> pretty

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
so um you die with that so that's pretty

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.210 
so um you die with that so that's pretty
bad<00:03:51.350> maybe<00:03:51.799> I<00:03:52.220> don't<00:03:52.940> know<00:03:53.769> can<00:03:54.769> be<00:03:54.920> easily

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
bad maybe I don't know can be easily

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.900 
bad maybe I don't know can be easily
used<00:03:55.489> for<00:03:55.910> a<00:03:55.940> trap<00:03:56.239> though<00:03:56.599> I<00:03:56.660> can<00:03:57.730> see<00:03:58.730> how<00:03:58.880> I

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
used for a trap though I can see how I

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:06.819 
used for a trap though I can see how I
could<00:03:59.060> do<00:03:59.329> that<00:04:05.049> let's<00:04:06.049> just<00:04:06.109> collect<00:04:06.590> some

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
could do that let's just collect some

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:08.349 
could do that let's just collect some
wood<00:04:06.859> here<00:04:07.310> I<00:04:07.340> don't<00:04:07.730> know<00:04:07.880> what<00:04:08.030> I'm<00:04:08.150> going<00:04:08.299> to

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 
wood here I don't know what I'm going to

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:10.990 
wood here I don't know what I'm going to
do<00:04:08.569> I<00:04:08.780> might<00:04:09.470> actually<00:04:09.680> start<00:04:10.489> exploring

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
do I might actually start exploring

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.710 
do I might actually start exploring
first<00:04:12.669> yeah<00:04:13.669> I<00:04:13.700> think<00:04:13.940> that's<00:04:14.269> what<00:04:14.419> I<00:04:14.450> should

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
first yeah I think that's what I should

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.170 
first yeah I think that's what I should
do<00:04:17.169> but<00:04:18.169> i<00:04:18.229> just<00:04:18.530> want<00:04:18.709> to<00:04:18.769> see<00:04:19.280> one<00:04:19.519> thing<00:04:19.849> I

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
do but i just want to see one thing I

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.750 
do but i just want to see one thing I
move<00:04:21.139> a<00:04:21.169> bit<00:04:21.500> faster<00:04:22.039> with<00:04:22.160> this<00:04:22.310> guy<00:04:22.520> by<00:04:22.729> the

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
move a bit faster with this guy by the

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.310 
move a bit faster with this guy by the
way<00:04:23.000> though<00:04:24.220> so<00:04:25.220> I<00:04:25.580> see<00:04:26.419> log<00:04:26.690> what<00:04:26.960> does<00:04:27.139> this

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
way though so I see log what does this

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.030 
way though so I see log what does this
make<00:04:29.680> does<00:04:30.680> not<00:04:30.950> make<00:04:31.190> anything<00:04:31.430> angry

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040
