one deep all the way across here and

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.799 
one deep all the way across here and
then<00:00:51.059> put<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.600> row<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.870> cactuses<00:00:52.620> on<00:00:52.860> your<00:00:53.370> sand

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809

then put a row of cactuses on your sand
right<00:00:54.809> here<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:56.129> catch<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.640> cannot<00:00:56.910> go<00:00:57.149> next

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
right here and catch this cannot go next

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.319 
right here and catch this cannot go next
to<00:00:57.539> each<00:00:57.660> other<00:00:58.129> and<00:01:00.500> then<00:01:01.500> you're<00:01:01.710> gonna<00:01:02.329> put

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
to each other and then you're gonna put

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.120 
to each other and then you're gonna put
a<00:01:03.359> row<00:01:03.750> straight<00:01:04.589> across<00:01:04.860> right<00:01:05.220> here<00:01:06.080> and

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
a row straight across right here and

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.020 
a row straight across right here and
then<00:01:08.130> you're<00:01:08.310> going<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.520> remove<00:01:08.939> them<00:01:11.030> the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
then you're going to remove them the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.090 
then you're going to remove them the
remove<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.810> blocks<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.380> are<00:01:13.619> in<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.920> middle

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
remove the blocks that are in the middle

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.020 
remove the blocks that are in the middle
of<00:01:14.900> each<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.560> these<00:01:16.740> cactuses<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.700> go<00:01:17.880> right

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
of each of these cactuses that go right

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.649 
of each of these cactuses that go right
here<00:01:19.580> because<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.759> will<00:01:20.909> allow<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.180> cactus

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
here because that will allow the cactus

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.539 
here because that will allow the cactus
to<00:01:21.810> grow<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.229> then<00:01:22.320> drop<00:01:23.750> into<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.780> water

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
to grow and then drop into the water

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.679 
to grow and then drop into the water
then<00:01:26.549> you're<00:01:26.820> going<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.000> put<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.240> row<00:01:27.479> right

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
then you're going to put a row right

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.050 
then you're going to put a row right
here<00:01:27.720> because<00:01:29.299> sand<00:01:30.500> drop<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.939> because<00:01:32.939> if

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
here because sand drop the because if

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.460 
here because sand drop the because if
you<00:01:33.180> want<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.420> make<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.630> high<00:01:33.810> higher<00:01:35.509> the<00:01:36.509> sand

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
you want to make it high higher the sand

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.969 
you want to make it high higher the sand
will<00:01:37.710> drop<00:01:38.040> if<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.340> don't<00:01:38.490> put<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> row<00:01:39.979> right

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
will drop if you don't put a row right

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.590 
will drop if you don't put a row right
here<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.520> just<00:01:41.640> put<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.880> row<00:01:42.000> right<00:01:42.180> there<00:01:42.420> and

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
here so I just put a row right there and

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.999 
here so I just put a row right there and
then<00:01:42.659> put<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.869> sand<00:01:43.110> on<00:01:43.200> top<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.680> then

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
then put the sand on top of it and then

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.590 
then put the sand on top of it and then
made<00:01:44.220> did<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.180> same<00:01:45.420> thing<00:01:47.210> just<00:01:48.210> depending

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
made did the same thing just depending

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.240 
made did the same thing just depending
on<00:01:48.630> out<00:01:48.899> how<00:01:49.140> many<00:01:49.200> rows<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.770> want<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.070> make

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
on out how many rows you want to make

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.139 
on out how many rows you want to make
and<00:01:51.229> how<00:01:52.229> many<00:01:52.340> how<00:01:53.340> high<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.640> want<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:54.000> make

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
and how many how high you want to make

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.730 
and how many how high you want to make
it<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:54.420> how<00:01:54.570> many<00:01:54.600> cactuses<00:01:55.320> you'll<00:01:55.530> probably

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
it is how many cactuses you'll probably

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.880 
it is how many cactuses you'll probably
get<00:01:56.869> pens<00:01:57.869> on<00:01:58.079> how<00:01:58.200> many<00:01:58.259> texts<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.890> get<00:02:00.890> so

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
get pens on how many texts you get so

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.790 
get pens on how many texts you get so
hold<00:02:02.549> up

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
you really do is that Keck's can't go

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.260 
you really do is that Keck's can't go
next<00:02:11.470> to<00:02:11.530> each<00:02:11.650> other<00:02:11.830> and<00:02:12.160> if<00:02:12.820> you<00:02:12.970> place<00:02:13.240> a

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
here because sometimes the drops from

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.130 
here because sometimes the drops from
the<00:02:51.880> cactuses<00:02:52.270> will<00:02:52.480> go<00:02:52.600> on<00:02:52.690> top<00:02:52.870> of<00:02:53.050> these

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
the cactuses will go on top of these

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.800 
the cactuses will go on top of these
blocks<00:02:53.440> right<00:02:53.680> here<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.190> you<00:02:54.570> won't<00:02:55.570> don't

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
blocks right here and you won't don't

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.930 
blocks right here and you won't don't
want<00:02:55.960> them<00:02:56.080> to<00:02:56.200> happen<00:02:56.320> and<00:02:56.770> to<00:02:57.430> prevent<00:02:57.730> that

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
want them to happen and to prevent that

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.890 
want them to happen and to prevent that
you<00:02:58.060> need<00:02:58.180> to<00:02:58.240> put<00:02:58.390> this<00:02:58.540> roof<00:02:59.760> so<00:03:00.780> for<00:03:01.780> the

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
you need to put this roof so for the

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.080 
you need to put this roof so for the

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
then when the water stopped I dug one

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.330 
then when the water stopped I dug one
down<00:03:09.570> to<00:03:10.570> make<00:03:10.750> it<00:03:10.870> keep<00:03:11.050> flowing<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:11.739> then

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
down to make it keep flowing and then

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.400 
down to make it keep flowing and then
once<00:03:12.580> it<00:03:12.730> stops<00:03:12.970> right<00:03:13.209> here<00:03:13.270> want<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.260> make

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410

water<00:03:20.320> will<00:03:20.800> connect<00:03:21.130> to<00:03:21.310> that<00:03:21.459> water

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
water will connect to that water

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.900 
water will connect to that water
sometimes<00:03:24.250> there<00:03:24.489> will<00:03:24.730> be<00:03:26.280> water<00:03:27.280> that's<00:03:27.640> not

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910
