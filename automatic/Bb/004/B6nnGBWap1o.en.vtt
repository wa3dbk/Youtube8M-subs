00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.150
 contrary to those of basil it is a 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.820
 piece that normally in the cooked kitchen 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:41.210
 is proposed to season various types of 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.340

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.980
 you have a nice stone mortar and a 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.780
 wooden pestle as per tradition for 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.420
 the pesto alla genovese 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.789
