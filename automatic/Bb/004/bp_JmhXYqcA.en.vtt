00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.140
 as usual 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.730
 for me to racing guy so 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.730
 better meets equal to match 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.430
 you've talked to the guys with whom 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.110
 we speak we speak the great 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.939
 also that we give you the tips with 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.610
 someone abdomen usually has a chance 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.470
 that nobody when to upload so it's a 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.750
 chain is passing by transmitting things 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.640
 A) Yes 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.379
 it is important to keep the base the group 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.510
 that has been formed and started that will be 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.470
 part of the previous tournament I think it makes 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.470
 something else is missing 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.149
 we will receive the best way 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.550
 one spoke the other day corvalan like the 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.020
 own ortiz already pointing to what's coming 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.940
 and also mentioning what 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.809
 missed on the team to be able to fight 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.760
 until the end 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.260
 the goal is to be able to fight until the 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.540
 last dates 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.220
 maybe now we have the obligation is 33 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.500
 points we have the obligation so 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.330
 less reach it and overcome it we are going to 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.800
 try three objective objectives to 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.960
 short term but try to overcome the 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:27.040
 30 points back and release for 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:27.880
 that we are to talk about obligation and 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.520
 Pressure 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:42.119
 big is always with the year the 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:42.119
 we had with it so yeah 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.420
 the truth 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.920
 bruno that you think he needs to 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:04.100
 just overcome these 33 points 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.350
 and well we were talking before last 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.080
 it starts that we were missing in the position 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.670
 of the ball so that the strikers and the 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.709
 flyers our creatives get them 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:18.130
 cleaner maybe work more and about 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:23.380
 solid defensive we have to work 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.380
 staff is a continuity 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:30.040
 when you want to keep playing treat 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.040
 to maintain 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:51.740
 if you think it's your tournament to take off 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.390
 one always that this grace in the 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.700
 first always think those always 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.560
 imagine dream symbol hopefully my turn 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.560
 sheet to touch my classmates and they can
