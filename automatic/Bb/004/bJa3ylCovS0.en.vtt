approach speed can vary significantly

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.790

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.130 

I<00:03:03.650> can<00:03:04.459> take<00:03:04.640> turn<00:03:04.879> floor<00:03:05.239> flat<00:03:05.540> out<00:03:05.750> but<00:03:06.050> it

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
I can take turn floor flat out but it

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.330 
I can take turn floor flat out but it
will<00:03:06.260> cause<00:03:06.440> me<00:03:06.650> to<00:03:06.800> lose<00:03:06.830> too<00:03:07.160> much<00:03:07.280> time

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
will cause me to lose too much time

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.820

leading<00:03:08.000> into<00:03:08.300> turn<00:03:08.540> five<00:03:08.870> so<00:03:09.590> I'm<00:03:09.680> going<00:03:09.800> to

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
leading into turn five so I'm going to

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.559 
leading into turn five so I'm going to
lift<00:03:10.010> enough<00:03:10.310> to<00:03:10.430> keep<00:03:10.580> two<00:03:10.790> drivers<00:03:11.060> right<00:03:11.390> on

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
lift enough to keep two drivers right on

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.960 
lift enough to keep two drivers right on

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
the exit of four I may adjust this if

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.580 
the exit of four I may adjust this if
there<00:03:14.150> are<00:03:14.209> other<00:03:14.330> cars<00:03:14.599> around<00:03:14.690> me<00:03:15.080> and<00:03:15.410> I'm

there are other cars around me and I'm

there are other cars around me and I'm

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.350 

as<00:03:22.740> soon<00:03:22.950> as<00:03:23.070> I'm<00:03:23.190> through<00:03:23.340> turn<00:03:23.580> four<00:03:23.610> I'm<00:03:24.180> off

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
as soon as I'm through turn four I'm off

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.540 
as soon as I'm through turn four I'm off
power<00:03:24.600> and<00:03:24.870> transitioning<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.470> break<00:03:25.800> even

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
power and transitioning to break even

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.040 
power and transitioning to break even
before<00:03:26.670> I've<00:03:26.910> completed<00:03:27.300> unwinding<00:03:27.930> the

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
before I've completed unwinding the

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.260 
before I've completed unwinding the
wheel<00:03:28.230> I'm<00:03:28.830> on<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.280> brakes<00:03:29.490> as<00:03:29.670> hard<00:03:29.700> as<00:03:29.940> I<00:03:30.030> can

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
wheel I'm on the brakes as hard as I can

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.090 
wheel I'm on the brakes as hard as I can
be<00:03:30.480> but<00:03:30.780> because<00:03:31.110> there's<00:03:31.290> so<00:03:31.440> much<00:03:31.590> load<00:03:31.890> on

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
be but because there's so much load on

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.740 
be but because there's so much load on
the<00:03:32.220> left<00:03:32.430> side<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:33.090> car<00:03:33.270> is<00:03:33.420> prone<00:03:33.720> to

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
the left side the car is prone to

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.990 
the left side the car is prone to
locking<00:03:34.350> up<00:03:34.470> both<00:03:34.740> of<00:03:34.770> the<00:03:35.010> right<00:03:35.160> side<00:03:35.400> tires

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
locking up both of the right side tires

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000 
locking up both of the right side tires
so<00:03:36.360> about<00:03:36.600> half<00:03:36.840> brake<00:03:37.200> pedal<00:03:37.560> is<00:03:37.590> about<00:03:37.860> as

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
so about half brake pedal is about as

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.040 
so about half brake pedal is about as
much<00:03:38.160> as<00:03:38.220> I<00:03:38.430> can<00:03:38.610> get<00:03:38.700> away<00:03:38.760> with<00:03:39.120> you<00:03:39.900> can

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
much as I can get away with you can

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.450 
much as I can get away with you can
probably<00:03:40.260> stay<00:03:40.560> in<00:03:40.590> third<00:03:40.890> gear<00:03:41.100> for<00:03:41.310> turn

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460 
probably stay in third gear for turn
