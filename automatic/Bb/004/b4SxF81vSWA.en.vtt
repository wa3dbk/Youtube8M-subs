00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.859
 Welcome deposit is preview 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.429
 today it's about the new model of the 3d 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.870
 printer that is the plot likes four of them 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.269
 I need five pieces right now 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.840
 As you can see I am currently printing the 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.359
 parts for the second printer is there 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.310
 So a lot has already been printed 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.539
 and how you can recognize how it works 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.890
 300 x 200 mm actually pretty good 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.740
 and now this time stopped because 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.800
 I as a basis for the control one 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:39.030
 quaint dell latitude about 800 users 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.480
 or it's a deag tournee 800 and that 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.100
 Ding is easy and n73 with 800 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.840
 megahertz so that one can not but more 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.690
 try for it but start it 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.230
 Everything is still going on so what's up in it? 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.449
 In this case and I print just the 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:58.020
 y-axis or x-axis carrier that is so 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.590
 in Saxony holder as here the 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.270
 trolley for the islands axis and 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.409
 of course the weight extruder together 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.930
 with a few small parts 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.790
 the problem which now have time for 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.979
 Here's how to get on the video for sure 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.250
 can not tell is that the 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.760
 items not quite homogeneous printed 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.070
 become 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.860
 this is due to pressure in this case on 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.140
 So glass something that I never expected 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.049
 would actually have occurred 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.400
 Glas is not clear why that is 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.500
 I have not really been able to 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.600
 find out because 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.640
 there is no reason why that 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.800
 A problem should be if I am now 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.150
 go down here from my height 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.100
 and the whole a bit up close 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.840
 considered to find that 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.850
 for example here with this gear 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.100
 the lines are all a bit thin 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.960
 and that a bit suddenly become 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.520
 everything is here with the little one 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.950
 baker extruder gear is in fact 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.950
 but it is quite right next to it 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.440
 totally good without any 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.060
 difficulty is therefore clicks 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.240
 back here in this area 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.470
 actually backwards off and me 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.090
 just could not quite understand 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.070
 what this is now what the 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.540
 related if the other glass plan 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.959
 And that's how I am 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:13.410
 here glass plates can be cut extra 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:15.959
 and this is kam k mi 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.330
 flames glass so the company as 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.670
 camille flames resp 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.380
 it could also be that a glass should 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.860
 that is the name of the original 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.570
 meant for fireplace and there was mine 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.060
 hope that this is also reasonable 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.209
 works so far i say i am 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.830
 not completely disappointed but so plan 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.220
 as I thought, it just is not 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.230
 you can practically 230 x 200 maybe 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.510
 Also 240 x 200 you can reasonably 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.360
 clean dry but the last 60 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.890
 inches thick and yes that is 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.050
 somehow not as perfect as 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.700
 you can see here 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.590
 that's the construction that I get 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.690
 thought of it here for the straps 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.000
 leadership but just look where I 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.380
 collisions for the belt leadership that 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.120
 So does pretty cool that 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.980
 these little coffee makers here 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.310
 if you look at it from the side 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.980
 You can tell that here are small 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.900
 ball bearings are in there the vines are 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.370
 So almost frictionless third 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.340
 guided from below and from above is one 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.770
 pass disc in it is very much 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.470
 good and anni a construction of 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:25.320
 Christian here is a central one 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:27.150
 Storage of the ypsilon bremen 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.590
 So that's free of charge with me 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.660
 believe that emi has in his 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.870
 original construction relatively similar 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.270
 get it done or something similar 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.290
 The whole thing will be here in the middle 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:41.340
 handy to the trolley handy 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.830
 Jammed in the simple 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.260
 So we take the belts here 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.760
 practically the teeth with in the 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.010
 trolley then you can print 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.600
 the belt since precise use that 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.250
 maximum pressure given by the suck 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.709
 pain in and down then just stop 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.239
 simply the nozzle together with the bed 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.209
 extruder that is here one of 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.980
 hr3 he calls himself the problem on the 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.540
 he 3ds you always have to be down here 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.160
 on such a stupid metal plates underneath 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.660
 to glue the nozzle around the nozzle 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.920
 I do not think I'm that ideal 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.200
 So let's see if I will soon 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.720
 Build your own extruder somehow 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.360
 world extra but better to print because 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.150
 all this printing world extruder 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.280
 I currently do not think so 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.680
 nice so a combination of those 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.240
 here and one where the nozzle reasonable 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.530
 I thought it was great because of that 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.050
 nice thing about this is of course 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.620
 the role here back so say this 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.889
 poor 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.139
 which is stored directly here below 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.190
 plastic you can because you do not need 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.419
 individual parts with 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.160
 it all hangs together nicely 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.990
 everything works just wonderfully 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.380
 Stop the story with this one 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.030
 I think not quite so ideal solved 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.830
 that's how it looks when it's done 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.930
 I have a little here now 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.160
 video pushed because I believe it 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.380
 is quite interesting to see how 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.419
 neat and clean the whole will 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.980
 if you give them an exact 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.780
 Look at it I try it 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.000
 a little bit spicy what he did 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.520
 said not so easy 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.350
 because of the lighting and then you become one 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.130
 Realize that the parts are really here 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:12.940
 pure flowers are very great 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:17.080
 Here, too, the cellar story 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:19.510
 with the straps that's so good that 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:23.100
 you can insert the straps directly here 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:26.290
 You have to think we can do that 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:28.990
 vines are t25 that is a rather 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:31.540
 Teeth what you see here is straight 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.520
 a millimeter tall and they are 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.900
 all wonderfully clean up here 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.030
 now a mistake where I'm not quite 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.900
 exactly knows where it comes from but not 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.669
 so bad you go in there 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.500
 screwdriver in and then that is 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.390
 whole again clean which I also completely 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.330
 good at the whole story is 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:48.310
 that the whole thing is not more 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.229
 must be reworked so if you 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.680
 here a certain extent in the 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:56.260
 For example, construction pays attention 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.810
 plus 0.3 millimeters at the holes then 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:01.180
 you can suck it smacking here 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:04.979
 for example, the rods here 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:09.070
 push in the ihks axis holder 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:10.660
 and through the two holes the quasi 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.889
 here for a long time to this 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:15.710
 you can put here 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:18.469
 the whole city ​​then in plastic 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.569
 tighten so to speak because 

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:22.009
 the plastic is still under load 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:23.509
 a bit flexible and can 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:26.300
 be compressed 

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:28.610
 and that works very well 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.620
 There is no need for a crimping connector 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.300
 or something like that you can construct 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.180
 then just squeeze together like that 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:37.699
 Also the gear here you can see it too 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.039
 by 3d more is quite outstanding 

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:41.689
 they are relatively good 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:43.639
 designed together with the extruder 

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:45.139
 except for the problems that I have 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:46.520
 That's what people have said yesterday 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:48.259
 then just punch the air 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.729
 without somehow closing them 

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:51.500
 has the advantage she does not have to 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:53.330
 opening up has the big disadvantage that 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.610
 it's pretty stupid from below now 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.349
 looks partial but overall bin 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.099
 I am very happy with the print job here 

00:06:57.349 --> 00:07:02.659
 satisfied 

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:04.250
 that has become a nice palette na 

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:06.199
 Well that 's it, thank you 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.719
 to see and appreciate any 

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:11.529
 comments from there to the next 

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:11.529
 we'll see each other
