00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
mother and from this chapter you'd think

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.460 
mother and from this chapter you'd think
that<00:02:31.090> she<00:02:31.210> would<00:02:31.300> want<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.600> get<00:02:31.690> revenge<00:02:31.900> and

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
the way it sets it up is that her father

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.530 
the way it sets it up is that her father
jumps<00:02:35.500> in<00:02:35.740> and<00:02:36.010> it<00:02:36.370> makes<00:02:36.520> you<00:02:36.640> think<00:02:36.820> like<00:02:37.060> hmm

instance he can actually manipulate his
barriers<00:03:08.740> to<00:03:08.770> go<00:03:09.070> into<00:03:09.280> certain<00:03:09.670> forms<00:03:10.030> in

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
barriers to go into certain forms in

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.080 
barriers to go into certain forms in
shape<00:03:10.510> he<00:03:11.050> makes<00:03:11.320> a<00:03:11.470> staircase<00:03:11.920> this<00:03:12.580> chapter

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
shape he makes a staircase this chapter

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.460 
shape he makes a staircase this chapter
and<00:03:13.180> actually<00:03:13.510> manages<00:03:13.750> to<00:03:13.810> make<00:03:13.930> a<00:03:13.960> giant<00:03:14.260> a

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
and actually manages to make a giant a

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.170 
and actually manages to make a giant a
staircase<00:03:14.740> to<00:03:15.010> go<00:03:15.100> to<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.280> next<00:03:15.400> floor<00:03:15.640> of<00:03:16.060> the

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
staircase to go to the next floor of the

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.240 
staircase to go to the next floor of the
fortress<00:03:16.570> and<00:03:16.780> you<00:03:17.260> see<00:03:17.440> how<00:03:17.620> he<00:03:17.680> gets<00:03:17.980> hit<00:03:18.220> in

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
fortress and you see how he gets hit in

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.640 
fortress and you see how he gets hit in
the<00:03:18.340> face<00:03:18.610> because<00:03:19.240> he<00:03:19.480> couldn't<00:03:19.810> block<00:03:20.110> it<00:03:20.170> so

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
the face because he couldn't block it so

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.500 
the face because he couldn't block it so
this<00:03:20.980> reveals<00:03:21.340> that<00:03:21.520> he<00:03:21.640> has<00:03:21.760> a<00:03:21.790> certain<00:03:22.240> limit

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
this reveals that he has a certain limit

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.390 
this reveals that he has a certain limit
and<00:03:22.840> he<00:03:23.230> has<00:03:23.470> to<00:03:23.650> like<00:03:23.890> wait<00:03:24.100> until<00:03:24.310> the

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
and he has to like wait until the

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.550 
and he has to like wait until the
barrier<00:03:24.700> disappears<00:03:25.420> so<00:03:25.930> there<00:03:26.080> is<00:03:26.110> shocking

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
barrier disappears so there is shocking

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.750 
barrier disappears so there is shocking
to<00:03:26.590> find<00:03:26.830> out<00:03:26.950> something<00:03:27.160> like<00:03:27.340> that<00:03:27.550> i<00:03:27.580> mean

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
to find out something like that i mean

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.940 
to find out something like that i mean
the<00:03:28.060> biggest<00:03:28.360> thing<00:03:28.540> know<00:03:28.690> we<00:03:28.870> we<00:03:29.140> learned<00:03:29.410> was

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
the biggest thing know we we learned was

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.320 
the biggest thing know we we learned was
that<00:03:29.980> he<00:03:30.310> could<00:03:30.430> manipulate<00:03:30.490> the<00:03:30.970> shape<00:03:31.180> he

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
that he could manipulate the shape he

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.790 
that he could manipulate the shape he
could<00:03:31.450> probably<00:03:31.540> make<00:03:31.780> a<00:03:31.840> cube<00:03:32.260> a<00:03:32.530> cage

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
could probably make a cube a cage

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.340 
could probably make a cube a cage
whatever<00:03:33.520> and<00:03:33.850> I<00:03:34.209> wonder<00:03:34.480> exactly<00:03:34.570> how<00:03:34.930> far

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
whatever and I wonder exactly how far

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.990 
whatever and I wonder exactly how far
can<00:03:35.530> go<00:03:35.680> I'm<00:03:36.010> just<00:03:36.280> that's<00:03:36.490> my<00:03:36.700> big<00:03:36.880> question

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
can go I'm just that's my big question

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.390 
can go I'm just that's my big question
right<00:03:37.330> now<00:03:37.360> now<00:03:38.290> overall<00:03:38.830> that's<00:03:39.070> pretty<00:03:39.280> much

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
right now now overall that's pretty much

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.010 
right now now overall that's pretty much
all<00:03:39.610> that<00:03:39.820> really<00:03:39.940> happened<00:03:40.360> a<00:03:40.390> lot<00:03:40.570> of<00:03:40.750> setup

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
all that really happened a lot of setup

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.140 
all that really happened a lot of setup
