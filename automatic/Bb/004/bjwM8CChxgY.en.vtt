00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.079
 football since we find it we are going to 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.489
 tell our friend to come and be told 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.129
 Also stick to what is the boxcar 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.079
 Now that it's stuck I'll tell you 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.300
 to our friend that he goes away and goes 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.039
 what is your candles and good while I 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.260
 I will continue running around what is the 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.510
 football since our friend tells us that 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.550
 already got what you 'll see now we're going 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.229
 to take out what is the cell phone and we are going to 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.449
 mark what is this contact that 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:08.690
 it's called east now we're going to ask 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.060
 activate us what is it that the police 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.579
 ignore what crimes are now 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.990
 here we activate it we will go to 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:18.020
 paste what is a small 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.000
 4 that you already know we have 25 c4 so 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.579
 we have 25 opportunities to do it well 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.710
 this little 5 so every time 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.270
 we created what is an armored van we 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.520
 they will be giving 2000 experience 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.590
 apart that they are going to be giving us a 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.600
 some money so you'll be able to do 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.560
 the trick then getting what is the pp 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.140
 and money now and to take turns 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.850
 you and do not have to be leaving 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.920
 and looking for more vans what they can 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.770
 to do is that for example since you 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.459
 finish what are the 25 then of cuatros 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.289
 and when you get to number 26, follow him 

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:53.569
 running around until your friend then 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.009
 come and continue to chase him now in what 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:56.959
 which is the van while you 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.880
 you get into what the garage is and so 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:01.220
 obviously you help him feel help to you 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.810
 so I hope it will serve you immensely 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.429

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.080
