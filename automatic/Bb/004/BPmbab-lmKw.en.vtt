happy<00:01:12.960> about<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.770> first<00:01:14.040> one<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:15.350> it<00:01:16.350> makes

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
happy about the first one is it makes

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.899 
happy about the first one is it makes
typing<00:01:17.130> rather<00:01:17.759> mushy<00:01:18.750> quite<00:01:19.350> mushy<00:01:19.850> when<00:01:20.850> I

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
typing rather mushy quite mushy when I

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.030 
typing rather mushy quite mushy when I
began<00:01:21.240> using<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.259> tried<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.740> for<00:01:22.920> about

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
began using it and I tried it for about

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.620 
began using it and I tried it for about
an<00:01:23.310> entire<00:01:23.610> two<00:01:23.850> days<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.299> see<00:01:24.420> if<00:01:24.450> it's

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
an entire two days to see if it's

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.760 
an entire two days to see if it's
something<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.930> would<00:01:25.110> work<00:01:25.229> for<00:01:25.470> me<00:01:25.500> I

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
something that would work for me I

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.270 
something that would work for me I
noticed<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.729> was<00:01:26.759> typing<00:01:27.119> at<00:01:27.479> least<00:01:28.280> half

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
noticed that I was typing at least half

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.069 
noticed that I was typing at least half
at<00:01:29.670> least<00:01:29.909> fifty<00:01:30.180> percent<00:01:30.450> slower<00:01:30.810> than<00:01:31.020> I

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
at least fifty percent slower than I

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.590 
at least fifty percent slower than I
normally<00:01:31.170> type<00:01:31.909> making<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.970> lot<00:01:33.090> more<00:01:33.210> errors

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
normally type making a lot more errors

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.109 
normally type making a lot more errors
so<00:01:33.810> for<00:01:34.079> me<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.710> was<00:01:34.920> kind<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.369> really<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.759> big

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
so for me this was kind of really a big

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.190 
so for me this was kind of really a big
downer<00:01:36.420> for<00:01:36.540> me<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.750> thought<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:36.930> was<00:01:37.020> gonna<00:01:37.079> have

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
downer for me I thought I was gonna have

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.560 
downer for me I thought I was gonna have
a<00:01:37.290> lot<00:01:37.409> more<00:01:37.439> flexibility<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.220> writing

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
a lot more flexibility in the writing

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.130 
a lot more flexibility in the writing
also<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:40.049> noticed<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:41.540> not<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.840> much

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
also I noticed that not that much

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.780 
also I noticed that not that much
lighting<00:01:43.500> was<00:01:43.770> actually<00:01:44.159> coming<00:01:44.369> through

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
lighting was actually coming through

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.460 
lighting was actually coming through
from<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.689> lighting<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.290> keyboard

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
from the lighting in the keyboard

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.889 
from the lighting in the keyboard
underneath<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.670> know<00:01:47.759> supposedly<00:01:48.119> it's<00:01:48.720> a

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
underneath you know supposedly it's a

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.359 
underneath you know supposedly it's a
some<00:01:49.619> kind<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.920> semi<00:01:50.220> clear<00:01:50.490> material<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:52.369> the

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
some kind of semi clear material and the

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.410 
some kind of semi clear material and the
lighting<00:01:53.549> from<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.820> keyboard<00:01:54.030> should<00:01:54.329> be

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
lighting from the keyboard should be

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.639 
lighting from the keyboard should be
shining<00:01:54.689> through<00:01:54.840> but<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.110> really<00:01:55.380> really

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
shining through but it really really

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.639 
shining through but it really really
wasn't<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:56.630> overall<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.659> have<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.049> say<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.439> was

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
wasn't so overall I have to say I was

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.740 
wasn't so overall I have to say I was
generally<00:01:59.430> disappointed<00:02:00.210> by<00:02:00.329> this<00:02:00.390> and

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
generally disappointed by this and

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.899 
generally disappointed by this and
that's<00:02:00.810> why<00:02:01.619> today<00:02:01.920> actually<00:02:02.399> I'm<00:02:02.640> gonna<00:02:02.729> head

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
that's why today actually I'm gonna head

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.789 
that's why today actually I'm gonna head
over<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.180> mac<00:02:03.329> store<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.899> return<00:02:04.740> it

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
over to the mac store and return it

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.429 
over to the mac store and return it
because<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.399> just<00:02:05.490> wasn't<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.990> functional

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
because it just wasn't that functional

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.830 
because it just wasn't that functional
for<00:02:07.649> me<00:02:07.740> in<00:02:07.829> fact<00:02:08.069> as<00:02:08.459> soon<00:02:09.239> as<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.479> would<00:02:09.599> take

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
for me in fact as soon as I would take

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.610 
for me in fact as soon as I would take
it<00:02:09.869> off<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.979> would<00:02:11.129> start

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
it off and I would start

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.930 
it off and I would start
I think<00:02:11.860> I<00:02:11.950> felt<00:02:12.250> like<00:02:12.370> I<00:02:12.519> could<00:02:12.670> finally

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
I think I felt like I could finally

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.300 
I think I felt like I could finally
breathe<00:02:13.390> again<00:02:13.830> just<00:02:14.830> because<00:02:15.010> there's<00:02:15.190> so

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
breathe again just because there's so

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.610 
breathe again just because there's so
much<00:02:15.430> easier<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.790> type<00:02:15.940> so<00:02:16.180> for<00:02:16.360> now<00:02:16.560> I'm<00:02:17.560> going

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
much easier to type so for now I'm going

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.690 
much easier to type so for now I'm going
to<00:02:17.799> go<00:02:17.860> with<00:02:17.950> that<00:02:18.010> any<00:02:18.250> kind<00:02:18.459> of<00:02:18.519> keyboard
