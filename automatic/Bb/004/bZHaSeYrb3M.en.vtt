00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
there's a number of new areas we've

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.519 
there's a number of new areas we've
become<00:00:02.159> interested<00:00:02.939> in<00:00:03.060> for<00:00:03.540> phase<00:00:03.780> four<00:00:04.200> and

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
become interested in for phase four and

become interested in for phase four and
for<00:00:04.980> our<00:00:05.069> current<00:00:05.310> evaluations<00:00:06.410> one<00:00:07.410> of<00:00:07.560> them

what's<00:00:52.500> going<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.710> go<00:00:52.860> on<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:53.910> something

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
what's going to go on that is something

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.360 
what's going to go on that is something
the<00:00:54.300> frontal<00:00:54.629> lobe<00:00:54.750> does<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.739> does<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.039> very

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
the frontal lobe does it does it very

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.880 
the frontal lobe does it does it very
well<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:57.210> allows<00:00:57.629> us<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.870> have<00:00:57.989> foresight<00:00:58.649> so

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
well it allows us to have foresight so

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.860 
well it allows us to have foresight so
we're<00:00:59.550> studying<00:00:59.789> that<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.329> little<00:01:00.449> bit<00:01:00.660> more

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
we're studying that in a little bit more

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.460 
we're studying that in a little bit more
detail<00:01:01.350> for<00:01:02.190> phase<00:01:02.430> four<00:01:02.760> in<00:01:02.969> addition<00:01:03.899> we've

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
detail for phase four in addition we've

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.800 
detail for phase four in addition we've
become<00:01:04.710> much<00:01:05.040> more<00:01:05.100> interested<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:06.090> human

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
become much more interested in human

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.590 
become much more interested in human
social<00:01:07.229> beliefs<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.920> very<00:01:08.220> high<00:01:08.549> level<00:01:08.909> aspect

to legal and to moral beliefs and we're

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.490 
to legal and to moral beliefs and we're
studying<00:01:18.180> them<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.630> lot<00:01:18.810> more<00:01:18.840> detail

studying them in a lot more detail

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.100 
studying them in a lot more detail
because<00:01:19.710> it's<00:01:20.040> likely<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.729> damage<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
because it's likely that damage to the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.450 
because it's likely that damage to the
frontal<00:01:22.409> lobes<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.830> brain<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.369> the

frontal lobes of the brain and the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.670 
frontal lobes of the brain and the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
temporal lobes of the brain that we see

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.800 
temporal lobes of the brain that we see
with<00:01:25.979> our<00:01:26.009> vets<00:01:26.880> with<00:01:27.150> traumatic<00:01:27.450> brain

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
with our vets with traumatic brain

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.950 
with our vets with traumatic brain
injury<00:01:28.200> will<00:01:28.710> affect<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:29.460> some<00:01:30.090> way<00:01:30.329> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
injury will affect in some way the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.719 
injury will affect in some way the
nature<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.409> those<00:01:31.650> higher-level<00:01:31.920> social

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
nature of those higher-level social

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
beliefs now is this meaningful for our

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.480 
beliefs now is this meaningful for our
day-to-day<00:01:36.210> functioning<00:01:37.049> in<00:01:37.200> life<00:01:37.439> well<00:01:38.310> it

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
day-to-day functioning in life well it

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.880 
day-to-day functioning in life well it
could<00:01:38.700> be<00:01:38.880> I'll<00:01:39.240> give<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.479> one<00:01:39.659> example<00:01:39.890> say

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
could be I'll give you one example say

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.620 
could be I'll give you one example say
the<00:01:41.520> example<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.380> legal<00:01:43.380> beliefs<00:01:44.240> so<00:01:45.240> we<00:01:45.420> might

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
the example of legal beliefs so we might

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.490 
the example of legal beliefs so we might
have<00:01:45.869> somebody<00:01:46.200> judge<00:01:46.939> how<00:01:48.079> much<00:01:49.079> they<00:01:49.290> want

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
have somebody judge how much they want

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.490 
have somebody judge how much they want
to<00:01:49.619> punish<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.490> perpetrator<00:01:51.420> who's<00:01:52.079> committed

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
to punish a perpetrator who's committed

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.429 
to punish a perpetrator who's committed
a<00:01:52.560> crime<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.130> we<00:01:53.579> vary<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.479> severity<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.290> the

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
a crime and we vary the severity of the

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.980 
a crime and we vary the severity of the
crimes<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:56.549> we<00:01:56.759> want<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.180> see<00:01:57.360> which<00:01:57.600> crime

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
crimes so we want to see which crime

they<00:01:58.290> ranked<00:01:58.590> as<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.860> worst<00:01:59.250> they<00:01:59.729> might<00:02:00.000> want

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
they ranked as the worst they might want

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.380 
they ranked as the worst they might want
to<00:02:00.360> execute<00:02:00.719> somebody<00:02:01.170> or<00:02:01.619> give<00:02:01.950> them<00:02:02.390> capital

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390

punishment<00:02:03.899> all<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.560> way<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.770> probation<00:02:05.729> on

punishment all the way to probation on
the<00:02:06.240> other<00:02:06.420> end<00:02:06.719> so<00:02:07.320> we<00:02:07.439> have<00:02:07.649> them<00:02:07.860> make<00:02:08.039> these

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
the other end so we have them make these

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.639 
the other end so we have them make these
judgments<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.000> rankings<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.720> we<00:02:10.289> know<00:02:10.470> from

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
judgments and rankings and we know from

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.230 
judgments and rankings and we know from
a<00:02:10.800> previous<00:02:11.009> study<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.790> smaller<00:02:12.270> study

all<00:02:24.040> right<00:02:24.280> so<00:02:24.460> you<00:02:24.520> say<00:02:24.820> wow<00:02:25.090> we're<00:02:26.050> not<00:02:26.170> gonna

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
all right so you say wow we're not gonna

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.170 
all right so you say wow we're not gonna
put<00:02:26.500> him<00:02:26.590> on<00:02:26.710> a<00:02:26.740> jury<00:02:27.040> okay<00:02:27.610> they're<00:02:27.940> not<00:02:28.030> gonna

put him on a jury okay they're not gonna

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.940 
put him on a jury okay they're not gonna
do<00:02:28.360> very<00:02:28.570> well<00:02:28.600> if<00:02:28.780> they're<00:02:28.900> on<00:02:29.050> a<00:02:29.080> jury<00:02:29.410> but

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
do very well if they're on a jury but

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.470 
do very well if they're on a jury but
forget<00:02:30.280> about<00:02:30.370> a<00:02:30.520> jury<00:02:30.790> let's<00:02:31.060> say<00:02:31.210> they're<00:02:31.360> at

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
forget about a jury let's say they're at

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.540 
forget about a jury let's say they're at
home<00:02:31.600> and<00:02:31.660> they<00:02:31.840> have<00:02:31.960> kids<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:33.370> kids

misbehave<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:35.620> creates<00:02:35.980> more<00:02:36.190> conflicts

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
misbehave that creates more conflicts

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.390

with<00:02:37.510> their<00:02:37.690> spouse<00:02:38.020> for<00:02:38.710> example<00:02:39.250> in

with their spouse for example in

with their spouse for example in

determining how to punish those kids the

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.340 
determining how to punish those kids the
spouse<00:02:43.120> might<00:02:43.360> have<00:02:43.570> one<00:02:43.780> point<00:02:43.990> of<00:02:44.170> view

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
spouse might have one point of view

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.930 
spouse might have one point of view
which<00:02:44.560> is<00:02:44.590> consistent<00:02:45.370> with<00:02:45.430> sort<00:02:45.760> of<00:02:45.820> the

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
which is consistent with sort of the

which is consistent with sort of the

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
normal view of how to punish but the

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:49.770 
normal view of how to punish but the
person<00:02:48.910> who's<00:02:49.030> had<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.300> traumatic<00:02:49.600> brain

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780

injury<00:02:49.990> may<00:02:50.800> be<00:02:50.860> less<00:02:51.430> able<00:02:51.670> to<00:02:51.850> do<00:02:52.180> that<00:02:52.450> and

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
injury may be less able to do that and

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.530 
injury may be less able to do that and
may<00:02:53.170> not<00:02:53.380> punish<00:02:53.640> effectively<00:02:54.640> because<00:02:55.510> of

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
may not punish effectively because of

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.170 
may not punish effectively because of
that<00:02:55.780> so<00:02:56.440> that's<00:02:56.680> a<00:02:56.980> place<00:02:57.430> where<00:02:57.460> we<00:02:57.820> study<00:02:58.090> a

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
that so that's a place where we study a

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.810 
that so that's a place where we study a
higher<00:02:58.480> belief<00:02:58.960> which<00:02:59.410> is<00:02:59.620> how<00:03:00.280> you<00:03:00.340> punish

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
higher belief which is how you punish

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.110 
higher belief which is how you punish
somebody<00:03:01.090> for<00:03:01.330> misbehavior<00:03:02.170> and<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:03.880> can<00:03:04.030> be

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
somebody for misbehavior and it can be

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.110 
somebody for misbehavior and it can be
translated<00:03:04.570> directly<00:03:05.260> into<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.560> home<00:03:05.770> and

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
translated directly into the home and

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.180 
translated directly into the home and
