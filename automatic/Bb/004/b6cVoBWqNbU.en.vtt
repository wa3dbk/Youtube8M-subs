um I think my favorite thing that I do

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.369 
um I think my favorite thing that I do
with<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.400> business<00:00:56.580> is<00:00:57.089> signing<00:00:57.870> all<00:00:57.989> orders

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
with the business is signing all orders

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.460 
with the business is signing all orders
I<00:00:58.530> could<00:00:58.739> enjoy<00:00:59.010> breath<00:00:59.760> on<00:01:00.150> cost<00:01:00.870> all<00:01:01.050> orders

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470 
I could enjoy breath on cost all orders

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:07.219 
I could enjoy breath on cost all orders
and<00:01:01.850> I<00:01:02.850> feel<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:05.570> where<00:01:06.570> we<00:01:06.780> connect

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
and I feel that that is where we connect

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.780 
and I feel that that is where we connect
to<00:01:07.380> our<00:01:07.470> customers<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:09.110> I<00:01:10.110> think<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.220> it's<00:01:11.640> a

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
to our customers and I think that it's a

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.240 
to our customers and I think that it's a
really<00:01:12.060> neat<00:01:12.810> thing<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.350> we're<00:01:14.040> pretty

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
really neat thing that we're pretty

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.280 
really neat thing that we're pretty
individual<00:01:15.240> we're<00:01:15.690> the<00:01:15.780> only<00:01:15.900> one<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.140> do<00:01:16.260> it

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
individual we're the only one to do it

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.810 
individual we're the only one to do it
but<00:01:16.710> most<00:01:16.860> things<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.430> business<00:01:17.610> does

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
but most things that the business does

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.490 
but most things that the business does
for<00:01:18.240> our<00:01:18.330> family<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.960> makes<00:01:19.140> us<00:01:19.290> work

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
for our family is it makes us work

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.000 
for our family is it makes us work
together<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.310> we're<00:01:20.460> almost<00:01:20.549> always<00:01:20.820> together

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
together so we're almost always together

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.930 
together so we're almost always together
so<00:01:23.010> that's<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.220> business<00:01:23.430> we<00:01:23.670> wouldn't<00:01:23.850> have

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
so that's the business we wouldn't have

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.389 
so that's the business we wouldn't have
been<00:01:24.030> able<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.299> bring<00:01:24.479> my<00:01:24.600> dad<00:01:24.780> home<00:01:24.890> so<00:01:25.890> we<00:01:26.280> get
