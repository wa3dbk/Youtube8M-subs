00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
user interface that it's got a lighter

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.429 
user interface that it's got a lighter
overall<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.659> seems<00:02:03.869> pretty<00:02:04.049> much<00:02:04.170> the

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
true the battery life is improved and

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.229 
true the battery life is improved and
everything<00:02:07.530> pretty<00:02:07.860> much<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.250> snappy

everything pretty much is snappy

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.210 
everything pretty much is snappy

especially the multitasking functions
that<00:02:11.459> usually<00:02:11.879> took

now missing those minor things are

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.140 
now missing those minor things are
probably<00:03:07.680> because<00:03:08.489> of<00:03:08.519> the<00:03:08.790> cost<00:03:09.000> reduction

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150

probably because of the cost reduction
software<00:03:09.930> wise<00:03:10.079> or<00:03:10.319> the<00:03:10.409> hardware<00:03:10.650> wise<00:03:10.889> but

this not thing impressive it comes to

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.719 
this not thing impressive it comes to
the<00:04:51.810> strap<00:04:52.020> like<00:04:52.169> a<00:04:52.229> 410<00:04:52.620> processor<00:04:53.220> it's<00:04:53.610> a

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
an update the RAM wise it comes to 1.5

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.290 
an update the RAM wise it comes to 1.5

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
about the screen resolution of the phone

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.900 
about the screen resolution of the phone
and<00:05:08.780> the<00:05:09.780> thing<00:05:10.050> is<00:05:10.260> when<00:05:11.190> we<00:05:11.340> usually<00:05:11.490> hear

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
and the thing is when we usually hear

we suspect that it's not going to run as

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.250 
we suspect that it's not going to run as

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
snappy as the other phones but let's say

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.920 
snappy as the other phones but let's say
that<00:05:22.500> you<00:05:22.710> go<00:05:22.860> a<00:05:22.889> web<00:05:23.190> surfing<00:05:23.460> and<00:05:23.849> this<00:05:24.270> is<00:05:24.570> on

that you go a web surfing and this is on

the reactions overall is actually a lot

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
usable is nothing impressive but it's

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:23.060

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 
there

there
the<00:06:23.639> sound<00:06:23.849> quality<00:06:23.970> wasn't<00:06:24.630> that<00:06:24.810> great<00:06:25.139> the

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 
the sound quality wasn't that great the

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.110 
the sound quality wasn't that great the
call<00:06:25.590> quality<00:06:25.770> actually<00:06:26.310> was<00:06:26.580> better<00:06:26.849> than<00:06:27.030> we

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
call quality actually was better than we

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.689 
call quality actually was better than we
thought<00:06:27.330> but<00:06:27.659> the<00:06:27.990> speaker<00:06:28.590> or<00:06:28.979> the<00:06:29.220> music

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:29.699 
thought but the speaker or the music

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:31.310 
thought but the speaker or the music
coming<00:06:29.849> from<00:06:29.909> the<00:06:30.120> earphone<00:06:30.419> was<00:06:30.690> not<00:06:30.900> exactly

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.320 
coming from the earphone was not exactly

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.370 
coming from the earphone was not exactly
great<00:06:31.620> but<00:06:32.280> everything<00:06:33.229> everything<00:06:34.229> that

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 
great but everything everything that

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.350 
great but everything everything that
comes<00:06:34.590> short<00:06:34.950> was<00:06:35.159> mostly<00:06:35.729> covered<00:06:36.120> by<00:06:36.300> the

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
comes short was mostly covered by the

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.250 
comes short was mostly covered by the
battery<00:06:36.779> life<00:06:37.039> this<00:06:38.039> is<00:06:38.279> not<00:06:38.419> exactly<00:06:39.419> a<00:06:39.510> big

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260 
battery life this is not exactly a big

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.930 
battery life this is not exactly a big
green<00:06:40.410> phone<00:06:40.590> or<00:06:40.860> a<00:06:40.890> small<00:06:41.280> screen<00:06:41.520> phone<00:06:41.760> and

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 
green phone or a small screen phone and

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.060 
green phone or a small screen phone and
the<00:06:42.000> battery<00:06:42.270> capacity<00:06:42.360> seemed<00:06:42.990> to<00:06:43.320> just<00:06:43.740> fit

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.070 
the battery capacity seemed to just fit

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.280 
the battery capacity seemed to just fit
it<00:06:44.190> well<00:06:44.400> but<00:06:45.000> the<00:06:45.300> actual<00:06:45.660> battery<00:06:46.050> runtime

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:46.290 
it well but the actual battery runtime

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.380 
it well but the actual battery runtime
was<00:06:46.740> a<00:06:46.950> lot<00:06:47.280> better<00:06:47.580> than<00:06:47.790> we<00:06:47.940> thought

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:48.390 
was a lot better than we thought

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.690 
was a lot better than we thought
so<00:06:48.810> the<00:06:48.960> galaxy<00:06:49.260> grand<00:06:49.500> 3<00:06:49.680> is<00:06:49.890> a<00:06:49.920> no<00:06:50.280> surprise

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:50.700 
so the galaxy grand 3 is a no surprise

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.030 
so the galaxy grand 3 is a no surprise
or<00:06:50.910> it<00:06:51.030> doesn't<00:06:51.240> come<00:06:51.480> with<00:06:51.630> the<00:06:51.660> high<00:06:52.080> CPU<00:06:52.620> or

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:53.040 
or it doesn't come with the high CPU or

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.490 
or it doesn't come with the high CPU or

anything of the top-notch specs but for

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.590 
anything of the top-notch specs but for

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:00.600 
this kind of price you could get the

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.050 
this kind of price you could get the
