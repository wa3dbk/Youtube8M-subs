important first team player because
that's<00:03:08.260> what<00:03:08.350> we<00:03:08.500> want<00:03:08.680> and<00:03:09.070> he's<00:03:09.370> demanding

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
that's what we want and he's demanding

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.530 
that's what we want and he's demanding
2k<00:03:10.540> per<00:03:11.170> week<00:03:11.500> on<00:03:11.740> a<00:03:11.850> four-year<00:03:12.850> contract<00:03:13.360> and

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
2k per week on a four-year contract and

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.140 
2k per week on a four-year contract and
I'm<00:03:13.630> thinking<00:03:13.980> took<00:03:14.980> is<00:03:15.160> quite<00:03:15.550> a<00:03:15.580> bit<00:03:15.850> to<00:03:16.000> come

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
I'm thinking took is quite a bit to come

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.320 
I'm thinking took is quite a bit to come
out<00:03:16.240> my<00:03:16.360> budget<00:03:16.810> and<00:03:16.960> I<00:03:17.410> undercut<00:03:17.920> him<00:03:18.330> 1750

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
out my budget and I undercut him 1750

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.870 
out my budget and I undercut him 1750
but<00:03:19.780> I<00:03:20.020> do<00:03:20.200> put<00:03:20.590> him<00:03:20.710> as<00:03:20.830> an<00:03:21.070> important<00:03:21.700> first

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
but I do put him as an important first

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.490 
but I do put him as an important first
team<00:03:22.090> player<00:03:22.300> and<00:03:22.510> I<00:03:22.810> increase<00:03:23.320> his

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
team player and I increase his

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.980 
team player and I increase his
contracted<00:03:24.160> five<00:03:24.400> years<00:03:24.730> so<00:03:25.270> his<00:03:25.690> offer<00:03:25.840> is

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
contracted five years so his offer is

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.200 
contracted five years so his offer is
quite<00:03:26.230> good<00:03:26.470> hopefully<00:03:27.220> he<00:03:27.400> will<00:03:27.550> accept<00:03:28.060> that

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.210 
quite good hopefully he will accept that

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.720 
quite good hopefully he will accept that
I'd<00:03:28.390> be<00:03:28.480> fantastic<00:03:29.080> and<00:03:29.200> we<00:03:29.650> also<00:03:29.860> get<00:03:30.310> Nathan

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
I'd be fantastic and we also get Nathan

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.360

I just<00:04:27.729> think<00:04:27.850> it's<00:04:28.030> a<00:04:28.120> bit<00:04:28.240> better<00:04:28.360> the<00:04:28.600> place

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
I just think it's a bit better the place

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.300 
I just think it's a bit better the place
of<00:04:28.900> garden<00:04:29.169> tomb<00:04:29.320> that<00:04:29.410> moment<00:04:29.740> so<00:04:29.919> he<00:04:30.130> will

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
of garden tomb that moment so he will

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.360 
of garden tomb that moment so he will
fit<00:04:30.520> in<00:04:30.729> very<00:04:31.300> nicely<00:04:31.479> like<00:04:32.440> I<00:04:32.620> said<00:04:32.680> four<00:04:33.100> star

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
fit in very nicely like I said four star

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.850 
fit in very nicely like I said four star
skills<00:04:33.729> as<00:04:33.940> well<00:04:34.300> very<00:04:34.960> good<00:04:35.259> indeed<00:04:35.560> but<00:04:35.740> at

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
skills as well very good indeed but at

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.529 
skills as well very good indeed but at
the<00:04:35.979> moment<00:04:36.100> this<00:04:36.639> is<00:04:36.699> the<00:04:36.940> team<00:04:37.150> i'm<00:04:37.330> going

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
the moment this is the team i'm going

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.210 
the moment this is the team i'm going
with<00:04:37.720> keeping<00:04:38.259> Michael<00:04:38.440> shopper<00:04:38.919> in<00:04:39.039> there

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
with keeping Michael shopper in there

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.090 
with keeping Michael shopper in there
and<00:04:39.400> with<00:04:40.240> keeping<00:04:40.600> the<00:04:40.660> formation<00:04:41.169> at<00:04:41.350> 4231

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
and with keeping the formation at 4231

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.850 
and with keeping the formation at 4231
so<00:04:42.430> this<00:04:42.669> is<00:04:42.910> the<00:04:43.120> first<00:04:43.479> pregame<00:04:43.840> match<00:04:44.229> I<00:04:44.440> am

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
so this is the first pregame match I am

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.529 
so this is the first pregame match I am
swimming<00:04:45.220> these<00:04:45.520> because<00:04:46.150> they<00:04:46.270> are<00:04:46.300> just

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
swimming these because they are just

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.029 
swimming these because they are just
pregame<00:04:46.990> there<00:04:47.139> don't<00:04:47.350> really<00:04:47.560> matter<00:04:47.740> too

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:48.039 
pregame there don't really matter too

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:50.340 
pregame there don't really matter too
