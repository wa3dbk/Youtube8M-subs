I'm<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.980> little<00:00:53.340> worried<00:00:53.610> that's<00:00:53.820> going<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.480> be

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
I'm a little worried that's going to be

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.740 
I'm a little worried that's going to be
indicative<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.820> quality<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
indicative of the quality of the

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.450 
indicative of the quality of the
construction<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.410> these<00:00:58.590> figures<00:00:58.920> but<00:00:59.399> I

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
construction of these figures but I

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.450 
construction of these figures but I
guess<00:00:59.760> we'll<00:00:59.940> just<00:00:59.969> have<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.270> find<00:01:00.449> out<00:01:01.460> okay

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
guess we'll just have to find out okay

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.490 
guess we'll just have to find out okay
so<00:01:02.520> we<00:01:02.789> got<00:01:02.879> Blanca<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.719> cannow<00:01:04.260> their

so we got Blanca and cannow their
packaging<00:01:05.070> first<00:01:05.939> thoughts<00:01:06.860> they're<00:01:07.860> not<00:01:08.040> bad

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460

figures<00:01:09.090> actually<00:01:09.600> they<00:01:09.689> have<00:01:09.810> some<00:01:09.990> really

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
figures actually they have some really

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.560

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
nice things going for them but the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.530 
nice things going for them but the
quality<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.290> bit<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:14.010> distraction<00:01:14.540> for

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540

sculpted<00:02:09.959> figure<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.890> plastic<00:02:11.370> feels<00:02:11.580> a

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
sculpted figure the plastic feels a

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.360 
sculpted figure the plastic feels a
little

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
little

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.960 
little
keep<00:02:13.049> holding<00:02:14.049> him<00:02:14.260> in<00:02:14.409> my<00:02:14.560> hand<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.190> some<00:02:15.849> of

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
keep holding him in my hand and some of

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.809 
keep holding him in my hand and some of
the<00:02:16.030> joints<00:02:16.420> here<00:02:16.739> are<00:02:17.739> pretty<00:02:18.159> tight<00:02:18.519> like

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
the joints here are pretty tight like

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.699 
the joints here are pretty tight like
for<00:02:18.970> instance<00:02:19.269> this<00:02:20.790> shoulder<00:02:21.790> joint<00:02:22.150> here<00:02:22.709> it

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
for instance this shoulder joint here it

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.220 
for instance this shoulder joint here it
really<00:02:24.190> starts<00:02:24.819> to<00:02:24.940> make<00:02:25.360> some<00:02:25.599> noise<00:02:25.900> if<00:02:26.140> you

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
really starts to make some noise if you

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.490 
really starts to make some noise if you
tried<00:02:26.500> taking<00:02:26.830> it<00:02:27.069> too<00:02:27.610> far<00:02:27.970> above<00:02:28.810> that<00:02:28.870> point

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
tried taking it too far above that point

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.360 
tried taking it too far above that point
which<00:02:30.069> isn't<00:02:30.220> very<00:02:30.579> high<00:02:31.079> and<00:02:32.079> I'm<00:02:32.319> again<00:02:33.040> the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
which isn't very high and I'm again the

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.369 
which isn't very high and I'm again the
plastic<00:02:34.180> on<00:02:34.299> it<00:02:34.420> feels<00:02:34.629> a<00:02:34.720> little<00:02:34.810> cheap<00:02:35.110> so

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
plastic on it feels a little cheap so

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.410 
plastic on it feels a little cheap so
I'm<00:02:35.739> really<00:02:35.980> worried<00:02:36.190> about<00:02:36.280> breaking<00:02:36.610> that

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
I'm really worried about breaking that

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.949 
I'm really worried about breaking that
specific<00:02:38.200> joint<00:02:38.470> on<00:02:38.709> him<00:02:38.950> which<00:02:39.099> is<00:02:39.659> again<00:02:40.659> a

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
specific joint on him which is again a

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.410 
specific joint on him which is again a
bit<00:02:41.379> of<00:02:41.500> a<00:02:41.650> of<00:02:42.220> a<00:02:42.400> deterrent<00:02:42.760> from<00:02:43.090> from

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
bit of a of a deterrent from from

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.380 
bit of a of a deterrent from from
handling<00:02:43.780> him<00:02:43.989> too<00:02:44.170> much<00:02:44.379> but<00:02:45.239> otherwise<00:02:46.239> I

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
handling him too much but otherwise I

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.640 
handling him too much but otherwise I
really<00:02:46.720> like<00:02:46.989> what<00:02:47.170> they've<00:02:47.319> done<00:02:47.440> with<00:02:47.590> the

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
really like what they've done with the

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.490 
really like what they've done with the
figure<00:02:48.040> here<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.670> articulation<00:02:49.329> is<00:02:49.510> good<00:02:49.720> he

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
figure here the articulation is good he

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.349 
figure here the articulation is good he
has<00:02:50.590> a<00:02:50.620> little<00:02:51.040> bit<00:02:51.160> of<00:02:51.220> a<00:02:51.370> ball<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:51.849> joint<00:02:52.000> on

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359 
has a little bit of a ball and joint on

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.960 
has a little bit of a ball and joint on
his<00:02:52.540> head<00:02:53.140> and<00:02:53.470> but<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.400> head<00:02:54.579> has<00:02:54.790> some

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
his head and but the head has some

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.740 
his head and but the head has some
limited<00:02:55.540> movement<00:02:55.989> due<00:02:56.290> to<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.590> giant<00:02:57.750> hairdo

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
limited movement due to the giant hairdo

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.619 
limited movement due to the giant hairdo
here<00:02:59.250> it<00:03:00.250> doesn't<00:03:00.640> really<00:03:00.909> move<00:03:01.150> around<00:03:01.359> too

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
here it doesn't really move around too

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.140 
here it doesn't really move around too
much<00:03:01.659> but<00:03:02.079> he<00:03:02.170> got<00:03:02.349> a<00:03:02.379> little<00:03:02.859> bit<00:03:03.010> of<00:03:03.190> swivel

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
much but he got a little bit of swivel

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.839 
much but he got a little bit of swivel
there<00:03:04.299> the<00:03:04.810> shoulder<00:03:05.739> has<00:03:05.980> a<00:03:06.040> ball<00:03:06.549> and<00:03:06.670> socket

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
there the shoulder has a ball and socket

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.449 
there the shoulder has a ball and socket
with<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.150> hinge<00:03:07.510> this<00:03:08.319> shoulder<00:03:08.829> seems<00:03:09.159> to<00:03:09.340> move

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
with a hinge this shoulder seems to move

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.819 
with a hinge this shoulder seems to move
up<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:09.849> down<00:03:10.030> much<00:03:10.720> easier<00:03:10.989> than<00:03:11.379> this<00:03:11.620> one

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
up and down much easier than this one

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.979 
up and down much easier than this one
for<00:03:12.040> some<00:03:12.190> reason<00:03:12.239> then<00:03:13.239> we<00:03:13.359> have<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.720> hinge

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
for some reason then we have the hinge

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.339 
for some reason then we have the hinge
with<00:03:14.409> a<00:03:14.680> nice<00:03:15.269> rotation<00:03:16.269> ball<00:03:16.840> and<00:03:16.989> socket

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
there on the elbow the hands will rotate

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.900 
there on the elbow the hands will rotate
around<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:23.560> they<00:03:23.859> are<00:03:23.980> swappable<00:03:24.400> will<00:03:24.669> show

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
around and they are swappable will show

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.270 
around and they are swappable will show
you<00:03:24.970> the<00:03:25.209> swappable<00:03:25.870> hands<00:03:26.290> here<00:03:26.590> in<00:03:26.709> in<00:03:26.980> a

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
here on the upper torso which works out

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:37.740

though so you can get this guy in a lot

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:58.500 
though so you can get this guy in a lot
of<00:03:56.230> different<00:03:56.410> poses<00:03:56.769> which<00:03:57.129> is<00:03:57.280> great<00:03:57.549> and

I just wish they made this guy out of

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.059 
I just wish they made this guy out of
better<00:04:06.069> plastic<00:04:06.609> and<00:04:07.109> he<00:04:08.109> didn't<00:04:08.349> feel<00:04:08.799> as

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
better plastic and he didn't feel as
