it's a really good comfortable easy feel
I'm<00:01:30.320> say<00:01:30.530> with<00:01:30.649> the<00:01:30.740> side<00:01:30.920> cut<00:01:31.159> looks<00:01:31.939> like

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
I'm say with the side cut looks like

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:33.940 
I'm say with the side cut looks like
almost<00:01:32.299> a<00:01:32.420> nutritional<00:01:32.930> side<00:01:33.140> cut<00:01:33.409> feels<00:01:33.799> like

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
almost a nutritional side cut feels like

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.740 
almost a nutritional side cut feels like
a<00:01:33.979> traditional<00:01:34.460> side<00:01:34.700> but<00:01:34.970> but<00:01:35.540> what<00:01:35.630> it

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
a traditional side but but what it

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.390 
a traditional side but but what it
actually<00:01:35.870> is<00:01:36.050> it's<00:01:36.380> got<00:01:36.530> some<00:01:36.710> kink<00:01:37.010> areas

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
actually is it's got some kink areas

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.330 
actually is it's got some kink areas
kind<00:01:37.970> of<00:01:38.000> like<00:01:38.180> along<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:39.290> side<00:01:39.500> and<00:01:40.070> what

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
kind of like along the side and what

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.520 
kind of like along the side and what
that<00:01:40.490> does<00:01:40.640> is<00:01:40.700> it<00:01:40.909> distorted<00:01:41.780> delivers

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
that does is it distorted delivers

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.680 
that does is it distorted delivers
pressure<00:01:42.800> just<00:01:43.640> in<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:44.000> snow<00:01:44.210> when<00:01:44.570> you're

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
pressure just in the snow when you're

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.300 
pressure just in the snow when you're
turning<00:01:45.080> when<00:01:45.260> you're<00:01:45.380> making<00:01:45.590> turns<00:01:45.770> it's

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
turning when you're making turns it's

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.469 
turning when you're making turns it's
going<00:01:46.490> to<00:01:46.549> grip<00:01:46.760> a<00:01:46.790> little<00:01:46.880> bit<00:01:47.060> better<00:01:47.210> than

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
going to grip a little bit better than

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.719 
going to grip a little bit better than
like<00:01:47.630> a<00:01:47.659> regular<00:01:47.750> side<00:01:48.470> cut<00:01:48.680> wood<00:01:48.890> which<00:01:49.610> is

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
like a regular side cut wood which is

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.310 
like a regular side cut wood which is
pretty<00:01:49.880> rad<00:01:50.150> so<00:01:50.479> you<00:01:50.570> don't<00:01:50.720> even<00:01:50.810> notice<00:01:51.049> it

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
pretty rad so you don't even notice it

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.570 
pretty rad so you don't even notice it
but<00:01:51.500> you're<00:01:51.710> getting<00:01:51.799> better<00:01:52.040> edge<00:01:52.250> script

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
but you're getting better edge script

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.899 
but you're getting better edge script
