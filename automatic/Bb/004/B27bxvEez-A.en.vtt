00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.700
 The service is that's my weapon 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.469
 In soccer you always have this completely in 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.450
 hallucinations so we are now 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.740
 on the blog here on the blog how should 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.389
 be different in the tub in yours 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.980
 love death match map around course 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.920
 the box sports a bit too 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.760
 look at how they are doing 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.820
 because you do not have the front 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.990
 get along here with 10 on the way 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.519
 on recommend the kc of course 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.500
 not so good but that's not it 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.349
 necessarily to the patch because he is 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.910
 has screwed down but the 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.680
 fact that in the far 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.230
 distances was designed 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.079
 but as I said we try the sports 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.360
 to test and that proves of course 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.940
 in block not not so easy around 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.280
 my god oh my god 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.879
 Cluster fuck is not that easy because 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.739
 here the close fight anyway not so 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.940
 are transparent and you are not exactly 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.649
 knows where are the people now the 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.660
 Whole transports or book are book 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.890
 she tensed 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.739
 it was so many before that 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.030
 partly very stupid 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.680
 sponsored and mine 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.700
 wait some could save up to 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.990
 or at one time 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.390
 have emerged behind one 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.080
 indirectly it was then out of the spawn 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.549
 shot 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.229
 and of course that's not really true 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.340
 the yellow of the egg if you look at yourself 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.979
 in advance any position 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.799
 then you should have fought for it 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.570
 the advantage of this piece- wide course 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.430
 and not just from the next 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.950
 newsflash spot the whole time up 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.530
 the cap just gets a light weight 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.509
 be targeted and shot 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.520
 therefore we are here on the road says 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.990
 that was also taken away and 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.670
 try to give us a little bit of picture here 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.829
 make is first no pistol or 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.860
 no option anymore and have through the 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.880
 taser shit that of course now makes 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.470
 the matter of course more difficult of 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.899
 therefore first to grenade launcher 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.450
 but change them frankly here in 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.470
 also not hallein through effective me 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.299
 do not know if she still might 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.590
 Rescue patches should be in power yes 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.070
 absolutely hurt no just look 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.020
 body hits par excellence but 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.280
 here again a shit on it 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.870
 does not work he is not here 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.869
 more in the toilet when he comes in there's 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:12.450
 tidy the taser grenade that good thing 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.840
 well not come out of the window out 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.840
 is better 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.620
 the network that's nice so must the 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.630
 his 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.040
 only with calvin gets warm greetings 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.060
 to the cellar out there is the whole 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.440
 here more and would be such a live 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.700
 comments and that in duplicate 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.709
 execution 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.630
 because on one side I play here 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.989
 live while I chat with you here 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.190
 and on your side are here 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.540
 of course also spectators in the livestream 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.370
 hey going on all the time 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.450
 What are you doing ? We test 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.300
 battlefield leyen 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.320
 as I said the patch and yet before the 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.000
 laundry I do not consider myself as to the 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.560
 fun away now in the team deathmatch and 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.450
 I have to say that sports are 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.519
 more difficult to analyze than to 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.920
 for example, the adapted weapons 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.060
 changes in the framework of the k10 or also 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.440
 the battle is so mature 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.209
 crucial to one's first 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.060
 were announced or just the 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.410
 performance and I think about this 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.290
 these three important ones for me 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.480
 important factors in the end are the 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.420
 Last performance was improved 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:16.350
 I can confirm that, too 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:18.269
 then on the second group 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.170
 second position the weapons adjustments 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.610
 I rather than not necessarily yes like 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.650
 Let's say they are they are already 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.959
 they happen to be there but they are more likely 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.090
 a bit important the k10 is always important 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.500
 still very strong on short distance and 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.760
 that's why people are now 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.140
 probably not between only because 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.970
 the cats then the little one 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.430
 she has been getting very much 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.840
 strong the bakery stuck 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.400
 were adapted to each other 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.470
 I did not think so 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.299
 get more encouragement what the others 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.760
 So the ihk is mature 50 or the 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.200
 hcr then I'll think if 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.880
 Not if you have a bit of something 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.560
 the game continues to understand the 58th 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.030
 or take the sketch 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.130
 In my opinion, that will not work 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.570
 Do a lot and now your team's deathmatch 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.220
 it's a bit harder too 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.480
 analyze what is going on with the spots off 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.700
 So I would be honest now 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.040
 so far not shot from behind because 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.750
 one is curious behind me and 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.220
 Of course, the block is not exactly that 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.770
 best map for something like that 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.110
 take apart and piece to far 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.140
 analyze but must have to say whether 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.540
 Ballack from behind you can do that 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.840
 here too the distance has changed 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.490
 always great that unfortunately problems 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.400
 you have the appropriate server 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.760
 find where you can play in the game because there is 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.190
 Although some servers have people on it 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.080
 but mostly if it's 64x then 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.520
 server where the meaningfulness also not 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.670
 there is more in the team deathmatch 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.900
 mode or is a server the only two 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.100
 have people on it and you can do that 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.450
 Of course not test by that 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.180
 I am here now unfortunately forced 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.820
 take up 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:51.930
 blogs server gone or had to leave 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.530
 a little bit of eyecatching 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.690
 to take 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.640
 but as I said so far I can 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.610
 nothing negative say it is his blog 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:02.340
 team deathmatch the people sport unit 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.110
 where spawnen and then entrenched itself 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.760
 Either where he can and looks he with it 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.380
 with the best position gets around the 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.330
 most people just have to get away 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.000
 because of course that his team 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.950
 Deathmatch kills people too 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.610
 rattle and of course the team for 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:19.200
 to lead victorious and that has not been 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.000
 negative aspect can recognize little 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.530
 Of course you have to say that honestly 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.600
 It may be that in the further course 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.910
 on other maps the clearer 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.520
 but maybe if we also from 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.350
 official side of dice or until 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.610
 for u 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.229
 perhaps never happened how 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.419
 now shape the sports and have from 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:38.960
 the graphic or other but around the 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:41.430
 complete whole again roundabout 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.600
 performance was the biggest for me 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:47.850
 decisive aspect 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.070
 As for this patch , this is for everyone 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.460
 improved case 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.800
 been 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.110
 I find the weapon adjustments more like that 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.750
 put a bit in the sand the 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.770
 I do not have big big ones 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.630
 I think I do not really believe in that 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:04.440
 great influence on the one on the other 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:06.870
 Game feeling for all people and the 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.370
 team deathmatch sports so what is 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.600
 also tremendously caught the game effect 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.710
 i 'm not going to congress stuff right now 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.330
 one that somehow more tickets 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.720
 could cease because it is marginal 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:17.190
 but team deathmatch gives me the first one 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.160
 view is not possible either 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.290
 negative aspect 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.600
 I feel a bit crazy here 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.250
 was of portal strange may 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.020
 it depends on the block maybe it depends 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.060
 The change can not be said exactly 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.960
 but also with the fact that 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.250
 of course the performance already 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.070
 it was necessary to adjust the people 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.720
 of course positive for each piece 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:39.320
 but it is still in any case 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.970
 potential and air up there as well 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.510
 of course, the upcoming patches what 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.680
 to do 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.270
 And now, of course, it's hers too 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.470
 opinion asked what you got from the patch 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:50.090
 crest if you borrow battlefield 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:52.400
 what does not necessarily have so sure 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.600
 as the name in the church is there 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.920
 really writes your opinion 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.450
 times below the comments purely what you 

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.770
 from the whole hold so far like that 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.090
 feeling for you is back 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.700
 a bit of impressions and information 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.500
 and then maybe we can collect 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.030
 sometimes a small result will get if 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.600
 the patch was really worth it and whether he 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.900
 what torn 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.830
 the sun at her goal in the eye and me 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.300
 Try a little bit more here 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.360
 survive that just does not work that way 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.360
 Well
