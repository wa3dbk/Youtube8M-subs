00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.139
 we are following the direction and the 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.630
 arrow that the ferrari cars follow 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.070
 when a kit arrives this is placed 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.849
 here where we are now so quiet 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.849
 I study the sea 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.960
 there has to be a lot in the mechanics and 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.560
 in the whole piston process 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.790
 faster computer 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.500
 adding up all that we expected 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.670
 if we are the fastest the most 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.800
 constant because we have not committed 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.260
 no mistake and this year the importance 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.240
 it's bigger because there's more seen now it 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.070
 they will be more happy and there are more races that 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.480
 they are still here only in the moments that 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.220
 the wheel changes without signs the 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.820
 knick-knacks that I use from rolling 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.820
 charmed 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.859
 good frame what draws the most attention 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.210
 although this is the fashion beyond the 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:58.469
 semaphores that have been imposed 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.839
 although there are still some lolly 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.420
 of you have this is the one that sends no 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:06.270
 issues Ferrari invented the system in 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.070
 the whole system that we teach today all 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.530
 minus the nut inserted in the rim 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.970
 the whole system was invented by Mercedes 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.920
 the only thing that we have copied that everything 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.630
 other elements closed and starting with 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.159
 the good traffic light this is the one that sends 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.780
 when the pilot arrives Architect 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.960
 semaphore is in red 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.000
 and no matter what happens 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.430
 the pilot does not move is something that 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.869
 turn on the light and turn green and 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.340
 the traffic light only tells the pilot 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.840
 when all the action has been completed 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.550
 that is , it is not that we use it as 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.770
 reference and where to stop 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.200
 however I have seen one of the 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.300
 ferrari mechanics in the pitstop that 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.840
 does not do anything is in the front 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.090
 of the car and who has a command 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.890
 and I do not know what he does with the command this is the 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.270
 command this is the joystick 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.270
 so this was born 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.070
 or changed the system here in singapore 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:59.100
 when the problem of felipe then the 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.319
 Mechanical service and mechanics are 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.270
 it would turn green when he pressed and 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.609
 now not now if he sees something that does not 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.799
 it works there is traffic he presses the button 

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:10.470
 and it's only going to go green when he 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.239
 leave the button and if there is a problem of 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.269
 electricity or whatever it has this 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.340
 system that is a little hunting type that the 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.110
 system does not work then yes squeeze 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.549
 this button he can put the traffic light on 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.160
 green but it really says a little 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.630
 overnight inning in English, not what it is 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.060
 there is some problem in the track the button 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.319
 and he has control of the one he has 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.610
 many sensors there is not only would be put 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.019
 in green when he leaves the button but in 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.010
 principle you do not have to touch anything this is 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.930
 this man does not have to do anything 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.430
 only when the expenses that are 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.290
 let's see now automatically 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.360
 traffic light turns green when it has 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.430
 released the car of all act this is 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.230
 just for if you see a problem so that the 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.299
 sensors do not work and then it would be him 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.430
 but if he sees that the floor is clean the 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.330
 be alone in case there is traffic or passes 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.510
 some 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:57.319
 this is amazing 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:59.090
 I shot if you give me the opportunity 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.530
 last since I would want is the 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.599
 name that holds the cat in front 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.700
 because even if you stop the car you 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.250
 points out the position those who are in the 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.450
 wheels this man is here in front 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.319
 with a car that comes 100 kilometers away 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.319
 per hour and that has to stop 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.659
 This is the cat that uses Ferrari 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.569
 It is also important that you touch 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:24.030
 do not fall short because if you 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.739
 you go long or you fall short the 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.230
 piston is delayed sure is very 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.780
 important precision and this cat the 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.940
 particularity that it has is that you lower it 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.489
 automatic or automatic, that is when 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.470
 they climb the car and when you squeeze 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.930
 of stem handlebar rings when not 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.349
 they think like this if carbon gets low 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.349
 automatically 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.470
 and you lower it when these two lights are 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.540
 some sensors that are connected 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.160
 with the guns when the wheels of the 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.140
 before they have finished the cross they have finished 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.630
 do the piston and the mechanic marks it to 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.680
 he appears two green lights and then 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.270
 the cat goes down 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.590
 The operation does not end when you see that 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.840
 wheels have changed and not only are fixed 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.480
 the light we go to the butt and the butt 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.670
 so far this I think good 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.840
 you also have to act fast but not 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.700
 has as much responsibility as the 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.920
 front right the system is of 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.880
 same two lights that indicate to each 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.000
 one of the wheels when it has 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.799
 completed the operation 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.970
 this I think it has to make stronger 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.260
 the two have to do force in the 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.420
 that raise the front front jack 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.060
 they have strength here the only thing is that 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:29.370
 when the operation ends 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:32.639
 Release correct if released and other 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:36.330
 way is blocked to lift it is 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:39.259
 very basic is directly you push towards 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.259
 up and send her to the car 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.620
 sometimes even in those two seconds it 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.160
 You can also change the angle of the 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:50.190
 front spoiler and for that is used 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.530
 that little pistol that is a normal stick and 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.910
 current is a drill and here too and 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.800
 I believe that this is where the 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.020
 Italian philosophy that they invent them 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.250
 we invented them all and so yes 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.570
 I consider Italian medium with those of 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.700
 Ferrari does not look like the steering wheel of 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.130
 fernando 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.050
 that is, here is to increase or decrease 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.660
 the incidence of the nasa of more or less 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.820
 here you can tell what changes he 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.730
 is going to do in the to pre pre- figurine 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.670
 programs imagine that you want to increase 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:18.500
 1.5 degrees the wing you put it directly 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.910
 there and when you go clients that you have 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.500
 stopped you have changed a story of 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.240
 like hundred degrees otherwise you had 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:27.820
 that you count how many rounds of dabs 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.820
 do not go piece of gun 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.169
 and think about yourself, and here you are 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:36.169
 pistols and I believe that the evolution ado 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:37.310
 in two subjects the first one is that good that 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.810
 now the nut before being with the 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.229
 gun and now it's always in 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:44.360
 Atlanta and the second is that when it ends 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:46.219
 the operation sometimes the pilot the 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.560
 mechanic could hesitate about lifting 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:50.300
 or not the hand and now not now when you 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.490
 you make this movement when they 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.870
 they finish pisto pisto and go back what 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.419
 indicate in this way and this conveys 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.159
 automatically the cat in front of a 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:59.569
 wheel plus you dial there are two lights for 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:03.139
 look for each of the two wheels all 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:04.819
 this in 25 seconds and 2.5 seconds the 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:07.580
 guy that has the gun or like physics 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:10.129
 has to come the car got the 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.289
 gun loosens hits this 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:13.639
 for this to change it from 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:15.469
 address and press again to 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:18.530
 put it 

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:21.139
 remove it and squeeze this should be done 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.240
 like five or six movements in two 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:25.219
 seconds without committing a single error of 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.960
 done they ask the pilot to be very 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:27.770
 precise when braking face we'll see how 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.599
 make 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.819
 because they do not look at the older car 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:33.139
 They are only looking and focused 

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:35.449
 that the wheels are ahead 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:36.229
 they make this movement last march to 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:38.659
 I've always called my attention 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:41.150
 these numbers that are in the area of ​​the 

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:43.789
 stop that I do not know what it means because of 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.199
 0 to 5 to one side and another and then here 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:47.599
 there is also a brand with a zero in the 

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:50.509
 medium to see here you try the ideal 

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:52.400
 would be that the wheel is exactly the 

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:54.830
 center of the wheel is in the area of 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.629
 zero and in the christ also to the area 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.250
 from zero here you see for example where 

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:59.780
 we have practiced the pits top is a 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.150
 little more on the right about 510 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:05.569
 centimeters the accuracy of the position 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.009
 it is very important for mechanics and 

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:08.419
 here in the rubber we have already put for 

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:11.599
 the day of the race on the day of 

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:12.979
 race we're going to have many steps 

00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:15.610
 for the pit lane because we are talking 

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:18.650
 that there will be at least six 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:20.750
 six stops three for each pilot as 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:22.610
 minimum last year three and four 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:24.650
 I do not think that is also not much better 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:27.110
 I think there will be less 

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:29.509
 is the big prize I think of the most watched 

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:31.160
 whereupon the importance in the 

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:33.229
 final result of the mechanics here is 

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.759
 the highest in the championship I'm going to tension 

00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:35.210
 for these guys they do not have a lot 

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:37.220
 tension 

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:42.009
 I could not really do it let's go 

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:42.009
 this to us we do not ours
