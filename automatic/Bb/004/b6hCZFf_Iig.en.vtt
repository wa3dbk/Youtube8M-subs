00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:02.370
 the device 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.500
 Hello Pedro 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.270
 he thinks it's happened to me there 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.190
 do not be better or tell me 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.469
 I almost got hit by a car 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:10.979
 will have invented 

00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:11.789
 Well, you'll see 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:14.259
 yes duck but I want invention 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:16.219
 I'll tell you how little I know 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.580
 the history of the automobile begins with the self-propelled vehicles formed 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.630
 by 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.140
 being in 1985 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.029
 when it is created 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.390
 the first internal combustion engine with gasoline 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.200
 yes duck but I want to invented 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.030
 Carl Benz built his first model in 1885 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.470
 he patented it in 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.470
 on January 29, 1886 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.270
 and started 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.270
 to produce it in 1888 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.999
 It is commonly accepted that 

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:53.730
 first cars with gasoline 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.390
 they were almost simultaneously developed by German engineers 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.310
 working independently 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.840
 then that one 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.520
 alves is responsible 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.240
 in 1900 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.000
 mass production of automobiles 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.840
 a viella started in france 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.690
 and united states 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.580
 in 1910 carrefour 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.580
 started producing cars on an assembly line 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.750
 totally innovative system that allowed him to reach figures 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.860
 d up until then unthinkable ericka interesting 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.340
 from the end of the first world war to the great 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.310
 depression of 1929 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.330
 cars were manufactured in series 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.780
 seriously 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.250
 serially 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.260
 and from 1929 to a thousand 948 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.160
 the development of the cars was completely closed 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.680
 more rounded shape 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.210
 like those of now 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.590
 so is 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.450
 since the beginning of the closure 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.340
 recovery of the Second World War 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.440
 in 1948 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.279
 until the modern stage 

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:15.129
 stage characterized by the development of faster cars 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.520
 like the one that almost overwhelmed me by modern stage characterized by the development 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.709
 of safer engines 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.249
 and efficient 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:25.579
 It has less pollutants 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:26.819
 safe 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.610
 for humans because a people and innocent but as I do not have any 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.409
 safety with speed 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.339
 that develop support day cars 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:38.909
 do not do the suffering 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.999
 do not walk across the downtown street on both sides 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.879
 in the street you take care 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.459
 go friend and thanks for the day 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.069
 take care of yourself and only accepted 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.849
