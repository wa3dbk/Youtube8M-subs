00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.080
 in all the university of some 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.180
 stickers stuck 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.010
 well you guys if you saw it and it 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.840
 they ask what is an abduction here 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:20.540
 among you will have the answer 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:22.220
 go ahead thank you sissy truthfully I 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.020
 I do not know what the ombudsman is like 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.840
 that we are going to look for it and asia to see if the 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:30.199
 rest of the people know what a 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.650
 man of sources and by chance you 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:36.780
 you know what the ombudsman is not and who 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.260
 you imagine that it can be the ombudsman 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.219
 putting value 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.219
 last conduit 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.760
 very good thing 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:02.350
 down the street that can be an ombudsman 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.590
 something in your name 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.590
 what we do with it 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.820
 the actual 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.170
 let's go with someone who 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.940
 can really have the answer to a 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.570
 academic who knows what is the 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.570
 ombudsman 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.660
 the ombudsman's translation into Spanish is 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.150
 ombudsman for different things 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.770
 who have passed in college 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.470
 academic students and the rector 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.050
 think about installing the ombudsman or 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.370
 defender of university rights 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.190
 for a construction of a community 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:57.880
 more open and convener where prime 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:02.430
 respect and good treatment for your 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.900
 independence, autonomy and neutrality 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.780
 was to operate in cases of sexual harassment 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.140
 labor abuse arbitrary discrimination 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.900
 is among others to make this possible 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.060
 the community of trusting in electric 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.070
 then we could say that the very most 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.989
 it's a mix between the choir doctor and 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.580
 gandhi because I recommend doing these 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:27.030
 action changes but it's also a 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.030
 moral authority but I ignored 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.310
 plus 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.870
 good hoping that they have been a 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.920
 little clear the concept of the many 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.870
 we leave you all cordially 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.940
