00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.620
 lesson component reversing assignment by 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.620
 by means of a half turn 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.330
 a half turn is a common one 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.530
 special maneuver but at the car 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.000
 a smooth movement 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.710
 within the available space 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.140
 turned 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.480
 the examiner of the cbr will be the total 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.060
 implement this in combination with you 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.990
 assess viewing behavior in this 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.700
 lesson item 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.619
 I indicate how you make this special 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.840
 perform maneuvers step by step 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.079
 to achieve the best possible result 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.079
 come 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.920
 during the exam the examiner will 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:45.160
 give a reverse order in time you are allowed 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.629
 the me choose how you are going to turn 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.930
 but it must happen in the street 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.370
 but the examiner gives you the assignment 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.329
 so you cannot go around the block 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.829
 to drive 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.229
 as soon as you receive a reversal assignment 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.839
 you have to look for enough space 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:01.579
 to reverse at once 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.890
 if you have enough space me now 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.269
 enough room to be sure that you are 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.860
 it's going to save 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.009
 so do n't make it for yourself 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.009
 difficult 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.130
 choose a place that you know for sure 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.530
 you will save it in one go 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.880
 so drive through a bit before if necessary 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.740
 you start to turn 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.100
 make it that simple for yourself 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.100
 possible 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.710
 first name while approaching 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.229
 in front of 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.909
 the inner mirror then in you 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.380
 left exterior mirror 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.380
 and last over your left shoulder 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.640
 if it is safe give direction to 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.960
 turn left and calm him off 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.789
 if you were in too high a gear 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.130
 drive for the half turn 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.450
 then switch back to the second one in time 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.100
 or first gear 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.540
 if you have to stand still to get priority 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.310
 grant 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.780
 look again just before you send 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.400
 forward interior mirror 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.739
 left exterior mirror 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.900
 and if you left to be sure 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.810
 that you will not be overtaken and safe 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.300
 can send if it is safe 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.810
 Then continue calmly and send quickly 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.810
 to the left 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.050
 if you are bothered you look over you 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.500
 shoulders to either side or it 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.880
 is still safe 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.690
 like the car across the road 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.100
 state 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.890
 just to be sure, look again 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.690
 before the road goes on stairs 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.920
 you look that we forward in you 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.660
 interior mirror 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.980
 left exterior mirror and whether you 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.570
 left shoulder 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.700
 is it still safe and he then 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.270
 drive up the lane and continue to the 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.270
 maximum speed 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:11.819
 important tips 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.620
 one was in too high a gear 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.959
 drive for the half turn 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.310
 then switch back to the second one in time 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.930
 or first gear 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.049
 if you have to stand still to get priority 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.049
 grant 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.260
 two were you for 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.840
 must grant then stop on time and move 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.819
 look out your direction indicator then 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.590
 again and when it's free 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.319
 indicate your direction to the left and he 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.099
 smoothly with the traffic during it 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.230
 speed up 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.670
 look again in your interior mirror 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.739
 and left exterior mirror 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.040
 to determine if someone is arriving and if 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.510
 that you will be overtaken 3 look flat 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.420
 before you send again to 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.609
 front interior mirror, left exterior mirror 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.620
 and over your left shoulder to make sure 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:58.310
 that you will not be caught and 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.310
 send safely 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.439
 4 if you have enough space 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.510
 do n't make it too difficult for yourself 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:11.430
 by sending in too early so that you 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.469
 three times but stitches 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.980
 rather drive a bit through for half 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:15.980
 turn 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.020
 most driving instructors have their 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.520
 own way of teaching 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.470
 viewing behavior can be done per situation 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.360
 differences but the most important 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.800
 have my guidelines in the 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.540
 instruction film tells 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.940
 rail is help point nl is also possible 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.690
 made by driving school 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.690
 safety drivers
