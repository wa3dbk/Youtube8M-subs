00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:07.919
 hello, I 'm the man like I 'm on top 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.230
 thick tower in Sendim to what is a 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.019
 town well directs almost a village 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.020
 close to florence to show 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:20.160
 you a little of the cultivation here in the region 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.289
 What do you guys come from is olive 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.949
 in that the olives and what you sell 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:31.859
 the vineyards are the reasons for 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:34.140
 the vasco to have hospital what is a thing 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.290
 It's nice to note that it's you to see how 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.540
 are small areas of cultivation is everything 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.809
 a quilt even you do not have 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.600
 large areas with only one culture 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.320
 really well cut dinho and this is a 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:55.020
 cultivation that has been increasingly 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:57.750
 used is the day I see you have love 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.820
 out in large areas you have 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.940
 cultures, sometimes even mixing 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.939
 with the type for plants in it 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.369
 sometimes in alternate columns in 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.650
 alternating rows so they do not 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.130
 exhausted all soil nutrients is 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.610
 considered as a more organic continuum of 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.979
 kind think the exploration of the sun of a 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.080
 smarter and less harmful way 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.040
 for the environment is I learned 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.780
 some things that dynamics have videos 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.420
 on youtube if you want to take a look 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.820
 just take a look at the playlist of 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.729
 agriculture that has a portion of 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.000
 video about fear is these concepts 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.680
 more extensive agricultural crops than 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.170
 also for us to adapt our 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.840
 Even a small vegetable garden 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.670
 lose what you use a plant that 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.619
 was determined the type of nutrient 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.860
 sun and then can switch her type 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.530
 with another one that restores 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.870
 The training just looks nice 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.340
 in the coming days I will make the 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.340
 area is the kiss even more
