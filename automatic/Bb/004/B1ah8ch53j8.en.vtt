00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:06.170

video<00:00:06.590> of<00:00:07.010> injustice<00:00:07.670> gods<00:00:08.120> among<00:00:08.330> us<00:00:08.630> today

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:08.870 
video of injustice gods among us today

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.860 
video of injustice gods among us today
we<00:00:09.200> are<00:00:09.440> going<00:00:09.920> to<00:00:10.040> be<00:00:10.240> looking<00:00:11.240> at<00:00:11.390> the

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
we are going to be looking at the

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.670 
we are going to be looking at the
attacks<00:00:12.320> and<00:00:12.650> fighting<00:00:13.280> skills<00:00:13.640> of<00:00:14.680> Sinestro

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
attacks and fighting skills of Sinestro

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.690 
attacks and fighting skills of Sinestro
so<00:00:16.100> this<00:00:16.640> is<00:00:16.910> a<00:00:16.970> relatively<00:00:18.369> evil<00:00:19.369> looking

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:19.700 
so this is a relatively evil looking

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.120 
so this is a relatively evil looking
character<00:00:20.270> so<00:00:20.570> I<00:00:20.840> think<00:00:21.170> it's<00:00:21.470> part<00:00:21.740> of<00:00:21.890> the

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
character so I think it's part of the

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.490 
character so I think it's part of the
Green<00:00:22.400> Lantern<00:00:22.580> series<00:00:23.330> and<00:00:23.600> he's<00:00:24.140> the<00:00:24.350> boss

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
Green Lantern series and he's the boss

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.460 
Green Lantern series and he's the boss
or<00:00:24.890> maybe<00:00:25.280> not<00:00:25.670> I'm<00:00:26.270> not<00:00:26.330> really<00:00:26.630> sure<00:00:26.900> let<00:00:27.440> me

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
or maybe not I'm not really sure let me

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.610 
or maybe not I'm not really sure let me
know<00:00:27.740> if<00:00:27.980> you<00:00:28.220> do<00:00:28.460> know<00:00:32.320> anyways<00:00:33.320> we're<00:00:33.500> gonna

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
know if you do know anyways we're gonna

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.189 
know if you do know anyways we're gonna
be<00:00:33.770> looking<00:00:33.920> at<00:00:34.280> how<00:00:35.210> he<00:00:35.269> plugs<00:00:35.749> in<00:00:35.899> the<00:00:36.019> game

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:36.199 
be looking at how he plugs in the game

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:39.000 
be looking at how he plugs in the game
and<00:00:36.710> it<00:00:37.309> seems<00:00:37.519> good<00:00:37.789> or<00:00:37.969> not

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
and it seems good or not

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.290 
and it seems good or not
first<00:00:40.010> thing<00:00:40.190> I<00:00:40.280> think<00:00:40.339> Sinestro<00:00:41.149> is<00:00:41.179> a

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
first thing I think Sinestro is a

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.160 
first thing I think Sinestro is a
terrible<00:00:42.050> character<00:00:42.289> in<00:00:42.710> my<00:00:42.829> opinion<00:00:44.170> okay

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
terrible character in my opinion okay

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.899 
terrible character in my opinion okay
we're<00:00:45.440> gonna<00:00:45.530> use<00:00:45.769> the<00:00:45.889> first<00:00:45.920> move<00:00:46.370> and<00:00:46.609> it's

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:46.909 
we're gonna use the first move and it's

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:50.259 
we're gonna use the first move and it's
called<00:00:47.210> death<00:00:47.629> from<00:00:47.960> above<00:00:48.819> I'm<00:00:49.819> not<00:00:50.089> gonna

to<00:01:05.360> if<00:01:06.229> you<00:01:06.440> missed<00:01:06.740> the<00:01:06.950> first<00:01:07.780> connection<00:01:08.780> I

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
to if you missed the first connection I

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.960 
to if you missed the first connection I
guess<00:01:09.350> like<00:01:09.590> the<00:01:09.950> buttons<00:01:10.340> you<00:01:10.400> were<00:01:10.580> supposed

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
guess like the buttons you were supposed

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.470 
guess like the buttons you were supposed
to<00:01:11.060> swipe<00:01:11.510> or<00:01:11.780> tap<00:01:11.860> you<00:01:12.860> woulda<00:01:13.130> did<00:01:14.000> only<00:01:14.270> one

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
to swipe or tap you woulda did only one

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.710 
to swipe or tap you woulda did only one
kick<00:01:15.610> we're<00:01:16.610> gonna<00:01:16.730> have<00:01:16.940> wait<00:01:17.180> until<00:01:17.510> Green

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
kick we're gonna have wait until Green

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.800 
kick we're gonna have wait until Green
Lantern<00:01:18.200> attacks<00:01:18.980> us<00:01:19.310> and<00:01:19.610> gets<00:01:19.970> our<00:01:20.360> bar<00:01:20.630> up

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
Lantern attacks us and gets our bar up

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.350 
Lantern attacks us and gets our bar up
but<00:01:21.530> I<00:01:21.800> think<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.790> next<00:01:23.120> row<00:01:23.240> is<00:01:23.270> pretty<00:01:23.660> weak

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
but I think the next row is pretty weak

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.910 
but I think the next row is pretty weak
both<00:01:26.360> cards<00:01:26.810> are<00:01:26.930> weak<00:01:27.110> actually<00:01:27.680> in<00:01:27.800> my

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
both cards are weak actually in my

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:43.960 
both cards are weak actually in my
opinion<00:01:41.080> okay<00:01:42.080> we<00:01:42.230> need<00:01:42.440> one<00:01:42.470> more<00:01:42.980> hit<00:01:43.340> from

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
opinion okay we need one more hit from

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.050 
opinion okay we need one more hit from
Green<00:01:44.270> Lantern<00:01:44.840> and<00:01:45.440> we're<00:01:45.860> gonna<00:01:46.010> launch<00:01:46.340> his
