00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.319 
December they tried to sell them another
throttle<00:00:35.370> body<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:35.850> was<00:00:35.969> just<00:00:36.180> out<00:00:36.300> of

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
throttle body so it was just out of

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.780 
throttle body so it was just out of
specifications<00:00:37.170> but<00:00:38.010> when<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.190> got<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.520> truck

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
specifications but when I got the truck

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.209 
specifications but when I got the truck
I<00:00:39.059> looked<00:00:39.600> at<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.649> found<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.070> the

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
I looked at it and I found that the

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.520 
I looked at it and I found that the
idler<00:00:41.579> control<00:00:42.000> was<00:00:42.390> doing<00:00:42.660> his<00:00:42.809> job<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:43.410> was

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
idler control was doing his job it was

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.630 
idler control was doing his job it was
all<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.800> they<00:00:43.890> closed<00:00:44.190> trying<00:00:44.579> to

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
all that they closed trying to

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.819 
all that they closed trying to
compensate<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.239> idle<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:46.410> reason<00:00:46.739> that

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
compensate the idle and the reason that

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.920 
compensate the idle and the reason that
this<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.039> sticking<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.820> because<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.629> plate

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
this is sticking is because this plate

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.240 
this is sticking is because this plate
is<00:00:49.170> worn<00:00:49.469> out<00:00:49.620> inside<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.219> here<00:00:51.829> this<00:00:52.829> throttle

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
is worn out inside of here this throttle

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.459 
is worn out inside of here this throttle
plate<00:00:54.059> inside<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.570> here<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.780> perfectly<00:00:55.199> round

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
plate inside of here is perfectly round

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.900 
plate inside of here is perfectly round
so<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.860> supposed<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.219> fit<00:00:56.579> this<00:00:56.699> perfectly

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
so it supposed to fit this perfectly

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.799 
so it supposed to fit this perfectly
round<00:00:57.300> housing<00:00:57.750> there<00:00:58.320> should<00:00:58.469> be<00:00:58.620> no<00:00:58.800> air<00:00:59.100> gap

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
round housing there should be no air gap

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.260 
round housing there should be no air gap
so<00:01:00.809> when<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.109> look<00:01:01.289> through<00:01:01.500> there<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.010> you

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
so when you look through there and you

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.579 
so when you look through there and you
see<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.449> big<00:01:03.660> gap<00:01:03.899> right<00:01:04.170> through<00:01:04.379> there

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
see that big gap right through there

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.770 
see that big gap right through there
that<00:01:05.580> gaps<00:01:05.880> not<00:01:06.090> supposed<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.479> be<00:01:06.630> there

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
that gaps not supposed to be there

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.109 
that gaps not supposed to be there
that's<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.990> huge<00:01:07.439> gap<00:01:07.830> if<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.700> look<00:01:08.880> on<00:01:09.000> the

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
that's a huge gap if you look on the

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.080 
that's a huge gap if you look on the
other<00:01:09.150> side<00:01:09.330> there's<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.020> small<00:01:10.350> gap<00:01:10.880> but<00:01:11.880> over

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
other side there's a small gap but over

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.539 
other side there's a small gap but over
there<00:01:12.330> that's<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.200> big<00:01:13.530> gap<00:01:13.890> that's<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.340> lot<00:01:14.520> of

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
there that's a big gap that's a lot of

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.609 
there that's a big gap that's a lot of
air<00:01:14.880> getting<00:01:15.150> through<00:01:15.450> there<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:16.259> doesn't

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
air getting through there that doesn't

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.170 
air getting through there that doesn't
that<00:01:16.740> place<00:01:16.979> should<00:01:17.189> be<00:01:17.280> sealed<00:01:17.580> perfectly

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
that place should be sealed perfectly

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.450 
that place should be sealed perfectly
flush<00:01:18.420> with<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.650> reason<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:19.979> problems

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
flush with that the reason that problems

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.490 
flush with that the reason that problems
happen<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:20.939> this<00:01:21.030> vehicle<00:01:21.420> has<00:01:21.540> 220<00:01:22.170> thousand

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
happen is this vehicle has 220 thousand

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.080 
happen is this vehicle has 220 thousand
miles<00:01:22.680> on<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.520> where<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.850> gets<00:01:23.909> all

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
miles on it this is where it gets all

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.030 
miles on it this is where it gets all
the<00:01:24.210> load<00:01:24.450> all<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.869> tension<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.890> where

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
the load all the tension this is where

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.950 
the load all the tension this is where
the<00:01:26.159> spring<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.520> when<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.420> press<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.780> gas

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
the spring is when you press the gas

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.719 
the spring is when you press the gas
pedal<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.040> where<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.220> accelerator

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
pedal this is where the accelerator

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.640 
pedal this is where the accelerator
cable<00:01:29.880> hooks<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.329> when<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.600> moves<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.530> this

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
cable hooks in when this moves so this

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.440 
cable hooks in when this moves so this
is<00:01:31.770> taking<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.070> lot<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.250> load<00:01:32.549> on<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:33.030> side<00:01:33.299> of

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
is taking a lot of load on this side of

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.410 
is taking a lot of load on this side of
it<00:01:34.369> then<00:01:35.369> if<00:01:35.490> we<00:01:35.579> look<00:01:35.610> at<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.970> new<00:01:36.119> one<00:01:36.270> we

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
it then if we look at the new one we

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.609

that at all we turned around the other

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.560 
that at all we turned around the other
way<00:02:02.579> look<00:02:02.850> at<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.090> side<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:05.180> see<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.360> big

in this industry this can wear out 2,000
miles<00:02:45.300> ago<00:02:45.570> but<00:02:46.140> you<00:02:46.260> know<00:02:46.350> like<00:02:46.470> they're

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
miles ago but you know like they're

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.020 
miles ago but you know like they're
saying<00:02:46.800> they<00:02:46.980> want<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.220> change<00:02:47.459> that<00:02:47.640> that<00:02:47.910> is

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
saying they want to change that that is

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.330 
saying they want to change that that is
past<00:02:48.300> its<00:02:48.510> limit<00:02:48.840> there<00:02:49.020> it's<00:02:49.800> just<00:02:50.130> out<00:02:50.310> of

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
past its limit there it's just out of

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.820 
past its limit there it's just out of
spec<00:02:50.730> which<00:02:50.910> there's<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.300> terminology<00:02:51.800> so<00:02:52.800> I

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
spec which there's that terminology so I

a huge gap that's in there this was the
problem<00:02:57.180> that<00:02:57.420> he<00:02:57.510> had<00:02:57.720> all<00:02:57.959> along<00:02:58.140> is<00:02:58.650> this

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
problem that he had all along is this
