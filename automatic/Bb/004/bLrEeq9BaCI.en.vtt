00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.269
 tell me 

00:00:01.269 --> 00:00:03.360
 as we had never done 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.940
 He made it clear that the points were very good memorizing circuits and almost 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.269
 I could close 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.269
 karlovic live it as one of the states that have most 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.709
 and I said we have another one for that reason the drug months ago 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:17.960
 hurry is capable 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.240
 imagine a return integrates the circuit of cataluÃ±a 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.909
 we are doing exactly the same thing that they do 

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:24.970
 by the steering wheel 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.089
 and guess more or less the time they think it's possible 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.089
 they think he will be able to side 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.760
 that is, you are not capable 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.760
 the second round 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.290
 2-3 m 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.730
 Marrero explained at least 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.010
 when I do not know what the three of them appear to me it really seemed to me 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.689
 incredible what has been able to people hands or simulating this turn 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:49.750
 Closing the eyes 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.519
 maximum concentration 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.319
 and catching practically time is going to fail by or for a second its 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.109
 future been a tenth above tenth down so basic was so good 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.259
 we have said come because we are not going one step further 

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:04.009
 let's take the 

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:05.849
 I do not think at all about the simulation 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.239
 and we are going to mix it 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.789
 with the real image with the return they wanted classifications
