should

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.410 
should
firstly<00:01:23.520> like<00:01:24.520> to<00:01:24.670> use<00:01:24.820> parsley<00:01:25.119> for<00:01:25.630> color

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
firstly like to use parsley for color

don't<00:01:33.009> use<00:01:33.250> parsley<00:01:33.579> they<00:01:34.539> keep<00:01:34.719> it<00:01:34.869> very

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020

green<00:01:40.689> for<00:01:41.110> color<00:01:41.380> I<00:01:41.819> find<00:01:42.819> it<00:01:43.030> makes<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.479> dish

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 
green for color I find it makes the dish

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.889 
green for color I find it makes the dish
you<00:01:43.840> much<00:01:43.990> more<00:01:44.259> appetizing<00:01:45.600> when<00:01:46.600> you<00:01:46.689> have<00:01:46.869> a

and we use half a cup of finely ground
pecorino<00:02:20.680> cheese<00:02:20.770> now<00:02:21.640> this<00:02:21.820> cheese<00:02:22.330> is<00:02:22.600> a

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
pecorino cheese now this cheese is a

sheep's cheese and it's from Italy it's
a<00:02:26.770> little<00:02:26.980> bit<00:02:27.100> stronger<00:02:27.370> than<00:02:27.640> parmesan<00:02:28.240> now

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
a little bit stronger than parmesan now

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.990 
a little bit stronger than parmesan now
I<00:02:28.480> did<00:02:28.810> make<00:02:29.140> this<00:02:29.350> recipe<00:02:29.830> for<00:02:30.430> my<00:02:30.580> husband

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
I did make this recipe for my husband

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.200 
I did make this recipe for my husband
and<00:02:31.260> he<00:02:32.260> doesn't<00:02:32.620> like<00:02:32.740> a<00:02:33.010> very<00:02:33.490> strong<00:02:33.820> cheese

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
and he doesn't like a very strong cheese

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.790 
and he doesn't like a very strong cheese
so<00:02:34.930> I<00:02:35.370> really<00:02:36.370> enjoyed<00:02:36.730> it<00:02:36.760> but<00:02:37.590> with<00:02:38.590> his

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
so I really enjoyed it but with his

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.950 
so I really enjoyed it but with his
palate<00:02:39.280> he<00:02:39.490> would<00:02:39.880> have<00:02:39.970> preferred<00:02:40.360> probably

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
palate he would have preferred probably

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.350 
palate he would have preferred probably
like<00:02:41.350> a<00:02:41.380> parmesan<00:02:41.710> which<00:02:42.220> would<00:02:42.430> not<00:02:43.000> be<00:02:43.060> as

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
like a parmesan which would not be as

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.660 
like a parmesan which would not be as
