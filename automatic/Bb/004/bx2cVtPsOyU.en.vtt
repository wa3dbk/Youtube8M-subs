logo on it now one of the things I do to
prepare<00:00:15.750> for<00:00:15.990> this<00:00:16.320> is<00:00:16.529> I<00:00:17.100> take<00:00:17.340> an<00:00:17.550> exacto

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
mark here the reason I do that is

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.560 
mark here the reason I do that is
because<00:00:25.350> if<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.769> don't<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.699> shows<00:00:27.000> up<00:00:27.240> right

like to move this in here so I can get

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.700 
like to move this in here so I can get
some<00:01:32.610> idea<00:01:33.000> where<00:01:33.299> Center<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:34.049> going<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.350> be<00:01:34.470> on

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
some idea where Center is going to be on

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.940 
some idea where Center is going to be on
it<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:35.070> just<00:01:35.549> kind<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.790> eyeball<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.950> by

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
it I just kind of eyeball that by

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.429 
it I just kind of eyeball that by
looking<00:01:38.340> at<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.579> top<00:01:39.420> left<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.020> top<00:01:40.110> right

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
looking at the top left and top right

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.069 
looking at the top left and top right
corners<00:01:41.390> doesn't<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.570> be<00:01:42.659> exact<00:01:42.960> because

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
corners doesn't have to be exact because

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.090 
corners doesn't have to be exact because
you're<00:01:43.290> going<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.470> move<00:01:43.590> these<00:01:43.770> letters

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
you're going to move these letters

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.760 
you're going to move these letters
around<00:01:44.310> anyway<00:01:44.700> but<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.090> helps<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.840> get<00:01:45.990> an

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
around anyway but it helps to to get an

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.710 
around anyway but it helps to to get an
idea<00:01:47.130> where<00:01:47.369> Center<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:47.939> going<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.180> be<00:01:48.299> on<00:01:48.509> this

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
idea where Center is going to be on this

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.969 
idea where Center is going to be on this
so<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:50.310> way<00:01:50.430> we<00:01:50.579> have<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.970> arc<00:01:51.619> letters<00:01:52.619> around

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
so the way we have to arc letters around

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.950 
so the way we have to arc letters around
a<00:01:53.070> curve<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.579> design<00:01:53.850> space<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.210> we<00:01:54.600> have<00:01:54.810> to

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
a curve in design space is we have to

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.959 
a curve in design space is we have to
right-click<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.710> them<00:01:55.890> we<00:01:56.490> have<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.700> isolate

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
right-click on them we have to isolate

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.690 
right-click on them we have to isolate
two<00:01:57.600> letters<00:01:58.100> and<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.219> will<00:01:59.460> break<00:01:59.640> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
two letters and this will break the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.740 
two letters and this will break the
letters<00:02:00.360> apart<00:02:00.689> into<00:02:00.869> individual<00:02:01.740> letters

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
letters apart into individual letters

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.810 
letters apart into individual letters
now<00:02:03.750> with<00:02:04.320> design<00:02:04.649> space<00:02:04.920> 2.0<00:02:05.430> right<00:02:05.610> now

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
now with design space 2.0 right now

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.910 
now with design space 2.0 right now
there<00:02:06.210> is<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.750> little<00:02:07.350> bit<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.710> nuisance

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
there is a little bit of a nuisance

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.460 
there is a little bit of a nuisance
we're<00:02:08.509> working<00:02:09.509> with<00:02:09.629> objects<00:02:10.020> this<00:02:10.229> files

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
we're working with objects this files

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.979 
we're working with objects this files
can<00:02:10.890> be<00:02:10.920> difficult<00:02:11.489> because<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:12.300> click<00:02:12.660> on<00:02:12.840> it

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
can be difficult because you click on it

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.710 
can be difficult because you click on it
and<00:02:13.170> these

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
and these

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.840 
and these
little<00:02:13.990> corner<00:02:14.380> markers<00:02:14.890> cover<00:02:15.310> up<00:02:15.520> almost

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
little corner markers cover up almost

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.930 
little corner markers cover up almost
your<00:02:16.060> entire<00:02:17.400> object<00:02:18.400> you're<00:02:18.520> working<00:02:18.820> with

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
your entire object you're working with

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.720 
your entire object you're working with
now<00:02:19.390> you<00:02:19.450> can<00:02:19.810> zoom<00:02:20.080> in<00:02:20.290> on<00:02:20.410> it<00:02:20.590> but<00:02:21.220> it<00:02:21.550> only

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
now you can zoom in on it but it only

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.870 
now you can zoom in on it but it only
helps<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:22.510> a<00:02:22.540> certain<00:02:22.900> degree<00:02:23.050> so<00:02:23.820> really<00:02:24.820> just

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
helps to a certain degree so really just

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.640 
helps to a certain degree so really just
to<00:02:25.120> kind<00:02:25.150> of<00:02:25.360> have<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.660> move<00:02:25.840> this<00:02:25.990> around<00:02:26.170> and

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
to kind of have to move this around and

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.790 
to kind of have to move this around and
look<00:02:27.490> at<00:02:27.700> it<00:02:27.960> move<00:02:28.960> your<00:02:29.140> letters<00:02:29.410> around<00:02:29.620> and

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
look at it move your letters around and

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.830 
look at it move your letters around and
click<00:02:29.980> off<00:02:30.160> of<00:02:30.190> it<00:02:30.520> to<00:02:30.640> see<00:02:30.820> where<00:02:31.150> your

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
click off of it to see where your

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.620 
click off of it to see where your
placements<00:02:32.410> are<00:02:32.500> going<00:02:32.650> to<00:02:32.710> end<00:02:32.860> up<00:02:33.450> it's<00:02:34.450> not

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
placements are going to end up it's not

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.950 
placements are going to end up it's not
too<00:02:34.900> hard<00:02:35.230> just<00:02:35.560> kind<00:02:36.280> of<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.660> pain<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.690> have<00:02:37.840> to

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
too hard just kind of a pain to have to

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.570 
too hard just kind of a pain to have to
do<00:02:38.230> it<00:02:38.380> that<00:02:38.530> way<00:02:38.620> until<00:02:38.920> they<00:02:39.070> come<00:02:39.220> up<00:02:39.250> with<00:02:39.520> a

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
do it that way until they come up with a

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.920 
do it that way until they come up with a
fix<00:02:39.880> for<00:02:40.120> this<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:42.300> so<00:02:43.300> you<00:02:43.360> rotate<00:02:43.750> your

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
fix for this and so you rotate your

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.030 
fix for this and so you rotate your
letters<00:02:44.260> around<00:02:45.960> and<00:02:46.960> position<00:02:47.590> them<00:02:47.710> until

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
letters around and position them until

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.100 
letters around and position them until
you<00:02:48.250> have<00:02:48.610> what<00:02:49.090> you<00:02:49.270> think<00:02:49.570> is<00:02:49.750> a<00:02:49.870> good

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
you have what you think is a good

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.210 
you have what you think is a good
looking<00:02:50.700> centered<00:02:51.700> name<00:02:52.800> now<00:02:53.800> what's<00:02:53.980> nice

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
looking centered name now what's nice

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.260 
looking centered name now what's nice
too<00:02:54.700> is<00:02:54.970> that<00:02:55.000> you<00:02:55.540> can<00:02:57.000> move<00:02:58.000> these<00:02:58.210> around

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
too is that you can move these around

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.810 
too is that you can move these around
and<00:02:59.110> once<00:02:59.590> you<00:02:59.710> have<00:02:59.980> them<00:03:00.190> at<00:03:00.280> least<00:03:00.400> spaced

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
and once you have them at least spaced

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.240 
and once you have them at least spaced
and<00:03:01.180> art<00:03:01.420> properly<00:03:01.990> if<00:03:02.350> it's<00:03:02.590> not<00:03:02.830> centered

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
and art properly if it's not centered

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.090 
and art properly if it's not centered
I'll<00:03:03.700> show<00:03:03.940> you<00:03:04.000> a<00:03:04.090> trick<00:03:04.330> in<00:03:04.570> a<00:03:04.630> moment<00:03:05.100> that

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
I'll show you a trick in a moment that

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.120 
I'll show you a trick in a moment that
you<00:03:06.280> can<00:03:06.400> use<00:03:06.610> to<00:03:06.760> get<00:03:06.880> around<00:03:07.000> that<00:03:07.890> as<00:03:08.890> you

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
you can use to get around that as you

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.310 
you can use to get around that as you
can<00:03:09.250> see<00:03:09.310> it's<00:03:09.970> sometimes<00:03:10.510> difficult<00:03:10.750> to<00:03:11.170> get

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
can see it's sometimes difficult to get

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.230 
can see it's sometimes difficult to get
these<00:03:11.470> moved<00:03:11.680> around<00:03:12.070> with<00:03:12.790> these<00:03:13.000> little

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
these moved around with these little

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.950 
these moved around with these little
corner<00:03:13.720> pieces<00:03:14.640> will<00:03:15.640> rotate<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:16.240> apostrophe

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 
corner pieces will rotate the apostrophe

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:28.920 
corner pieces will rotate the apostrophe
a<00:03:16.990> little<00:03:17.290> bit<00:03:24.600> and<00:03:26.610> there's<00:03:27.610> a<00:03:27.930> fairly

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
a little bit and there's a fairly

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.620 
a little bit and there's a fairly
good-looking<00:03:29.140> centered<00:03:29.890> name<00:03:30.220> I<00:03:30.459> believe<00:03:30.630> now

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
good-looking centered name I believe now

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.800 
good-looking centered name I believe now
what<00:03:31.840> I<00:03:31.870> can<00:03:32.140> do<00:03:32.580> is<00:03:33.580> I<00:03:33.760> can<00:03:33.820> highlight<00:03:34.480> all<00:03:34.750> of

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
what I can do is I can highlight all of

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:42.300 
what I can do is I can highlight all of
these<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:36.959> well<00:03:37.959> with<00:03:38.170> them<00:03:38.290> and<00:03:41.040> then<00:03:42.040> when<00:03:42.280> I

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
these and well with them and then when I

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.370 
these and well with them and then when I
click<00:03:42.610> on<00:03:42.760> the<00:03:42.850> object<00:03:43.360> if<00:03:43.750> I<00:03:43.900> want<00:03:44.080> to<00:03:44.170> move

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
click on the object if I want to move

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.530 
click on the object if I want to move
this<00:03:44.709> to<00:03:44.950> the<00:03:44.980> right<00:03:45.100> or<00:03:45.459> I<00:03:45.730> can<00:03:45.910> move<00:03:46.150> it<00:03:46.360> and

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
this to the right or I can move it and

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.540 
this to the right or I can move it and
then<00:03:46.870> just<00:03:47.080> rotate<00:03:47.620> it<00:03:47.650> a<00:03:47.860> little<00:03:47.890> bit<00:03:48.250> to<00:03:48.400> make

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
then just rotate it a little bit to make

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.570 
then just rotate it a little bit to make
it<00:03:48.580> a<00:03:48.700> little<00:03:48.940> more<00:03:49.060> centered<00:03:49.860> so<00:03:50.860> like<00:03:51.280> again

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
it a little more centered so like again

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.670 
it a little more centered so like again
once<00:03:51.820> you<00:03:51.910> have<00:03:52.180> your<00:03:52.360> art<00:03:52.630> form<00:03:53.170> properly

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
once you have your art form properly

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.100 
once you have your art form properly
once<00:03:54.610> you<00:03:54.790> weld<00:03:55.060> them<00:03:55.270> together<00:03:55.420> you<00:03:55.840> can<00:03:55.989> do

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
once you weld them together you can do

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.260 
once you weld them together you can do
that<00:03:56.290> now<00:03:56.890> I'm<00:03:57.040> going<00:03:57.280> to<00:03:57.340> click<00:03:57.790> on<00:03:57.910> the<00:03:58.060> name

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
that now I'm going to click on the name
