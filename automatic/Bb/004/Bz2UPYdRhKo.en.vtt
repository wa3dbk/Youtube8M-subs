this<00:00:12.809> is<00:00:12.960> probably<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.639> worst<00:00:14.639> one<00:00:16.039> this<00:00:17.039> is<00:00:17.310> a

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170 
this is probably the worst one this is a

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.759 
this is probably the worst one this is a
see<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.230> on<00:00:19.350> both<00:00:19.560> sides<00:00:21.260> normally<00:00:22.260> we

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
see it on both sides normally we

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.429 
see it on both sides normally we
wouldn't<00:00:22.980> doctor<00:00:23.430> this<00:00:23.609> right<00:00:23.880> here<00:00:24.439> what

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
wouldn't doctor this right here what

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.710 
wouldn't doctor this right here what
would<00:00:25.590> wait<00:00:25.890> for<00:00:26.750> if<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:28.109> gets<00:00:28.349> bad<00:00:28.949> enough

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
would wait for if it gets bad enough

would wait for if it gets bad enough
that<00:00:31.040> the<00:00:32.040> gun<00:00:32.250> starts<00:00:32.700> swelling<00:00:32.940> up<00:00:34.340> you<00:00:35.340> can

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
that the gun starts swelling up you can

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.880 
that the gun starts swelling up you can
have<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:37.219> vaccination<00:00:38.219> for<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.670> but<00:00:39.620> we<00:00:40.620> tried

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
have a vaccination for this but we tried

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.690 
have a vaccination for this but we tried
and<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.309> not<00:00:42.050> very<00:00:43.050> good<00:00:43.430> within<00:00:44.430> three

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
and it is not very good within three

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.900 
and it is not very good within three
weeks<00:00:44.910> after<00:00:45.809> getting<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.610> it'll<00:00:47.610> numb<00:00:47.850> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
weeks after getting this it'll numb the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.260 
weeks after getting this it'll numb the
hallway<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.710> dole<00:00:49.920> or<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.610> kid<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:51.059> going

place<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:57.750> have<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.079> do<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.320> every<00:00:58.590> year<00:00:58.620> and

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
place you have to do it every year and

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.689 
place you have to do it every year and
you've<00:00:59.039> brought<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.430> live<00:00:59.640> virus<00:01:00.030> on<00:01:01.020> that

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
you've brought the live virus on that

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:08.770 
you've brought the live virus on that
what<00:01:02.699> we<00:01:02.820> use<00:01:04.670> is<00:01:05.689> today<00:01:07.130> it's<00:01:08.130> an<00:01:08.430> antibiotic

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
what we use is today it's an antibiotic

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:17.030 
what we use is today it's an antibiotic
for<00:01:10.100> mastitis<00:01:11.150> but<00:01:12.150> what<00:01:12.960> we<00:01:13.080> will<00:01:13.260> do<00:01:15.860> it's<00:01:16.860> a

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
for mastitis but what we will do it's a

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.980 
for mastitis but what we will do it's a
jail<00:01:17.720> just<00:01:18.720> take<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.790> and<00:01:21.170> squeeze<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:23.990> little

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
jail just take this and squeeze a little

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.819 
jail just take this and squeeze a little
bit<00:01:25.140> on<00:01:25.439> here<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.960> doesn't<00:01:27.960> have<00:01:28.140> any<00:01:28.200> more<00:01:28.650> on

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
bit on here and doesn't have any more on

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.609 
bit on here and doesn't have any more on
it<00:01:29.009> but<00:01:29.220> that's<00:01:29.729> what<00:01:29.939> we<00:01:30.090> would<00:01:30.299> do<00:01:30.450> if<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
it but that's what we would do if the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.340 
it but that's what we would do if the
gums<00:01:32.060> start<00:01:33.060> swelling<00:01:33.390> up<00:01:33.720> then<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.140> gets

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
gums start swelling up then that gets

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.490 
gums start swelling up then that gets
raw<00:01:34.650> looking<00:01:35.659> besides<00:01:36.659> doing<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:37.110> we<00:01:37.350> would

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
raw looking besides doing this we would

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.380 
raw looking besides doing this we would
use<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.799> antibiotics<00:01:38.549> for<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.820> couple<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.210> days

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
use the antibiotics for a couple of days

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.410 
use the antibiotics for a couple of days
and<00:01:39.930> within<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.799> few<00:01:40.890> days<00:01:41.220> this<00:01:41.909> will<00:01:42.090> go<00:01:42.210> away

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
and within a few days this will go away

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.030 
and within a few days this will go away
you<00:01:43.079> want<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.290> make<00:01:43.409> sure<00:01:43.439> you're<00:01:43.829> using

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
you want to make sure you're using

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.850 
you want to make sure you're using
gloves<00:01:44.909> when<00:01:45.240> you're<00:01:45.390> handling<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:45.990> you

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
it doesn't look very good but within

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.810 
it doesn't look very good but within
three<00:01:56.790> weeks<00:01:57.320> you're<00:01:58.320> immune<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.829> it's<00:01:59.009> gone

this is the dough that has just a little
bit<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.580> soil<00:02:02.790> mouth<00:02:03.030> in<00:02:03.300> the<00:02:03.390> very<00:02:03.600> corner<00:02:03.960> of
