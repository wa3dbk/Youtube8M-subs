I<00:03:11.599> just<00:03:12.470> you<00:03:12.620> know<00:03:12.650> Dallas<00:03:12.950> has<00:03:13.250> been<00:03:13.430> in<00:03:13.519> this

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
I just you know Dallas has been in this

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.670 
I just you know Dallas has been in this
game<00:03:13.730> so<00:03:14.239> many<00:03:14.510> times<00:03:14.989> you<00:03:15.379> know<00:03:15.500> they
