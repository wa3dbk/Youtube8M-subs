00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.930
 she is 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:15.849
 Well, the operation has long been like 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.830
 like a mechanism so a machine that even 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.960
 after 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.720
 probably if you even stop already 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.520
 engine it will still be by 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.619
 inertia move my engine is not yet 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.539
 stopped so now the movement 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:33.059
 happens not by inertia at full 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:37.330
 there is not enough money here I am not complaining 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:40.500
 brothers to dance i'm not going because 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.790
 that for my part it will be greed 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.710
 get so earn ok yet 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.869
 pupils take money well how would that be 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.890
 one fish so much dough 

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:53.290
 why for greed here is the first second 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:59.460
 have my own mission to bear the dance 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:01.930
 mass carry dance popularize it 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.689
 underground currents hip-hop house 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.610
 current all sorts of experimental 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:09.640
 movements carry to the masses this this such 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:13.030
 your mouth kinda my mission here 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.340
 teaching people teaching youth carry 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.049
 your philosophy carry your technique 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.460
 movement while I have strength 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:23.980
 while she wants to do this 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.710
 Well, something like this, how to do everything, even 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:30.850
 not in the end, it's one of the goals 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:33.220
 look even if out of 1000 people who 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.440
 passed me through there with me somehow 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.050
 trained were with me in the room in 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.590
 dance world even if 5 of them 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.990
 person 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.050
 bear the correct dance philosophy bear 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.190
 right movements and that is good 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:52.240
 good result of my deeds 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:55.330
 You know, a long time ago, we limited and led 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:59.260
 separate type about a separate house 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:02.830
 now I probably grew up and want more 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.130
 lead not hip-hop and house as separate 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:10.060
 style and I want people to dance 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:12.340
 base and such a thing is a game of character 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.220
 his game 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.099
 game ambitions no more battle it is not 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.489
 dance battles tabata watt watts battle 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:24.670
 today you won not always win you 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.170
 You showed a cool style and won a 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.739
 sometimes showed tatay become 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:33.400
 but you lost therefore the battle is 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:35.080
 cheer up your ego chop ponte when 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.239
 I was younger it was interesting to cut 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.560
 punks part crowd older to someone 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.629
 proving something to me is no longer interesting 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.400
 my students know what I am 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.349
 I represent my fleyva I know 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.150
 I represent people in France in America 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.940
 who know me they know what I am 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.829
 imagine there will be more tops ahead 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.510
 such as run away there and all sorts of yes 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:54.549
 of course involved so again sometimes 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.410
 to amuse your ego can be show 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.030
 someone your style just go 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.579
 connect in france why not always 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.920
 forever I do not mind it regards battle 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:06.040
 battle will I still participate 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.220
 the main thing that was not interesting will be 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.160
 everything is cool i hope i am me again 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:16.379
 I hope I hope to guess I can I 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.379
 I hope everything for this business
