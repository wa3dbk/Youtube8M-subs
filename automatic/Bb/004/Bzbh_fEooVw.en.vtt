00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
look very closely at the 18 to 135 when

look very closely at the 18 to 135 when
I<00:00:53.219> first<00:00:53.579> got<00:00:53.789> this<00:00:54.059> in<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.780> kit<00:00:55.110> with<00:00:55.410> my

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
I first got this in the kit with my

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.709 
I first got this in the kit with my
Canon<00:00:55.920> 7d<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:57.350> actually<00:00:58.350> thought<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.719> shortly

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
Canon 7d I actually thought that shortly

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.720 
Canon 7d I actually thought that shortly
after<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.199> ordered<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.340> may<00:01:02.520> be<00:01:02.579> a

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
after I ordered it that it may be a

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.710 
after I ordered it that it may be a
mistake<00:01:03.470> because<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:05.640> more<00:01:05.850> popular<00:01:06.390> kit

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
mistake because the more popular kit

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.289 
mistake because the more popular kit
came<00:01:07.500> with<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:08.060> 28<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.540> 135<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:11.430> had<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.610> USM

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
came with the 28 to 135 and it had a USM

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.440 
came with the 28 to 135 and it had a USM
focusing<00:01:12.930> motor<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:14.150> shortly<00:01:15.150> after

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
focusing motor and shortly after

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.749 
focusing motor and shortly after
ordering<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.930> thought<00:01:16.650> geez<00:01:16.920> me<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.369> almost

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
ordering I thought geez me I almost

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.899 
ordering I thought geez me I almost
canceled<00:01:18.659> my<00:01:18.810> order<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.610> ordered<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.759> other

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
canceled my order and ordered the other

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.929 
canceled my order and ordered the other
kit<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.750> could<00:01:21.960> get<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.320> slightly<00:01:22.979> nicer

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
kit so I could get the slightly nicer

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.819 
kit so I could get the slightly nicer
lit<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.930> lent<00:01:25.520> well<00:01:26.520> I'm<00:01:26.850> glad<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.270> didn't<00:01:27.829> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
lit and lent well I'm glad I didn't the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.969 
lit and lent well I'm glad I didn't the
18<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.490> 135<00:01:31.220> has<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.250> far<00:01:32.700> greater<00:01:33.000> range<00:01:33.979> you

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
18 to 135 has a far greater range you

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.499 
18 to 135 has a far greater range you
can<00:01:35.130> go<00:01:35.310> way<00:01:35.610> wider<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:37.100> because<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.310> that

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
can go way wider and because of that

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.969 
can go way wider and because of that
it's<00:01:39.509> just<00:01:39.920> so<00:01:40.920> much<00:01:41.100> more<00:01:41.400> usable<00:01:42.500> they<00:01:43.500> they

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
it's just so much more usable they they

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.929 
it's just so much more usable they they
each<00:01:44.130> have<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.579> same<00:01:45.799> telephoto<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.130> one<00:01:47.460> 35

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
each have the same telephoto and one 35

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.300 
each have the same telephoto and one 35
millimeter<00:01:48.479> which<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.380> think<00:01:49.409> equivalent

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
millimeter which is I think equivalent

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.770 
millimeter which is I think equivalent
to<00:01:50.460> like<00:01:50.780> 168<00:01:52.610> but<00:01:53.610> this<00:01:53.939> one<00:01:54.119> goes<00:01:54.270> clear<00:01:54.630> down

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
to like 168 but this one goes clear down

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.639 
to like 168 but this one goes clear down
to<00:01:54.810> 18<00:01:55.530> well<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.340> had<00:01:56.729> read<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:58.259> image

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
to 18 well I had read that the image

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.880 
to 18 well I had read that the image
quality<00:01:58.920> really<00:01:59.549> wasn't<00:01:59.759> that<00:01:59.969> great<00:02:00.590> at<00:02:01.590> the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
quality really wasn't that great at the

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.810 
quality really wasn't that great at the
at<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.939> wide<00:02:03.180> end<00:02:03.619> but<00:02:04.619> after<00:02:05.219> having<00:02:05.640> this

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
at the wide end but after having this

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.419 
at the wide end but after having this
lens<00:02:06.299> for<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.689> few<00:02:07.290> weeks<00:02:07.469> now<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.799> taking<00:02:08.340> a

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
lens for a few weeks now and taking a

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.979 
lens for a few weeks now and taking a
bunch<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.700> pictures<00:02:08.879> with<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.920> you<00:02:10.920> know

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
bunch of pictures with it you know

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.649 
bunch of pictures with it you know
you're<00:02:12.370> unless<00:02:13.370> you're<00:02:13.670> getting<00:02:14.090> these

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:14.659 
you're unless you're getting these

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:16.780 
you're unless you're getting these
images<00:02:15.170> on<00:02:15.319> your<00:02:15.469> computer<00:02:15.950> and<00:02:16.069> blowing<00:02:16.609> them

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
images on your computer and blowing them

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.059 
images on your computer and blowing them
up<00:02:16.909> to<00:02:17.120> a<00:02:17.150> hundred<00:02:17.420> percent<00:02:17.629> and<00:02:18.230> really

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
up to a hundred percent and really

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.910 
up to a hundred percent and really
looking<00:02:19.430> hard<00:02:19.900> you're<00:02:20.900> not<00:02:21.049> going<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.290> see<00:02:21.469> any

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
looking hard you're not going to see any

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.119 
looking hard you're not going to see any
difference<00:02:22.150> so<00:02:23.150> yeah<00:02:24.019> I<00:02:24.409> would<00:02:24.590> highly

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
difference so yeah I would highly

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:25.839 
difference so yeah I would highly
recommend<00:02:25.159> it

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
recommend it

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.360 
recommend it
some<00:02:26.269> of<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.510> downsides<00:02:26.780> with<00:02:27.530> this<00:02:27.709> lens<00:02:28.010> as

some of the downsides with this lens as
compared<00:02:29.000> to<00:02:29.090> some<00:02:29.450> of<00:02:29.599> the<00:02:29.629> more<00:02:30.040> expensive

compared to some of the more expensive

see the feet and meters that it's

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:42.940 
see the feet and meters that it's
focusing<00:02:41.090> whoop-dee-doo<00:02:41.989> you<00:02:42.530> know<00:02:42.650> I'm<00:02:42.799> not

focusing whoop-dee-doo you know I'm not

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.270 
focusing whoop-dee-doo you know I'm not
sure<00:02:43.010> I<00:02:43.900> don't<00:02:44.900> really<00:02:45.200> use<00:02:45.530> that<00:02:45.560> myself

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
sure I don't really use that myself

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.479 
sure I don't really use that myself
anyway<00:02:46.689> the<00:02:47.689> other<00:02:47.720> downside<00:02:48.379> is<00:02:48.620> it<00:02:49.069> doesn't

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
anyway the other downside is it doesn't

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.839 
anyway the other downside is it doesn't
focus<00:02:50.290> silently<00:02:51.290> there's<00:02:52.220> a<00:02:52.310> little<00:02:52.609> bit<00:02:52.730> of

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
focus silently there's a little bit of

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.629 
focus silently there's a little bit of
noise<00:02:53.000> you<00:02:53.769> know<00:02:54.769> I<00:02:54.859> doubt<00:02:54.950> you'll<00:02:55.220> be<00:02:55.280> able<00:02:55.430> to

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:55.639 
noise you know I doubt you'll be able to

00:02:55.639 --> 00:03:03.280 
noise you know I doubt you'll be able to
hear<00:02:55.909> it<00:02:56.060> but<00:02:56.269> you<00:03:00.849> know<00:03:01.849> I<00:03:02.060> it's<00:03:02.450> it's<00:03:02.900> fairly

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
hear it but you know I it's it's fairly

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.720 
hear it but you know I it's it's fairly
quiet<00:03:03.739> and<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:05.540> focusing<00:03:06.200> ring<00:03:06.230> at<00:03:06.739> the<00:03:07.700> end

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
quiet and the focusing ring at the end

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.619 
quiet and the focusing ring at the end
of<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.269> lens<00:03:08.480> does<00:03:08.930> rotate<00:03:10.329> none<00:03:11.329> of<00:03:11.480> those

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
of the lens does rotate none of those

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.470 
of the lens does rotate none of those
factors<00:03:12.040> has<00:03:13.040> written<00:03:13.370> has<00:03:13.669> been<00:03:14.030> a<00:03:14.060> factor

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
factors has written has been a factor

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.069 
factors has written has been a factor
for<00:03:15.200> me

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
for me

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.909 
for me
they<00:03:18.079> just<00:03:18.260> don't<00:03:18.500> bother<00:03:18.650> me<00:03:18.919> it<00:03:19.729> works<00:03:20.060> great

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:20.919 
they just don't bother me it works great

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:25.629

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
check out the 18 to 135 so I thought I'd

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.550 
check out the 18 to 135 so I thought I'd
mention<00:04:02.150> that<00:04:02.269> after<00:04:02.449> using<00:04:02.780> this<00:04:03.079> for<00:04:03.319> a<00:04:03.349> few

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
mention that after using this for a few

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.020 
mention that after using this for a few
weeks<00:04:05.259> as<00:04:06.259> you<00:04:06.500> can<00:04:06.650> see<00:04:06.859> there<00:04:07.459> there<00:04:07.790> it<00:04:07.909> is

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
weeks as you can see there there it is

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.009 
weeks as you can see there there it is
fully<00:04:08.299> extended

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
fully extended

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:15.879 
fully extended
there<00:04:09.769> is<00:04:10.040> no<00:04:10.370> zoom<00:04:10.729> creep<00:04:12.159> at<00:04:13.159> all<00:04:13.810> as<00:04:14.810> you<00:04:15.739> can

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
there is no zoom creep at all as you can

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.939 
there is no zoom creep at all as you can
see<00:04:16.329> it's<00:04:17.329> very<00:04:17.479> tight<00:04:18.049> has<00:04:18.620> image

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:18.949 
see it's very tight has image

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:22.089 
see it's very tight has image
stabilization<00:04:20.529> you<00:04:21.529> know<00:04:21.650> the<00:04:21.889> only<00:04:22.010> thing

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.099 
stabilization you know the only thing

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:24.100 
stabilization you know the only thing
that<00:04:22.250> would<00:04:22.430> make<00:04:22.490> it<00:04:22.789> better<00:04:22.969> would<00:04:23.960> be<00:04:23.990> a

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
that would make it better would be a

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.610 
that would make it better would be a
wider<00:04:24.529> aperture

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
wider aperture

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.640 
wider aperture
it<00:04:25.680> is<00:04:26.130> a<00:04:26.160> 3.5<00:04:27.090> all<00:04:27.570> the<00:04:27.840> way<00:04:27.990> out<00:04:28.199> to<00:04:28.440> its

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
it is a 3.5 all the way out to its

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.860 
it is a 3.5 all the way out to its
widest<00:04:29.130> and<00:04:29.400> when<00:04:30.090> you<00:04:30.180> zoom<00:04:30.389> it<00:04:30.540> all<00:04:30.630> the<00:04:30.750> way

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
widest and when you zoom it all the way

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.659 
widest and when you zoom it all the way
in<00:04:31.080> its<00:04:31.919> maximum<00:04:32.730> aperture<00:04:32.910> is<00:04:33.180> 5.6<00:04:33.900> so<00:04:34.800> really

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
in its maximum aperture is 5.6 so really

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.210 
in its maximum aperture is 5.6 so really
you<00:04:36.330> know<00:04:36.449> if<00:04:37.199> you<00:04:37.410> plan<00:04:37.590> on<00:04:37.650> using<00:04:38.070> that

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
you know if you plan on using that

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.210 
you know if you plan on using that
indoor<00:04:38.790> or<00:04:39.150> in<00:04:39.389> low-light<00:04:39.900> situations<00:04:40.220> this

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
indoor or in low-light situations this

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.909 
indoor or in low-light situations this
is<00:04:41.280> not<00:04:41.610> your<00:04:41.790> lens<00:04:42.350> this<00:04:43.350> is<00:04:43.530> good<00:04:43.710> for

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
is not your lens this is good for

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.060 
is not your lens this is good for
outdoor<00:04:44.130> like<00:04:44.729> I<00:04:44.850> say<00:04:45.060> travel<00:04:46.070> anything

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
outdoor like I say travel anything

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.270 
outdoor like I say travel anything
outdoor<00:04:47.550> walk<00:04:47.970> around<00:04:48.590> but<00:04:49.590> if<00:04:49.680> your<00:04:49.830> indoor

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
outdoor walk around but if your indoor

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.010 
outdoor walk around but if your indoor
sporting<00:04:51.090> events<00:04:51.570> or<00:04:51.690> something<00:04:51.780> like<00:04:51.960> that

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
sporting events or something like that

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.560 
sporting events or something like that
you<00:04:52.740> need<00:04:52.860> to<00:04:52.979> look<00:04:53.100> elsewhere<00:04:53.370> you<00:04:54.330> need<00:04:54.479> to

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
you need to look elsewhere you need to

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.490 
you need to look elsewhere you need to
get<00:04:54.690> a<00:04:54.720> like<00:04:55.169> a<00:04:55.199> 2.8<00:04:56.810> maximum<00:04:57.810> aperture<00:04:58.290> lens

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
get a like a 2.8 maximum aperture lens

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.900 
get a like a 2.8 maximum aperture lens
so<00:04:59.490> the<00:04:59.810> 18<00:05:00.810> to<00:05:00.930> 135<00:05:01.560> is<00:05:01.830> a<00:05:01.860> great<00:05:02.250> choice<00:05:02.580> I

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
so the 18 to 135 is a great choice I

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.430 
so the 18 to 135 is a great choice I
would<00:05:03.210> recommend<00:05:03.690> it<00:05:03.840> especially<00:05:03.930> for<00:05:04.380> the

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
would recommend it especially for the

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.490 
would recommend it especially for the
price<00:05:04.740> I<00:05:05.130> think<00:05:05.340> it<00:05:05.460> runs<00:05:06.169> around<00:05:07.669> 450<00:05:08.669> or<00:05:08.970> so

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
price I think it runs around 450 or so
