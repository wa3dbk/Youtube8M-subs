for<00:02:15.730> prior<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:16.090> that<00:02:16.239> game<00:02:16.350> there's<00:02:17.350> a

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
for prior to that game there's a

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.750 
for prior to that game there's a
separate<00:02:17.800> game<00:02:18.040> because<00:02:18.310> I<00:02:18.340> did<00:02:18.640> actually

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
separate game because I did actually

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.040 
separate game because I did actually
think<00:02:19.090> it<00:02:19.209> was<00:02:19.300> going<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.630> be<00:02:19.720> different

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
think it was going to be different

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.840 
think it was going to be different
levels<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:20.739> I<00:02:20.830> can<00:02:21.069> set<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.370> thing<00:02:21.550> but<00:02:21.730> it's

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
levels and I can set the thing but it's

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.600
