in<00:00:06.770> my<00:00:07.580> kitchen<00:00:07.850> when<00:00:08.300> I<00:00:08.330> charge<00:00:08.600> devices<00:00:10.570> if<00:00:11.570> I

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
in my kitchen when I charge devices if I

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.620 
in my kitchen when I charge devices if I
have<00:00:12.230> these<00:00:12.500> three<00:00:12.920> charters<00:00:13.640> they're<00:00:14.450> all

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 
have these three charters they're all

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.600 
have these three charters they're all
hooked<00:00:14.840> on<00:00:15.020> to<00:00:15.290> a<00:00:15.320> power<00:00:15.590> strip<00:00:15.920> which<00:00:16.250> is<00:00:16.400> off

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:16.610 
hooked on to a power strip which is off

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.360 
hooked on to a power strip which is off
the<00:00:17.150> wall<00:00:17.330> so<00:00:17.960> it's<00:00:18.080> just<00:00:18.170> very<00:00:18.440> cluttered<00:00:19.070> and

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:19.370 
the wall so it's just very cluttered and

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.410 
the wall so it's just very cluttered and
messy<00:00:20.620> so<00:00:21.620> the<00:00:21.710> benefit<00:00:22.190> of<00:00:22.220> this<00:00:22.610> one<00:00:22.880> is<00:00:23.120> that

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
messy so the benefit of this one is that

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.170 
messy so the benefit of this one is that
when<00:00:24.100> within<00:00:25.100> one<00:00:25.310> break<00:00:25.580> you<00:00:25.880> can<00:00:26.000> charge

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
when within one break you can charge

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.060 
when within one break you can charge
five<00:00:26.450> different<00:00:26.780> devices<00:00:27.080> so<00:00:27.590> let's<00:00:27.740> open<00:00:27.860> it

it's very small I thought it'd be pretty
big<00:00:46.399> but<00:00:46.870> compared<00:00:47.870> to<00:00:48.309> the<00:00:49.309> note<00:00:49.520> 3<00:00:50.410> it's

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
big but compared to the note 3 it's

00:00:51.410 --> 00:01:01.720 
big but compared to the note 3 it's
pretty<00:00:51.590> small<00:00:54.670> compared<00:00:55.670> to<00:00:55.790> a<00:00:55.870> nexus<00:00:56.870> 7<00:01:00.730> and

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
pretty small compared to a nexus 7 and

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.449 
pretty small compared to a nexus 7 and
compared<00:01:02.180> to<00:01:02.300> the<00:01:02.450> stock<00:01:03.069> apple<00:01:04.069> charger

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:04.459 
compared to the stock apple charger

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:06.999 
compared to the stock apple charger
which<00:01:04.789> only<00:01:04.969> charges<00:01:05.449> one<00:01:05.659> you're<00:01:06.560> charging

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
which only charges one you're charging
