remake<00:02:33.610> it<00:02:33.790> anyway<00:02:34.200> it's<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.349> door<00:02:35.620> hinge<00:02:35.920> and

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
remake it anyway it's a door hinge and

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.759 
remake it anyway it's a door hinge and
some<00:02:36.879> angle<00:02:37.209> iron<00:02:37.420> just<00:02:38.230> welded<00:02:38.590> together<00:02:38.709> and

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
some angle iron just welded together and

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.390 
some angle iron just welded together and
spaced<00:02:41.769> out<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.190> springs<00:02:42.580> for<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:42.970> seat<00:02:43.209> and

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
spaced out the springs for the seat and

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.729 
spaced out the springs for the seat and
here<00:02:45.400> you<00:02:45.519> can<00:02:45.670> see<00:02:45.940> if<00:02:46.870> it's<00:02:47.110> not<00:02:47.290> too<00:02:47.470> dark

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
here you can see if it's not too dark

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.949 
here you can see if it's not too dark
where<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:48.849> battery<00:02:49.180> will<00:02:49.299> sit<00:02:49.599> there's<00:02:49.900> a

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
waterproof it and here I don't know if

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.050 
waterproof it and here I don't know if
you<00:03:21.370> can<00:03:21.519> see<00:03:21.730> this<00:03:22.260> but<00:03:23.260> I<00:03:23.319> use<00:03:23.650> a<00:03:23.680> piece<00:03:24.010> of

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
you can see this but I use a piece of

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.509 
you can see this but I use a piece of
electrical<00:03:25.060> conduit<00:03:25.660> and<00:03:26.310> drilled<00:03:27.310> through

back<00:03:35.950> to<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.310> battery<00:03:36.639> to<00:03:37.540> keep<00:03:37.720> it<00:03:37.840> above<00:03:38.170> the

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
back to the battery to keep it above the

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.740 
back to the battery to keep it above the
frame<00:03:39.459> to<00:03:39.489> keep<00:03:39.850> it<00:03:39.970> out<00:03:40.060> of<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.239> way<00:03:40.420> of<00:03:40.630> the

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
frame to keep it out of the way of the

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.250 
frame to keep it out of the way of the
anything<00:03:41.530> getting<00:03:41.859> hung<00:03:42.489> on<00:03:42.730> it<00:03:42.910> but<00:03:43.840> also<00:03:44.019> to

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
anything getting hung on it but also to

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.660 
anything getting hung on it but also to
keep<00:03:44.500> it<00:03:44.680> from<00:03:44.889> like<00:03:45.670> my<00:03:45.850> leg<00:03:46.090> to<00:03:46.359> keep<00:03:47.139> it<00:03:47.290> from

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
keep it from like my leg to keep it from

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.240 
keep it from like my leg to keep it from
pulling<00:03:48.670> it<00:03:49.030> or<00:03:49.350> damaging<00:03:50.350> in<00:03:50.470> it<00:03:50.650> anyway<00:03:51.040> and

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
pulling it or damaging in it anyway and

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.559 
pulling it or damaging in it anyway and
then<00:03:52.180> i<00:03:52.239> just<00:03:52.600> used<00:03:53.380> hot<00:03:53.590> glue<00:03:53.620> again<00:03:54.569> right

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
then i just used hot glue again right

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.080 
then i just used hot glue again right
here<00:03:55.900> around<00:03:56.260> the<00:03:56.920> hole<00:03:57.160> and<00:03:57.489> painted<00:03:58.000> it

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
here around the hole and painted it

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.390 
here around the hole and painted it
black<00:03:58.299> and<00:03:58.359> and<00:03:58.840> it<00:03:59.650> almost<00:03:59.799> looks<00:04:00.220> like<00:04:00.310> a

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
black and and it almost looks like a

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.870 
black and and it almost looks like a
bead<00:04:01.120> from<00:04:01.420> welding<00:04:02.100> but<00:04:03.100> i<00:04:03.130> think<00:04:03.519> it<00:04:03.639> turned

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
bead from welding but i think it turned

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.349 
bead from welding but i think it turned
out<00:04:04.000> pretty<00:04:04.180> good<00:04:05.040> I<00:04:06.060> don't<00:04:07.060> know<00:04:07.120> if<00:04:07.239> you'll

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
out pretty good I don't know if you'll

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:09.120 
out pretty good I don't know if you'll
be<00:04:07.480> able<00:04:07.510> to<00:04:07.660> see<00:04:07.840> here<00:04:08.139> but<00:04:08.170> underneath<00:04:08.620> I've

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
be able to see here but underneath I've

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:17.039 
be able to see here but underneath I've
made<00:04:10.060> a<00:04:10.560> angle<00:04:11.560> angle<00:04:11.829> iron<00:04:14.130> ramp<00:04:15.130> for<00:04:15.880> for<00:04:16.840> any

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
made a angle angle iron ramp for for any

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.870 
made a angle angle iron ramp for for any
obstacles<00:04:17.680> and<00:04:17.829> I<00:04:17.919> plan<00:04:18.099> on<00:04:18.280> putting<00:04:18.459> a<00:04:18.609> skid

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
obstacles and I plan on putting a skid

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.170 
obstacles and I plan on putting a skid
plate<00:04:19.120> over<00:04:19.389> top<00:04:19.599> the<00:04:19.630> whole<00:04:19.870> bottom<00:04:20.320> and<00:04:20.470> that

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
plate over top the whole bottom and that

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.659 
plate over top the whole bottom and that
will<00:04:22.440> keep<00:04:23.440> me<00:04:23.500> from<00:04:23.620> getting<00:04:23.919> hung<00:04:24.280> up<00:04:24.430> on

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
will keep me from getting hung up on

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:29.010 
will keep me from getting hung up on
just<00:04:24.970> the<00:04:25.440> transaxle<00:04:26.460> and<00:04:27.479> like<00:04:28.479> I<00:04:28.599> said<00:04:28.660> it's

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
just the transaxle and like I said it's

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.310 
just the transaxle and like I said it's
it's<00:04:29.349> pretty<00:04:29.620> close<00:04:29.860> to<00:04:30.099> being<00:04:30.310> running<00:04:30.700> now

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
it's pretty close to being running now

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.820 
it's pretty close to being running now
just<00:04:32.320> need<00:04:32.470> to<00:04:32.590> get<00:04:32.710> the<00:04:32.860> throttle

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
here to the governor set up and once I

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.060 
here to the governor set up and once I
know<00:04:55.780> the<00:04:56.020> distance<00:04:56.380> of<00:04:56.530> that<00:04:56.650> I'll<00:04:56.860> make<00:04:57.040> a

know the distance of that I'll make a
new<00:04:57.310> one<00:04:57.490> and<00:04:58.260> then<00:04:59.260> I<00:04:59.290> should<00:04:59.800> be<00:05:00.010> ready<00:05:00.730> to

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
new one and then I should be ready to

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.470 
new one and then I should be ready to
test<00:05:01.150> it<00:05:01.360> and<00:05:02.160> that's<00:05:03.160> that's<00:05:03.700> about<00:05:04.060> it<00:05:04.090> it's

wide body and it's a five-speed manual
transmission<00:05:30.190> and<00:05:31.440> I'm<00:05:32.440> going<00:05:32.590> to<00:05:32.620> make<00:05:32.710> a

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
transmission and I'm going to make a

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.420 
transmission and I'm going to make a
shifter<00:05:34.470> extension<00:05:35.470> for<00:05:35.770> the<00:05:35.830> handle<00:05:36.160> to<00:05:36.280> use

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
shifter extension for the handle to use

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.950 
shifter extension for the handle to use
this<00:05:36.750> this<00:05:38.130> rubber<00:05:39.130> handle<00:05:39.580> here<00:05:39.880> which<00:05:40.780> has

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
this this rubber handle here which has

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.040 
this this rubber handle here which has
the<00:05:42.030> indentions<00:05:43.030> for<00:05:43.210> your<00:05:43.330> fingers<00:05:43.690> I<00:05:43.840> think

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
the indentions for your fingers I think

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.170 
the indentions for your fingers I think
it'll<00:05:44.260> work<00:05:44.290> a<00:05:44.500> little<00:05:44.620> bit<00:05:44.770> better<00:05:45.180> but

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
it'll work a little bit better but

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.210 
it'll work a little bit better but
that's<00:05:46.390> that's<00:05:47.140> a<00:05:47.350> finishing<00:05:47.950> touch<00:05:48.100> job<00:05:48.640> and

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
that's that's a finishing touch job and

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.550 
that's that's a finishing touch job and
also<00:05:51.220> here<00:05:51.460> you<00:05:51.640> can<00:05:51.790> see<00:05:52.000> I<00:05:52.030> had<00:05:52.300> to<00:05:52.450> raise<00:05:53.260> the

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
also here you can see I had to raise the

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.210 
also here you can see I had to raise the
stock<00:05:53.860> dash<00:05:54.580> three<00:05:55.330> inches<00:05:55.690> by<00:05:55.900> welding<00:05:56.830> in

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
stock dash three inches by welding in

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.660 
stock dash three inches by welding in
three<00:05:58.120> inch<00:05:58.270> wide<00:05:58.510> sheet<00:05:59.410> metal<00:05:59.740> because<00:06:00.430> this

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:00.670 
three inch wide sheet metal because this

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:03.690 
three inch wide sheet metal because this
opposed<00:06:01.660> twin<00:06:01.930> motor<00:06:02.320> is<00:06:02.590> much<00:06:03.190> taller<00:06:03.490> than

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:03.700 
opposed twin motor is much taller than

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.430 
opposed twin motor is much taller than
the<00:06:04.030> original<00:06:04.450> motor<00:06:04.660> that<00:06:04.900> came<00:06:05.080> on<00:06:05.290> this

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
the original motor that came on this

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.660 
the original motor that came on this
lawn<00:06:06.400> mower<00:06:06.670> and<00:06:07.530> that's<00:06:08.530> that's<00:06:09.160> about<00:06:09.490> all<00:06:09.520> I

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:09.670 
lawn mower and that's that's about all I

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:15.450 
lawn mower and that's that's about all I
have<00:06:10.000> for<00:06:10.890> this<00:06:11.890> project<00:06:14.100> when<00:06:15.100> I<00:06:15.130> get<00:06:15.340> it

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 
have for this project when I get it

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.020 
have for this project when I get it
started<00:06:15.880> i'll<00:06:16.060> make<00:06:16.660> another<00:06:16.780> video<00:06:17.200> of<00:06:18.030> it

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.030 
started i'll make another video of it

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:25.560 
started i'll make another video of it
running<00:06:19.270> and<00:06:20.940> see<00:06:21.940> how<00:06:22.120> it<00:06:22.270> runs<00:06:23.220> and<00:06:24.570> that's

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:25.570 
running and see how it runs and that's

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.050 
running and see how it runs and that's
it<00:06:25.750> for<00:06:25.900> now
