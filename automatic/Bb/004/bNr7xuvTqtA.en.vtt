signature this exercise can be used on

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.590 
signature this exercise can be used on
every<00:00:45.960> single<00:00:46.140> key<00:00:46.469> signature<00:00:47.039> in<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:48.239> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
every single key signature in in the

every single key signature in in the
whole<00:00:48.809> register<00:00:49.260> but<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.550> lesson<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:51.090> will

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
whole register but in this lesson I will

00:00:51.149 --> 00:01:00.500 
whole register but in this lesson I will
be<00:00:51.510> using<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:52.079> C<00:00:52.320> major

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:09.030 

simple<00:01:01.510> as<00:01:01.570> that<00:01:05.460> now<00:01:06.930> my<00:01:07.930> right<00:01:08.500> hand<00:01:08.530> is

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
simple as that now my right hand is

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.910 
simple as that now my right hand is
going<00:01:09.430> to<00:01:09.910> jump<00:01:10.630> on<00:01:10.840> the<00:01:11.050> keys<00:01:11.290> because<00:01:11.560> it's

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
going to jump on the keys because it's

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.090 
going to jump on the keys because it's
very<00:01:12.190> hot<00:01:12.990> left<00:01:13.990> hand<00:01:14.229> can<00:01:14.440> play<00:01:14.650> very

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
very hot left hand can play very

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.719 
very hot left hand can play very
normally<00:01:15.869> because<00:01:16.869> it's<00:01:17.290> normally<00:01:18.160> heated

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
normally because it's normally heated

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:32.870 
normally because it's normally heated
keys<00:01:19.119> right<00:01:20.400> like<00:01:21.400> this

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.139 

you

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.690 

then<00:01:37.149> all<00:01:37.450> you<00:01:37.689> have<00:01:37.719> to<00:01:38.140> do<00:01:38.350> is<00:01:38.649> change<00:01:39.520> the

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
then all you have to do is change the

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.380 
then all you have to do is change the
hands<00:01:40.299> now<00:01:40.950> your<00:01:41.950> left<00:01:42.219> hand<00:01:42.399> is<00:01:42.759> moving<00:01:43.060> on

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
hands now your left hand is moving on

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.109 
hands now your left hand is moving on
the<00:01:43.600> hotkeys<00:01:44.259> and<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:45.130> right<00:01:45.369> hand<00:01:45.700> is<00:01:45.939> moving

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
the hotkeys and the right hand is moving

00:01:46.119 --> 00:02:03.149 
the hotkeys and the right hand is moving
on<00:01:46.509> the<00:01:46.659> cold<00:01:46.960> keys<00:01:47.369> like<00:01:48.369> this<00:02:01.709> very<00:02:02.709> very

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
on the cold keys like this very very

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.789 
on the cold keys like this very very
simple<00:02:03.729> so<00:02:04.600> you<00:02:04.750> just<00:02:04.959> have<00:02:05.140> to<00:02:05.289> learn<00:02:05.500> how<00:02:05.560> to

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
simple so you just have to learn how to

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.089 
simple so you just have to learn how to
play<00:02:06.100> the<00:02:06.369> key<00:02:06.579> before<00:02:06.789> you<00:02:07.060> start<00:02:07.360> it<00:02:07.979> start<00:02:08.979> a

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
play the key before you start it start a

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.000 
play the key before you start it start a
very<00:02:09.429> slow<00:02:09.819> move<00:02:10.509> up<00:02:10.780> to<00:02:10.989> speed<00:02:11.290> once<00:02:11.650> you<00:02:11.799> have

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
very slow move up to speed once you have

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.750 
very slow move up to speed once you have
get<00:02:12.280> more<00:02:12.760> independent<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:14.310> your<00:02:15.310> progress

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
get more independent and your progress

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.120 
get more independent and your progress
will<00:02:16.269> reach<00:02:16.540> new<00:02:16.870> heights<00:02:17.079> I<00:02:17.410> promise<00:02:17.980> you

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
will reach new heights I promise you

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.239 
will reach new heights I promise you
good<00:02:19.060> luck
