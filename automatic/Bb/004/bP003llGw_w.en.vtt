work<00:00:19.020> off<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:20.160> reason<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:20.730> because<00:00:20.970> as<00:00:21.270> it

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
work off the reason is because as it

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.509 
work off the reason is because as it
comes<00:00:21.660> down<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.500> blade<00:00:22.740> comes<00:00:23.039> into<00:00:23.490> a

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
comes down the blade comes into a

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.960 
comes down the blade comes into a
cut-set<00:00:24.029> visit<00:00:24.600> coming<00:00:25.260> back<00:00:25.410> up<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:26.550> hits<00:00:26.789> two

cut-set visit coming back up it hits two
hits<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.570> again<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.590> it's<00:00:28.769> causes<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.279> chip

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
hits it again and it's causes it to chip

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
this is what's going to make the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.050 
this is what's going to make the
contrast<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.829> give<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.220> 3d<00:01:32.579> effect<00:01:32.880> is

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
contrast to give it that 3d effect is

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.499 
contrast to give it that 3d effect is
the<00:01:33.180> three<00:01:33.390> different<00:01:33.659> styles<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.020> wood<00:01:34.460> now

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
the three different styles of wood now

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.649 
the three different styles of wood now
as<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.659> push<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.049> in<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.920> see<00:01:38.100> up<00:01:38.220> here<00:01:38.659> I've

as I push that in you see up here I've

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.120 
as I push that in you see up here I've
got<00:01:39.869> us<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.020> little<00:01:40.140> stop<00:01:40.409> block<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.860> notice<00:01:41.070> I

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
got us a little stop block you notice I

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.480 
got us a little stop block you notice I
just<00:01:41.369> touches<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.790> corner<00:01:42.150> right<00:01:42.930> here<00:01:43.490> okay

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
just touches the corner right here okay

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.260 
just touches the corner right here okay
I<00:01:44.840> don't<00:01:45.840> know<00:01:45.930> if<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.140> showing<00:01:46.470> very<00:01:46.649> good

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
I don't know if it's showing very good

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.990 
I don't know if it's showing very good
but<00:01:48.500> and<00:01:49.500> what<00:01:49.710> reason<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:50.189> do<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.340> right<00:01:50.759> there

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
but and what reason I do it right there

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.700 
but and what reason I do it right there
instead<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.329> having<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.720> whole<00:01:51.960> block<00:01:52.229> right

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
instead of having a whole block right

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.399 
instead of having a whole block right
through<00:01:52.950> here<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.810> because<00:01:54.810> if<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.229> have<00:01:55.380> a

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
through here is because if you have a

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.929 
through here is because if you have a
block<00:01:55.680> right<00:01:55.890> here<00:01:55.920> when<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.399> hits<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.640> blade

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
block right here when it hits a blade

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.550 
block right here when it hits a blade
it'll<00:01:57.329> actually<00:01:57.450> take<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.990> blade<00:01:58.259> will<00:01:58.380> pick

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
it'll actually take that blade will pick

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.800 
it'll actually take that blade will pick
it<00:01:58.590> up<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:58.860> kick<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.189> back<00:01:59.340> at<00:01:59.520> you<00:01:59.729> so<00:02:00.659> by

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
it up and kick it back at you so by

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.899 
it up and kick it back at you so by
placement<00:02:01.290> right<00:02:01.380> here<00:02:01.649> when<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:01.860> cut<00:02:02.219> it

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
placement right here when you cut it

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.490 
placement right here when you cut it
will<00:02:03.030> roll<00:02:03.240> this<00:02:03.420> right<00:02:03.659> back<00:02:03.810> out<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.290> will

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
will roll this right back out and will

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.889 
will roll this right back out and will
allow<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.710> blade<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.100> recut<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.520> again<00:02:05.899> I'll

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
allow the blade to recut it again I'll

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.540 
allow the blade to recut it again I'll
show<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.229> here<00:02:07.439> real<00:02:07.619> quick<00:02:07.890> if<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.190> could<00:02:08.369> hold

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
show you here real quick if I could hold

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:26.460 
show you here real quick if I could hold
this

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.940 

yeah<00:02:27.040> that's<00:02:27.370> it

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
yeah that's it

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.699 
yeah that's it
now<00:02:29.520> you<00:02:29.580> look<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.870> pattern<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.349> you<00:02:31.470> want

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
now you look the pattern that you want

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.640 
now you look the pattern that you want
when<00:02:32.280> you're<00:02:32.400> done<00:02:32.640> is<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:34.290> look<00:02:34.410> like<00:02:34.620> a

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
when you're done is to look like a

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.930 
when you're done is to look like a
diamond<00:02:35.690> okay<00:02:36.690> so<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:38.099> more<00:02:38.519> perfect<00:02:38.730> the

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
diamond okay so the more perfect the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.850 
diamond okay so the more perfect the
diamond<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.330> more<00:02:39.540> perfect<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:39.989> 3d<00:02:40.319> effect<00:02:40.650> is

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
diamond the more perfect to 3d effect is

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.050 
diamond the more perfect to 3d effect is
going<00:02:41.099> to<00:02:41.160> be<00:02:41.750> now<00:02:42.750> when<00:02:43.019> you<00:02:43.110> cut<00:02:43.319> that<00:02:44.060> you

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
going to be now when you cut that you

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.790 
going to be now when you cut that you
come<00:02:45.300> over<00:02:45.420> here<00:02:45.540> this<00:02:46.200> is<00:02:46.319> where<00:02:46.470> I've

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800

and<00:03:06.209> grab<00:03:06.330> me<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.510> piece<00:03:06.690> of<00:03:06.720> walnut<00:03:07.019> I<00:03:09.110> try<00:03:10.110> to

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
and grab me a piece of walnut I try to

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.020 
and grab me a piece of walnut I try to
get<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.799> grain<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.489> go<00:03:11.640> in<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.849> same

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
get the grain to go in the same

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.229 
get the grain to go in the same
direction<00:03:12.090> as<00:03:12.810> much<00:03:12.989> as<00:03:13.140> I<00:03:13.230> can<00:03:14.090> sometimes<00:03:15.090> you

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
direction as much as I can sometimes you

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.630 
direction as much as I can sometimes you
make<00:03:15.450> mistakes<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:16.110> you<00:03:16.230> don't<00:03:16.410> see<00:03:16.709> it<00:03:16.860> and

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
make mistakes and you don't see it and

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.250 
make mistakes and you don't see it and
you<00:03:17.940> see<00:03:18.239> how<00:03:18.390> it<00:03:18.480> goes<00:03:18.660> together<00:03:21.170> and<00:03:22.170> it

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
you see how it goes together and it

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.069 
you see how it goes together and it
gives<00:03:22.470> you<00:03:22.560> that<00:03:22.709> 3d<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:23.630> that's<00:03:24.630> because<00:03:24.810> of

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
gives you that 3d and that's because of

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.420 
gives you that 3d and that's because of
the<00:03:25.140> contrast<00:03:25.650> between<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:26.069> different

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
the contrast between the different

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.380 
the contrast between the different
colors<00:03:26.700> of<00:03:26.849> wood<00:03:27.090> whoops<00:03:27.660> it<00:03:28.200> really<00:03:28.410> worked

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
colors of wood whoops it really worked

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.500 
colors of wood whoops it really worked
so<00:03:31.099> now<00:03:32.099> if<00:03:32.400> you<00:03:32.549> really<00:03:32.910> want<00:03:33.120> it<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.269> give<00:03:33.480> it

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
so now if you really want it to give it

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.099 
so now if you really want it to give it
more<00:03:33.750> contrast<00:03:35.180> there's<00:03:36.180> two<00:03:36.420> ways<00:03:36.600> of<00:03:36.780> doing

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
more contrast there's two ways of doing

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.840 
more contrast there's two ways of doing
it<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.319> first<00:03:37.590> way<00:03:37.709> is<00:03:37.829> just<00:03:38.250> to<00:03:38.400> put<00:03:38.670> a<00:03:38.700> little

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
it the first way is just to put a little

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.629 
it the first way is just to put a little
Locker<00:03:39.120> on<00:03:39.420> it<00:03:39.569> okay<00:03:39.930> and<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.530> locker<00:03:40.739> it's

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
Locker on it okay and the locker it's

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.330 
Locker on it okay and the locker it's
going<00:03:41.850> to<00:03:41.880> cause<00:03:42.090> it<00:03:42.329> to<00:03:42.709> highlight<00:03:43.709> the

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
going to cause it to highlight the

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.460 
going to cause it to highlight the
different<00:03:44.670> colors<00:03:44.940> of<00:03:45.090> wood<00:03:45.299> and<00:03:46.049> we'll<00:03:46.260> spray

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
different colors of wood and we'll spray

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:53.240 
different colors of wood and we'll spray
this<00:03:46.620> down<00:03:46.680> just<00:03:47.280> for<00:03:47.519> test<00:03:47.819> and<00:03:48.000> show<00:03:48.150> you<00:03:52.250> now

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
this down just for test and show you now

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.910 
this down just for test and show you now
you<00:03:53.310> see<00:03:53.579> how<00:03:53.670> that<00:03:53.730> comes<00:03:53.970> out<00:03:54.829> now<00:03:55.829> it's

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
you see how that comes out now it's

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.569 
you see how that comes out now it's
really<00:03:56.160> starting<00:03:56.310> to<00:03:56.639> look<00:03:56.790> good<00:03:57.739> now<00:03:58.739> when

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
really starting to look good now when

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.960 
really starting to look good now when
you<00:04:00.319> before<00:04:01.319> you<00:04:01.410> do<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.709> locker<00:04:01.970> try

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
you before you do the locker try

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.840 
you before you do the locker try
something<00:04:03.299> else<00:04:03.389> I<00:04:03.950> use<00:04:04.950> what<00:04:05.730> they<00:04:05.819> call

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
something else I use what they call

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.530 
something else I use what they call
special<00:04:06.329> walnut'<00:04:06.930> then<00:04:07.350> the<00:04:07.530> stain<00:04:08.540> you'll

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
special walnut' then the stain you'll

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.379 
special walnut' then the stain you'll
play<00:04:09.780> that<00:04:10.019> on<00:04:10.230> and<00:04:10.940> each<00:04:11.940> of<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.239> different

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
play that on and each of the different

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.300 
play that on and each of the different
colors<00:04:12.810> would<00:04:13.230> will<00:04:13.620> actually<00:04:13.920> take<00:04:14.130> the

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
colors would will actually take the

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.759 
colors would will actually take the
stain<00:04:14.609> differently<00:04:15.389> and<00:04:15.599> it<00:04:16.349> will<00:04:16.440> even<00:04:16.560> give

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
stain differently and it will even give

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.440 
stain differently and it will even give
more<00:04:17.070> of<00:04:17.160> a<00:04:17.190> contrast<00:04:17.729> what<00:04:18.090> you<00:04:18.209> see<00:04:18.419> right

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
more of a contrast what you see right

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.259 
more of a contrast what you see right
there<00:04:18.900> then<00:04:19.799> afterwards<00:04:20.310> I<00:04:20.609> go<00:04:20.760> ahead<00:04:20.880> and<00:04:21.030> I

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
there then afterwards I go ahead and I

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.409 
there then afterwards I go ahead and I
put<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:22.349> locker<00:04:22.740> over<00:04:23.099> top<00:04:23.370> just<00:04:23.880> to<00:04:23.940> seal<00:04:24.240> it

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
put the locker over top just to seal it

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.920
