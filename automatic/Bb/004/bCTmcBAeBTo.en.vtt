00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:13.000
 I'll teach operation 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.340
 of the active cruise control system 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.850
 I'm going to change the screen here, I hope 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.850
 that they see it 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:29.180
 here put speed of 120 we go now 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:32.619
 at 90 kilometers per hour to 86 according to him 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:36.900
 the gps with which we measure 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:40.740
 90 on the scoreboard 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.740
 86 with 5 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:49.710
 86 586 6 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:54.079
 we round it to 90 mark 87 to 90 of 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.079
 market are 87 degrees with the real 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.110
 here is the speed with 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.100
 with the vehicle that precedes us I am 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.199
 lengthening 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.680
 for that low speed now we are going to 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.680
 80 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.860
 and now I 'm shorting it and now it 's accelerating 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.100
 and now I'm going to approach the lines 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.470
 so they can listen so they can hear 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.600
 the noise he makes when one approaches 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.320
 the side lines without putting the 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:37.470
 Real intermittent on the left 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.470
 there is the noise I go to the one on the right 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.440
 and good and noise 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:53.259
 we have 120 in the control system 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.609
 cruise let's go to 86 I'll put 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.609
 intermittent to overtake 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.640
 advance and when I leave behind the 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.640
 truck accelerates well 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:11.280
 it slows us down, it keeps accelerating and 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.280
 we are already 120 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.760
 Now next another car 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.250
 developing 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.350
 I feel now brakes 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.519
 now accelerates 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.010
 and now it's just at speed and it's still 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.010
 behind d 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.020
 the car that precedes us 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.530
 I think when I put on intermittent 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.280
 I start to accelerate even 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.150
 behind the other car then I'm going to 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.430
 have to try again 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.390
 because it has given me the feeling that at 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.579
 put the blinker accelerates given the 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.099
 feeling twice the first I've 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.620
 thought it was chance that same day 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.950
 I was parked away but in 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.860
 this is not 90 see 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.599
 I put the blinker effectively on 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.190
 as much as the intermittent alone 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.400
 start to accelerate 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.739
 it's the first time I see it 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.180
 with this clarity many times there was 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.180
 I doubt if by putting the blinker 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:34.290
 I started him alone accelerating in the 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.750
 mazda6 sure you follow a car you put the 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.570
 intermittent and starts 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.650
 accelerate your approaching even if the 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:46.260
 distance 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:50.989
 I'm going to do it again once we're done 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.989
 near a truck that should go to 90 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.049
 organized leo braking braking 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.360
 Now I'm going to put the blinker 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.360
 we are in your life 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.810
 it quickly accelerates we are 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.820
 accelerating to change and now braking 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.420
 because we accelerate command we approach 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.420
 too 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:33.280
 I like it, I like how it works 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.940
 accelerate system by putting 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.940
 intermittent 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.280
 I had not tried it on any car 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.860
 maybe in some I had it and I did not 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.220
 I have noticed but in this evolves 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.220
 very good
