00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:06.319
 r 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.160
 Yup 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.600
 r 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.620
 I fire today 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:25.970
 This time 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:31.230
 The more we pursue the phenomenon, the more we seek 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:36.600
 I think let's tell about things that go to the end from those seeking 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.550
 It is all right in the word now, so it's okay to finish it 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.879
 Also 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:45.960
 When we ask for the phenomenon too much, we 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:49.870
 It's that there are many I have to say I fit in Dotsubo in even this time 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:56.050
 Though it's such that he himself felt the heat well Well 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:01:01.839
 Or it come occurred experience and what kind of the phenomenon pursue So you Tteyuu phenomenon 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:07.899
 Of over there by saying, for example, Toka will seek a good phenomenon and wonder if this kind of phenomenon does not occur 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:09.890
 It is said that the situation here or something like that will be neglected if you are caught by people 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:15.110
 I really felt this time 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:21.670
 So there is something that we want to ask for the result 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:24.670
 I think there is something to do something like this and seek out the results. 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:31.390
 But the result is 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:37.479
 It is not the end of living now, but that is not the result 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:42.210
 Rather, what kind of consciousness you go here or what kind of moment do you enjoy living ? 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:44.659
 I have to put my mind on my experience 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:49.939
 In search of phenomenon or result 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:55.399
 If you go, the results will come out and you will have a good time inside 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:02:00.380
 The next decline will be decided by that one rejoicing 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:04.099
 For example, a little way in that the phenomenon was not so good 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.680
 I've been depressed and slumped 

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:07.850
 First of all 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.540
 I 'm going to 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:18.680
 It means that you will go in the direction of the cat 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:21.830
 So, rather than relying on the phenomenon or pursuing the phenomenon 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:27.870
 At this moment we will return to consciousness again 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:30.680
 And one by one to experience the experience of this moment 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:36.170
 I think I'm going back 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:40.310
 Ask me who looks just this result because the result to you will not be caught 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:44.590
 Because there is a thing called for seeking the phenomenon 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:50.670
 I'll make it there again or not 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:54.180
 Bringing Consciousness back to the origin Now if you are going to bring it back to here 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:03:00.870
 I wonder if I can work on it again with new feelings 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:04.200
 This is really determined to become seeking also phenomenon that way it is my own experience 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.660
 I felt that say is going more and more away from the result 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:13.320
 So that's not true 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:18.210
 It's about experiencing the reality of here and now and here and now 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:20.920
 I think that it is not good to bring awareness 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:25.220
 Put your consciousness here right now 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:28.370
 The more you look for the phenomenon, the more you look for it 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.820
 It's about getting away from the phenomenon you are looking for 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:38.030
 So rather the phenomenon you are seeking 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:41.350
 Things happen when things are forgotten when you want this to happen 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:47.260
 I think this is not true 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:50.190
 This moment is more than Let's taste the moment in such a thing to us sound both 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.190
 Thank you
