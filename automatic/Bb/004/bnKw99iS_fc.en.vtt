00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.080 
tremendous length in a very bright
future<00:04:08.900> your<00:04:09.900> grandfather<00:04:10.470> used<00:04:11.310> to<00:04:11.430> say<00:04:11.490> that

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
future your grandfather used to say that

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.530 
future your grandfather used to say that
his<00:04:13.020> goal<00:04:13.290> was<00:04:13.350> to<00:04:13.860> have<00:04:13.890> a<00:04:14.400> wine<00:04:15.030> that<00:04:15.060> had<00:04:15.420> the

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
his goal was to have a wine that had the

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.720 
his goal was to have a wine that had the
power<00:04:15.750> of<00:04:15.990> a<00:04:16.049> Pavarotti<00:04:16.709> with<00:04:17.310> a<00:04:17.340> tenderness

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
power of a Pavarotti with a tenderness

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.880 
power of a Pavarotti with a tenderness
of<00:04:17.910> a<00:04:18.000> baby's<00:04:18.299> bottom<00:04:18.480> and<00:04:19.260> I<00:04:19.320> think<00:04:19.380> this<00:04:19.650> wine

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
of a baby's bottom and I think this wine

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.800 
of a baby's bottom and I think this wine
certainly<00:04:20.370> has<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.519> power<00:04:20.910> of<00:04:21.120> a<00:04:21.209> Pavarotti

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
certainly has the power of a Pavarotti

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.720 
certainly has the power of a Pavarotti
and<00:04:21.840> I<00:04:22.019> think<00:04:22.230> it<00:04:22.350> is<00:04:22.440> evolving<00:04:22.770> into<00:04:23.610> that

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
and I think it is evolving into that

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.090 
and I think it is evolving into that
tenderness<00:04:24.150> and<00:04:24.780> silky<00:04:25.260> tannins<00:04:25.470> that<00:04:25.710> is<00:04:25.920> so

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
tenderness and silky tannins that is so

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.940 
tenderness and silky tannins that is so
important<00:04:26.550> to<00:04:26.670> us<00:04:29.840> behalf<00:04:30.840> of<00:04:30.930> my<00:04:31.080> family<00:04:31.260> or
