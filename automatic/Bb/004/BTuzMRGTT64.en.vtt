00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
it's a real simple rhythm it's based in

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.440 
it's a real simple rhythm it's based in
E<00:01:22.050> and<00:01:22.730> I'm<00:01:23.730> gonna<00:01:23.820> break<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.030> down<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.420> you

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:25.980 
okay the first thing about this

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.320 
okay the first thing about this
technique<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.640> there's<00:01:26.910> a<00:01:26.970> little<00:01:27.210> bit<00:01:27.300> a

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
technique is that there's a little bit a

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.790 
technique is that there's a little bit a
little<00:01:27.390> bit<00:01:27.510> different<00:01:27.930> it's<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.170> kind<00:01:28.740> of

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800
