00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.549
 Welcome friends here in the 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.960
 you also experience small neudorf 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:13.080
 already recognize from the 13 and here too 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.630
 now in rs 15 we are represented 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.970
 here are three species of animals so all three did 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.960
 We have three farms here, three villages 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.510
 bg sawmill heater and we have here 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.269
 also two forest areas and over 40 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.039
 Fields but actually with am 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.510
 But the most beautiful is where she is right now 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.550
 I have to test friends 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.620
 it works like burning is interesting 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.140
 But no criticism great and sausage 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.329
 but explore the trees and 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.180
 no trees were taken from the 13th 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.399
 do not think so bad 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:48.870
 this plan map why this is how it looks 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.910
 is really clear but that does 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.530
 Nothing 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.420
 that really looks really good so 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.000
 if you like the lighting 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.879
 change that looks really good of course 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.789
 now we have steamy guys that 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.769
 problem that we unfortunately the trees here 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.729
 to fell as we fell 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.650
 but we would like to have it here though 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.520
 Forest areas as in the north and the south 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.200
 run under friends and have here too 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.810
 The possibility always the same in the bga 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:24.119
 to stop by and also the first work 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.520
 is here sawmill is here and here goes 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.409
 it deserve the bega around here 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.990
 look friends it falls here one 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.079
 special feature on how he does not get me through 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.729
 fossil or phase where we got this new thing 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.799
 can as it's called but it should 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.939
 she pushed her it was just like that 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.619
 does not call it 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.659
 that was so nice we also have the 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.030
 hackschnitzel power plant is clearly here 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.979
 compared to shelters from the sawmill and 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.439
 Personally, I like it that way 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.689
 on the left is the first forest and here you can 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.400
 you might soon see that we 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.190
 here trees can fall 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.320
 it is very good that 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.450
 maybe it's wet again soon 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:09.060
 you do not have to do anything here maybe 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.630
 An Indian doms is not about the trees 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.240
 make 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.130
 it does not do anything here that would be 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.160
 first case that may not be so 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.440
 but we want to see friends 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.160
 here you can maybe only the 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.190
 bigger forest so easy over there 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.650
 but also in the north who was here once 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.030
 clever look vollgas what do we 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.130
 opportunities and accordingly only the 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:37.230
 starts vehicles have is to me very 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:40.470
 like to look in the forest in the north where it 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.750
 yes, it is noticeable that one 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.459
 quite coherent map hamas I like the 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.980
 actually very short singleplayer maps 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.470
 for oldtimer or smaller devices 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.660
 Of course it is quite possible 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.270
 and here it sounded away and come here 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.190
 You also have a nice wood loading area 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.380
 create those are of course not 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.680
 sometimes so bad just throw short 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.019
 look at the map with the growth 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.330
 grades and the fruit so always 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.790
 a lot to do what you grow 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.769
 actually as good as done and we 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.989
 take a look in the city 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:16.019
 vehicles and we have three four 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.900
 tractors so three tractors and 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.940
 front loader 44 tractors zÃ¡mbÃ³ and 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.280
 Of course, then still small accessories 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.850
 actually a lot but then one too 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.640
 a lot of 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.980
 that's actually the name 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:33.060
 actually worry insanity find very well 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:37.890
 So now there can be negative coffers 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:40.530
 mega - dot where is god or something 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.110
 This is an app that is great 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.730
 in singleplayer play where it 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.280
 hopefully the new version will be released 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.959
 it is the version 1.0 here 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.530
 actually everything you need so 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.269
 more 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:57.640
 a lot more could imagine 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:04:00.040
 That's a car from Max Hofmann 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:04.690
 to hear how you are now brazenly wise 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:07.360
 stolen so the device left it is the 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.910
 second one always hopes there so looks 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.030
 As already mentioned, there are quite a few here 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.910
 Doing and living is the biggest thing 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.970
 web so far away from a street he 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:21.400
 that does not matter, it's insane 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.570
 so easy by the small ones 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:28.689
 to drive 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:31.179
 this typically so typical 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:32.769
 small web is actually in itself 

00:04:31.179 --> 00:04:35.679
 So that's what you can do here 

00:04:32.769 --> 00:04:39.519
 any case for thrifty if you are here 

00:04:35.679 --> 00:04:42.069
 through the map then drive so thought 

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:45.129
 already for watching and see you 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:48.699
 then hopefully next time 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:53.439
 again so beautiful maid first friends and 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:54.099
 We ask this is forgotten Rate 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:55.689
 always so accurate 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:57.599
 We will not forget on models 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:59.409
 or is certainly very happy 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:01.329
 suggestions for improvement criticism please 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:02.199
 also like seeing on motor 

00:05:01.329 --> 00:05:04.209
 comments area 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:07.559
 and then we 'll meet as usual 

00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:07.559
 Thanks again
