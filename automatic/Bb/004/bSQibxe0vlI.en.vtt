these so that is why we leased this
because<00:02:17.180> that<00:02:17.209> makes<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.660> most<00:02:17.810> sense<00:02:17.930> for

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260

keep it clean when we turn it in but the

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.210 
keep it clean when we turn it in but the
back<00:04:31.780> seat<00:04:32.020> really<00:04:32.260> is<00:04:32.470> not<00:04:32.650> the<00:04:32.770> largest<00:04:32.949> as

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
back seat really is not the largest as

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.740

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
you can see that that's it about I would

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.520 
you can see that that's it about I would
say<00:04:35.970> probably<00:04:36.970> for<00:04:37.270> my<00:04:37.419> for<00:04:37.960> my<00:04:38.080> height<00:04:38.320> and

room<00:04:42.190> back<00:04:42.370> there<00:04:42.400> I<00:04:42.760> mean<00:04:43.060> this<00:04:43.810> is<00:04:43.990> a<00:04:44.020> very

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
room back there I mean this is a very

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.670 
room back there I mean this is a very
small<00:04:44.650> sedan<00:04:45.210> um<00:04:46.210> so<00:04:46.750> the<00:04:47.110> room<00:04:47.289> really<00:04:47.440> isn't

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
small sedan um so the room really isn't

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.120 
small sedan um so the room really isn't
the<00:04:47.860> best<00:04:47.889> but<00:04:48.639> in<00:04:49.090> her<00:04:49.300> new<00:04:49.419> car<00:04:49.660> she<00:04:50.110> wanted<00:04:50.889> a

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
the best but in her new car she wanted a

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:57.240 
the best but in her new car she wanted a
little<00:04:51.639> bit<00:04:51.729> more<00:04:51.910> room<00:04:52.090> in<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:52.300> back<00:04:56.250> show

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
little bit more room in the back show

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:04.950 
little bit more room in the back show
off<00:04:57.370> the<00:04:57.550> trunk<00:04:57.820> now<00:05:02.849> and<00:05:03.849> this<00:05:04.270> is<00:05:04.419> where<00:05:04.570> one

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
off the trunk now and this is where one

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.710 
off the trunk now and this is where one
of<00:05:04.990> the<00:05:05.139> places<00:05:05.349> where<00:05:05.590> the<00:05:05.710> 3-series<00:05:06.190> really

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
of the places where the 3-series really

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.320 
of the places where the 3-series really
just<00:05:07.720> isn't<00:05:08.590> very<00:05:08.740> impressive<00:05:09.669> I<00:05:10.030> think

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
just isn't very impressive I think

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.240 
just isn't very impressive I think
there's<00:05:10.660> only<00:05:10.750> about<00:05:10.990> 11<00:05:11.380> or<00:05:11.440> 12<00:05:11.500> cubic<00:05:12.099> feet

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
there's only about 11 or 12 cubic feet

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.320 
there's only about 11 or 12 cubic feet
of<00:05:12.310> space<00:05:12.849> here<00:05:13.830> it<00:05:14.830> may<00:05:15.070> be<00:05:15.099> more<00:05:15.460> but<00:05:15.699> to<00:05:16.240> be

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
of space here it may be more but to be

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.909 
of space here it may be more but to be
honest<00:05:16.539> it's<00:05:16.720> not<00:05:16.840> very<00:05:17.050> usable<00:05:17.320> you<00:05:17.560> have<00:05:17.800> I

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
honest it's not very usable you have I

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:19.260 
honest it's not very usable you have I
don't<00:05:17.979> know<00:05:18.130> if<00:05:18.220> you<00:05:18.280> guys<00:05:18.400> can<00:05:18.610> see<00:05:18.789> but<00:05:18.910> the

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
don't know if you guys can see but the

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.379 
don't know if you guys can see but the
wheel<00:05:19.449> wells<00:05:19.720> to<00:05:19.930> cut<00:05:20.110> in<00:05:20.229> over<00:05:20.500> here<00:05:21.240> you<00:05:22.240> have

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
wheel wells to cut in over here you have

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:26.189 
wheel wells to cut in over here you have
this<00:05:22.539> little<00:05:22.780> roadside<00:05:23.740> assistance<00:05:25.050> kit<00:05:26.050> over

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199 
this little roadside assistance kit over

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:31.170 
this little roadside assistance kit over
here<00:05:26.680> and<00:05:26.830> then<00:05:27.460> obviously<00:05:29.849> c-can<00:05:30.849> I<00:05:30.880> get<00:05:30.940> this

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
here and then obviously c-can I get this

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.909 
here and then obviously c-can I get this
up<00:05:31.360> probably<00:05:31.630> not<00:05:31.930> I'm<00:05:32.169> trying<00:05:32.620> to<00:05:32.680> pick<00:05:32.800> that

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
up probably not I'm trying to pick that

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.790 
up probably not I'm trying to pick that
up<00:05:32.979> you<00:05:33.639> have<00:05:33.820> a<00:05:34.510> flat<00:05:35.110> repair<00:05:35.289> kit<00:05:35.650> under

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
up you have a flat repair kit under

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.140 
up you have a flat repair kit under
there<00:05:36.010> I<00:05:36.039> believe<00:05:36.280> because<00:05:36.669> this<00:05:36.820> does<00:05:37.000> have

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
there I believe because this does have

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.540 
there I believe because this does have
one<00:05:37.360> flat<00:05:37.539> tires<00:05:37.810> but<00:05:38.199> just<00:05:38.979> the<00:05:39.099> trunks<00:05:39.310> not

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
one flat tires but just the trunks not

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.200 
one flat tires but just the trunks not
very<00:05:39.789> deep<00:05:40.889> and<00:05:41.889> it<00:05:42.460> doesn't<00:05:42.729> have<00:05:42.910> the<00:05:43.060> split

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
very deep and it doesn't have the split

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.140 
very deep and it doesn't have the split
folding<00:05:43.570> rear<00:05:43.630> seat<00:05:44.050> either<00:05:44.229> so<00:05:45.150> versatility

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
folding rear seat either so versatility

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.210 
folding rear seat either so versatility
wide<00:05:46.270> it<00:05:46.510> was<00:05:46.630> not<00:05:46.810> the<00:05:46.960> most<00:05:47.139> versatile<00:05:47.620> so

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
wide it was not the most versatile so

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.610 
wide it was not the most versatile so
that<00:05:48.849> will<00:05:49.000> be<00:05:49.090> rectified<00:05:49.330> given<00:05:49.990> you<00:05:50.080> are

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
that will be rectified given you are

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.940 
that will be rectified given you are
however<00:05:52.580> overall<00:05:53.540> we've<00:05:53.960> really<00:05:54.770> enjoyed
