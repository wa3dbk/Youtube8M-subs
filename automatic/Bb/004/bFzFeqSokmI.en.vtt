 and in Mexico the humanoid robot was presented to press conference alex horne 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.080
 most advanced in its type of Latin America 

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:16.189
 Dr. Eduardo Valero Mexican scientists from the research center and 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:19.469
 of advanced studies of the national polytechnic institute 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.759
 in collaboration with his team he builds the most advanced humanoid robot in his 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:31.050
 type of latin america called mexico which the mexican robot measure a meter 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.050
 of height and will weigh approximately 10 to 12 kilos 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.220
 You can do activities such as walking, sitting and climbing stairs 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.600
 natural with the passage of time will be able to store experiences and new 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.960
 learnings thus improving their cognitive ability to the degree of reproducing 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.610
 human actions by means of the imitation convention before this great 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.520
 advance doctor eduardo bayro during a press conference mud highlighted

 with which competed as the conda sony among others the tax is 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.100
 find in more will have visions since the elimination came to support the 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.450
 ocular movement with management skills and with eyes 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.650
 objects that appear in your field 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.600
 so recognizing people this week will be provided with sensors 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.750
 touch to explore and recognize objects but here 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.680
 application can have that kind of technological development to life 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.190
 practice of society 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.650

 employees in the ears and eyes 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.950
 of the projects the algorithms and the development and welfare paths in that 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.780
 The titles 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.610
 allows me to transport governments not 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.700
 for example case 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.370
 for watery props 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.570
 Not seeing 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.740
 are two cameras we are not in those elections 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.720
 and also according to 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.550
 he did not cease his functions 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.379
 the air cargo expects this project of robbery mexico 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:10.149
 continuous 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.209
 going forward

 that they revolutionize Anglican as well as lose an opportunity to 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:20.580
 that the country knows that they promote that this scientist supports 

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:25.249
 in mexico some years this institution are the remains 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:27.329
 decomposed 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.950
 and that has to support levels of decisions agreed upon the two 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:36.089
 2 that's what we hope they will support us 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.829
 our posts will solve the problems in the theater in traffic 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.209
 mn in the discussion on pollution 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.489

 is the fight 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.359
 or if he succeeds
