our<00:00:08.189> pool<00:00:10.580> or<00:00:11.580> should<00:00:12.090> I<00:00:12.179> say<00:00:12.450> pools<00:00:12.960> because

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
our pool or should I say pools because

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.640 
our pool or should I say pools because
we've<00:00:13.860> kind<00:00:14.250> of<00:00:14.340> made<00:00:14.580> more<00:00:15.509> than<00:00:15.690> one<00:00:15.839> well

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
we've kind of made more than one well

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.330 
we've kind of made more than one well
you<00:00:16.920> can<00:00:17.100> never<00:00:17.430> have<00:00:17.730> enough<00:00:17.789> balls<00:00:18.359> right

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
you can never have enough balls right

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.450 
you can never have enough balls right
actually<00:00:20.340> that's<00:00:20.760> not<00:00:21.119> always<00:00:21.510> true<00:00:22.460> space

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
actually that's not always true space

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.589 
actually that's not always true space
can<00:00:23.970> become<00:00:24.449> an<00:00:24.570> issue<00:00:28.250> and<00:00:29.250> it's<00:00:29.970> very<00:00:30.480> easy

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
can become an issue and it's very easy

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.010 
can become an issue and it's very easy
to<00:00:31.140> get<00:00:31.289> overcrowded<00:00:32.160> but<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.820> love<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.690> pool

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
to get overcrowded but I love this pool

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.709 
to get overcrowded but I love this pool
because<00:00:34.530> it's<00:00:34.710> flat<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.520> easy<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.969> make<00:00:36.180> plus

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
because it's flat and easy to make plus

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.930 
because it's flat and easy to make plus
it<00:00:37.020> can<00:00:37.140> be<00:00:37.290> large<00:00:37.559> enough<00:00:37.860> for<00:00:37.890> our<00:00:38.250> 18<00:00:38.790> inch

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
it can be large enough for our 18 inch

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.479 
it can be large enough for our 18 inch
dolls<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.390> enjoy<00:00:39.719> most<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.559> our<00:00:40.680> 18<00:00:41.070> inch<00:00:41.219> dolls

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
dolls to enjoy most of our 18 inch dolls

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.209 
dolls to enjoy most of our 18 inch dolls
have<00:00:41.760> cloth<00:00:42.059> bodies<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:43.260> going<00:00:43.680> near<00:00:43.920> any

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
have cloth bodies so going near any

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.000 
have cloth bodies so going near any
actual<00:00:44.820> water<00:00:45.180> it's<00:00:45.870> kind<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.469> out<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.920> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
actual water it's kind of out of the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.569 
actual water it's kind of out of the
question

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.270 

I'm<00:00:50.579> kind<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.850> thirsty

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.180 

but<00:00:56.280> with<00:00:56.640> our<00:00:56.910> little<00:00:57.390> pool<00:00:57.570> water<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.649> not<00:00:59.129> a

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
but with our little pool water is not a

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.400 
but with our little pool water is not a
problem<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.420> dolls<00:01:00.629> just<00:01:00.899> kind<00:01:01.289> of

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
problem and the dolls just kind of

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.609 
problem and the dolls just kind of
flipped<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.129> top<00:01:02.850> well<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.600> guess<00:01:04.140> she's<00:01:04.470> not

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
flipped on top well I guess she's not

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.820 
flipped on top well I guess she's not
really<00:01:04.769> floating<00:01:05.070> right<00:01:05.820> just<00:01:06.150> blown<00:01:06.780> away

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
really floating right just blown away

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.170 
really floating right just blown away
yeah

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
yeah

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.170 
yeah
and<00:01:09.620> since<00:01:10.620> it<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:10.770> flat<00:01:11.340> when<00:01:11.640> playtime<00:01:12.060> is

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
and since it is flat when playtime is

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.500 
and since it is flat when playtime is
over

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
over

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.360 
over
you<00:01:12.960> can<00:01:13.140> just<00:01:13.320> put<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.620> in<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.800> closet<00:01:13.980> or

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
you can just put it in the closet or

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.580 
you can just put it in the closet or
under<00:01:14.940> the<00:01:15.060> bed<00:01:15.180> or<00:01:15.360> something<00:01:15.390> but<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.350> am

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
under the bed or something but I am

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.300 
under the bed or something but I am
always<00:01:16.860> creating<00:01:17.790> something<00:01:18.480> so<00:01:19.440> I<00:01:19.650> needed<00:01:20.160> a

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
always creating something so I needed a

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.790 
always creating something so I needed a
space<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.820> was<00:01:20.970> multifunctional<00:01:21.960> until<00:01:22.710> I

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
space that was multifunctional until I

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.790 
space that was multifunctional until I
talk<00:01:23.040> with<00:01:23.190> my<00:01:23.250> hands<00:01:23.760> a<00:01:23.940> lot<00:01:24.320> children<00:01:25.320> time

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
talk with my hands a lot children time

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.750 
talk with my hands a lot children time
for<00:01:26.250> dinner<00:01:26.520> coming<00:01:27.390> mom

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.540 

so<00:01:33.150> we<00:01:33.300> created<00:01:33.690> our<00:01:33.990> double<00:01:34.590> backyard<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:35.370> our

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
so we created our double backyard in our

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.170 
so we created our double backyard in our
soccer<00:01:36.030> field<00:01:36.450> video<00:01:37.730> but<00:01:38.730> it<00:01:38.850> didn't<00:01:39.060> have

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
soccer field video but it didn't have

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.090 
soccer field video but it didn't have
the<00:01:39.300> pulled<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.900> had<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.530> soccer<00:01:40.770> field

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
the pulled in it had the soccer field

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.210 
the pulled in it had the soccer field
because<00:01:41.550> it<00:01:41.700> was<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.850> soccer<00:01:42.479> field<00:01:42.900> video<00:01:43.410> but

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
because it was a soccer field video but

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.100 
because it was a soccer field video but
what<00:01:44.430> was<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:44.760> incredibly<00:01:45.420> awesome<00:01:45.660> about

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
what was so incredibly awesome about

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.500 
what was so incredibly awesome about
this<00:01:46.229> project<00:01:46.440> is<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.880> soccer<00:01:48.150> field

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
this project is that the soccer field

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.300 
this project is that the soccer field
doesn't<00:01:48.660> have<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.110> stay<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.380> soccer<00:01:49.740> field<00:01:50.070> you

favorite addition the pool and really
we're<00:02:02.580> thinking<00:02:02.910> about<00:02:03.030> making<00:02:03.300> the<00:02:03.540> pool<00:02:03.780> to

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
we're thinking about making the pool to

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.750 
we're thinking about making the pool to
fit<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.200> backyard<00:02:04.650> we<00:02:05.220> thought<00:02:05.460> well<00:02:05.670> we

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
fit the backyard we thought well we

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.340 
fit the backyard we thought well we
could<00:02:05.970> make<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.300> the<00:02:06.420> same<00:02:06.600> as<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:07.050> know<00:02:07.170> the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
could make it the same as you know the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.469 
could make it the same as you know the
first<00:02:07.500> one<00:02:07.800> or<00:02:08.399> we<00:02:08.729> can<00:02:08.880> just<00:02:09.060> make<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.240> a

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
first one or we can just make it a

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.870 
first one or we can just make it a
little<00:02:09.780> different<00:02:10.250> and<00:02:11.250> that's<00:02:11.520> what<00:02:11.640> we<00:02:11.700> did

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
little different and that's what we did

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.960 
little different and that's what we did
here<00:02:12.090> we<00:02:12.240> made<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.600> actually<00:02:12.840> able<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.970> hold

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
here we made it actually able to hold

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.060 
here we made it actually able to hold
the<00:02:15.209> dolls<00:02:15.420> or<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.959> dogs<00:02:16.140> can<00:02:16.350> actually<00:02:16.620> go<00:02:16.769> in

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
the dolls or the dogs can actually go in

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
the dolls or the dogs can actually go in
the<00:02:17.910> water<00:02:18.300> like<00:02:18.989> substance<00:02:19.790> you<00:02:20.790> know<00:02:20.880> you

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
the water like substance you know you

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.150 
the water like substance you know you
guys<00:02:21.180> see<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.480> so<00:02:22.110> we<00:02:22.230> pretty<00:02:22.410> much<00:02:22.500> cut<00:02:22.830> like<00:02:23.010> a

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
guys see it so we pretty much cut like a

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
and spaces he like under his arm water

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.479 
and spaces he like under his arm water
could<00:02:58.200> seep<00:02:58.410> in<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.950> then<00:02:59.040> it's<00:02:59.160> just<00:02:59.250> sitting

surfaces<00:03:40.719> what's<00:03:41.469> really<00:03:41.889> awesome<00:03:41.920> about

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
surfaces what's really awesome about

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.550 
surfaces what's really awesome about
these<00:03:43.030> projects<00:03:43.780> is<00:03:43.900> that<00:03:44.109> since<00:03:44.379> they're

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
these projects is that since they're

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.379 
these projects is that since they're
made<00:03:44.709> of<00:03:44.829> cardboard<00:03:45.129> you<00:03:45.879> can<00:03:45.909> pretty<00:03:46.299> much

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
made of cardboard you can pretty much

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.599 
made of cardboard you can pretty much
make<00:03:46.540> them<00:03:46.900> whatever<00:03:47.260> size<00:03:47.859> you<00:03:48.040> want<00:03:48.250> to<00:03:48.340> fit

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
make it smaller it's really easy to

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.460 
make it smaller it's really easy to
resize<00:03:54.129> using<00:03:54.879> the<00:03:55.030> same<00:03:55.239> instructions<00:03:55.810> and<00:03:56.049> I

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
resize using the same instructions and I

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.199 
resize using the same instructions and I
really<00:03:56.829> like<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.219> way<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:57.489> furniture<00:03:57.969> came

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
really like the way the furniture came

really like the way the furniture came
out<00:03:58.389> for<00:03:58.510> this<00:03:58.659> project<00:03:58.900> it's<00:03:59.680> kind<00:03:59.919> of<00:04:00.010> like

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:00.219 
out for this project it's kind of like

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:04.140 
out for this project it's kind of like
modern<00:04:01.209> or<00:04:01.540> contemporary<00:04:02.939> something<00:04:03.939> that

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
modern or contemporary something that

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.729 
modern or contemporary something that
you<00:04:04.239> would<00:04:04.359> actually<00:04:04.480> probably<00:04:04.930> find<00:04:05.319> in<00:04:05.590> real
