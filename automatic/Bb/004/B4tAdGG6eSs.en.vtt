00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.140
 I read 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.590
 we only wait for the equity manager and 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.590
 safety 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.430
 I think the most important thing to us 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.110
 can do enough to change 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.560
 quite a thing I think it's been a year 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.560
 quite important 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.000
 I think the main change in the 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.369
 lawn, right? 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.450
 We are there, changing the whole lawn of 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.579
 villa belmiro 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.309
 We had a drainage problem. 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:41.260
 of the lawn that it was obstructed by 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.670
 material was used for fertilization and 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.150
 leveling the starting lawn 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.890
 all this material that will redo the 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.199
 lawn of the village Belmiro that will have a 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.269
 a much higher quality approach and with 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.010
 a much more beautiful appearance waits 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:56.780
 that from January 26th 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.059
 The Saints have the best country lawn 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.339
 again the ideal to make the exchange of 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.530
 lawn is every ten years right because 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:05.479
 grass ends up suffering a mutation who 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.909
 come to the village of Belmiro could observe that the 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.159
 lawn had several shades of green on the 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.270
 grasses 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.460
 So we ended up doing 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.270
 this exchange now after 14 years there 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.560
 four years late, but it is thanks to 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.420
 this show that we still made two 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.490
 santana we managed to capture 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.049
 resources to make this exchange in which 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.500
 Saints have to shell out money for 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.500
 do this 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.760
 ended up making the change in the secretary 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.530
 ground floor to facilitate 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.210
 access to the partner is not 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.090
 today has much more direct access to 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.310
 social secretary she is enlarged has 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.320
 much more than 100 service points 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.930
 the partner served more quickly 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.540
 more comfortable without having to enter the 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.520
 administrative inside the club 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.110
 which also generates a benefit for us 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.060
 in terms of safety 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.940
 we had people's access 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.830
 very large on the second floor and today it 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.420
 is restricted to the ground floor, right? 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.280
 people do not need to enter the 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.930
 administrative part of the club only if today 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.690
 that comes on game day too 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.020
 formerly a rather shabby post 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.250
 huh 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.860
 we will be able to meet in maximum 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.570
 two people at a time and the movement in the day 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.370
 of the game is an intense movement that has 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.570
 a member who forgot the card is 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.670
 the one with monthly fees in 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.840
 someone who has not paid the 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.640
 come to pay on the day 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.709
 so we put more 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.810
 service and more 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.130
 fast with more quality for the partner 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.720
 which is no longer a service station 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.370
 but now direct care in the 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.900
 office where we have all the 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.900
 resources that the secretariat has 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.660
 pt the people as soon as we entered 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.340
 ended up making a reform informed 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.770
 all the rooms that had many 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.440
 cracked a painting and all the 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.360
 ct rooms and now in this new stop 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.340
 We are enjoying the countryside and yours. 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.290
 arm which had a very good structure 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.880
 but still shy of the 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.620
 pretensions of the department of 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.720
 physiotherapy and physiology 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.640
 So we're amplifying that weakness. 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.850
 and is also making a 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.720
 kitchen to have a better service to 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.720
 as of 2011 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.710
 the idea of ​​the museum is to make a 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.680
 expansion of the memorial that exists today 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.510
 but the largest modern memorial 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.720
 some technological resources that people 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.510
 does not choose today and the idea is to 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.470
 where today 's gym is located. 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.030
 club 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.550
 but there is also a proposal that 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.490
 is evaluating is between two companies 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.480
 have proposals with us here the people 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.480
 working for the better 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.850
 It has 12 pots where one does not exclude the other 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.490
 which is the renovation and enlargement of the village 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.260
 belmiro and the construction of a new 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.060
 So we're going there analyzing these 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.190
 two areas to see which is more 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.630
 interesting or even a proposal that 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.880
 mix the streets that we can do 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.190
 an evaluation a reform in the queue and 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.480
 build a new stage 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.670
 but this is still a work that still 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.710
 it is very embryonic, we still 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.510
 is evaluating the proposals by 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.370
 we can do what the 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.050
 resources we need then 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.660
 some proposal is still walking 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:06.150
 very slowly but it is a strong desire of the 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.020
 chairman ends the management with a 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.020
 solution mainly
