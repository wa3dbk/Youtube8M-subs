00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.600 
going to rope braid these so in a row
braid<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.199> divide<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.619> into<00:00:31.769> two<00:00:31.980> pieces<00:00:32.160> and

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
braid you divide it into two pieces and

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.400
