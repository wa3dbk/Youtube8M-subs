00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.180 
some rb2 and honestly I really like RV
too<00:02:32.200> even<00:02:33.200> though<00:02:33.319> it<00:02:33.500> doesn't<00:02:33.650> have<00:02:33.800> a<00:02:33.890> story

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
too even though it doesn't have a story

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.589 
too even though it doesn't have a story
mode<00:02:34.370> which<00:02:34.550> honestly<00:02:34.730> is<00:02:35.090> not<00:02:35.120> that<00:02:35.450> much<00:02:35.540> of

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
mode which honestly is not that much of

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.530 
mode which honestly is not that much of
a<00:02:35.780> bother<00:02:35.959> to<00:02:36.110> me<00:02:36.260> I<00:02:36.790> really<00:02:37.790> think<00:02:38.000> it<00:02:38.360> is<00:02:38.510> a

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
a bother to me I really think it is a

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.690 
a bother to me I really think it is a
really<00:02:38.840> good<00:02:39.050> Dragonball<00:02:39.470> Z<00:02:39.620> game<00:02:39.650> like<00:02:40.580> if

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
really good Dragonball Z game like if

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.100 
really good Dragonball Z game like if
every<00:02:40.879> single<00:02:41.180> Dragonball<00:02:41.540> Z<00:02:41.690> game<00:02:41.720> that<00:02:41.989> came

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
every single Dragonball Z game that came

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.770 
every single Dragonball Z game that came
out<00:02:42.319> was<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:43.459> the<00:02:43.580> quality<00:02:44.000> of<00:02:44.090> Raging<00:02:44.360> Blast<00:02:44.450> 2

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
out was to the quality of Raging Blast 2

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.059 
out was to the quality of Raging Blast 2
I<00:02:44.810> think<00:02:45.080> I'd<00:02:45.200> be<00:02:45.349> I<00:02:45.530> would<00:02:45.800> be<00:02:45.890> pretty

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
I think I'd be I would be pretty

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:53.979 
I think I'd be I would be pretty
satisfied<00:02:46.610> with<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.910> series<00:02:51.760> alright<00:02:52.989> he's

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
satisfied with the series alright he's

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.650 
satisfied with the series alright he's
already<00:02:54.200> almost<00:02:54.380> dead<00:02:54.799> I<00:02:55.480> might<00:02:56.480> actually

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
already almost dead I might actually

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.949 
already almost dead I might actually
have<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:57.140> start<00:02:58.000> giving<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.510> characters

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
have to start giving the characters

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.479 
have to start giving the characters
boost<00:03:00.290> and<00:03:00.620> by<00:03:00.739> that<00:03:00.920> I<00:03:00.950> mean<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.340> enemy

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
boost and by that I mean the enemy

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.759 
boost and by that I mean the enemy
characters<00:03:02.060> I<00:03:02.239> remember<00:03:02.959> I<00:03:02.989> used<00:03:03.080> to<00:03:03.349> try<00:03:03.620> and

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
characters I remember I used to try and

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.620 
characters I remember I used to try and
do<00:03:03.920> that<00:03:04.130> but<00:03:04.370> it<00:03:04.459> still<00:03:04.730> wasn't<00:03:05.060> any<00:03:05.299> sort<00:03:05.540> of

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
do that but it still wasn't any sort of

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.259 
do that but it still wasn't any sort of
challenge<00:03:07.329> which<00:03:08.329> is<00:03:08.630> it's<00:03:09.170> dumb<00:03:09.440> because

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
challenge which is it's dumb because

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.360 
challenge which is it's dumb because
like<00:03:11.269> I<00:03:11.420> know<00:03:11.540> that<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:12.290> game<00:03:12.500> is<00:03:12.769> somewhat

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
like I know that the game is somewhat

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.940 
like I know that the game is somewhat
meant<00:03:13.640> for<00:03:13.940> younger<00:03:14.360> people<00:03:15.170> like<00:03:15.380> I<00:03:15.829> don't

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
10 or 11 but this is too easy like even

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.870

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.280 

if<00:03:54.000> this<00:03:54.209> were<00:03:54.300> to<00:03:54.420> actually<00:03:54.780> happened<00:03:55.140> I'm

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
if this were to actually happened I'm

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.960 
if this were to actually happened I'm
not<00:03:55.440> really<00:03:55.560> sure<00:03:55.920> who<00:03:56.160> would<00:03:56.280> win<00:03:56.459> because<00:03:56.640> we

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
not really sure who would win because we

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.430 
not really sure who would win because we
obviously<00:03:57.300> never<00:03:57.690> seen<00:03:57.810> Vegeta

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
obviously never seen Vegeta

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.270 
obviously never seen Vegeta
Super<00:03:59.099> Saiyan<00:03:59.310> 3<00:03:59.400> in<00:03:59.940> any<00:04:00.209> actual<00:04:01.160> Dragon<00:04:02.160> Ball

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
Super Saiyan 3 in any actual Dragon Ball

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.630 
Super Saiyan 3 in any actual Dragon Ball
Z<00:04:02.400> media<00:04:02.700> besides<00:04:02.880> the<00:04:03.209> video<00:04:03.450> games<00:04:03.780> I<00:04:04.640> think

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
Z media besides the video games I think

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.640 
Z media besides the video games I think
that<00:04:05.819> he<00:04:06.120> was<00:04:06.239> Super<00:04:06.569> Saiyan<00:04:06.750> 3<00:04:06.810> in<00:04:07.080> one<00:04:07.260> Dragon

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
that he was Super Saiyan 3 in one Dragon

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.080 
that he was Super Saiyan 3 in one Dragon
Ball<00:04:07.800> Heroes<00:04:09.950> animation<00:04:10.950> but<00:04:11.640> that<00:04:11.910> was<00:04:12.060> just

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
Ball Heroes animation but that was just

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.670 
Ball Heroes animation but that was just
a<00:04:12.300> trailer<00:04:12.540> I'm<00:04:12.780> not<00:04:12.930> really<00:04:13.050> sure<00:04:13.319> if<00:04:13.440> he

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
a trailer I'm not really sure if he

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.259 
a trailer I'm not really sure if he
actually<00:04:13.860> hasn't<00:04:14.250> been<00:04:14.370> Super<00:04:14.640> Saiyan<00:04:14.849> 3<00:04:14.910> I

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
actually hasn't been Super Saiyan 3 I

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.409 
actually hasn't been Super Saiyan 3 I
think<00:04:15.900> he<00:04:16.290> has<00:04:16.850> because<00:04:17.850> I<00:04:17.940> remember<00:04:18.299> there

soo<00:04:31.110> Sun<00:04:31.350> glacier<00:04:31.740> I<00:04:34.190> have<00:04:35.190> fond<00:04:35.400> memories<00:04:35.430> of

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
soo Sun glacier I have fond memories of

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.760 
soo Sun glacier I have fond memories of
glacier<00:04:36.300> mainly<00:04:36.570> because<00:04:36.720> I<00:04:36.900> played<00:04:37.320> a<00:04:37.350> lot<00:04:37.590> of

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
glacier mainly because I played a lot of

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.610 
glacier mainly because I played a lot of
that<00:04:38.310> in<00:04:38.490> the<00:04:38.610> demo<00:04:38.790> when<00:04:39.690> they<00:04:39.870> had<00:04:40.080> the<00:04:40.410> demo

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
that in the demo when they had the demo

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.900 
that in the demo when they had the demo
for<00:04:40.830> Raging<00:04:41.100> Blast<00:04:41.160> so<00:04:41.400> I<00:04:41.430> think<00:04:41.639> they<00:04:41.729> still

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
for Raging Blast so I think they still

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.110 
for Raging Blast so I think they still
have<00:04:42.090> it<00:04:42.300> on<00:04:42.389> the<00:04:42.510> Xbox<00:04:42.750> Marketplace<00:04:44.120> Super

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
have it on the Xbox Marketplace Super

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.930 
have it on the Xbox Marketplace Super
Saiyan<00:04:45.389> 3<00:04:45.419> can<00:04:45.960> do<00:04:46.139> battle<00:04:46.950> between<00:04:47.100> two<00:04:47.490> Super

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
Saiyan 3 can do battle between two Super

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.929 
Saiyan 3 can do battle between two Super
Saiyan<00:04:48.150> threes<00:04:48.540> I<00:04:48.870> can't<00:04:49.350> wait

00:04:52.929 --> 00:04:52.939 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:57.860 

she<00:04:53.939> has<00:04:54.090> a<00:04:55.430> his<00:04:56.430> moveset<00:04:56.669> isn't<00:04:57.090> as<00:04:57.270> different

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
she has a his moveset isn't as different

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.040 
she has a his moveset isn't as different
as<00:04:58.020> you<00:04:58.379> would<00:04:58.469> expect<00:04:58.560> in<00:04:59.039> Super<00:04:59.340> Saiyan<00:04:59.550> 3<00:04:59.639> I

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
as you would expect in Super Saiyan 3 I

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.830 
as you would expect in Super Saiyan 3 I
also<00:05:01.050> don't<00:05:01.620> mind<00:05:02.460> if<00:05:02.639> I<00:05:02.759> actually<00:05:02.969> keep

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
also don't mind if I actually keep

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.600 
also don't mind if I actually keep
hitting<00:05:04.169> LT<00:05:04.560> when<00:05:04.979> I'm<00:05:05.099> trying<00:05:05.249> to<00:05:05.340> charge

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
hitting LT when I'm trying to charge

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:06.800 
hitting LT when I'm trying to charge
it's<00:05:05.819> mainly<00:05:06.060> because<00:05:06.270> I've<00:05:06.509> been<00:05:06.599> playing

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
it's mainly because I've been playing

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.879 
it's mainly because I've been playing
budokai<00:05:07.229> Tenkaichi<00:05:07.349> 3<00:05:08.060> so<00:05:09.060> it's<00:05:09.240> kind<00:05:09.479> of

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
budokai Tenkaichi 3 so it's kind of

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:12.980 
budokai Tenkaichi 3 so it's kind of
tough<00:05:10.889> to<00:05:10.939> transition<00:05:11.939> into<00:05:12.090> hitting<00:05:12.419> down<00:05:12.719> on

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
tough to transition into hitting down on

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.320 
tough to transition into hitting down on
the<00:05:13.199> directional<00:05:14.099> pad<00:05:14.279> so<00:05:15.210> don't<00:05:15.419> mind<00:05:15.629> that

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
the directional pad so don't mind that

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.029 
the directional pad so don't mind that
as<00:05:18.330> I<00:05:18.449> said<00:05:18.629> I<00:05:18.659> am<00:05:18.840> out<00:05:18.960> of<00:05:19.080> practice<00:05:19.259> but<00:05:20.779> yeah

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 
as I said I am out of practice but yeah

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:24.260 
as I said I am out of practice but yeah
scheme<00:05:23.039> is<00:05:23.159> really<00:05:23.370> good<00:05:23.550> though<00:05:23.729> and<00:05:23.939> he's

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
scheme is really good though and he's

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.839 
scheme is really good though and he's
almost<00:05:24.509> dead<00:05:24.960> already<00:05:25.289> well<00:05:25.620> is<00:05:26.370> that<00:05:26.550> half

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:26.849 
almost dead already well is that half

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:30.490 
almost dead already well is that half
health<00:05:27.330> which<00:05:27.779> I<00:05:28.169> don't<00:05:28.770> understand<00:05:29.520> how<00:05:29.699> he's

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
health which I don't understand how he's

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.969 
health which I don't understand how he's
dead<00:05:31.500> so<00:05:31.770> quickly<00:05:32.129> yeah<00:05:32.430> I'll<00:05:32.580> have<00:05:32.789> to<00:05:32.819> start

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:33.979 
dead so quickly yeah I'll have to start

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:39.469 
dead so quickly yeah I'll have to start
putting<00:05:34.979> some<00:05:37.550> I'll<00:05:38.550> start<00:05:38.969> putting<00:05:39.240> some

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
putting some I'll start putting some

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:57.680 
putting some I'll start putting some
items<00:05:39.840> on<00:05:40.080> the<00:05:40.229> enemy<00:05:40.529> characters

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.320 

if<00:05:58.690> there's<00:05:58.900> a<00:05:58.960> lot<00:05:59.110> of<00:05:59.260> damage<00:05:59.440> to<00:05:59.620> him<00:05:59.920> and

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
if there's a lot of damage to him and

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.100 
if there's a lot of damage to him and
now<00:06:01.330> since<00:06:01.690> he's<00:06:02.680> already<00:06:03.040> almost<00:06:03.250> dead<00:06:03.640> I

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
now since he's already almost dead I

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.510 
now since he's already almost dead I
probably<00:06:05.110> used<00:06:05.440> too<00:06:05.710> many<00:06:05.830> super<00:06:06.220> attacks

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
probably used too many super attacks

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.970 
probably used too many super attacks
it's<00:06:06.670> probably<00:06:06.970> why<00:06:07.150> all<00:06:10.080> right<00:06:11.110> and<00:06:11.290> that's

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:11.980 
it's probably why all right and that's

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.470 
it's probably why all right and that's
the<00:06:12.190> end<00:06:12.340> of<00:06:12.430> the<00:06:12.520> fight<00:06:12.730> that<00:06:12.910> was<00:06:13.030> actually

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:13.480 
the end of the fight that was actually

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.750 
the end of the fight that was actually
extremely<00:06:13.900> quick<00:06:14.110> that<00:06:14.320> was<00:06:14.410> six<00:06:14.890> and<00:06:15.580> a<00:06:15.730> half

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760 
extremely quick that was six and a half

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.960 
extremely quick that was six and a half
minutes<00:06:16.530> well<00:06:17.530> not<00:06:17.950> even<00:06:17.980> six<00:06:18.340> now<00:06:18.460> that<00:06:18.880> was

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:18.970 
minutes well not even six now that was

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.040 
minutes well not even six now that was
more<00:06:19.330> almost<00:06:19.660> six<00:06:19.930> and<00:06:19.960> a<00:06:20.080> half<00:06:20.110> minutes<00:06:21.690> Wow

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050 
more almost six and a half minutes Wow

more almost six and a half minutes Wow
so<00:06:23.260> that<00:06:23.410> was<00:06:23.530> quick<00:06:23.980> so<00:06:24.810> well<00:06:25.810> I<00:06:25.840> think<00:06:25.960> is<00:06:26.320> I

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
so that was quick so well I think is I

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.800 
so that was quick so well I think is I
think<00:06:26.620> that<00:06:26.980> maybe<00:06:27.910> Vegeta<00:06:28.390> we'll<00:06:28.480> be<00:06:28.570> able<00:06:28.660> to

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
think that maybe Vegeta we'll be able to

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.230 
think that maybe Vegeta we'll be able to
be<00:06:28.990> Goku<00:06:29.320> but<00:06:29.440> I'm<00:06:29.530> not<00:06:29.680> really<00:06:29.800> sure<00:06:30.240> I've

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 
be Goku but I'm not really sure I've

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.850 
be Goku but I'm not really sure I've
