can you talk to us a little bit about

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:24.109 
can you talk to us a little bit about
your<00:00:22.500> tea<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.250> what<00:00:23.730> makes<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.029> special

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
your tea to the what makes it special

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.589 
your tea to the what makes it special
and<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:25.910> things<00:00:26.910> are<00:00:27.060> tryouts<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.480> be

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
and and things are tryouts it to be

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.779 
and and things are tryouts it to be
interested<00:00:27.929> in<00:00:28.019> okay<00:00:28.919> so<00:00:29.009> the<00:00:29.429> first<00:00:29.640> thing

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
interested in okay so the first thing

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.810 
interested in okay so the first thing
that's<00:00:30.119> most<00:00:30.330> important<00:00:30.839> about<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.589> t2<00:00:32.130> which

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
that's most important about the t2 which

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.680 
that's most important about the t2 which
is<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.770> triathlon<00:00:34.770> specific<00:00:35.399> race<00:00:35.820> shoe<00:00:36.090> from

is a triathlon specific race shoe from
Scott<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.350> actually<00:00:38.149> what<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.180> fantastic

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
Scott is actually what a fantastic

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.529 
Scott is actually what a fantastic
running<00:00:40.469> shoe<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:40.949> quite<00:00:41.910> apart<00:00:42.180> from<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:42.539 
running shoe it is quite apart from the

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:44.209 
running shoe it is quite apart from the
quick<00:00:42.719> entry<00:00:42.899> system<00:00:43.350> which<00:00:43.469> we'll<00:00:43.649> get<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.070> in

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
quick entry system which we'll get to in

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.459 
quick entry system which we'll get to in
a<00:00:44.370> second<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.270> has<00:00:45.449> to<00:00:45.660> do<00:00:45.930> with<00:00:46.199> the<00:00:46.320> ERG

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469

illogic ride midsole technology it's

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.420 
illogic ride midsole technology it's
essentially<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.550> mild<00:00:51.059> rocker<00:00:52.190> geometry<00:00:53.190> to

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
essentially a mild rocker geometry to

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.220 
essentially a mild rocker geometry to
the<00:00:53.519> midsole<00:00:53.910> which<00:00:54.210> allows<00:00:54.539> for<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> much

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
the midsole which allows for a much

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.619 
the midsole which allows for a much
smoother<00:00:56.010> transition<00:00:56.760> between<00:00:57.030> each<00:00:57.300> phase

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
smoother transition between each phase

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
of the running cycles it's a racing

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.000 
of the running cycles it's a racing
plateau<00:01:00.120> at<00:01:00.570> whatsit<00:01:00.870> wing<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.320> added<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.739> size

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
plateau at whatsit wing it added a size

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.580 
plateau at whatsit wing it added a size
nine<00:01:02.550> or<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.269> the<00:01:03.600> size<00:01:03.809> nine<00:01:04.080> men's<00:01:04.350> is

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:04.590 
nine or so so the size nine men's is

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.240 
nine or so so the size nine men's is
seven<00:01:05.369> ounces<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:06.659> extremely<00:01:07.439> light<00:01:07.770> racing

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
seven ounces so extremely light racing

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.490 
seven ounces so extremely light racing
shoe<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.850> actually<00:01:09.180> prefer<00:01:09.840> not<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.140> call<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.439> a

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
shoe I actually prefer not to call it a

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.280 
shoe I actually prefer not to call it a
flat<00:01:10.770> because<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.430> does<00:01:11.640> have<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.390> know<00:01:12.630> quite

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
flat because it does have you know quite

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.440 
flat because it does have you know quite
a<00:01:13.350> good<00:01:13.650> soul<00:01:14.159> structure<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.000> not<00:01:15.240> at

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
a good soul structure to it is not at

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.370 
a good soul structure to it is not at
all<00:01:15.540> flat<00:01:16.070> and<00:01:17.070> therefore<00:01:17.700> feels<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.689> has<00:01:19.350> a

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
all flat and therefore feels and has a

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.590 
all flat and therefore feels and has a
ride<00:01:19.860> very<00:01:20.250> much<00:01:20.490> like<00:01:20.909> you're<00:01:21.119> comfortable

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
ride very much like you're comfortable

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.170 
ride very much like you're comfortable
with<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.350> training<00:01:22.619> shoe<00:01:22.950> but<00:01:23.430> executed<00:01:24.060> in

with in a training shoe but executed in

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.300 
with in a training shoe but executed in
an<00:01:24.299> extremely<00:01:24.689> lightweight<00:01:24.960> package<00:01:25.590> well

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
an extremely lightweight package well

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.740 
an extremely lightweight package well
tell<00:01:26.939> us<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.090> little<00:01:27.180> bit<00:01:27.299> about<00:01:27.540> the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
tell us a little bit about the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.649 
tell us a little bit about the
transition<00:01:28.320> technology<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.119> quick<00:01:30.450> entry

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
transition technology so the quick entry

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.200 
transition technology so the quick entry
system<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.729> very<00:01:33.290> clever<00:01:34.290> design<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.210> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
system is very clever design and the the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.819 
system is very clever design and the the
most<00:01:36.360> important<00:01:36.840> thing<00:01:36.990> about<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.590> it

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
most important thing about it is that it

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.830 
most important thing about it is that it
allows<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.549> shoe<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:40.970> have<00:01:41.970> your<00:01:42.240> lace<00:01:42.479> lace

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
allows the shoe to have your lace lace

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.920 
allows the shoe to have your lace lace
inset<00:01:43.399> exactly<00:01:44.399> how<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.610> want<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.840> know

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
inset exactly how you want it you know

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.109 
inset exactly how you want it you know
fit<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.560> your<00:01:46.590> foot<00:01:46.979> exactly<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.729> then<00:01:48.000> the

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
fit to your foot exactly and then the

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.330 
fit to your foot exactly and then the
upper<00:01:48.360> does<00:01:48.479> not<00:01:48.630> stretch<00:01:49.110> like<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.159> would

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
upper does not stretch like you would

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.639 
upper does not stretch like you would
get<00:01:50.520> if<00:01:50.729> for<00:01:51.149> example<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.570> had<00:01:51.869> stretch<00:01:52.200> laces

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
get if for example you had stretch laces

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.550 
get if for example you had stretch laces
in<00:01:52.680> there<00:01:53.040> so<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.549> have<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.240> upper<00:01:54.990> set<00:01:55.290> and

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
in there so you have the upper set and

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.770 
in there so you have the upper set and
it<00:01:55.979> stays<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.280> way<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:57.360> know<00:01:57.479> for<00:01:57.689> the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
it stays that way you know for the

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.459 
it stays that way you know for the
duration<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.439> race<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.920> then<00:01:59.570> the<00:02:00.570> quick

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
duration of the race and then the quick
