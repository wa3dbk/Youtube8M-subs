00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.800
 wave 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:09.560
 and 8 more kindly than huanchu commenting 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:14.990
 in a new video tutorial he said put 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.970
 our pst to 1080p this is very simple 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.190
 but people are believed to even put it 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.220
 I did not know how to put it in before 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:25.190
 connect the time to record think 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.500
 list but I discovered that it is very very 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.020
 easy so for people who do not know 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.300
 then I leave my tutorial place for 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.320
 people who do not go by the side too 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.660
 but right now I have 576 costs 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.600
 I think that is what I had before 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.880
 ebay looks pretty bad grosso look at me 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.369
 but I will teach how to put 1080p 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.290
 while our TV supports it very 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.290
 fans have to go to the settings 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:58.310
 where can you adjust the screen 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.020
 to dispose the setting would be worth video 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.530
 although it will use and under 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.899
 resolutions would be current 576 pesos with 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.000
 we who are there I have 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.640
 it would cost per terminal component 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.739
 because I'm recording with the cat and this 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.610
 what allows does not allow to measure 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:18.709
 play 3 then you have to leave then good 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.510
 we click there I want to know is 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.090
 select all the functions that 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.700
 admit the TV and well then I my 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.340
 TV supports 1080p because it has there 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.769
 also 70 inches from good in 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.709
 Reviewers the axis is fine and 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:36.310
 he admits it in any position that 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.310
 click there 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:44.659
 may already be of provisions and if the 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.659
 affirmative answer is emotionally 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.670
 and as we give everything to affect and if 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.310
 you want to configure audio settings 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.519
 good that and you but in my case 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:00.540
 of the bng at the end of the voucher we heard 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:02.670
 and as you see our ps3 is exactly 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.620
 the general villegas and when he is now 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:10.349
 same to psn and well I also want to say 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.269
 that in the description of this video by 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.709
 exterminate to try to climb to the maximum 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.530
 possible quality since the other has not 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.209
 could because he did not know well, and a 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.170
 information in the description sorry 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:24.150
 then I will leave my from pst for whatever 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.609
 I want to add idea ps4 which is the 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.590
 himself and a boys well up here 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:31.290
 tutorial video that is very simple but I 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.859
 I know there are people who do not know good until 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.859
 the next
