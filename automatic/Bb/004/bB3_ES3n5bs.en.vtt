00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
going to be implemented or will they be

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.410 
going to be implemented or will they be
in<00:00:25.740> later<00:00:25.949> on<00:00:26.160> or<00:00:26.519> if<00:00:26.640> they're<00:00:26.849> even<00:00:27.060> planned

at<00:00:27.570> all<00:00:27.660> tommasi<00:00:28.650> responds<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.490> things<00:00:30.090> like

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
at all tommasi responds that things like

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.209 
at all tommasi responds that things like
villages<00:00:30.750> need<00:00:30.929> infinite<00:00:31.289> worlds<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:31.980> order

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
villages need infinite worlds in order

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.600 
villages need infinite worlds in order
to<00:00:32.369> actually<00:00:32.759> function<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:34.250> villages<00:00:35.250> will<00:00:35.460> be

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
to actually function so villages will be

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.660 
to actually function so villages will be
coming<00:00:35.850> after<00:00:36.180> infinite<00:00:36.750> worlds<00:00:37.320> now<00:00:38.129> he

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
coming after infinite worlds now he

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.340 
coming after infinite worlds now he
hasn't<00:00:38.940> even<00:00:39.090> really<00:00:39.450> specified<00:00:40.110> when

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
hasn't even really specified when

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.340 
hasn't even really specified when
infinite<00:00:40.860> worlds<00:00:41.129> will<00:00:41.309> come<00:00:41.570> but<00:00:42.570> we<00:00:43.170> can

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
infinite worlds will come but we can

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.799 
infinite worlds will come but we can
expect<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.950> be<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.370> few<00:00:44.789> updates<00:00:45.000> which

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
expect it to be in a few updates which

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.470 
expect it to be in a few updates which
is<00:00:46.050> okay<00:00:46.739> by<00:00:47.219> me<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.520> mean<00:00:47.820> as<00:00:48.030> long<00:00:48.180> as<00:00:48.360> they

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
is okay by me I mean as long as they

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.580 
is okay by me I mean as long as they
take<00:00:48.660> their<00:00:48.840> time<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.230> make<00:00:49.379> sure<00:00:49.410> the

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
take their time and make sure the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.340 
take their time and make sure the
infinite<00:00:50.010> worlds<00:00:50.309> function<00:00:51.020> I'm<00:00:52.020> all<00:00:52.170> right

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
infinite worlds function I'm all right

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.340 
infinite worlds function I'm all right
with<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.730> but<00:00:53.730> uh<00:00:53.930> villages<00:00:54.930> can<00:00:55.230> be

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
with that but uh villages can be

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.560 
with that but uh villages can be
relatively<00:00:56.039> large<00:00:56.550> just<00:00:57.180> like<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:57.510> next

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
relatively large just like this next

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.010 
relatively large just like this next
tweet<00:00:58.020> says<00:00:58.850> well<00:00:59.850> Xbox<00:01:00.420> doesn't<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:00.899> an

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
tweet says well Xbox doesn't have an

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.330 
tweet says well Xbox doesn't have an
infinite<00:01:01.230> worlds<00:01:01.680> but<00:01:01.829> they<00:01:01.980> still<00:01:02.160> have

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
infinite worlds but they still have

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.939 
infinite worlds but they still have
villages<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.149> tommasi<00:01:03.510> responds<00:01:04.320> with

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
villages and tommasi responds with

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.469 
villages and tommasi responds with
something<00:01:05.250> that's<00:01:05.309> extraordinarily<00:01:05.729> logical

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
something that's extraordinarily logical

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.399 
something that's extraordinarily logical
the<00:01:06.930> villages<00:01:07.350> can<00:01:07.560> be<00:01:07.650> quite<00:01:07.890> massive<00:01:08.130> and

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
the villages can be quite massive and

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.500 
the villages can be quite massive and
villages<00:01:10.640> can<00:01:11.640> take<00:01:11.880> up<00:01:12.060> as<00:01:12.180> much<00:01:12.210> as<00:01:12.360> a

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
villages can take up as much as a

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.170 
villages can take up as much as a
quarter<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.320> Pocket<00:01:13.710> Edition<00:01:13.820> world<00:01:14.820> and

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
quarter of the Pocket Edition world and

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.200 
quarter of the Pocket Edition world and
also<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.320> Xbox<00:01:16.770> world's<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.220> much<00:01:17.340> bigger<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:17.970> a

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
also the Xbox world's a much bigger so a

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.370 
also the Xbox world's a much bigger so a
MP<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.470> npc<00:01:20.570> village<00:01:21.570> that's<00:01:21.780> your<00:01:21.990> average

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
MP in npc village that's your average

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.210 
MP in npc village that's your average
size<00:01:22.619> would<00:01:23.460> fit<00:01:23.810> appropriately<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:25.650> an<00:01:25.740> xbox

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
size would fit appropriately in an xbox

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.539 
size would fit appropriately in an xbox
world<00:01:26.520> whereas<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.689> rather<00:01:28.500> large<00:01:28.950> village

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
world whereas a rather large village

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.460 
world whereas a rather large village
would<00:01:30.000> be<00:01:30.920> rather<00:01:32.540> space<00:01:33.540> consuming<00:01:34.290> in

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
would be rather space consuming in

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.640 
would be rather space consuming in
Pocket<00:01:34.950> Edition<00:01:35.090> so<00:01:36.170> they<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.560> have

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
Pocket Edition so they have to have

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.280 
Pocket Edition so they have to have
bigger<00:01:37.920> worlds<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:39.210> might<00:01:39.689> not<00:01:39.810> even<00:01:39.869> have<00:01:40.229> to

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
bigger worlds it might not even have to

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.140 
bigger worlds it might not even have to
be<00:01:40.470> infinite<00:01:40.979> worlds<00:01:41.250> but<00:01:41.369> at<00:01:41.520> least<00:01:41.670> bigger

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
be infinite worlds but at least bigger

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.969 
be infinite worlds but at least bigger
worlds<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:42.750> order<00:01:42.899> for<00:01:43.079> villages<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.649> be<00:01:43.770> there

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
worlds in order for villages to be there

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.030 
worlds in order for villages to be there
so<00:01:44.280> if<00:01:44.549> they<00:01:44.820> attempt<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.299> do<00:01:45.560> bigger<00:01:46.560> world's

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
so if they attempt to do bigger world's

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.850 
so if they attempt to do bigger world's
first<00:01:47.579> then<00:01:48.329> infinite<00:01:49.079> worlds<00:01:49.409> at<00:01:49.560> least

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
first then infinite worlds at least

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.340 
first then infinite worlds at least
there'll<00:01:50.130> be<00:01:50.159> some<00:01:50.399> space<00:01:50.729> for<00:01:51.000> villages<00:01:51.479> all

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
there'll be some space for villages all

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.020 
there'll be some space for villages all
right<00:01:52.500> since<00:01:52.740> last<00:01:53.009> tweet<00:01:53.460> actually<00:01:53.939> has

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
right since last tweet actually has

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.480 
right since last tweet actually has
someone<00:01:54.390> rather<00:01:54.600> special<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:56.009> on<00:01:56.219> that

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
someone rather special in it on that

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.569 
someone rather special in it on that
would<00:01:56.579> be<00:01:56.729> cleo<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.590> one<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.770> people<00:01:59.490> who

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
would be cleo is one of the people who

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.179
