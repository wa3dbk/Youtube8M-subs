00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
mindset but the point is this will be

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.300 
mindset but the point is this will be
comfortable<00:01:27.390> okay<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.799> comfortable

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
and it's a little false step now there's

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.109 
and it's a little false step now there's
a<00:01:31.470> frost<00:01:31.770> step<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.460> if<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.700> watch<00:01:32.909> out

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
every time and Daniel ascends use the

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.440 
every time and Daniel ascends use the
false<00:01:40.409> step<00:01:40.680> at<00:01:40.890> times<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.060> point<00:01:42.329> is

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
false step at times so the point is

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.109 
false step at times so the point is
people<00:01:43.320> would<00:01:43.649> possibly<00:01:44.280> say<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.520> it's<00:01:44.880> it's

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
people would possibly say that it's it's

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.450 
people would possibly say that it's it's
a<00:01:45.299> bad<00:01:45.479> technique<00:01:45.869> but<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.140> point<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:47.220> gets

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
a bad technique but the point is it gets

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.429 
a bad technique but the point is it gets
the<00:01:47.549> job<00:01:47.579> done<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.810> can<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.409> can
