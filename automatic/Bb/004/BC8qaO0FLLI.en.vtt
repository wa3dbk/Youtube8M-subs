be that future his purpose for the
business<00:01:03.090> was<00:01:03.270> greater<00:01:03.540> than<00:01:03.630> just<00:01:04.020> building

business was greater than just building
a<00:01:04.410> product<00:01:05.240> it<00:01:06.240> was<00:01:06.500> it<00:01:07.500> was<00:01:07.620> to<00:01:07.770> fulfill<00:01:07.950> a

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
a product it was it was to fulfill a

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.730 
a product it was it was to fulfill a
belief<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.210> how<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.450> how<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.170> live<00:01:10.410> your<00:01:10.620> life

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.620 
belief in how you how you live your life
and<00:01:11.160> I<00:01:11.610> think<00:01:11.820> he<00:01:11.880> did<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.180> through<00:01:12.479> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
and I think he did that through the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.100 
and I think he did that through the
business<00:01:14.060> integrity<00:01:15.060> was<00:01:15.420> our<00:01:15.600> first<00:01:15.900> venture
