eight years it's run perfectly fine the
entire<00:00:14.160> time<00:00:14.429> I've<00:00:14.639> had<00:00:14.880> it<00:00:15.089> been<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.780> real<00:00:16.020> good

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
entire time I've had it been a real good

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.150 
entire time I've had it been a real good
quiet<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.529> don't<00:00:16.560> think<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:16.949> did<00:00:17.010> anything

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
quiet I don't think I did anything

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.880 
quiet I don't think I did anything
except<00:00:17.910> replace<00:00:18.570> one<00:00:18.750> CV<00:00:19.170> boot<00:00:19.380> in<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.680> at<00:00:19.859> one

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
except replace one CV boot in it at one

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.439 
except replace one CV boot in it at one
time<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.869> I<00:00:21.869> put<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.350> choke<00:00:22.590> cable<00:00:22.980> on<00:00:23.100> it

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
time and I put a choke cable on it

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:25.550 
time and I put a choke cable on it
because<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.539> was<00:00:24.660> broke<00:00:24.869> when<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:25.109> got<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.410> like

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
because it was broke when I got it like

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.670 
because it was broke when I got it like
this<00:00:25.789> and<00:00:27.080> the<00:00:28.080> one<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.380> put<00:00:28.529> on<00:00:28.590> it

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
this and the one that I put on it

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.250 
this and the one that I put on it
immediately<00:00:28.980> broke<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.699> same<00:00:29.910> way<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.539> it's<00:00:31.170> a

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
immediately broke the same way so it's a

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.930 
immediately broke the same way so it's a
bear<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.529> put<00:00:31.679> on<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.070> didn't<00:00:32.520> replace<00:00:32.759> it

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
bear to put on so I didn't replace it

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.780 
bear to put on so I didn't replace it
again<00:00:33.030> because<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.840> works<00:00:33.989> perfectly<00:00:34.410> fine

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
again because it works perfectly fine

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.060 
again because it works perfectly fine
the<00:00:35.790> machine<00:00:36.540> has<00:00:36.780> eleven<00:00:37.620> hundred<00:00:37.770> and

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
the machine has eleven hundred and

the machine has eleven hundred and
twelve<00:00:38.340> miles<00:00:38.760> on<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.200> so<00:00:40.200> it's<00:00:40.379> fairly<00:00:40.620> low

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
twelve miles on it so it's fairly low

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.350 
twelve miles on it so it's fairly low
mileage<00:00:41.219> especially<00:00:41.610> for<00:00:41.760> two<00:00:41.879> thousand<00:00:42.300> I

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
mileage especially for two thousand I

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.779 
mileage especially for two thousand I
put<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.629> 27<00:00:43.230> mud<00:00:43.469> lights<00:00:43.710> on<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.100> but<00:00:44.370> I'm

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
put the 27 mud lights on it but I'm

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.650 
put the 27 mud lights on it but I'm
keeping<00:00:44.969> those<00:00:45.210> for<00:00:45.480> my<00:00:45.600> next<00:00:45.870> machine<00:00:47.660> you

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
keeping those for my next machine you

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.970 
keeping those for my next machine you
can<00:00:48.780> see<00:00:48.899> it's<00:00:49.050> pretty<00:00:49.230> clean<00:00:49.530> when<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.829> look

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
can see it's pretty clean when you look

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:50.569 
can see it's pretty clean when you look

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
it's like site of an ice machine that's

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.240 
it's like site of an ice machine that's
been<00:01:06.840> real<00:01:07.049> good<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.260> me<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.650> just<00:01:07.979> happened<00:01:08.220> to

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
one so I'm going to park this one out I

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.859 
one so I'm going to park this one out I
will<00:01:14.250> show<00:01:14.400> he's<00:01:14.610> got<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.729> Warren<00:01:15.090> winch<00:01:15.299> on<00:01:15.540> it

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
will show he's got a Warren winch on it

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.170 
will show he's got a Warren winch on it
I<00:01:15.950> had<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.100> racks<00:01:17.340> when<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.640> got<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.000> because

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
I had the racks when I got it because

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.310 
I had the racks when I got it because
they<00:01:18.270> were<00:01:18.360> scratched<00:01:18.689> up<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:19.020> had<00:01:19.200> them

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
they were scratched up I had them

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.060 
they were scratched up I had them
powder-coated<00:01:20.180> wrinkle<00:01:21.180> finish<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:22.320> they've

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
powder-coated wrinkle finish so they've

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.350 
powder-coated wrinkle finish so they've
got<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.250> couple<00:01:23.400> marks<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:23.939> them<00:01:24.060> from<00:01:24.180> carrying

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
got a couple marks on them from carrying

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.679 
got a couple marks on them from carrying
stuff<00:01:24.750> but<00:01:25.049> realistically<00:01:25.740> they're<00:01:26.689> probably

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
stuff but realistically they're probably

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.240 
stuff but realistically they're probably
significantly<00:01:28.320> cleaner<00:01:28.619> than<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.040> vast

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
significantly cleaner than the vast

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.590 
significantly cleaner than the vast
majority<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.759> them<00:01:29.939> out<00:01:30.030> there<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
majority of them out there and the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.749 
majority of them out there and the
finish<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.290> durable<00:01:31.619> as<00:01:31.860> heck<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.310> also

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
finish on it is durable as heck I also

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.280 
finish on it is durable as heck I also
had<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.270> bottom<00:01:33.630> running<00:01:33.990> boards

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
had the bottom running boards

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.590 
had the bottom running boards
powder-coated<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.729> one<00:01:35.939> had<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.150> little<00:01:36.360> ding

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
powder-coated this one had a little ding

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.210 
powder-coated this one had a little ding
in<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.840> when<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:36.960> got<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.590> didn't<00:01:37.979> feel<00:01:38.100> like

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
in it when I got it I didn't feel like

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.590 
in it when I got it I didn't feel like
fixing<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.640> because<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:38.850> wanted<00:01:39.060> like<00:01:39.210> 100
