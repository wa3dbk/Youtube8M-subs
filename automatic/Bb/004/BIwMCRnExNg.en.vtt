hi there are five do your quick Bing I'm

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.610 
hi there are five do your quick Bing I'm
not<00:00:04.830> going<00:00:04.950> to<00:00:05.040> go<00:00:05.730> into<00:00:05.910> too<00:00:06.210> much<00:00:06.240> detail

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:06.620 
not going to go into too much detail

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.490 
not going to go into too much detail
it's<00:00:07.620> just<00:00:08.269> for<00:00:09.269> a<00:00:09.300> plane<00:00:09.660> you<00:00:10.230> want<00:00:10.410> to

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
it's just for a plane you want to

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.629 
it's just for a plane you want to
extrude<00:00:11.040> an<00:00:11.429> edge<00:00:11.870> right<00:00:12.950> so<00:00:13.950> I<00:00:14.040> convert<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.610> a

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
extrude an edge right so I convert to a

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.240 
extrude an edge right so I convert to a
poly<00:00:15.080> you're<00:00:16.080> saying<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:16.890> you<00:00:16.980> when<00:00:17.130> you

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
poly you're saying it you when you

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.460 
poly you're saying it you when you
extrude<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:17.789> from<00:00:18.000> my<00:00:18.119> face<00:00:18.390> it<00:00:18.900> will<00:00:19.109> come<00:00:19.320> out

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
extrude it from my face it will come out

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.160 
extrude it from my face it will come out
like<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.100> it<00:00:20.189> will<00:00:20.250> work<00:00:20.400> quite<00:00:20.670> nicely

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
like that and it will work quite nicely

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.990 
like that and it will work quite nicely
but<00:00:22.170> if<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.560> extrude<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.070> from<00:00:23.340> an<00:00:23.460> edge<00:00:23.609> it

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
but if you extrude it from an edge it

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.720 
but if you extrude it from an edge it
doesn't<00:00:24.480> do<00:00:24.570> anything<00:00:24.840> well<00:00:25.680> there<00:00:26.340> are<00:00:26.369> two

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
doesn't do anything well there are two

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.450 
doesn't do anything well there are two
reasons<00:00:26.760> why<00:00:27.230> one<00:00:28.230> if<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.619> do<00:00:28.769> if<00:00:28.920> i<00:00:29.099> tried<00:00:29.429> to

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
reasons why one if you do if i tried to

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.460 
reasons why one if you do if i tried to
select<00:00:29.880> this<00:00:30.029> edge<00:00:30.240> here<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.630> extrude<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.289> or

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
select this edge here and extrude it or

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.889 
select this edge here and extrude it or
do<00:00:31.650> nothing<00:00:31.859> because<00:00:32.640> it's<00:00:32.969> got<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.600> match

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
do nothing because it's got to match

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.450 
do nothing because it's got to match
it's<00:00:34.230> got<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.440> polygon<00:00:34.950> lee<00:00:35.160> it's<00:00:35.309> got

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
it's got a polygon lee it's got

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.430 
it's got a polygon lee it's got
something<00:00:35.700> on<00:00:35.850> both<00:00:36.059> sides<00:00:36.450> so<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:36.960> can't

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
something on both sides so you can't

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.869 
something on both sides so you can't
extrude<00:00:37.890> from<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.250> won't<00:00:38.430> be<00:00:38.550> able<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.760> pull

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
extrude from you won't be able to pull

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:39.979 
extrude from you won't be able to pull
it<00:00:38.910> up<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.329> won't<00:00:39.420> be<00:00:39.629> able<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.840> put<00:00:39.960> it

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
it up you won't be able to put it

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.590 
it up you won't be able to put it
anywhere<00:00:40.430> but<00:00:41.430> if<00:00:41.550> i<00:00:41.670> grab<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.120> one<00:00:42.300> that's

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
anywhere but if i grab the one that's

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.340 
anywhere but if i grab the one that's
got<00:00:42.750> nothing<00:00:42.809> no<00:00:43.350> reg<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.550> press<00:00:44.879> shift

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
got nothing no reg to it and press shift

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.170 
got nothing no reg to it and press shift
just<00:00:46.350> shift<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.890> then<00:00:46.950> move<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.370> arrow<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:48.030> or

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
just shift and then move the arrow it or

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.940 
just shift and then move the arrow it or
extrude<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.050> can<00:00:49.200> do<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.410> as<00:00:49.500> much<00:00:49.649> as<00:00:49.710> you

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
extrude and you can do it as much as you

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.910 
extrude and you can do it as much as you
want<00:00:50.160> like<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.940> like<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.379> you

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
want like this and like that and you

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.250 
want like this and like that and you

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
really wanted then you can just select

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.410 
really wanted then you can just select
two<00:01:03.690> edges<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.229> bedroom<00:01:04.710> Britta<00:01:05.420> brigham

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
two edges and bedroom Britta brigham

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.219 
two edges and bedroom Britta brigham
whatnot<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.799> know<00:01:07.830> own<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.520> all<00:01:08.670> comes

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
whatnot you know own it and it all comes

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.060 
whatnot you know own it and it all comes
into<00:01:10.229> place<00:01:11.060> right<00:01:12.060> but<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.530> have<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.890> make

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
into place right but you have to make

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.249 
into place right but you have to make
sure<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.729> there's<00:01:14.939> no<00:01:15.210> Polly's<00:01:15.689> there's<00:01:16.110> not

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
sure that there's no Polly's there's not

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.469 
sure that there's no Polly's there's not
a<00:01:16.290> poly<00:01:16.590> on<00:01:16.799> either<00:01:16.950> side<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.759> ugly<00:01:18.240> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
a poly on either side of the ugly the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.570 
a poly on either side of the ugly the
spline<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.140> voice<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.950> edge<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.310> ways<00:01:20.549> that

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
spline of voice the edge of ways that

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.950 
spline of voice the edge of ways that
don't<00:01:20.880> do<00:01:21.090> nothing<00:01:21.330> all<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.570> can<00:01:21.689> do<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:21.930> just

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
don't do nothing all you can do is just

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.010 
don't do nothing all you can do is just
move<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.560> right<00:01:24.409> so<00:01:25.409> yeah<00:01:26.250> I've<00:01:26.820> helped<00:01:27.420> it's

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
move it right so yeah I've helped it's

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.770 
move it right so yeah I've helped it's
just<00:01:28.460> basically<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.670> need<00:01:29.790> an<00:01:30.299> empty<00:01:30.630> edge

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
just basically you need an empty edge

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.850 
just basically you need an empty edge
you<00:01:31.770> got<00:01:31.950> an<00:01:32.040> empty<00:01:32.159> edge<00:01:32.460> then<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.030> can

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
you got an empty edge then you can

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.080 
you got an empty edge then you can
extrude<00:01:34.860> out<00:01:35.100> along<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.549> line<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.970> doesn't

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
extrude out along the line it doesn't

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.550 
extrude out along the line it doesn't
really<00:01:36.299> matter<00:01:36.509> where<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.900> extrude<00:01:37.200> where<00:01:37.439> we

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
really matter where you extrude where we

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.850 
really matter where you extrude where we
extrude<00:01:37.890> up<00:01:38.840> where<00:01:39.840> we<00:01:39.930> extrude<00:01:40.320> off<00:01:40.560> at<00:01:40.740> an

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
extrude up where we extrude off at an

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.340 
extrude up where we extrude off at an
angle<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.490> side<00:01:42.710> you<00:01:43.710> know<00:01:44.689> you<00:01:45.689> extrude

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
angle to the side you know you extrude

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.679 
angle to the side you know you extrude
out<00:01:46.619> here<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.340> then<00:01:47.520> we<00:01:47.880> can<00:01:47.909> move<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.509> and

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
out here and then we can move it and

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.179 
out here and then we can move it and
whatnot<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.290> doesn't<00:01:49.530> really<00:01:49.619> matter<00:01:49.860> as<00:01:50.159> long

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
whatnot it doesn't really matter as long

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.819 
whatnot it doesn't really matter as long
as<00:01:50.490> there's<00:01:50.670> an<00:01:50.759> empty<00:01:51.060> edge<00:01:51.350> is<00:01:52.350> there<00:01:52.530> one

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
as there's an empty edge is there one

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.630 
as there's an empty edge is there one
then<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.820> won't<00:01:54.210> do<00:01:54.420> anything<00:01:55.640> don't

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
then you it won't do anything don't

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.149 
then you it won't do anything don't
think<00:01:57.030> you
