00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
through unless let's say I want to open

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.550 
through unless let's say I want to open
up<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:51.149> App<00:01:51.210> Store<00:01:51.509> I'll<00:01:51.869> do<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.170> hit<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.409> and

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
up the App Store I'll do is hit it and

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.770 
up the App Store I'll do is hit it and
there<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.280> go<00:01:53.399> it's<00:01:53.700> right<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:54.030> there<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.360> think

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
there you go it's right in there I think

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.450 
there you go it's right in there I think
that's<00:01:54.990> probably<00:01:55.229> my<00:01:55.439> main<00:01:55.770> reason<00:01:56.100> but<00:01:56.399> you

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
that's probably my main reason but you

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.060 
that's probably my main reason but you
also<00:01:56.759> can<00:01:57.090> find<00:01:57.270> hidden<00:01:57.750> applications<00:01:58.409> those

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
also can find hidden applications those

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.510 
also can find hidden applications those
just<00:01:59.369> go<00:01:59.610> oh<00:01:59.640> I<00:02:00.000> don't<00:02:00.270> know<00:02:00.540> um<00:02:01.280> let's<00:02:02.280> look

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
just go oh I don't know um let's look

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.980 
just go oh I don't know um let's look
for<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:02.880> pass<00:02:04.850> mm-hmm<00:02:05.939> there<00:02:06.119> we<00:02:06.210> go<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.960> you

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
for it pass mm-hmm there we go so you

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.279 
for it pass mm-hmm there we go so you
can<00:02:07.170> see<00:02:07.350> here<00:02:07.619> this<00:02:07.860> would

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
can see here this would

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
like SB settings you see us right here

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.660 
like SB settings you see us right here
this<00:02:17.269> is<00:02:17.420> as<00:02:17.599> hidden<00:02:17.930> hidden<00:02:18.379> application<00:02:19.040> but

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
this is as hidden hidden application but

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.550 
this is as hidden hidden application but
it<00:02:19.790> normally<00:02:20.269> would<00:02:20.420> not<00:02:20.540> show<00:02:20.780> up<00:02:20.959> but<00:02:21.140> with

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
it normally would not show up but with

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.479 
it normally would not show up but with
the<00:02:21.950> enhancements<00:02:22.790> of<00:02:22.879> spot<00:02:23.239> bright<00:02:23.840> and

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
the enhancements of spot bright and

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.220 
the enhancements of spot bright and
probably<00:02:25.489> messed<00:02:25.700> up<00:02:26.120> bad<00:02:26.450> couple<00:02:26.750> times<00:02:26.989> but

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
probably messed up bad couple times but

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.890 
probably messed up bad couple times but
you<00:02:27.620> see<00:02:27.799> it<00:02:27.950> is<00:02:28.040> right<00:02:28.250> there<00:02:28.280> um<00:02:29.269> you<00:02:29.810> know
