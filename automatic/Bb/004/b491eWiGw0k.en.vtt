other<00:01:14.729> calculator<00:01:15.409> it<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.680> use<00:01:16.890> your<00:01:16.920> number

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
other calculator it you use your number

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.080 
other calculator it you use your number
pad<00:01:17.549> I'm<00:01:18.119> using<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.630> number<00:01:18.840> pad<00:01:19.020> where<00:01:19.200> now<00:01:20.090> you

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
pad I'm using a number pad where now you

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.850 
pad I'm using a number pad where now you
can<00:01:21.270> clear<00:01:21.720> your<00:01:21.750> many<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.470> doesn't<00:01:22.740> have

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
can clear your many it doesn't have

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.590 
can clear your many it doesn't have
memory<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:23.280> there<00:01:23.820> just<00:01:23.939> here<00:01:24.240> I'll<00:01:24.360> blow<00:01:24.509> up

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
memory in there just here I'll blow up

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.370 
memory in there just here I'll blow up
the<00:01:24.750> Vista<00:01:25.110> calculator<00:01:26.810> next<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.080> for<00:01:28.110> a

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
the Vista calculator next to it for a

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.539 
the Vista calculator next to it for a
comparison<00:01:29.900> so<00:01:30.900> with<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.409> one<00:01:31.619> yes<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.189> can

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
comparison so with this one yes you can

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.260 
comparison so with this one yes you can
use<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.909> number<00:01:33.180> pad<00:01:33.710> this<00:01:34.710> one<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.549> can<00:01:36.060> use

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
use the number pad this one you can use

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.390 
use the number pad this one you can use
the<00:01:36.390> number<00:01:36.600> pad<00:01:36.860> but<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:37.890> doesn't<00:01:38.280> have

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
the number pad but it doesn't have

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.300 
the number pad but it doesn't have
memory<00:01:38.610> in<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:38.970> one<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.810> if<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.439> go<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.770> view

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
memory in this one so if you go to view

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.639 
memory in this one so if you go to view
you<00:01:41.880> have<00:01:42.000> standard<00:01:42.570> mode<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.960> scientific

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
you have standard mode and scientific

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.719 
you have standard mode and scientific
mode<00:01:43.850> this<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:45.030> scientific<00:01:45.570> mode<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:46.229> is

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
mode this is scientific mode this is

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.280 
mode this is scientific mode this is
standard<00:01:47.729> mode<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:48.720> one<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:48.990> have

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
standard mode so this one you have

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.609 
standard mode so this one you have
standard<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.280> have<00:01:50.340> scientific<00:01:51.000> mode<00:01:51.619> you

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
standard you have scientific mode you

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.889 
standard you have scientific mode you
have<00:01:52.759> programmer<00:01:53.759> mode<00:01:54.030> which<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.600> all<00:01:54.750> on

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
have programmer mode which is all on

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.319 
have programmer mode which is all on
Beinecke<00:01:55.350> prep<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.399> have<00:01:56.670> statistics

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
Beinecke prep and you have statistics

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.740 
Beinecke prep and you have statistics
mode<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.860> am<00:01:58.860> medium<00:01:59.579> standard<00:02:00.119> mode<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.450> usually

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
mode I am medium standard mode I usually

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.630 
mode I am medium standard mode I usually
use<00:02:00.869> in<00:02:01.049> scientific<00:02:01.619> mode<00:02:01.950> actually<00:02:02.369> because

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
use in scientific mode actually because

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.039 
use in scientific mode actually because
I<00:02:02.759> use<00:02:02.909> trigonometric<00:02:03.450> now<00:02:03.600> in<00:02:03.719> school<00:02:03.960> right

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
I use trigonometric now in school right

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.180 
I use trigonometric now in school right
now<00:02:04.229> um<00:02:05.719> that's<00:02:06.719> it's<00:02:07.200> not<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.530> huge<00:02:08.009> difference

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
now um that's it's not a huge difference

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.949 
now um that's it's not a huge difference
um<00:02:09.709> it's<00:02:10.709> just<00:02:10.860> shortcuts<00:02:11.670> this<00:02:11.970> one<00:02:12.239> you<00:02:12.780> can
