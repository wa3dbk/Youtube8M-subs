inside so that plate was not put on
there<00:01:57.030> for<00:01:57.210> any<00:01:57.360> cracks<00:01:57.689> unless<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.860> crack

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
there for any cracks unless the crack

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.410 
there for any cracks unless the crack
was<00:01:59.189> in<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.369> outside<00:01:59.700> for<00:01:59.850> some<00:01:59.939> reason<00:02:00.270> but

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
was in the outside for some reason but

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.139 
was in the outside for some reason but
there's<00:02:01.380> no<00:02:01.560> crack<00:02:01.829> on<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.100> inside<00:02:02.460> so<00:02:03.060> the

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
there's no crack on the inside so the

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.219 
there's no crack on the inside so the
inside<00:02:03.479> looks<00:02:03.659> great<00:02:05.659> the<00:02:06.659> other<00:02:06.810> cover<00:02:07.049> that

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
inside looks great the other cover that

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.190 
inside looks great the other cover that
we<00:02:07.290> have<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.710> other<00:02:07.890> side<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.340> engine<00:02:09.200> is

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
we have the other side of the engine is

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.900 
we have the other side of the engine is
here

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
here

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.360 
here
this<00:02:12.910> covers<00:02:13.150> up<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:14.230> flywheel<00:02:14.770> and<00:02:15.010> the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
this covers up the the flywheel and the

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.590 
this covers up the the flywheel and the
stator<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:18.040> starter<00:02:18.520> posted<00:02:19.300> that<00:02:19.420> hole

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
stator the starter posted that hole

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.130 
stator the starter posted that hole
towards<00:02:20.170> us<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:22.030> starters<00:02:22.420> actually<00:02:22.720> being

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
towards us the starters actually being

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.900 
towards us the starters actually being
list<00:02:23.350> at<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.560> same<00:02:23.710> time<00:02:23.890> as<00:02:23.950> this<00:02:24.190> another

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
list at the same time as this another

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.270 
list at the same time as this another
option<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:26.080> starter<00:02:26.470> would<00:02:26.620> plug<00:02:26.980> into<00:02:27.010> this

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
option the starter would plug into this

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.940 
option the starter would plug into this
hole<00:02:27.490> there<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.900> once<00:02:29.440> again<00:02:29.560> we<00:02:29.830> have

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
hole there and once again we have

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.890 
hole there and once again we have
another<00:02:30.160> plate<00:02:30.430> here<00:02:30.700> that<00:02:30.820> they<00:02:30.970> they<00:02:31.570> put<00:02:31.780> on

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
another plate here that they they put on

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.100 
another plate here that they they put on
here<00:02:32.170> with<00:02:33.100> j-b<00:02:33.340> weld<00:02:33.490> for<00:02:34.240> extra<00:02:34.510> protection

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.240 

it<00:02:38.110> is<00:02:38.260> i<00:02:38.440> think<00:02:38.470> believe<00:02:38.980> it's<00:02:39.100> when<00:02:39.190> they're

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
it is i think believe it's when they're

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.880 
it is i think believe it's when they're
pretty<00:02:39.490> pretty<00:02:40.030> strong<00:02:40.450> but<00:02:41.350> there<00:02:41.500> are<00:02:41.650> no

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
pretty pretty strong but there are no

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.010 
pretty pretty strong but there are no
cracks<00:02:42.220> on<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.460> inside<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.420> inside<00:02:43.450> looks

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
cracks on the inside the inside looks

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.110 
cracks on the inside the inside looks
good<00:02:44.260> so<00:02:44.500> much<00:02:44.680> my<00:02:45.220> thought<00:02:45.430> was<00:02:45.640> that<00:02:45.700> I<00:02:45.940> don't

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
good so much my thought was that I don't

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.610 
good so much my thought was that I don't
know<00:02:46.210> if<00:02:46.300> anybody<00:02:46.570> would<00:02:46.630> even<00:02:46.690> want<00:02:46.990> this

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
know if anybody would even want this

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.430 
know if anybody would even want this
since<00:02:47.890> it's<00:02:48.040> got<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.280> plate<00:02:48.460> on<00:02:48.550> it<00:02:48.640> but<00:02:49.300> uh

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
since it's got the plate on it but uh

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.990 
since it's got the plate on it but uh
both<00:02:50.440> of<00:02:50.650> these<00:02:50.740> from<00:02:51.280> each<00:02:51.550> side<00:02:51.790> of<00:02:51.910> the

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
both of these from each side of the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.750 
both of these from each side of the
engine<00:02:52.680> both<00:02:53.680> of<00:02:53.830> those<00:02:53.920> covers<00:02:54.280> come<00:02:54.460> with<00:02:54.610> it

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
engine both of those covers come with it

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.890 
engine both of those covers come with it
so<00:02:54.910> that<00:02:55.060> if<00:02:55.180> you<00:02:55.300> do<00:02:55.390> get<00:02:55.510> it<00:02:55.570> you<00:02:55.660> have<00:02:55.870> a

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
so that if you do get it you have a

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.840 
so that if you do get it you have a
matching<00:02:56.140> for<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:56.560> other<00:02:56.680> side<00:02:56.890> but<00:02:57.520> I'm<00:02:57.670> like

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
matching for the other side but I'm like

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.330 
matching for the other side but I'm like
I<00:02:57.940> said<00:02:58.120> they<00:02:58.210> are<00:02:58.240> not<00:02:58.930> cracked<00:02:59.470> or<00:02:59.770> anything

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
I said they are not cracked or anything

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.290 
I said they are not cracked or anything
so<00:03:00.640> this<00:03:01.360> auction<00:03:01.840> is<00:03:01.930> for<00:03:01.990> all<00:03:02.380> those<00:03:02.710> bolts

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
so this auction is for all those bolts

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.460 
so this auction is for all those bolts
