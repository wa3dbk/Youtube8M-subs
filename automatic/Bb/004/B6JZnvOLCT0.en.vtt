00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 hello how about friends layoffs and 19 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.910
 I am 69 and from today I have them 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:14.900
 you the versus between the moi uruguay 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.900
 its beautiful and good let's start 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.120
 in these two cubes the aspect is 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.660
 exactly the same but inside 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:34.610
 they keep many but many differences 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.520
 like for example the car is a thousand times 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.489
 louder than the bag the car has 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.100
 a sound more or less like the funk if 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.940
 three for three version one and the bone 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.559
 it has more or less the sound of a flight 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.950
 The bad thing about good psuv is that it's very 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.260
 slow compared to the 8th last 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.020
 it has such a smooth turn that it is very much 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.670
 more controllable and faster the cutting of 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.940
 corners of the outer layers of the 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.430
 two cubes is identical arrives up in 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.369
 half of the two pieces and when you pass 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.890
 can not anymore the pop in both cubes is 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:13.160
 very difficult but in the bone is more 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.110
 easy to get the jump an inner part 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.360
 centerpieces of both games are 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.190
 almost equal the difference that the 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.690
 side only has a spike that makes it 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.450
 hook better 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.090
 the corners of both cubes have some 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.670
 big differences for example that of the 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.650
 bones are very simple and those of the bear 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.400
 they have many peaks and they have almost no 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.470
 no curves 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.620
 with the edges the same thing happens as with 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.380
 the centers are almost the same only 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.080
 those of the osu have a peak that I know 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.750
 get hooked better on the side so 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.300
 they improved internal parts a lot 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.970
 that now they do not jump at all and as 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:56.250
 we can see on the right those of the bone 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:02:02.410
 are still loose in summary the 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:06.000
 bone is very very stuck very very 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:09.940
 good dry is very soft but very slow 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.330
 then compared to the car the side 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:18.400
 psoe is very loose it is soft but not so 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:20.709
 soft as the bone then for obvious 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.530
 reasons I prefer the south side more than 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.780
 the bone is then to follow everything 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.270
 the video says that I took a lot in 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.140
 upload a new one but you're on vacation 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.120
 then they could not 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.460
 I hope you liked the little hand 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:40.820
 above comment and also comment 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.740
 videos that you want me to do as to 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.970
 recommend or something I already have several in 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:50.150
 mind then if they put more options and 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.390
 so I'll have more this more lives in 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.590
 mind and more videos to prepare and 13 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.590
 see you see us in the next
