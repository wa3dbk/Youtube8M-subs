docked in launch Bay seven if we move
now<00:01:38.149> we<00:01:38.479> can<00:01:38.960> make<00:01:39.049> it<00:01:39.259> so<00:01:39.649> you<00:01:39.710> should<00:01:39.830> be<00:01:40.100> able

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
now we can make it so you should be able

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:45.639 
now we can make it so you should be able
to<00:01:40.310> hear<00:01:40.520> it<00:01:40.580> a<00:01:40.670> little<00:01:40.820> better<00:01:41.000> here<00:01:43.960> and<00:01:44.960> you

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
to hear it a little better here and you

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.230 
to hear it a little better here and you
can<00:01:45.770> also<00:01:45.920> go<00:01:46.220> over<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.490> ramp<00:01:46.729> and<00:01:46.909> turn<00:01:47.090> in

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
can also go over the ramp and turn in

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:59.660 
can also go over the ramp and turn in
there

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.929 

I<00:02:00.049> think<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.229> for<00:02:01.500> nipples<00:02:01.890> waiting<00:02:02.580> for<00:02:02.759> me

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
I think that for nipples waiting for me

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:13.070 
I think that for nipples waiting for me
at<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.299> starship<00:02:11.599> it's<00:02:12.599> always<00:02:12.840> great

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
at the starship it's always great

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.640 
at the starship it's always great
blowing<00:02:13.349> up<00:02:13.470> grunts<00:02:15.110> it's<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.230> little<00:02:16.470> odd<00:02:16.620> but

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
blowing up grunts it's a little odd but

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.140 
blowing up grunts it's a little odd but
I<00:02:16.950> think<00:02:17.130> it<00:02:17.220> turns<00:02:17.430> out<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.730> be<00:02:17.850> one<00:02:18.000> of<00:02:18.030> the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
I think it turns out to be one of the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.360 
I think it turns out to be one of the
biggest<00:02:18.330> Easter<00:02:18.750> eggs<00:02:18.930> in<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.170> game<00:02:19.380> well

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
biggest Easter eggs in the game well

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.959 
biggest Easter eggs in the game well
that's<00:02:20.580> about<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.209> thanks<00:02:21.780> for<00:02:21.900> watching
