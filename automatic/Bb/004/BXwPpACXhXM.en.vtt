16<00:00:28.949> by<00:00:29.099> 9<00:00:29.310> ratio<00:00:29.730> but<00:00:30.300> let's<00:00:30.480> imagine<00:00:30.599> that

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
16 by 9 ratio but let's imagine that

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.760 
16 by 9 ratio but let's imagine that
this<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.470> overkill<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.520> 1280<00:00:33.030> by<00:00:33.420> 720<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.350> I

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
this is overkill to 1280 by 720 and I

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.860 
this is overkill to 1280 by 720 and I
know<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.640> still<00:00:35.880> in<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.120> 16<00:00:36.480> by<00:00:36.630> 9

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
know that this is still in the 16 by 9

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.560 
know that this is still in the 16 by 9
aspect<00:00:37.050> ratio<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:38.219> my<00:00:38.399> view<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:39.000> my<00:00:39.120> camera

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
aspect ratio so my view in my camera

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.170 
aspect ratio so my view in my camera
won't<00:00:39.960> change<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:41.219> let's<00:00:41.370> try<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:42.000> our

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
won't change so let's try it in our

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.680 
won't change so let's try it in our
resolution<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.899> get<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.230> bit<00:00:43.379> 1280<00:00:44.420> by<00:00:45.420> 720<00:00:47.690> but

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
resolution and get a bit 1280 by 720 but

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.020 
resolution and get a bit 1280 by 720 but
we<00:00:49.110> can<00:00:49.289> instantly<00:00:49.890> see<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.309> my<00:00:50.399> view<00:00:50.700> has

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
we can instantly see that my view has

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.720 
we can instantly see that my view has
changed<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.899> appears<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:53.010> I've<00:00:53.250> zoomed<00:00:53.460> in

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
changed it appears that I've zoomed in

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.250 
changed it appears that I've zoomed in
slightly<00:00:54.090> now<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.719> shouldn't<00:00:55.110> have

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
slightly now this shouldn't have

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.229 
slightly now this shouldn't have
happened<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:56.100> let's<00:00:56.280> go<00:00:56.430> back<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.820> see<00:00:56.879> what's

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
happened so let's go back and see what's

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.150 
happened so let's go back and see what's
happening<00:00:57.570> here<00:00:58.199> i<00:00:58.260> am<00:00:58.500> at<00:00:58.649> my<00:00:58.739> original

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
happening here i am at my original

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.000 
happening here i am at my original
resolution<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.910> i'm<00:01:00.270> going<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.449> 1280<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.350> and

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
resolution and i'm going to 1280 in and

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.039 
resolution and i'm going to 1280 in and
press<00:01:02.430> enter<00:01:02.760> now<00:01:03.270> not<00:01:03.480> only<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.840> my

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
press enter now not only is my

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.410 
press enter now not only is my
resolution<00:01:04.650> changed<00:01:05.040> but<00:01:05.309> my<00:01:05.460> film<00:01:05.880> back<00:01:06.119> has

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
resolution changed but my film back has

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.109 
resolution changed but my film back has
also<00:01:06.630> changed<00:01:07.080> it's<00:01:07.770> gone<00:01:07.950> down<00:01:08.130> from<00:01:08.340> 36<00:01:08.909> to

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
also changed it's gone down from 36 to

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.200 
also changed it's gone down from 36 to
24<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.960> if<00:01:10.320> i<00:01:10.439> put<00:01:10.650> 720<00:01:11.310> as<00:01:11.460> my<00:01:11.640> resolution

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
24 and if i put 720 as my resolution

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.260 
24 and if i put 720 as my resolution
height<00:01:13.220> we<00:01:14.220> can<00:01:14.369> see<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.760> film<00:01:15.030> back

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270

also<00:01:15.750> goes<00:01:16.020> down<00:01:16.229> again<00:01:16.380> from<00:01:17.189> 20.2<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.360> 13.5

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
we adjust the resolution the film back

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.910 
we adjust the resolution the film back
adjusts<00:01:41.850> as<00:01:42.000> well<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.990> order<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.409> make<00:01:43.619> sure

that<00:01:46.560> our<00:01:46.680> view<00:01:47.100> stays<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.610> same<00:01:47.880> when

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
that our view stays the same when

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.420 
that our view stays the same when
changing<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.049> resolution<00:01:49.439> we<00:01:49.890> need<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.220> lock

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
changing a resolution we need to lock

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.670 
changing a resolution we need to lock
the<00:01:50.700> aspect<00:01:50.729> ratio<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:52.140> now<00:01:52.320> I'm<00:01:52.380> going<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.560> put

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
the aspect ratio so now I'm going to put

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.319 
the aspect ratio so now I'm going to put
my<00:01:52.710> resolution<00:01:53.399> back<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.700> what<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:53.880> was<00:01:53.970> and

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
my resolution back to what it was and

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.450 
my resolution back to what it was and
now<00:01:54.899> before<00:01:55.290> lowering<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.770> resolution<00:01:56.280> I'm

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
now before lowering the resolution I'm

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.249 
now before lowering the resolution I'm
going<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.729> click<00:01:56.880> this<00:01:57.030> lock<00:01:57.270> icon<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:58.049> lock

going to click this lock icon to lock
the<00:01:58.439> aspect<00:01:58.469> ratio<00:01:58.939> then<00:01:59.939> i<00:02:00.210> can<00:02:00.420> put<00:02:00.600> 1280<00:02:01.020> on

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
the aspect ratio then i can put 1280 on

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.749 
the aspect ratio then i can put 1280 on
one<00:02:01.409> side<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:02.250> other<00:02:02.280> side<00:02:02.460> will

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
one side the other side will

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.600 
one side the other side will
automatically<00:02:03.659> go<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.840> 720<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.369> film

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
automatically go to 720 and the film

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.479 
automatically go to 720 and the film
back<00:02:05.820> will<00:02:06.270> not<00:02:06.600> change<00:02:07.110> leaving<00:02:08.069> me<00:02:08.190> with<00:02:08.369> the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
back will not change leaving me with the

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.490 
back will not change leaving me with the
same<00:02:08.700> angle<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.209> view<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.660> had<00:02:09.869> before<00:02:10.050> if

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
same angle of view that I had before if

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.589 
same angle of view that I had before if
I<00:02:10.950> wanted<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.370> change<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.849> height<00:02:12.239> of<00:02:12.270> my

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
I wanted to change the height of my

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.910 
I wanted to change the height of my
resolution<00:02:13.140> again

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
resolution again

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.250 
resolution again
example<00:02:14.310> 2<00:02:14.430> 1024<00:02:15.180> was<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.390> lot<00:02:15.569> of<00:02:15.599> monitors<00:02:16.080> and

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
example 2 1024 was a lot of monitors and

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.620

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
aspect ratio change it to 1024 and there

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.339
