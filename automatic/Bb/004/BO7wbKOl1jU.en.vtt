like that on our two inside poles we

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:38.830 
like that on our two inside poles we
have<00:03:28.830> a<00:03:28.860> crankbait<00:03:29.460> running

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.420 

approximately<00:03:39.840> 12<00:03:40.260> foot<00:03:40.500> deep<00:03:40.740> and<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.160> crank

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
approximately 12 foot deep and the crank

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.449 
approximately 12 foot deep and the crank
thanks<00:03:41.880> 13<00:03:42.570> foot<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:43.770> right<00:03:43.950> now<00:03:44.100> we're<00:03:44.280> just

thanks 13 foot and right now we're just

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.760 
thanks 13 foot and right now we're just
trying<00:03:44.670> to<00:03:44.700> determine<00:03:44.880> which<00:03:45.750> face<00:03:46.140> they<00:03:46.500> crop

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
trying to determine which face they crop

00:03:46.770 --> 00:04:00.130 
trying to determine which face they crop
back

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.600 

this<00:04:01.140> is<00:04:01.320> our<00:04:01.440> first<00:04:01.620> pitch<00:04:01.950> of<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:02.160> day<00:04:02.370> it

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
this is our first pitch of the day it

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.630 
this is our first pitch of the day it
come<00:04:02.820> off<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.150> cajun<00:04:03.540> cricket<00:04:03.930> stroller<00:04:04.640> it

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
come off the cajun cricket stroller it

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.600 
come off the cajun cricket stroller it
should<00:04:06.000> be<00:04:06.120> running<00:04:06.420> about<00:04:06.690> 12<00:04:06.989> foot<00:04:07.230> deep<00:04:07.610> so

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
should be running about 12 foot deep so

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.040 
should be running about 12 foot deep so
we're<00:04:08.790> going<00:04:08.910> to<00:04:08.970> switch<00:04:09.150> over<00:04:09.420> to<00:04:09.570> some<00:04:09.900> more

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
we're going to switch over to some more

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.330 
we're going to switch over to some more
oranges<00:04:10.530> and<00:04:10.739> our<00:04:10.860> baits

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
oranges and our baits

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.360 
oranges and our baits
and<00:04:11.940> if<00:04:12.360> we<00:04:12.570> can<00:04:12.780> determine<00:04:13.560> that's<00:04:13.920> actually

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
and if we can determine that's actually

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:30.280 
and if we can determine that's actually
where<00:04:14.520> they're<00:04:14.670> wanting<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.000> bike<00:04:15.300> today

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.530 

we're<00:04:31.290> gonna<00:04:31.530> be<00:04:31.650> fishing<00:04:31.890> here<00:04:32.330> we're<00:04:33.330> on<00:04:33.420> the

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
we're gonna be fishing here we're on the

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.440 
we're gonna be fishing here we're on the
Ross<00:04:33.660> Barnett<00:04:33.990> lower<00:04:34.440> lake<00:04:34.970> this<00:04:35.970> is<00:04:36.030> called

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
Ross Barnett lower lake this is called

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.530 
Ross Barnett lower lake this is called
we<00:04:36.780> got<00:04:36.930> Rice<00:04:37.170> Lake<00:04:37.200> right<00:04:37.800> next<00:04:38.190> to<00:04:38.340> us<00:04:38.540> the

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
we got Rice Lake right next to us the

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.320 
we got Rice Lake right next to us the
old<00:04:39.720> river<00:04:39.990> channel<00:04:40.080> run<00:04:41.010> it<00:04:41.190> run<00:04:41.460> into<00:04:41.820> the<00:04:42.000> I

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
old river channel run it run into the I

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.290 
old river channel run it run into the I
guess<00:04:42.750> it'd<00:04:42.900> be<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:43.230> east<00:04:43.800> of<00:04:44.040> it<00:04:44.180> we're<00:04:45.180> going

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
guess it'd be the east of it we're going

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.900 
guess it'd be the east of it we're going
to<00:04:45.390> follow<00:04:45.690> that<00:04:45.870> river<00:04:46.230> channel<00:04:46.770> along<00:04:47.730> the

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
to follow that river channel along the

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.000 
to follow that river channel along the
edges<00:04:48.240> a<00:04:48.270> bit<00:04:48.420> we're<00:04:49.290> going<00:04:49.440> to<00:04:49.560> be<00:04:49.620> fishing

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
edges a bit we're going to be fishing

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.680 
edges a bit we're going to be fishing
there's<00:04:50.220> a<00:04:50.280> couple<00:04:50.610> old<00:04:50.730> lakes<00:04:51.030> in<00:04:51.270> here<00:04:51.450> dog

here's a crankbait somebody lost and the

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.710 
here's a crankbait somebody lost and the
reason<00:05:16.020> they<00:05:16.170> lost<00:05:16.380> it<00:05:16.710> is<00:05:17.700> because<00:05:18.480> they<00:05:18.660> were

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
reason they lost it is because they were

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.480

using<00:05:18.960> monofilament<00:05:19.500> line<00:05:19.920> you<00:05:20.790> can<00:05:20.970> see<00:05:21.150> the

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
using monofilament line you can see the

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.050 
using monofilament line you can see the
line<00:05:23.490> right<00:05:23.790> there<00:05:24.060> and<00:05:25.520> we<00:05:26.520> use<00:05:26.700> braids

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
line right there and we use braids

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.820 
line right there and we use braids
because<00:05:27.360> braid<00:05:27.780> works<00:05:28.110> and<00:05:28.320> straighten<00:05:28.710> those

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
because braid works and straighten those

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.230 
because braid works and straighten those

and at five dollars a crankbait

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.680 
and at five dollars a crankbait
it<00:05:35.220> gets<00:05:35.490> real<00:05:35.700> expensive<00:05:36.060> when<00:05:36.390> you<00:05:36.420> lose<00:05:36.660> a
