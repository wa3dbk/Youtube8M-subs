collection of bee bumble bees I have

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.100 
collection of bee bumble bees I have
through<00:00:08.280> using<00:00:08.820> of<00:00:08.940> artificial<00:00:09.480> nest<00:00:09.690> boxes

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
through using of artificial nest boxes

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.570 
through using of artificial nest boxes
because<00:00:10.590> they<00:00:10.620> are<00:00:10.769> an<00:00:10.860> endangered<00:00:11.099> species

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
because they are an endangered species

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.049 
because they are an endangered species
so<00:00:12.120> I<00:00:12.889> started<00:00:13.889> off<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.250> few<00:00:14.519> years<00:00:14.700> ago<00:00:14.849> with

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
so I started off a few years ago with

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.480 
so I started off a few years ago with
one<00:00:15.089> nest<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.900> then<00:00:16.139> up<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.470> two<00:00:16.680> this<00:00:17.100> year

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
one nest and then up to two this year

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.849 
one nest and then up to two this year
seem<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.180> have<00:00:18.270> nine<00:00:18.480> which<00:00:19.350> has<00:00:19.500> been<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.710> bit

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
seem to have nine which has been a bit

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.800 
seem to have nine which has been a bit
difficult<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.670> get<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.270> point<00:00:21.570> what<00:00:21.779> I

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
difficult to get to that point what I

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.960 
difficult to get to that point what I
have<00:00:21.990> anyway<00:00:22.380> so<00:00:23.010> just<00:00:23.310> have<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.760> little

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970

have anyway so just have a little
looking<00:00:24.210> at<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.449> first<00:00:24.689> three<00:00:25.050> just<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.680> show

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
looking at the first three just to show

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.589 
looking at the first three just to show
you<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.010> position<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.550> them<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.269> boxes

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
you the position of them and the boxes

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.150 
you the position of them and the boxes
itself<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.080> may<00:00:28.199> not<00:00:28.320> see<00:00:28.529> too<00:00:28.740> much<00:00:28.920> activity

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
itself you may not see too much activity

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.959 
itself you may not see too much activity
at<00:00:29.580> first<00:00:29.970> but<00:00:30.150> I'll<00:00:31.109> have<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.289> look<00:00:31.910> this<00:00:32.910> is

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
at first but I'll have a look this is

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.799 
at first but I'll have a look this is
the<00:00:33.270> first<00:00:33.450> one<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:37.399> there's<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.730> speed<00:00:39.390> Queen

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
the first one and there's a speed Queen

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.880 
the first one and there's a speed Queen
just<00:00:40.200> about<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.710> go<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:41.010> she<00:00:41.700> goes<00:00:42.590> miss<00:00:43.590> a

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
just about to go in she goes miss a

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.069 
just about to go in she goes miss a
small<00:00:44.280> speech<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.820> small<00:00:45.090> red<00:00:45.329> tail<00:00:45.539> species

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
small speech a small red tail species

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.670 
small speech a small red tail species
called<00:00:46.620> bombers<00:00:46.950> per<00:00:47.100> tourim<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:48.440> that<00:00:49.440> is

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
called bombers per tourim and that is

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.770 
called bombers per tourim and that is
the<00:00:49.860> easiest<00:00:50.219> one<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.059> will<00:00:51.210> accept<00:00:51.570> an

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
the easiest one that you will accept an

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.560 
the easiest one that you will accept an
artificial<00:00:52.320> nest<00:00:52.530> box

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
artificial nest box

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.130 
artificial nest box
they're<00:00:54.570> quite<00:00:55.079> early<00:00:55.379> species<00:00:55.730> so<00:00:56.730> Queens<00:00:57.149> to

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
they're quite early species so Queens to

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.610 
they're quite early species so Queens to
be<00:00:58.289> out<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:58.680> early<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.100> May<00:01:00.320> the<00:01:01.320> game<00:01:01.500> will

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
be out this early in May the game will

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.840 
be out this early in May the game will
come<00:01:01.739> around<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.129> second<00:01:02.520> one<00:01:02.640> again

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
come around to the second one again

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.509 
come around to the second one again
that's<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.359> same<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:04.110> tourim<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:05.010> not<00:01:05.220> so

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
that's the same the tourim it's not so

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.289 
that's the same the tourim it's not so
active<00:01:05.729> moment<00:01:07.159> as<00:01:08.159> we<00:01:08.310> speak<00:01:08.580> another<00:01:09.000> queen

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
active moment as we speak another queen

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.810 
active moment as we speak another queen
has<00:01:09.479> come<00:01:09.630> out<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.900> first<00:01:10.110> box<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:11.549> third

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
has come out the first box and the third

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.660 
has come out the first box and the third
box<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:13.610> larger<00:01:14.610> ginger<00:01:15.030> species<00:01:16.520> which<00:01:17.520> is

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
box is a larger ginger species which is

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.640 
box is a larger ginger species which is
just<00:01:17.909> workers<00:01:18.270> at<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.479> moment<00:01:18.810> but<00:01:19.110> obviously

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
just workers at the moment but obviously

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.289 
just workers at the moment but obviously
you<00:01:19.950> can<00:01:20.159> see<00:01:20.310> there<00:01:20.490> wasn't<00:01:20.610> many<00:01:20.759> coming<00:01:21.180> in

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
you can see there wasn't many coming in

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.770 
you can see there wasn't many coming in
so<00:01:22.170> if<00:01:22.259> we<00:01:22.380> come<00:01:22.650> back<00:01:23.180> and<00:01:24.180> then<00:01:24.330> go<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.570> the

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
so if we come back and then go to the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.160 
so if we come back and then go to the
middle<00:01:24.900> section<00:01:25.259> just<00:01:26.100> miss<00:01:26.340> ball<00:01:27.170> just

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
middle section just miss ball just

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.830 
middle section just miss ball just
missed<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.590> large<00:01:28.829> worker<00:01:29.280> coming<00:01:29.579> out<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:30.030> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
missed a large worker coming out of the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.690 
missed a large worker coming out of the
center<00:01:31.110> box<00:01:31.380> all<00:01:31.710> these<00:01:31.890> boxes<00:01:32.100> I've<00:01:32.430> made

really now she goes and that box is the
most<00:02:21.480> active<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:22.049> think<00:02:22.080> of<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.530> whole<00:02:22.709> nine

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.630 

and<00:03:15.780> is<00:03:16.050> if<00:03:16.290> you<00:03:16.380> can<00:03:16.560> see<00:03:16.740> closely<00:03:17.100> there's<00:03:17.580> a

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
and is if you can see closely there's a

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.070 
and is if you can see closely there's a
B<00:03:17.850> at<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.240> very<00:03:18.450> entrance

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
B at the very entrance

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.650 
B at the very entrance
now<00:03:19.200> she's<00:03:19.470> Fanning<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.100> best<00:03:20.660> because

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
now she's Fanning the best because

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.360 
now she's Fanning the best because
obviously<00:03:21.840> it<00:03:22.170> gets<00:03:22.440> pretty<00:03:22.800> hot<00:03:23.040> in<00:03:23.190> there

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
obviously it gets pretty hot in there

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.900 
obviously it gets pretty hot in there
and<00:03:23.520> it's<00:03:23.640> pretty<00:03:24.030> pretty<00:03:24.450> big<00:03:24.690> nest<00:03:25.170> anyway

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
and it's pretty pretty big nest anyway

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.550 
and it's pretty pretty big nest anyway
so<00:03:26.910> she's<00:03:27.210> trying<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.630> keep<00:03:27.780> it<00:03:27.960> cool<00:03:28.200> that's

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
so she's trying to keep it cool that's

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.320 
so she's trying to keep it cool that's
how<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.740> work<00:03:28.950> is<00:03:29.130> coming<00:03:29.580> out<00:03:29.700> two<00:03:30.120> more

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
how the work is coming out two more

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.660 
how the work is coming out two more
there

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.550 

she'll<00:03:33.270> spend<00:03:33.510> some<00:03:33.720> time<00:03:33.960> fattening<00:03:34.470> and

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
she'll spend some time fattening and

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.330 
she'll spend some time fattening and
usually<00:03:35.190> she'll<00:03:35.400> end<00:03:35.490> up<00:03:35.640> coming<00:03:36.000> out<00:03:36.090> herself

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
usually she'll end up coming out herself

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.550 
usually she'll end up coming out herself
but<00:03:38.340> it<00:03:39.300> must<00:03:39.510> be<00:03:39.660> pretty<00:03:39.840> packed<00:03:40.230> in<00:03:40.410> there

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560
