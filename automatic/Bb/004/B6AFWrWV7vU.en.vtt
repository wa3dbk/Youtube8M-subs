sight of the block here in one of my
other<00:01:00.840> videos<00:01:01.100> I<00:01:02.100> made<00:01:02.879> up<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.210> fixture<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:04.049> I

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
other videos I made up a fixture and I

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.890 
other videos I made up a fixture and I
cut<00:01:04.769> helical<00:01:05.580> gears<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:09.030> dimensions<00:01:09.659> were

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
cut helical gears the dimensions were

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.649 
cut helical gears the dimensions were
calculated<00:01:10.860> but<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.400> wanted<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.090> make<00:01:12.270> up<00:01:12.479> a

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
calculated but I wanted to make up a

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.620 
calculated but I wanted to make up a
dummy<00:01:12.900> shaft<00:01:13.939> to<00:01:14.939> prove<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.630> everything<00:01:16.049> fit

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
dummy shaft to prove that everything fit

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.080

sixteenths diameter with the other gear

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.649 
sixteenths diameter with the other gear
pressed<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.040> end<00:01:47.250> just<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.820> test<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.479> out

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
pressed on the end just to test it out

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.609 
pressed on the end just to test it out
I'm<00:01:49.520> going<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.670> insert<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.240> into<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:52.259> cam

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
I'm going to insert that into the cam

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.030 
I'm going to insert that into the cam

Hall in the end of the block
I<00:02:04.510> have<00:02:05.510> a<00:02:05.540> mark<00:02:06.050> on<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:07.130> shaft<00:02:07.720> as<00:02:08.720> a

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
I have a mark on the shaft as a

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:16.750 
I have a mark on the shaft as a
reference<00:02:12.820> and<00:02:13.820> you<00:02:14.210> can<00:02:14.420> see<00:02:14.660> as<00:02:14.840> I<00:02:15.110> turn<00:02:15.760> the

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
reference and you can see as I turn the

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.020 
reference and you can see as I turn the
camshaft

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030
