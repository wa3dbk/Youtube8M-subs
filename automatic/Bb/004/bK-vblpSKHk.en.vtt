is going to draw some of the moisture
out<00:01:52.859> of<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.069> fish<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.460> toughen<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:53.909> up<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.179> bit

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
out of the fish and toughen it up a bit

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.510 
out of the fish and toughen it up a bit
ready<00:01:54.569> for<00:01:54.750> smoking<00:01:55.170> but<00:01:55.590> before<00:01:55.950> we<00:01:56.039> smoke<00:01:56.280> it

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
ready for smoking but before we smoke it

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.889 
ready for smoking but before we smoke it
we're<00:01:56.880> going<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.030> rinse<00:01:57.209> that<00:01:57.360> off<00:01:57.600> in<00:01:57.750> some

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
we're going to rinse that off in some

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.440 
we're going to rinse that off in some
cold<00:01:58.110> water<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.799> Pat<00:01:59.039> it<00:01:59.189> dry<00:01:59.310> all<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.299> needs

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
cold water and Pat it dry all it needs

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.870 
cold water and Pat it dry all it needs
now<00:02:00.539> is<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:01.049> little<00:02:01.259> bit<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.469> pepper

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.919 

so<00:02:05.880> those<00:02:06.030> sardines<00:02:06.479> are<00:02:06.630> going<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.840> need

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
so those sardines are going to need

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:08.960 
so those sardines are going to need
about<00:02:06.990> five<00:02:07.709> or<00:02:07.890> six<00:02:08.099> minutes<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.519> cure<00:02:08.759> and

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
about five or six minutes to cure and

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.520 
about five or six minutes to cure and
that's<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.450> perfect<00:02:09.840> amount<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:10.110> time<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.440> make

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
that's a perfect amount of time to make

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.009 
that's a perfect amount of time to make
a<00:02:10.590> quick<00:02:10.829> dressing<00:02:11.450> for<00:02:12.450> this<00:02:12.569> dressing

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
a quick dressing for this dressing

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:14.960 
a quick dressing for this dressing
really<00:02:13.260> simple<00:02:13.739> because<00:02:13.860> we've<00:02:14.069> got<00:02:14.160> nice<00:02:14.459> hot

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
really simple because we've got nice hot

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.330 
really simple because we've got nice hot
smoky<00:02:15.660> fish<00:02:15.959> I'm<00:02:16.500> just<00:02:16.709> going<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:16.920> start<00:02:17.220> with

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
smoky fish I'm just going to start with

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.100 
smoky fish I'm just going to start with
a<00:02:17.430> little<00:02:17.610> bit<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:17.910> red<00:02:18.090> onion<00:02:18.120> chop<00:02:19.019> that

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
a little bit of red onion chop that

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.530 
a little bit of red onion chop that
onion<00:02:19.290> as<00:02:19.530> finely<00:02:20.040> as<00:02:20.459> you<00:02:20.670> can<00:02:20.819> be<00:02:20.910> bothered

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.539 

now<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:24.840> kind<00:02:25.380> of<00:02:25.470> don't<00:02:25.650> want<00:02:25.739> to<00:02:25.920> worry<00:02:26.069> too

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
now I kind of don't want to worry too

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.039 
now I kind of don't want to worry too
much<00:02:26.579> about<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:27.150> stem<00:02:27.420> so<00:02:27.630> I'll<00:02:27.750> get<00:02:27.870> rid<00:02:27.989> of

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
much about the stem so I'll get rid of

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:29.960 
much about the stem so I'll get rid of
some<00:02:28.290> of<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:28.560> but<00:02:28.920> I've<00:02:29.040> left<00:02:29.220> quite<00:02:29.519> a<00:02:29.549> bit<00:02:29.819> on

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
some of it but I've left quite a bit on

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.970 
some of it but I've left quite a bit on
there<00:02:30.209> and<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.660> reason<00:02:30.989> for<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.170> is<00:02:31.470> I'm

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
there and the reason for that is I'm

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.920 
there and the reason for that is I'm
going<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.220> chop<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:32.579> quite<00:02:32.790> finely<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.510> it's

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
going to chop it quite finely and it's

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.319 
going to chop it quite finely and it's
going<00:02:34.079> to<00:02:34.140> be<00:02:34.230> another<00:02:34.560> flavor<00:02:34.920> as<00:02:35.790> well<00:02:35.849> as

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
going to be another flavor as well as

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.190 
going to be another flavor as well as
the<00:02:36.480> leaf<00:02:36.660> but<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.739> flavors<00:02:38.250> really<00:02:38.579> nice<00:02:39.200> and

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
the leaf but the flavors really nice and

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.110 
the leaf but the flavors really nice and
then<00:02:40.349> as<00:02:40.470> we<00:02:40.590> move<00:02:40.620> up<00:02:41.010> into<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.459> leaf<00:02:41.730> of<00:02:41.970> the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
then as we move up into the leaf of the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.210 
then as we move up into the leaf of the
Parsee<00:02:42.569> I'm<00:02:43.440> just<00:02:43.620> going<00:02:43.739> to<00:02:43.769> chop<00:02:44.069> more

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
tin foil lid that will work fine but

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:00.770
