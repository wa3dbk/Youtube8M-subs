00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
hey guys John V from phone reading here

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.160 
hey guys John V from phone reading here
you're<00:00:05.700> watching<00:00:06.060> our<00:00:06.180> video<00:00:06.509> comparison

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
you're watching our video comparison

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.280 
you're watching our video comparison
between<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:07.649> Samsung<00:00:08.220> Galaxy<00:00:08.519> s6<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.750> s6

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
between the Samsung Galaxy s6 and the s6

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.120 
between the Samsung Galaxy s6 and the s6
edge<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.820> galaxy<00:00:12.269> s6<00:00:12.719> has<00:00:13.019> finally<00:00:13.710> arrived

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
edge the galaxy s6 has finally arrived

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.160 
edge the galaxy s6 has finally arrived
but<00:00:14.400> this<00:00:14.549> year<00:00:14.790> there's<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.389> different

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
but this year there's a different

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.380 
but this year there's a different
approach<00:00:16.199> because<00:00:17.010> previous<00:00:17.699> years<00:00:18.029> we've

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
approach because previous years we've

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.570 
approach because previous years we've
only<00:00:18.570> had<00:00:18.810> one<00:00:18.840> flagship<00:00:19.740> smartphone<00:00:20.340> but

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
only had one flagship smartphone but

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.640 
only had one flagship smartphone but
with<00:00:20.730> this<00:00:20.939> time<00:00:21.359> it's<00:00:21.960> going<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.230> be<00:00:22.289> 2

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
with this time it's going to be 2

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.070 
with this time it's going to be 2
devices<00:00:23.039> you<00:00:23.400> have<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.609> standard<00:00:23.970> s6<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.689> of

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
devices you have the standard s6 and of

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.320 
devices you have the standard s6 and of
course<00:00:25.350> it's<00:00:25.619> sibling<00:00:25.859> in<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.310> s6<00:00:26.760> edge<00:00:26.880> now

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
course it's sibling in the s6 edge now

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.269 
course it's sibling in the s6 edge now
they<00:00:27.660> might<00:00:27.869> share<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.199> same<00:00:28.349> hardware<00:00:28.830> so

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
they might share the same hardware so

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.529 
they might share the same hardware so
you<00:00:29.369> think<00:00:29.580> they<00:00:29.699> would<00:00:29.820> perform<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.330> same

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
you think they would perform the same

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.359 
you think they would perform the same
but<00:00:31.109> honestly<00:00:31.560> there<00:00:31.980> are<00:00:32.009> some<00:00:32.189> subtle

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
but honestly there are some subtle

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.190 
but honestly there are some subtle
differences<00:00:32.669> between<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.450> two<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:34.079> we're

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
differences between the two so we're

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.540 
differences between the two so we're
going<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.350> find<00:00:34.469> exactly<00:00:34.890> what<00:00:35.070> they<00:00:35.219> are<00:00:35.340> and

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
going to find exactly what they are and

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.670 
going to find exactly what they are and
how<00:00:35.850> they<00:00:36.030> compare

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
how they compare

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.810 
how they compare
Samsung<00:00:37.680> really<00:00:38.070> hit<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.489> out<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.760> the

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
Samsung really hit it out of the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.240 
Samsung really hit it out of the
ballpark<00:00:39.030> with<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:40.050> redesign<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.829> its

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
ballpark with the redesign of its

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.580 
ballpark with the redesign of its
flagship<00:00:41.940> line<00:00:42.270> there<00:00:42.600> now<00:00:42.780> premium<00:00:43.410> in

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
flagship line there now premium in

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.819 
flagship line there now premium in
nature<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.430> they've<00:00:44.579> shared<00:00:44.879> several<00:00:45.360> common

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
nature and they've shared several common

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.020 
nature and they've shared several common
characteristics<00:00:46.829> for<00:00:46.980> example<00:00:47.039> they're<00:00:47.850> both

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
characteristics for example they're both

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.479 
characteristics for example they're both
constructed<00:00:48.750> out<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:48.960> Gorilla<00:00:49.890> Glass<00:00:50.129> 4

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
constructed out of Gorilla Glass 4

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.670 
constructed out of Gorilla Glass 4
surfaces<00:00:51.000> on<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.239> front<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.660> back<00:00:51.870> we<00:00:52.469> like

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
surfaces on the front and back we like

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.490 
surfaces on the front and back we like
how<00:00:52.860> light<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.760> shimmering<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.960> bounces<00:00:55.320> off

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
how light is shimmering and bounces off

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.569 
how light is shimmering and bounces off
their<00:00:55.770> casings

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
their casings

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.700 
their casings
yeah<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.090> metal<00:00:57.420> trim<00:00:57.660> bezels<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.260> outline

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
yeah the metal trim bezels that outline

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.709 
yeah the metal trim bezels that outline
their<00:00:58.920> sides<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.579> they're<00:00:59.910> pretty<00:01:00.059> compact

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
their sides and they're pretty compact

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.229 
their sides and they're pretty compact
you<00:01:01.350> know<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.949> hand<00:01:02.250> but<00:01:02.730> technically<00:01:03.090> on

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
you know in the hand but technically on

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.390 
you know in the hand but technically on
paper<00:01:03.480> it's<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.140> edge<00:01:04.379> that's<00:01:04.830> actually<00:01:05.309> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
paper it's the edge that's actually the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.250 
paper it's the edge that's actually the
more<00:01:05.519> compact<00:01:06.000> between<00:01:06.420> them<00:01:06.570> but<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.960> the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
more compact between them but it is the

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.440 
more compact between them but it is the
technically<00:01:07.650> thicker<00:01:08.100> than<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.490> standard<00:01:08.909> s6

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
technically thicker than the standard s6

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.480 
technically thicker than the standard s6
now<00:01:10.049> what<00:01:10.200> separates<00:01:10.650> them<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.040> course<00:01:11.250> is

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
now what separates them of course is

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.539 
now what separates them of course is
dual<00:01:11.790> chrome<00:01:12.000> display<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.229> edge<00:01:13.830> now<00:01:14.310> it

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
dual chrome display of the edge now it

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.810 
dual chrome display of the edge now it
just<00:01:14.700> adds<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.330> its<00:01:15.780> already<00:01:16.170> fantastic

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
just adds to its already fantastic

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.100 
just adds to its already fantastic
aesthetics<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.119> has<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.630> know<00:01:18.659> slicker

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
aesthetics it has you know slicker

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.200 
aesthetics it has you know slicker
appeal<00:01:19.619> which<00:01:19.799> we<00:01:19.979> like<00:01:20.159> more<00:01:20.520> but<00:01:21.030> when<00:01:21.119> it

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
appeal which we like more but when it

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.940 
appeal which we like more but when it
comes<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.900> hand<00:01:22.110> feel<00:01:22.320> we<00:01:22.619> prefer

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
comes to the in the hand feel we prefer

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.370 
comes to the in the hand feel we prefer
the<00:01:23.189> standard<00:01:23.460> s6<00:01:24.119> it's<00:01:24.360> by<00:01:24.869> far<00:01:25.170> more

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
the standard s6 it's by far more

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.810 
the standard s6 it's by far more
comfortable<00:01:25.619> just<00:01:25.920> because<00:01:26.250> with<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.670> edge

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
comfortable just because with the edge

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.730 
comfortable just because with the edge
it's<00:01:27.390> kind<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.689> sharp<00:01:27.900> around<00:01:28.049> these<00:01:28.380> sides

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
it's kind of sharp around these sides

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.249 
it's kind of sharp around these sides
here<00:01:29.250> now<00:01:29.850> they<00:01:30.000> share<00:01:30.150> similar<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.810> similar

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
here now they share similar and similar

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.960 
here now they share similar and similar
features<00:01:31.680> too<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.100> have<00:01:32.220> things<00:01:32.460> like<00:01:32.579> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
features too you have things like the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.039 
features too you have things like the
the<00:01:33.720> fingerprint<00:01:34.320> sensor<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:35.130> IR<00:01:35.520> blaster

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
the fingerprint sensor the IR blaster

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.780 
the fingerprint sensor the IR blaster
heart<00:01:37.049> rate<00:01:37.229> sensor<00:01:37.650> built-in<00:01:38.340> wireless

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
heart rate sensor built-in wireless

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.460 
heart rate sensor built-in wireless
charging<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.450> there's<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.810> same<00:01:40.049> exact

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
charging so there's the same exact

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.319 
charging so there's the same exact
things<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.950> get<00:01:41.070> with<00:01:41.340> both<00:01:41.549> but<00:01:42.060> with<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
things you get with both but with the

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.810 
things you get with both but with the
duper<00:01:42.720> display<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.710> edge<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.610> gain<00:01:44.790> a

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
duper display of the edge you gain a

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.460 
duper display of the edge you gain a
little<00:01:45.090> bit<00:01:45.329> more<00:01:45.479> functionality<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.320> way

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
little bit more functionality in the way

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.899

edge so they're both pretty bright and

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.310

easy<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.620> view<00:03:10.770> outdoors<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:12.240> all<00:03:12.630> told<00:03:12.930> we

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
easy to view outdoors and all told we

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.200 
easy to view outdoors and all told we
really<00:03:13.890> love<00:03:14.190> their<00:03:14.400> displays<00:03:14.850> that's

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
really love their displays that's

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.460 
really love their displays that's
another<00:03:15.450> thing<00:03:15.600> that<00:03:15.660> really<00:03:15.990> stands<00:03:16.260> out

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
another thing that really stands out

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.340 
another thing that really stands out
between<00:03:16.800> them<00:03:17.180> now<00:03:18.180> if<00:03:18.570> we<00:03:18.690> look<00:03:18.840> at<00:03:19.020> their

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
between them now if we look at their

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.620 
between them now if we look at their
experiences<00:03:20.250> software<00:03:20.700> experience<00:03:21.240> it's<00:03:21.570> the

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
experiences software experience it's the

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.570 
experiences software experience it's the
same<00:03:21.840> TouchWiz<00:03:22.320> experience<00:03:22.830> on<00:03:22.980> both<00:03:23.220> running

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.000 
on top of Android 5.0 lollipop so the
nice<00:03:27.090> thing<00:03:27.120> about<00:03:27.330> it<00:03:27.660> is<00:03:27.780> that<00:03:27.810> it's<00:03:28.800> more

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
nice thing about it is that it's more

point seven disciples but they pretty

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.580 
point seven disciples but they pretty

the<00:05:45.320> same<00:05:45.710> we<00:05:46.220> wouldn't<00:05:46.460> say<00:05:46.550> that<00:05:46.730> the<00:05:46.940> the

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
the same we wouldn't say that the the

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.620 
the same we wouldn't say that the the
best<00:05:47.570> at<00:05:47.750> that<00:05:48.110> but<00:05:48.410> pretty<00:05:49.160> much<00:05:49.340> average<00:05:49.630> our

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
best at that but pretty much average our

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.330 
best at that but pretty much average our
main<00:05:50.810> concern<00:05:51.200> is<00:05:51.230> just<00:05:51.620> that<00:05:51.800> there's<00:05:52.250> a

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
main concern is just that there's a

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.790 
main concern is just that there's a
little<00:05:52.520> bit<00:05:52.610> of<00:05:52.700> a<00:05:53.020> hysteresis<00:05:54.020> through<00:05:54.560> the

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
little bit of a hysteresis through the

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.070 
little bit of a hysteresis through the
earpiece<00:05:55.070> and<00:05:55.820> when<00:05:56.450> comes<00:05:56.630> to<00:05:56.660> battery<00:05:56.900> life

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
earpiece and when comes to battery life

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.050 
earpiece and when comes to battery life
now<00:05:58.010> this<00:05:58.250> is<00:05:58.400> kind<00:05:58.580> of<00:05:58.610> interesting<00:05:58.940> we

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
now this is kind of interesting we

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.450 
now this is kind of interesting we
managed<00:05:59.480> to<00:05:59.510> get<00:05:59.990> easily<00:06:00.530> a<00:06:00.560> day<00:06:00.920> out<00:06:01.160> of<00:06:01.310> both

standard s6 now in our battery benchmark
test<00:06:14.210> it's<00:06:14.570> kind<00:06:14.780> of<00:06:14.870> interesting<00:06:15.350> just

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
test it's kind of interesting just

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.010 
test it's kind of interesting just
because<00:06:15.770> the<00:06:16.310> Essex<00:06:16.790> returned<00:06:17.120> a<00:06:17.150> mark<00:06:17.480> of<00:06:17.630> 7

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
because the Essex returned a mark of 7

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.770 
because the Essex returned a mark of 7
hours<00:06:18.140> and<00:06:18.410> 14<00:06:18.770> minutes<00:06:18.820> whereas<00:06:19.820> with<00:06:20.150> the<00:06:20.360> s6

hours<00:06:23.570> and<00:06:23.810> 11<00:06:24.290> minutes<00:06:24.320> so<00:06:24.770> a<00:06:24.800> full<00:06:25.040> hour<00:06:25.280> now

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850 
hours and 11 minutes so a full hour now

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.430 
hours and 11 minutes so a full hour now
we<00:06:25.880> got<00:06:26.120> to<00:06:26.270> say<00:06:26.420> that<00:06:26.600> we<00:06:26.720> ran<00:06:26.990> the<00:06:27.140> test

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 
we got to say that we ran the test

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.220 
we got to say that we ran the test
because<00:06:27.830> the<00:06:28.070> edge<00:06:28.370> can't<00:06:29.210> be<00:06:29.390> placed<00:06:29.690> at<00:06:29.840> 200

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:30.230 
because the edge can't be placed at 200

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.980 
because the edge can't be placed at 200
it's<00:06:30.440> at<00:06:30.620> a<00:06:30.680> manual<00:06:31.460> setting<00:06:31.670> we<00:06:32.480> had<00:06:32.630> to<00:06:32.810> test

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:32.990 
it's at a manual setting we had to test

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.350 
it's at a manual setting we had to test
it<00:06:33.110> out<00:06:33.230> inlaid<00:06:33.650> 180<00:06:34.220> nets<00:06:34.520> whereas<00:06:35.030> with<00:06:35.270> the

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 
it out inlaid 180 nets whereas with the

s6 it was tested with the screen set to
200<00:06:38.750> nits<00:06:38.930> so<00:06:39.140> that<00:06:39.320> could<00:06:39.500> be<00:06:39.530> a<00:06:39.650> little<00:06:40.010> bit

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650 
200 nits so that could be a little bit

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.340 
200 nits so that could be a little bit
discrepancy<00:06:41.490> with<00:06:41.970> the<00:06:42.090> results<00:06:42.570> but<00:06:42.960> still

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:43.350 
discrepancy with the results but still

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.469 
discrepancy with the results but still
you<00:06:43.680> know<00:06:43.770> pretty<00:06:44.040> good<00:06:44.100> battery<00:06:44.610> life<00:06:44.639> or<00:06:44.790> you

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479 
you know pretty good battery life or you

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:48.140 
you know pretty good battery life or you
know<00:06:45.509> what<00:06:45.780> they<00:06:45.930> offer<00:06:46.169> a<00:06:46.350> type<00:06:46.590> of<00:06:46.620> specs<00:06:47.150> so

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
know what they offer a type of specs so

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.210 
know what they offer a type of specs so
here<00:06:48.300> in<00:06:48.389> the<00:06:48.479> US<00:06:48.750> the<00:06:49.020> pricing<00:06:49.500> structure<00:06:49.770> for

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:52.410 
the galaxy s6 line is a little bit we

the galaxy s6 line is a little bit we
are<00:06:52.440> depending<00:06:52.949> on<00:06:53.039> you<00:06:53.160> go<00:06:53.310> to<00:06:53.370> your<00:06:53.880> on

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:53.940 
are depending on you go to your on

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.939 
are depending on you go to your on
t-mobile<00:06:54.300> you're<00:06:54.900> lucky<00:06:55.139> because<00:06:55.590> it<00:06:55.770> looks

00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:55.949 
t-mobile you're lucky because it looks

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:58.340 
t-mobile you're lucky because it looks
like<00:06:56.160> both<00:06:56.430> handsets<00:06:57.030> are<00:06:57.180> priced<00:06:57.660> identical

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:58.350 
like both handsets are priced identical

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.159 
like both handsets are priced identical
so<00:06:58.680> that's<00:06:59.130> great<00:06:59.400> for<00:06:59.729> customers<00:07:00.570> but<00:07:01.110> in

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:01.169 
so that's great for customers but in

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:03.439 
so that's great for customers but in
other<00:07:01.320> carriers<00:07:01.800> like<00:07:02.009> AT&amp;T<00:07:02.400> Sprint<00:07:03.060> and

other carriers like AT&amp;T Sprint and
Verizon<00:07:03.740> there<00:07:04.740> could<00:07:04.889> be<00:07:04.919> a<00:07:05.009> little<00:07:05.400> bit<00:07:05.520> of<00:07:05.610> a

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:05.669 
Verizon there could be a little bit of a

Verizon there could be a little bit of a
difference<00:07:05.970> in<00:07:06.120> price<00:07:06.300> point<00:07:06.600> or<00:07:06.750> something

difference in price point or something

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.560
