00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
you'll see a little bit of a gap coming

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.100 
you'll see a little bit of a gap coming
to<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.840> window<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.229> your<00:01:13.439> stop<00:01:14.869> that<00:01:15.869> gap

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
to the window and your stop that gap

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.789 
to the window and your stop that gap
show<00:01:16.320> up<00:01:17.060> so<00:01:18.060> our<00:01:18.180> first<00:01:18.630> number<00:01:18.810> 36

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
show up so our first number 36

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.550 
show up so our first number 36
it's<00:01:20.460> right<00:01:20.610> down<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.820> 36<00:01:21.270> for<00:01:21.420> now<00:01:21.540> it's<00:01:22.500> a

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
it's right down to 36 for now it's a

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.920 
it's right down to 36 for now it's a
dial<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.860> second<00:01:23.220> one<00:01:23.369> into<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.240> combination

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
dial the second one into the combination

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.030 
dial the second one into the combination
we<00:01:25.080> keep<00:01:25.290> looking<00:01:25.590> through<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.770> window

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
we keep looking through the window

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.320 
we keep looking through the window
you'll<00:01:26.250> look<00:01:26.310> for<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.610> middle<00:01:26.790> one<00:01:26.939> in<00:01:27.150> there

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
you'll look for the middle one in there

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.950 
you'll look for the middle one in there
and<00:01:27.860> you'll<00:01:28.860> just<00:01:29.100> keep<00:01:29.369> turning<00:01:29.610> over<00:01:30.090> just

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
and you'll just keep turning over just

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.890 
and you'll just keep turning over just
keep<00:01:31.170> track<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:35.150> second<00:01:36.150> number<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.420> at<00:01:36.509> 18

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
keep track of it second number is at 18

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.520 
keep track of it second number is at 18
so<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.590> far<00:01:37.740> we<00:01:37.890> have<00:01:37.920> 36<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.759> 18<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.259> then<00:01:40.259> to

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
so so far we have 36 and 18 and then to

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.219 
so so far we have 36 and 18 and then to
the<00:01:40.619> last<00:01:40.829> one<00:01:41.600> dial<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.750> in<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.049> right

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
the last one dial it in to the right

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.789 
the last one dial it in to the right
like<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.590> normally<00:01:43.770> would<00:01:43.950> again<00:01:45.799> see

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
like you normally would again see

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.289 
like you normally would again see
they're<00:01:47.159> all<00:01:47.250> lined<00:01:47.520> up<00:01:47.700> right<00:01:47.909> there<00:01:48.180> now

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.660 

there<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.509> right<00:01:54.750> there

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
there it is right there

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.469 
there it is right there
see<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.820> gap<00:01:57.320> slide<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.439> past<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.740> window

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
see that gap slide it past the window

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.590 
see that gap slide it past the window
that's<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:01.460> 28th<00:02:02.460> marker<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.000> then<00:02:03.119> comes<00:02:03.390> in

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
that's the 28th marker and then comes in

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.980 
that's the 28th marker and then comes in
the<00:02:03.899> minus<00:02:04.740> 14<00:02:05.159> rule<00:02:05.399> not<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.119> minus<00:02:06.390> 14<00:02:06.750> rule

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
the minus 14 rule not the minus 14 rule

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.300 
the minus 14 rule not the minus 14 rule
is<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:09.660> fact<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.080> this<00:02:10.619> position<00:02:11.190> right

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
is is the fact that this position right

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.880 
is is the fact that this position right
here<00:02:11.640> is<00:02:11.819> exactly<00:02:12.300> 14<00:02:13.050> places<00:02:13.349> away

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
here is exactly 14 places away

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.930 
here is exactly 14 places away
from<00:02:14.640> right<00:02:15.120> here<00:02:15.600> and<00:02:15.780> there<00:02:16.590> is<00:02:17.040> where<00:02:17.730> the

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
from right here and there is where the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.280 
from right here and there is where the
actual<00:02:19.310> unlocker<00:02:20.310> bar<00:02:21.270> thing<00:02:21.720> is<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.260> tries<00:02:23.040> to

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
actual unlocker bar thing is it tries to

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.360 
actual unlocker bar thing is it tries to
push<00:02:25.290> on<00:02:25.500> in<00:02:25.650> that<00:02:25.860> way<00:02:26.069> so<00:02:27.950> what<00:02:28.950> I'm<00:02:29.040> saying

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
push on in that way so what I'm saying

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.660 
push on in that way so what I'm saying
is<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:30.300> actual<00:02:30.690> position<00:02:31.250> you'll<00:02:32.250> take<00:02:32.490> this

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
is the actual position you'll take this

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.440 
is the actual position you'll take this
and<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.000> subtract<00:02:33.450> 14<00:02:34.110> from<00:02:35.060> this<00:02:36.060> list<00:02:36.300> of

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
and you subtract 14 from this list of

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.710 
and you subtract 14 from this list of
numbers<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:37.080> you'll<00:02:37.200> have<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.590> last<00:02:37.770> one<00:02:38.010> so

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
numbers and you'll have the last one so

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.400 
numbers and you'll have the last one so
36<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:40.470> turns<00:02:41.100> into<00:02:41.250> 22<00:02:41.850> 18<00:02:42.570> turns<00:02:42.810> into<00:02:43.020> four

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
36 and turns into 22 18 turns into four

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.630 
36 and turns into 22 18 turns into four
and<00:02:43.910> 28<00:02:44.910> turns<00:02:45.360> into<00:02:45.660> 14<00:02:46.250> you<00:02:47.250> might<00:02:47.400> want<00:02:47.580> to

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
and 28 turns into 14 you might want to

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.490 
and 28 turns into 14 you might want to
go<00:02:47.760> through<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.209> a<00:02:48.540> couple<00:02:48.870> times<00:02:48.989> just<00:02:49.350> to

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
go through that a couple times just to

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.530 
go through that a couple times just to
make<00:02:49.650> sure<00:02:49.680> it's<00:02:49.950> right<00:02:50.600> but<00:02:51.830> here's<00:02:52.830> where

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
make sure it's right but here's where

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.690 
make sure it's right but here's where
close<00:02:54.540> up<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.780> padlock<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:59.400> moment<00:02:59.640> of

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
close up the padlock and the moment of

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:09.710 
close up the padlock and the moment of
truth<00:02:59.940> 22<00:03:02.030> for<00:03:04.400> 14<00:03:08.209> thanks<00:03:09.209> for<00:03:09.330> watching<00:03:09.600> and

truth 22 for 14 thanks for watching and

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.560
