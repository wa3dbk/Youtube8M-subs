00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:09.269
 hello today took a last but 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.870
 the most impossible machines i think 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.870
 of the world 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.660
 So today I believe with his camera 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:26.369
 because I have found I mike 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:28.519
 And that's only machine brings 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.519
 Nothing 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.890
 yes I do not want to be all the time now 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:56.750
 the mates and explain that is 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.750
 Of course, the witnessed machine is one 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.369
 Sewing machine so to speak so you do too 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:13.939
 I've already thought of it again 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:21.840
 future hold or computer down 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:23.820
 the culprits then you can believe me that 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.520
 the same one might get there too 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.520
 one not so 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:44.780
 I call you the speed machine 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:47.289
 with the fast youtube like this one 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.860
 the cross comparison makes sound 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:55.429
 First of all, only machines 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:02:02.990
 This is the most wanted machine 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:10.369
 also very unfavorable from the 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:14.690
 machines here so the two so what you 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:18.230
 have to do that sounds like that 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:23.780
 you can get some different ones here now 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:29.989
 let's see how you do it 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.769
 so here goes 1 peta I have now 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.310
 already built 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:39.489
 Ok, I can do it again 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:41.989
 made a peter once the direction 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:46.989
 if you guilty that I am here 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:50.319
 a bit like this or take the redstone 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:53.000
 placed that once was high out here 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.160
 to you a torch it is year 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 activated 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.010
 then change would have to switch so 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.150
 fast as it goes 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.150
 are you ever change so again 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:11.510
 make away and puts it sounds then 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:15.670
 and off we go only with repeaters us all 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.670
 important that you translate the area 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:32.900
 because I tried here too 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:35.560
 but I can do so much 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:40.990
 I do not own a funny machine myself 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:43.250
 but I had a fun 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.010
 where I do not know how it is needed 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.680
 I have his 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:56.950
 I just tried her why 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:04:04.160
 not so that it will earth it three earth 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:05.950
 if you do not press the switch here 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.520
 very helpful 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:12.040
 if I'm right as you tenschert 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:16.520
 already she protects herself there you can 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:29.450
 I think I'm just going to do that 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:31.810
 and there neighbors once those sticky ones 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.810
 call 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:53.139
 yes and so generally costs here were 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:56.100
 sticky spaces and their normal ones 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:59.410
 been pushed from the back 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:10.870
 which were backwards and were 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:13.110
 not that was not just that's it 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.110
 already 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:19.990
 That's it from the old ones 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:23.580
 Machines of the world I believe we see 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.580
 us at the red bull again and
