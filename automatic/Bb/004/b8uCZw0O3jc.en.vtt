mine's a 55 gallon I have a bigger thing
maybe<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.689> can<00:01:42.810> see<00:01:42.990> it's<00:01:43.110> pretty<00:01:43.229> active<00:01:43.680> a

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
maybe you can see it's pretty active a

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.920 
maybe you can see it's pretty active a
lot<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.759> little<00:01:44.939> micro<00:01:45.060> bubbles<00:01:45.360> coming<00:01:45.780> up

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
lot of little micro bubbles coming up

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.460 
lot of little micro bubbles coming up
it's<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.860> big<00:01:47.130> tank<00:01:47.600> but<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:49.170> one<00:01:49.290> thing<00:01:49.439> that

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
it's a big tank but the one thing that

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.249 
it's a big tank but the one thing that
you<00:01:49.649> got<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.860> worry<00:01:49.979> about<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.159> co2<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:51.259> surface

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
you got to worry about a co2 is surface

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.170 
you got to worry about a co2 is surface
agitation<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.979> more<00:01:53.130> surface<00:01:53.340> agitation<00:01:54.060> you

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
agitation the more surface agitation you

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.020 
agitation the more surface agitation you
have<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.840> by<00:01:55.200> surface<00:01:55.590> agitation<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.219> mean<00:01:56.399> all

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
have and by surface agitation I mean all

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.819 
have and by surface agitation I mean all
of<00:01:57.090> this<00:01:57.450> movement<00:01:57.990> on<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.229> surface<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.710> you

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
of this movement on the surface that you

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.069 
of this movement on the surface that you
see<00:01:59.040> everywhere<00:01:59.340> all<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.630> movement<00:02:00.869> on

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
see everywhere all of that movement on

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.080 
see everywhere all of that movement on
the<00:02:01.200> surface<00:02:01.380> gases<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.189> co2<00:02:02.640> out<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:02.820> your

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
the surface gases the co2 out of your

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.600 
the surface gases the co2 out of your
aquarium<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.960> like<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.740> lot<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.130> people<00:02:05.399> have

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
aquarium so like a lot of people have

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.580 
aquarium so like a lot of people have
rabbit<00:02:06.540> for<00:02:06.750> instance<00:02:07.020> if<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.229> watch<00:02:07.380> his

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
rabbit for instance if you watch his

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.770 
rabbit for instance if you watch his
videos<00:02:07.860> watch<00:02:08.099> out<00:02:08.340> of<00:02:08.459> Potter's<00:02:08.789> videos<00:02:09.119> he

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
videos watch out of Potter's videos he

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.520 
videos watch out of Potter's videos he
has<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.929> system<00:02:10.440> where<00:02:10.619> he<00:02:10.739> has<00:02:10.890> a

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
has a system where he has a

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.559 
has a system where he has a
he<00:02:13.530> has<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.650> canister<00:02:14.159> filter<00:02:14.519> so<00:02:15.090> he<00:02:15.359> gets

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
he has a canister filter so he gets

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.479 
he has a canister filter so he gets
almost<00:02:15.719> no<00:02:16.019> surface<00:02:16.439> agitation<00:02:17.010> so<00:02:17.249> if<00:02:17.370> you

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
almost no surface agitation so if you

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.629 
almost no surface agitation so if you
were<00:02:17.639> to<00:02:17.760> add<00:02:17.909> co2<00:02:18.239> to<00:02:18.780> his<00:02:18.930> tank<00:02:19.200> a

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:19.639 
were to add co2 to his tank a

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:22.729 
were to add co2 to his tank a
substantial<00:02:20.639> amount<00:02:20.849> and<00:02:21.150> then<00:02:21.689> try<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.590> add

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
substantial amount and then try to add

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.709 
substantial amount and then try to add
fish<00:02:23.099> it's<00:02:23.700> going<00:02:23.879> to<00:02:23.939> change<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.269> fish<00:02:24.569> in

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:24.719 
fish it's going to change the fish in

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:26.809 
fish it's going to change the fish in
praat<00:02:25.049> gonna<00:02:25.680> change<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.069> pH<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.489> his<00:02:26.609> tank

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
praat gonna change the pH and his tank

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.879 
praat gonna change the pH and his tank
and<00:02:27.030> probably<00:02:27.719> end<00:02:27.900> up<00:02:28.019> gassing<00:02:28.439> the<00:02:28.560> fish<00:02:28.739> out

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:28.889 
and probably end up gassing the fish out

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:30.349 
and probably end up gassing the fish out
to<00:02:29.069> where<00:02:29.189> they<00:02:29.280> can't<00:02:29.519> breathe<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.209> they'll

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:30.359 
to where they can't breathe and they'll

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.569 
to where they can't breathe and they'll
be<00:02:30.480> up<00:02:30.569> at<00:02:30.689> the<00:02:30.780> top<00:02:30.810> gasping<00:02:31.500> so<00:02:32.040> if<00:02:32.189> he<00:02:32.430> were

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
be up at the top gasping so if he were

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.280 
be up at the top gasping so if he were
to<00:02:32.700> do<00:02:32.790> co2

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
to do co2

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.929 
to do co2
likely<00:02:35.010> what<00:02:35.159> he<00:02:35.310> would<00:02:35.430> end<00:02:35.609> up<00:02:35.639> doing<00:02:35.760> is

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:35.939 
likely what he would end up doing is

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.270 
likely what he would end up doing is
putting<00:02:36.150> an<00:02:36.239> airstone<00:02:36.629> what<00:02:37.170> I<00:02:37.200> do<00:02:37.349> is<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:38.099> put

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
putting an airstone what I do is I put

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.619 
putting an airstone what I do is I put
an<00:02:38.370> airstone<00:02:38.639> anyway<00:02:38.969> and<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.150> run<00:02:39.329> it<00:02:39.419> all<00:02:39.540> the

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
an airstone anyway and I run it all the

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.429 
an airstone anyway and I run it all the

about<00:03:44.669> one<00:03:44.939> every<00:03:45.239> two<00:03:45.509> seconds<00:03:46.109> ish<00:03:46.729> I<00:03:48.470> don't

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
about one every two seconds ish I don't

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.649 
about one every two seconds ish I don't
know<00:03:49.620> that<00:03:49.799> this<00:03:49.919> diffuses<00:03:50.519> as<00:03:50.669> well<00:03:50.970> as<00:03:51.269> the

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 
know that this diffuses as well as the

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:53.539 
know that this diffuses as well as the
other<00:03:51.810> other<00:03:52.229> ones<00:03:52.560> but<00:03:52.949> I<00:03:52.979> think<00:03:53.310> that<00:03:53.430> it's

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
other other ones but I think that it's

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.909 
other other ones but I think that it's
fine<00:03:53.759> for<00:03:54.030> this<00:03:54.090> 20<00:03:54.509> I<00:03:54.689> mean<00:03:55.139> it<00:03:55.349> it<00:03:55.709> works

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919 
fine for this 20 I mean it it works

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.360 
fine for this 20 I mean it it works
obviously<00:03:56.519> because<00:03:56.729> the<00:03:56.849> 20<00:03:57.090> is<00:03:57.150> going<00:03:57.239> nuts<00:03:57.599> I

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
obviously because the 20 is going nuts I

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.119 
obviously because the 20 is going nuts I
don't<00:03:59.370> have<00:03:59.489> an<00:03:59.669> air<00:03:59.819> stone<00:04:00.090> in<00:04:00.239> this<00:04:01.009> but<00:04:02.009> I<00:04:02.040> do

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
don't have an air stone in this but I do

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:03.649 
don't have an air stone in this but I do
