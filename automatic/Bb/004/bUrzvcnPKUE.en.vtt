I've never done one of these video
tutorials<00:02:44.660> before<00:02:44.840> where<00:02:45.260> I've<00:02:46.250> recorded<00:02:46.700> a

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
tutorials before where I've recorded a

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.700 
tutorials before where I've recorded a
video<00:02:47.300> that<00:02:47.480> I'm<00:02:47.600> speaking<00:02:48.050> back<00:02:48.200> over<00:02:48.590> it

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
video that I'm speaking back over it

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.810 
video that I'm speaking back over it
doesn't<00:02:49.460> feel<00:02:49.790> fresh<00:02:50.210> but<00:02:50.750> you<00:02:50.780> know<00:02:51.760> I'm<00:02:52.760> not

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
doesn't feel fresh but you know I'm not

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.410 
doesn't feel fresh but you know I'm not
a<00:02:52.970> vagina<00:02:53.180> so<00:02:53.810> I've<00:02:54.230> got<00:02:54.470> no<00:02:55.120> worries<00:02:56.120> there

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
a vagina so I've got no worries there

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:16.400 
a vagina so I've got no worries there
about<00:02:57.110> the<00:03:02.290> do<00:03:03.850> do<00:03:04.850> dododo

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.220 

so<00:03:16.980> I<00:03:17.010> reckon<00:03:17.370> it<00:03:17.460> takes<00:03:17.490> about<00:03:18.200> five<00:03:19.200> minutes
