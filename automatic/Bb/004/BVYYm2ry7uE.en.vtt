00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.820
 hello how about youtube friends in this 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.620
 I'm going to show you what I do 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:13.809
 to revive batteries that no longer hold 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:17.350
 load those with the letter n iv 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:21.160
 touch looks 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:24.750
 well this brand almost zero 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.750
 let's try it 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:33.850
 0.0 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:40.950
 now what I'm going to do is I have here 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:42.690
 a charger with a 19-volt outlet 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.050
 and what I 'm going to do is give you some 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.620
 knock some electric shocks to this 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.430
 battery putting here the negative well 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.430
 tight 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.170
 and here I will give a few touches perhaps 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.610
 is going to achieve look is going to take some 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.740
 sparks 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.650
 I'm going to give about 5 to 10 touches 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.489
 one 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.360
 two 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.140
 3 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.140
 4 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.200
 5 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.920
 6 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.130
 7 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.700
 8 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.659
 9 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.480
 10 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.190
 eleven 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.000
 I will not give you two because it's very 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:32.320
 strong now let's try 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.320
 to see what voltage 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:39.350
 has at this time the battery 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:42.370
 we put here the tester the negative and 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.370
 here the positive 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.030
 I do not know if you can see that the battery already 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.920
 recovered a little bit already in 0.1 club 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.729
 which means that you need more 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.729
 electric shocks 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.929
 this battery after being at zero and 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.569
 after several attempts of several 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.910
 electric shock has already arrived and recovered 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.070
 1.2 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.500
 and we have it right now what I 'm going to do 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.470
 is to put them on a charger to see if they go 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.690
 to lift the load has if they reach 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:26.840
 grab cargo have to measure after 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.840
 between 1.3 and 1.4 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:41.719
 I put as to charge these batteries to 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:46.430
 see if they recover their energy since they no longer 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:48.620
 charged were already very low there was a 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.060
 that she was dead and like that prevented 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.430
 that the others would hold in charge the 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.189
 others were not totally dead 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.980
 still half a volt but it's already 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:59.620
 mean totally zero everything after 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.870
 have given him some electric touches 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.870
 it looks like they are going to get up I'm not 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.860
 very safe but a short time and then they 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.990
 I inform if yes or no the idea worked 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.730
 At this moment we are going to check if 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:17.170
 these batteries that were dead 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:19.540
 to see if they caught cargo 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.050
 after 20 minutes of being here in 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.050
 the charger 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.970
 and since there are four batteries of 1.2 each 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.100
 one should dial up to 5 volts 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.140
 between 4 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.040
 if they grabbed loads and not because no 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.040
 they will mark anything 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:44.409
 we put one here we put another here 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.409
 I do not know if you can look 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.420
 5.6 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.260
 which means 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:04:00.680
 that these batteries 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.680
 revived they already grabbed 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.020
 if you do this operation that 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.420
 they watched the video be careful of 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.540
 be in a free place where there is no 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.160
 nothing that is flamable since 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.630
 they give off many sparks when it comes to 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.630
 be giving him the electric touches
