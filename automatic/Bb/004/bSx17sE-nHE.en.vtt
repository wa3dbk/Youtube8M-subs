 banana with chocolate chips and nuts 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.769
 in the style of that famous ice cream 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.470
 ben &amp; jerry's that by the way plus 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.150
 very famous is very expensive and very 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.560
 rich also what happens that we 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.330
 here we have been investigating the 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.010
 secret formula and we have it for 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.689
 all of you and this secret formula 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.640
 that we have already prepared for 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.189
 approve it before and know that we get 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.410
 magnificent has come out so magnificent that 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.210
 some of our team out there 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.940
 saying hello they want to say they like 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.880
 more our formula than those of wenger is 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.500
 let's see is an ice cream that also 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.969
 It has very special characteristics 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.489
 apart from the name because having it from 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:48.399
 monkey will be because the monkeys can not 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.930
 they love bananas tell me either 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.910
 that the monkeys here would be all 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.890
 wishing that they will finish the ice cream going 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.320
 how to eat it good has money not 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.480
 has nut is chocolate us besides 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.219
 we are going to add a little rum to 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.160
 the older ones because for the little ones the 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.500
 classic version and the most important thing of 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.780
 everything that we are not going to need any 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.360
 ice cream machine no 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.280
 nothing of that then what else can you ask 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.170
 so nothing good we're going to see you say 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.190
 ahead what we will need to 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:20.340
 do this chan kim man that are 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.050
 4 ripe bananas or medium bananas in 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.320
 chunks 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.360
 400 grams or a cup and 34 cup of 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.020
 condensed milk 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.000
 a teaspoon of vanilla extract 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:37.290
 a splash or a spoonful of aged rum 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.810
 or black two cups or 500 grams of cream 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.110
 of milk or cream to assemble 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.350
 a cup of chocolate chips half 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.990
 cup of chopped nuts and of course 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.720
 the molds to put the ice cream the scoop 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.090
 spoon or cup the web all the 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.549
 income after the first step we're going 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.039
 to make is to beat the banana with the milk 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.380
 condensed and vanilla and that little touch 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.509
 of rum that we are going to put little one 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.630
 little one and prey for that we're going to 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.390
 use the blender is that I was 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:14.489
 resists there to me and that now exposed 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:16.170
 let's add condensed milk this 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.610
 do not make mistakes that is milk 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.610
 condensed evaporated 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.990
 we add the bananas that as you can see 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.720
 we have cut it into pieces of 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.800
 approximately one centimeter 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.800
 that are mature 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:38.099
 and we close 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.099
 and we beat 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:47.130
 and now that it is already a little bit beaten 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.130
 let's add the vanilla 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.989
 and the rum the rum is a little bit comfortable in 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:54.620
 us with a teaspoon a 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.620
 spoonful of brno 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.530
 is very good and we keep beating until 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.530
 that all the banana is crushed 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.570
 and we're ready to see 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:12.250
 check that there is no remaining 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:14.590
 nothing perfect a homogeneous mixture that 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.190
 it happened then and now we're going to 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.340
 leave here let's beat the cream that already 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.960
 the people have wi-fi fresquito that 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.370
 we add the cream that we also have 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.370
 cold this is important 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.480
 let's beat 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.480
 shark coloma 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.170
 ready look when those are formed 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.350
 little piquitos and he is ready 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:52.620
 if we are going to withdraw this 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.140
 ok and we have here the whipped cream and 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.400
 Now what we are going to do is add 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.790
 our mixture of condensed milk and 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.830
 banana little by little and with movements 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.120
 envelopes here is the trick because no 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.440
 we want the cream to come down 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:11.910
 then it too will go 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.520
 adding little by little like this and now with the 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:17.700
 spatula 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:21.930
 wraparound movements like this and this 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:24.950
 Patience with love with love and let's go 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.510
 there for the last batch 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.560
 that we have done it since approximately 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.560
 in four rounds 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:35.460
 and the last batch list and we continue 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.460
 moving little by little 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.950
 and since what we have everything 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.780
 integrated part of the chocolate and the 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.660
 part of the nuts that we're still going 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.430
 to add 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.430
 and with enveloping movements 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:55.050
 with enveloping movements we follow 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:58.140
 mixing and I 'm curious 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.450
 because we talk about ice cream with refrigerators 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.130
 in the area and I wonder why 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.500
 some we do here we are 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.270
 without a refrigerator, then the difference 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.700
 difference is in a key ingredient 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.380
 what is milk condensed milk 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.080
 condensed what it is going to do is that it is 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.490
 ice cream we do not need to beat it as 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.090
 that is freezing so it does not 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.560
 form crystals and have a texture 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.750
 delicious apart from the flavor logically 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.000
 you always learn new things truth 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.970
 guys are the tricks 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.100
 So, look, we have the base of 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.710
 prepared ice cream that we have to do 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.720
 now pass it to the molds 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.240
 approximately we have here around 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.380
 the 2 liters more or less here we are going to 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.730
 have a good side here I do not think 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.210
 will disappear soon then we are going to 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.210
 throw it here 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:55.400
 ready there and now we have out there those 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.600
 the transparent fill because we're going to 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.060
 cover 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.460
 and we're going to take it to the fridge sorry 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.880
 to the freezer to the freezer 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.220
 freezer 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:09.560
 at least six hours but I 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:11.780
 maybe I would leave it 24 24 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:16.400
 much better 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:18.650
 perfect then now every 11 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.780
 and quickie for the fridge that we are 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.840
 wanting to try hiking the fridge 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:26.710
 that we are leaving 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:29.440
 and we already come here with another and the other one 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:31.150
 is reserved for the sweet tooth and 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.639
 we've taken it out about ten minutes before 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:37.240
 true so that we can handle it 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:40.690
 better very well and nothing is simply 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.280
 do so present it to make the ball and 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:46.330
 to make the balls fix what 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:50.740
 I have a little story with hot water for 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:54.120
 that does not stick, that's not true then 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.120
 let's make little balls 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:00.060
 even though 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.060
 delicious 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.790
 in the second ball one for each and 

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:07.940
 let's finish it 

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:13.150
 let's put a little shanks like that 

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:20.230
 above and a few nuts 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:21.850
