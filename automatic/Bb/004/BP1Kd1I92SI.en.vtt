00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.170
 Hello, based on the video where I am 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:10.380
 It shows how to tie a scarf in her arms I 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:12.780
 tie a cape to the sofa or blanket more 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.210
 you will probably get me decorative 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.980
 I found myself with all the coils here 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.769
 here hopefully enough yarn and unwound 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.050
 I have a ponytail somewhere 45 meters and 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:29.029
 now we make the air loop like this 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:34.770
 way crossing capture the thread 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:39.450
 it turned out a loop we pull it up with our 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:44.899
 Toga's right hand is not worth it 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:48.360
 hard work and now since 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:54.590
 we make loops when knitting 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:57.570
 do exactly the same on the right hand 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.600
 try that they were all loops were 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.879
 same size 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.960
 grabbing for calling this thread 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.320
 the resulting loop on the right hand and so 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.320
 recruit 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.140
 I scored sixty five loops now 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.579
 start knitting 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.369
 we clamp the working thread in the right hand 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.569
 remove the first loop 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.100
 us got loop 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:45.969
 we put on the left hand again working thread 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.390
 in the right hand 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:54.569
 remove the next loop we got 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:57.520
 loop on the left and so continue to knit 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:02:04.329
 all need to pull up to more or less 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:08.099
 the size of the loops was the same 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:12.269
 knit the way we need 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.269
 just me hands 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.500
 now i will finish knitting me 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.110
 knitting gathered on the right hand working 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.080
 thread right hand 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.629
 I take off the first loop of the new loop on the left 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:39.180
 a hand 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:46.769
 I repeat now the loop which is closer to 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:49.980
 body on my left hand, I lower virgo 5 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:52.790
 working thread in my right hand rented 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.790
 next loop 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.190
 the resulting loop on the left hand again 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:04.760
 same for which is closer to the body 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:08.120
 I am emitting in this way 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:12.590
 continue until it turns out 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.590
 one loop on hand 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:24.359
 when there is only one loop on the arm just 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:30.799
 I cut the thread and pull through 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:34.130
 the remaining loop and tighten it all 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:37.400
 it can either cut it short 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:42.030
 hide in knitting as you please 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:46.250
 it depends on what threads you have there and on this 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.250
 all our blanket is finished
