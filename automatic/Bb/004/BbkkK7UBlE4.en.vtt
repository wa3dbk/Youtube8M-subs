well I had headaches what is very
unusual<00:00:09.450> not<00:00:10.200> impossible<00:00:11.040> but<00:00:11.190> it's<00:00:11.670> not

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
unusual not impossible but it's not

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.879 
unusual not impossible but it's not
usual<00:00:12.420> for<00:00:12.630> brain<00:00:12.809> tumor<00:00:13.139> patients<00:00:13.290> to

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
usual for brain tumor patients to

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.369 
usual for brain tumor patients to
present<00:00:14.280> with<00:00:14.429> headaches<00:00:14.839> the<00:00:15.839> only<00:00:16.080> time

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
present with headaches the only time

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.910 
present with headaches the only time
they<00:00:16.859> do<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.640> if<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.539> tumor<00:00:18.840> bleeds<00:00:19.380> into

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
they do is if the tumor bleeds into

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.060 
they do is if the tumor bleeds into
itself<00:00:20.359> causing<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.449> sudden<00:00:21.900> increase<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.920> the

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
itself causing a sudden increase of the

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.099 
itself causing a sudden increase of the
volume<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.670> tumor<00:00:23.939> within<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.390> head<00:00:24.570> or

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
volume of the tumor within the head or

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.170 
volume of the tumor within the head or
if<00:00:25.710> there's<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.010> lot<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.279> swelling<00:00:26.609> around<00:00:26.910> the

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
if there's a lot of swelling around the

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.609 
if there's a lot of swelling around the
tumor<00:00:27.510> or<00:00:28.310> if<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.640> tumor<00:00:29.910> obstructs<00:00:30.779> the

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
tumor or if the tumor obstructs the

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.400 
tumor or if the tumor obstructs the
spinal<00:00:32.099> fluid<00:00:32.130> drainage<00:00:32.969> system<00:00:33.420> causing<00:00:34.260> a

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
spinal fluid drainage system causing a

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.250 
spinal fluid drainage system causing a
buildup<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:35.160> fluid<00:00:35.219> or<00:00:35.610> hydrocephalus<00:00:36.260> so

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
buildup of fluid or hydrocephalus so

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.799 
buildup of fluid or hydrocephalus so
those<00:00:37.440> are<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.710> situations<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.820> which<00:00:38.850> people

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
those are the situations in which people

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.330 
those are the situations in which people
with<00:00:39.930> brain<00:00:40.200> tumors<00:00:40.559> really<00:00:40.860> present<00:00:41.280> with

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
with brain tumors really present with

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.459 
with brain tumors really present with
headache<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.540> headaches<00:00:42.930> are<00:00:43.110> unique

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
headache and the headaches are unique

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.190 
headache and the headaches are unique
because<00:00:44.190> they<00:00:44.640> usually<00:00:44.969> occur<00:00:45.570> at<00:00:45.780> night

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
because they usually occur at night

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.690 
because they usually occur at night
while<00:00:46.559> you're<00:00:46.710> sleeping<00:00:47.190> when<00:00:47.280> you're<00:00:47.399> lying

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
while you're sleeping when you're lying

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.060 
while you're sleeping when you're lying
down<00:00:48.110> that's<00:00:49.110> when<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.410> pressure<00:00:49.649> really

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
down that's when the pressure really

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.500 
down that's when the pressure really
begins<00:00:50.430> at<00:00:50.610> night<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.059> people<00:00:51.360> will

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
begins at night so the people will

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.490 
begins at night so the people will
report<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.110> headache<00:00:52.260> actually

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
report that the headache actually

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.939 
report that the headache actually
awakens<00:00:53.309> them<00:00:53.489> from<00:00:53.760> sleep<00:00:54.530> the<00:00:55.530> headache<00:00:55.829> is

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
awakens them from sleep the headache is

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.790 
awakens them from sleep the headache is
usually<00:00:56.550> associated<00:00:56.879> with<00:00:57.680> nausea<00:00:58.680> and

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
usually associated with nausea and

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.750 
usually associated with nausea and
vomiting<00:00:59.070> sometimes<00:00:59.850> double<00:01:00.180> vision

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.880 

so<00:01:03.570> these<00:01:03.719> headaches<00:01:03.960> are<00:01:04.260> not<00:01:04.409> your<00:01:04.680> typical

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
so these headaches are not your typical

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.800 
so these headaches are not your typical
own<00:01:05.460> my<00:01:05.729> pain<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.210> back<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.600> head<00:01:06.780> I

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
own my pain in the back of the head I

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.080 
own my pain in the back of the head I
get<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.200> every<00:01:07.470> day<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:08.280> worse<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.970> know

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090

so on and so on

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.960 
so on and so on
it's<00:01:10.439> it's<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.830> very<00:01:10.860> specific<00:01:11.430> type<00:01:11.939> of

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
headache that you get with brain tumors

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.440 
headache that you get with brain tumors
other<00:01:15.390> tumors<00:01:16.020> have<00:01:16.380> no<00:01:17.000> presenting<00:01:18.000> symptoms

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
other tumors have no presenting symptoms

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.570 
other tumors have no presenting symptoms
whatsoever<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.290> these<00:01:19.950> are<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.189> ones<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.460> I

doing<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.840> brain<00:01:58.020> scan<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.500> indeed<00:01:58.770> there's

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
doing a brain scan and indeed there's

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.030 
doing a brain scan and indeed there's
your<00:01:59.219> brain<00:01:59.430> tumor<00:02:00.290> these<00:02:01.290> are<00:02:01.649> called

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
your brain tumor these are called

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.270 
your brain tumor these are called
incidentally<00:02:03.030> discovered<00:02:03.630> tumors<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.619> then

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
incidentally discovered tumors and then

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.639 
incidentally discovered tumors and then
of<00:02:05.640> course<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:06.180> have<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.570> figure<00:02:07.170> out<00:02:07.320> okay

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
of course you have to figure out okay

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.889 
of course you have to figure out okay
down<00:02:07.890> what<00:02:08.129> kind<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.429> tumor<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:08.970> where<00:02:09.720> is

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
down what kind of tumor is it where is

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.960 
down what kind of tumor is it where is
it<00:02:09.929> what<00:02:10.319> can<00:02:10.470> I<00:02:10.530> do<00:02:10.590> about<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.069> does<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.700> have

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
it what can I do about it does it have

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.640 
it what can I do about it does it have
to<00:02:12.120> be<00:02:12.209> treated<00:02:12.599> or<00:02:12.690> can<00:02:12.870> it<00:02:12.959> be<00:02:13.110> watched

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
to be treated or can it be watched

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.949 
to be treated or can it be watched
and<00:02:13.739> many<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.519> these<00:02:14.690> incidentally<00:02:15.690> found

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
and many of these incidentally found

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.750 
and many of these incidentally found
tumors<00:02:16.470> don't<00:02:16.680> really<00:02:17.010> need<00:02:17.129> to<00:02:17.280> be<00:02:17.400> treated

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
tumors don't really need to be treated

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.670 
tumors don't really need to be treated
they<00:02:17.879> need<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.120> be<00:02:18.209> watched<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.900> if<00:02:19.440> there's

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
they need to be watched and if there's

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.229 
they need to be watched and if there's
growth<00:02:20.010> then<00:02:20.340> they<00:02:20.489> need<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.670> be<00:02:20.760> treated<00:02:21.150> but

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
growth then they need to be treated but

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.180 
growth then they need to be treated but
if<00:02:21.390> there's<00:02:21.569> no<00:02:21.720> growth<00:02:21.989> then<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.799> same<00:02:22.980> as

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
if there's no growth then the same as

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.860 
if there's no growth then the same as
they<00:02:23.370> were<00:02:23.430> there<00:02:23.730> before<00:02:23.940> they<00:02:24.299> can<00:02:24.480> stay

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
they were there before they can stay

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.619 
they were there before they can stay
there<00:02:25.080> forever<00:02:25.409> and<00:02:25.890> it's<00:02:26.879> that<00:02:27.180> type<00:02:27.599> of

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
there forever and it's that type of

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.089 
there forever and it's that type of
tumor<00:02:28.080> that<00:02:28.170> I<00:02:28.319> think<00:02:28.620> is<00:02:28.769> really<00:02:29.069> interesting

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
tumor that I think is really interesting

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.860 
tumor that I think is really interesting
because<00:02:29.849> it<00:02:30.090> it<00:02:31.790> forces<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.000> really<00:02:33.209> be

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
because it it forces you to really be

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.910 
because it it forces you to really be
logical<00:02:34.560> about<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:36.620> decision<00:02:37.620> making

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
logical about the decision making

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.839 
logical about the decision making
process

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
process

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.210 
process

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
as opposed to the knee-jerk reaction

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.819 
as opposed to the knee-jerk reaction
it's<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.849> big<00:02:42.090> malignant<00:02:42.629> tumor<00:02:42.900> it's<00:02:43.470> got<00:02:43.739> to

it's a big malignant tumor it's got to

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.339 
it's a big malignant tumor it's got to
