hide em in here DC aquatics today I'm

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.090 
hide em in here DC aquatics today I'm
just<00:00:03.330> going<00:00:03.449> to<00:00:03.480> go<00:00:03.570> over<00:00:03.659> three<00:00:04.589> of<00:00:04.920> the

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
just going to go over three of the

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.740 
just going to go over three of the
biggest<00:00:05.490> problems<00:00:06.000> that<00:00:06.060> I<00:00:06.240> see<00:00:06.270> with<00:00:06.629> the

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
biggest problems that I see with the

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.379 
biggest problems that I see with the
front<00:00:06.990> crossbar<00:00:07.700> so<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:08.790> first<00:00:08.970> major

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
front crossbar so the first major

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.980 
front crossbar so the first major
problem<00:00:09.840> I<00:00:09.929> see<00:00:10.200> is<00:00:10.230> that<00:00:10.530> people<00:00:11.010> like<00:00:11.519> to

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:11.990 
problem I see is that people like to

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.480 
problem I see is that people like to
fight<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.139> water<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.650> what<00:00:14.099> I<00:00:14.160> mean<00:00:14.280> by<00:00:14.340> that

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
fight the water and what I mean by that

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.700 
fight the water and what I mean by that
is<00:00:14.639> that<00:00:14.849> instead<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.750> using<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.260> water<00:00:16.529> to

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
is that instead of using the water to

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.680 
is that instead of using the water to
their<00:00:16.830> advantage<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.460> floating<00:00:18.270> in<00:00:18.510> the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
their advantage and floating in the

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.800 
their advantage and floating in the
water<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:19.500> try<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:20.210> fight<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.359> water<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.660> try

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
water you try to fight the water and try

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.550 
water you try to fight the water and try
to<00:00:21.869> push<00:00:22.140> ourselves<00:00:22.289> upward<00:00:23.039> so<00:00:23.970> instead<00:00:24.359> of

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
to push ourselves upward so instead of

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.019 
to push ourselves upward so instead of
keeping<00:00:25.560> as<00:00:25.890> much<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.279> your<00:00:26.400> body<00:00:26.609> out<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.880> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
your own as long as you're taking large

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.160 
your own as long as you're taking large
breasts<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.920> air<00:00:53.180> so<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.210> looks<00:00:54.480> more<00:00:54.719> like

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
breasts of air so it looks more like

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.569 
breasts of air so it looks more like
this<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.590> try<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.800> keep<00:00:55.949> your<00:00:56.129> head<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.340> as

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
this you try to keep your head in as

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.810 
this you try to keep your head in as
much<00:00:56.730> as<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:56.969> can<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.180> everything

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.040 

and<00:01:04.820> so<00:01:05.000> what<00:01:05.120> happens<00:01:05.420> when<00:01:05.540> you<00:01:05.660> do<00:01:05.780> it<00:01:05.900> that

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
and so what happens when you do it that

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.090 
and so what happens when you do it that
way<00:01:06.200> is<00:01:06.470> there<00:01:06.680> going<00:01:06.770> to<00:01:06.830> be<00:01:06.890> a<00:01:06.950> lot<00:01:07.070> more

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
way is there going to be a lot more

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.469 
way is there going to be a lot more
efficient<00:01:07.670> with<00:01:07.729> your<00:01:07.850> stroke<00:01:08.180> and<00:01:08.390> you're

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
efficient with your stroke and you're

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.120 
efficient with your stroke and you're
going<00:01:08.570> to<00:01:08.690> be<00:01:08.750> able<00:01:08.780> to<00:01:08.990> swim<00:01:09.410> a<00:01:09.590> lot<00:01:09.890> longer

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
going to be able to swim a lot longer

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.060 
going to be able to swim a lot longer
distances<00:01:10.760> without<00:01:10.910> getting<00:01:11.330> tired<00:01:12.070> the

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
distances without getting tired the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.130 
distances without getting tired the
second<00:01:13.460> problem<00:01:13.610> i<00:01:13.880> see<00:01:13.910> a<00:01:14.450> lot<00:01:14.750> of<00:01:14.780> people<00:01:14.960> who

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
second problem i see a lot of people who

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.500 
second problem i see a lot of people who
are<00:01:15.260> beginning<00:01:15.620> to<00:01:15.830> do<00:01:15.950> their<00:01:16.130> front<00:01:16.970> crawl<00:01:17.180> is

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
are beginning to do their front crawl is

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.530 
are beginning to do their front crawl is
that<00:01:17.810> they<00:01:18.320> tend<00:01:18.619> to<00:01:18.830> be<00:01:19.460> completely<00:01:19.910> rigid<00:01:20.270> in

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
that they tend to be completely rigid in

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.120 
that they tend to be completely rigid in
their<00:01:20.570> front<00:01:20.840> crawl<00:01:21.110> and<00:01:21.320> so<00:01:21.860> they're<00:01:22.010> not

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
their front crawl and so they're not

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.969 
their front crawl and so they're not
rotating<00:01:22.970> their<00:01:23.570> arching<00:01:23.990> their<00:01:24.140> back<00:01:24.380> their

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
rotating their arching their back their

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.010 
rotating their arching their back their
feet<00:01:25.250> are<00:01:25.400> down<00:01:25.580> and<00:01:25.910> the<00:01:26.210> whole<00:01:26.420> body<00:01:26.660> stick

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
feet are down and the whole body stick

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.650 
feet are down and the whole body stick
when<00:01:27.530> you<00:01:27.619> tense<00:01:27.860> up<00:01:28.070> your<00:01:28.280> body<00:01:28.660> usually

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
when you tense up your body usually

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.660 
when you tense up your body usually
you'll<00:01:29.810> start<00:01:30.110> to<00:01:30.170> sing<00:01:30.440> and<00:01:30.619> you<00:01:30.800> can't<00:01:31.100> use

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
you'll start to sing and you can't use

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.540 
you'll start to sing and you can't use
the<00:01:31.910> full<00:01:32.150> range<00:01:32.330> of<00:01:32.570> motion<00:01:32.860> if<00:01:33.860> I<00:01:34.070> my<00:01:34.280> hand

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
the full range of motion if I my hand

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.020 
the full range of motion if I my hand
here<00:01:35.440> it's<00:01:36.440> that<00:01:36.710> high<00:01:36.890> but<00:01:37.190> if<00:01:37.340> I<00:01:37.520> twist<00:01:37.820> a

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
here it's that high but if I twist a

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.029 
here it's that high but if I twist a
little<00:01:38.060> bit<00:01:38.360> i<00:01:38.570> can<00:01:39.350> raise<00:01:39.470> my<00:01:39.680> head<00:01:39.830> even

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
little bit i can raise my head even

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:41.800 
little bit i can raise my head even
higher<00:01:40.160> and<00:01:40.550> get<00:01:40.640> even<00:01:41.000> more<00:01:41.180> pull<00:01:41.539> with<00:01:41.570> the

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
higher and get even more pull with the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.170 
higher and get even more pull with the
water<00:01:42.110> so<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:42.619> loser<00:01:42.950> I<00:01:43.009> am<00:01:43.160> I'm<00:01:43.670> going<00:01:44.060> to<00:01:44.119> be

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
water so the loser I am I'm going to be

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.999 
water so the loser I am I'm going to be
able<00:01:44.360> to<00:01:44.450> get<00:01:44.600> a<00:01:44.840> lot<00:01:45.320> more<00:01:45.350> motion<00:01:45.830> on<00:01:45.920> my

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
able to get a lot more motion on my

able to get a lot more motion on my
front<00:01:46.250> row<00:01:46.430> and<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:47.570> third<00:01:47.600> thing<00:01:47.840> this<00:01:48.229> is

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
front row and the third thing this is

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.310 
front row and the third thing this is
probably<00:01:48.649> the<00:01:48.860> most<00:01:49.030> important<00:01:50.140> mistake<00:01:51.140> that

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
probably the most important mistake that

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.840 
probably the most important mistake that
I<00:01:51.410> see<00:01:51.440> people<00:01:51.710> making<00:01:52.070> as<00:01:52.280> they<00:01:52.430> think<00:01:52.729> that

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
I see people making as they think that

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.609 
I see people making as they think that
all<00:01:53.180> the<00:01:53.330> power<00:01:53.539> is<00:01:53.750> coming<00:01:53.810> from<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:54.320> legs

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
all the power is coming from the legs

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.889 
all the power is coming from the legs
but<00:01:55.369> really<00:01:55.700> about<00:01:55.850> eighty<00:01:56.149> percent<00:01:56.479> of<00:01:56.780> the

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
but really about eighty percent of the

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.810 
but really about eighty percent of the
power<00:01:57.140> that<00:01:57.320> your<00:01:57.470> dinner<00:01:57.710> in<00:01:57.920> is<00:01:58.100> coming<00:01:58.490> from
