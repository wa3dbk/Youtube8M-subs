I<00:03:27.670> think<00:03:28.390> anybody's<00:03:28.870> into<00:03:29.140> business<00:03:29.530> I<00:03:29.650> think

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
I think anybody's into business I think

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.460 
I think anybody's into business I think
you'd<00:03:30.070> do<00:03:30.310> that<00:03:30.489> and<00:03:30.850> it's<00:03:31.450> offensive<00:03:31.900> down<00:03:32.260> us

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
you'd do that and it's offensive down us

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.750 
you'd do that and it's offensive down us
down<00:03:32.739> that's<00:03:33.070> over<00:03:33.430> I<00:03:35.340> see<00:03:36.340> it<00:03:36.430> all<00:03:36.579> the<00:03:36.610> time

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
down that's over I see it all the time

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.210 
down that's over I see it all the time
sometimes<00:03:37.360> a<00:03:37.750> really<00:03:38.019> early<00:03:38.320> days<00:03:38.500> they<00:03:38.920> think

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
sometimes a really early days they think

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.220 
sometimes a really early days they think
they<00:03:39.400> want<00:03:39.610> to<00:03:39.700> do<00:03:39.850> it<00:03:40.030> but<00:03:40.540> I<00:03:40.720> think<00:03:40.750> they<00:03:41.049> need

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
they want to do it but I think they need

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.319 
they want to do it but I think they need
to<00:03:41.290> get<00:03:41.620> find<00:03:42.010> a<00:03:42.130> stable<00:03:42.400> were<00:03:42.670> there<00:03:42.850> lots<00:03:43.150> of

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
to get find a stable were there lots of

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.720 
to get find a stable were there lots of
horses<00:03:43.630> with<00:03:44.110> lots<00:03:44.350> of<00:03:44.500> chances<00:03:45.160> for<00:03:45.340> him<00:03:45.640> to

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
horses with lots of chances for him to

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.050 
horses with lots of chances for him to
ride<00:03:45.970> I<00:03:46.680> think<00:03:47.680> they<00:03:47.860> have<00:03:48.010> to<00:03:48.220> make<00:03:48.489> sure<00:03:48.519> they

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
ride I think they have to make sure they

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.920 
ride I think they have to make sure they
really<00:03:49.090> want<00:03:49.630> to<00:03:49.720> do<00:03:49.900> it<00:03:50.079> because<00:03:51.120> in<00:03:52.120> this

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
really want to do it because in this

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.319 
really want to do it because in this
sport<00:03:53.410> there's<00:03:53.799> so<00:03:54.010> many<00:03:54.160> ups<00:03:54.459> and<00:03:54.670> downs<00:03:54.970> and

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
sport there's so many ups and downs and

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.210 
sport there's so many ups and downs and
there's<00:03:55.600> probably<00:03:56.110> a<00:03:56.200> few<00:03:56.260> more<00:03:56.590> downs<00:03:56.920> and

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
there's probably a few more downs and

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.640 
there's probably a few more downs and
ups<00:03:57.340> I<00:03:57.760> see<00:03:58.570> them<00:03:58.660> all<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:59.019> time<00:03:59.049> people<00:03:59.620> that

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
ups I see them all the time people that

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.009 
ups I see them all the time people that
go<00:04:01.519> to<00:04:01.580> the<00:04:01.760> riding<00:04:02.180> schools<00:04:02.540> and<00:04:02.840> so<00:04:02.989> forth

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
go to the riding schools and so forth

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:04.869 
go to the riding schools and so forth
and<00:04:03.470> come<00:04:03.680> out<00:04:03.830> and<00:04:04.010> then<00:04:04.099> find<00:04:04.400> out<00:04:04.580> that's

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 
and come out and then find out that's

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.630 
and come out and then find out that's
not<00:04:04.970> really<00:04:05.510> what<00:04:05.690> they<00:04:05.810> want<00:04:06.019> to<00:04:06.110> do<00:04:06.610> so<00:04:07.610> I

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
not really what they want to do so I

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.369 
not really what they want to do so I
think<00:04:07.730> the<00:04:07.940> main<00:04:08.090> thing<00:04:08.150> is<00:04:08.510> this<00:04:08.720> is<00:04:09.050> a<00:04:09.110> good

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:09.379 
think the main thing is this is a good

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:13.990 
think the main thing is this is a good
start<00:04:09.830> and<00:04:11.739> good<00:04:12.739> horses<00:04:13.099> ride<00:04:13.459> to<00:04:13.670> go<00:04:13.790> to<00:04:13.849> or

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
start and good horses ride to go to or

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000 
start and good horses ride to go to or
to<00:04:14.090> stay<00:04:14.300> away<00:04:14.480> from<00:04:14.540> bad<00:04:14.870> horses<00:04:15.319> I<00:04:15.440> always<00:04:15.739> I

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
to stay away from bad horses I always I

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.920 
to stay away from bad horses I always I
know<00:04:17.949> don't<00:04:18.949> leave<00:04:19.519> that<00:04:19.970> you<00:04:20.180> learn<00:04:20.359> much<00:04:20.660> by

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930
