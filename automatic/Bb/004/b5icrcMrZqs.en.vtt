and such it has no carrier IQ as well
which<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.219> nice<00:00:47.399> what<00:00:47.820> your<00:00:47.910> carrier<00:00:48.570> can't

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809

carrier<00:00:51.270> IQ<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.960> should<00:00:52.079> probably<00:00:52.170> look

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
carrier IQ is you should probably look

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.810 
carrier IQ is you should probably look
into<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.860> but<00:00:53.699> yeah<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:54.140> has<00:00:55.399> added<00:00:56.399> mods<00:00:56.579> it
