00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
video and audio and interestingly the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.810 
video and audio and interestingly the
audio<00:01:13.619> actually<00:01:14.340> comes<00:01:14.549> from<00:01:14.640> your

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
audio actually comes from your

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.550 
audio actually comes from your
microphone<00:01:15.360> instead<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.930> game<00:01:16.140> or<00:01:16.380> app

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
microphone instead of the game or app

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.160 
microphone instead of the game or app
and<00:01:17.090> so<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.150> can<00:01:18.330> actually<00:01:18.540> do<00:01:18.900> a

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
and so you can actually do a

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.840 
and so you can actually do a
walk-through<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.280> know<00:01:20.430> where<00:01:20.700> your

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
walk-through you know where your

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.539 
walk-through you know where your
speaking<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.750> records<00:01:22.020> both<00:01:22.439> from<00:01:23.340> your

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
speaking and it records both from your

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.880 
speaking and it records both from your
device<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.720> can<00:01:24.750> choose<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.409> limit<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
device and you can choose to limit the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.640 
device and you can choose to limit the
duration<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.909> overall<00:01:27.330> it's<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.170> really<00:01:28.200> high

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
duration and overall it's a really high

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.710 
duration and overall it's a really high
quality<00:01:28.680> app<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.520> can<00:01:29.670> also<00:01:29.850> pause<00:01:30.299> your

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
quality app you can also pause your

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.010 
quality app you can also pause your
recording<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:32.610> export<00:01:33.060> files<00:01:33.299> are<00:01:33.689> great

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
recording and the export files are great

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.710 
recording and the export files are great

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
mp4 so like I said earlier it goes to

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.929 
mp4 so like I said earlier it goes to
