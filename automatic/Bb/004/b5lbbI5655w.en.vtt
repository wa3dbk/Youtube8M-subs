00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:31.069 

check<00:00:00.539> this<00:00:00.810> took<00:00:01.709> the<00:00:01.829> belt<00:00:02.070> off

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:31.079 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:38.520 

where's<00:00:32.079> the<00:00:32.230> noise<00:00:32.500> go<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.930> got<00:00:38.350> a<00:00:38.379> new

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
where's the noise go so got a new

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.889 
where's the noise go so got a new
alternator<00:00:38.800> around<00:00:39.220> here<00:00:39.399> got<00:00:39.850> a<00:00:39.899> rebuilt

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899 
alternator around here got a rebuilt

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:43.530 
alternator around here got a rebuilt
power<00:00:41.199> steering<00:00:41.620> pump<00:00:41.890> I<00:00:42.300> think<00:00:43.300> was<00:00:43.390> actually

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540 
power steering pump I think was actually

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.369 
power steering pump I think was actually
tight<00:00:43.989> enough<00:00:44.230> first<00:00:44.530> tournament<00:00:45.100> what<00:00:45.309> I

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
tight enough first tournament what I

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.819 
tight enough first tournament what I
think<00:00:47.379> it's<00:00:47.500> okay<00:00:47.860> that's<00:00:47.980> a<00:00:48.100> normal<00:00:48.309> noise

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
think it's okay that's a normal noise

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.939 
think it's okay that's a normal noise
but<00:00:51.239> crank<00:00:52.239> pulley<00:00:52.540> a<00:00:52.870> tighten<00:00:53.680> all<00:00:53.800> those

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
but crank pulley a tighten all those

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.260 
but crank pulley a tighten all those
bolts<00:00:54.370> I<00:00:54.489> had<00:00:54.670> that<00:00:55.079> had<00:00:56.079> the<00:00:56.230> balancer<00:00:56.800> off

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
bolts I had that had the balancer off

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.360 
bolts I had that had the balancer off
and<00:00:58.270> I<00:00:58.329> took<00:00:58.390> the<00:00:58.840> office<00:00:59.230> for<00:00:59.530> office<00:01:00.190> to

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
and I took the office for office to

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.300 
and I took the office for office to
inspect<00:01:00.760> it<00:01:00.910> like<00:01:01.239> years<00:01:01.690> ago<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:03.869> yeah<00:01:05.310> those

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
inspect it like years ago so yeah those

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.249 
inspect it like years ago so yeah those
actually<00:01:06.700> took<00:01:06.880> a<00:01:06.940> little<00:01:07.180> bit<00:01:07.420> a<00:01:07.690> little<00:01:08.140> bit

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
actually took a little bit a little bit

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:09.570 
actually took a little bit a little bit
with<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:08.470> impact<00:01:08.860> I<00:01:09.009> can't<00:01:09.220> really<00:01:09.340> get<00:01:09.550> a

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
with the impact I can't really get a

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.310 
with the impact I can't really get a
torque<00:01:09.880> wrench<00:01:10.060> on<00:01:10.330> it<00:01:10.360> so<00:01:10.750> accurately

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
torque wrench on it so accurately

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.919 
torque wrench on it so accurately
torquing<00:01:11.880> but<00:01:12.880> another<00:01:13.270> thing<00:01:13.509> is<00:01:13.630> the<00:01:13.720> belt

00:01:13.919 --> 00:01:13.929 
torquing but another thing is the belt

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:15.960 
torquing but another thing is the belt
tensioner<00:01:14.380> belt<00:01:14.649> tensioners<00:01:15.130> calmly<00:01:15.729> or

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
tensioner belt tensioners calmly or

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.850 
tensioner belt tensioners calmly or
really<00:01:16.720> crap<00:01:17.110> on<00:01:17.289> these<00:01:17.440> cars

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860

it's a gates one meaning cannon up the

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.680 
it's a gates one meaning cannon up the
bearings<00:01:20.770> made<00:01:20.950> in<00:01:21.750> China<00:01:24.210> one<00:01:25.210> left<00:01:25.450> a<00:01:25.539> little

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
bearings made in China one left a little

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.160 
bearings made in China one left a little
bit<00:01:25.929> loose<00:01:26.170> side-to-side<00:01:26.619> not<00:01:27.160> that<00:01:27.399> bad

know if I could be doing it maybe I'll
throw<00:01:37.329> another<00:01:37.450> tensioner<00:01:38.110> on<00:01:38.170> here<00:01:38.500> only<00:01:39.430> put

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
throw another tensioner on here only put

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.249 
throw another tensioner on here only put
like<00:01:39.850> three<00:01:40.060> home<00:01:40.360> on<00:01:40.570> and<00:01:40.780> over<00:01:40.960> the<00:01:41.049> last

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
like three home on and over the last

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:42.810 
like three home on and over the last
time<00:01:41.530> for<00:01:41.799> the<00:01:41.829> tensioner<00:01:42.310> on<00:01:42.430> I<00:01:42.460> kind<00:01:42.759> of

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
time for the tensioner on I kind of

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.899 
time for the tensioner on I kind of
fixed<00:01:43.119> it<00:01:43.270> so<00:01:44.189> see<00:01:45.189> what<00:01:45.340> happens

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
fixed it so see what happens

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.080 
fixed it so see what happens
maybe<00:01:46.390> another<00:01:47.140> tensioner<00:01:47.710> I<00:01:48.030> don't<00:01:49.030> know

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
maybe another tensioner I don't know

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.330 
maybe another tensioner I don't know
it's<00:01:49.420> not<00:01:49.509> the<00:01:49.659> flexplate

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
it's not the flexplate

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.859 
it's not the flexplate
it's<00:01:51.340> not<00:01:51.460> that<00:01:51.700> much<00:01:51.820> every<00:01:52.060> piece<00:01:52.210> of<00:01:52.630> I

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
it's not that much every piece of I

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.010 
it's not that much every piece of I
thought<00:01:53.140> it<00:01:53.320> was<00:01:54.060> but<00:01:55.060> uh<00:01:55.090> you<00:01:55.659> know<00:01:55.750> let's<00:01:55.899> get

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
thought it was but uh you know let's get

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.080 
thought it was but uh you know let's get
this<00:01:56.140> thing<00:01:56.320> back<00:01:56.469> together<00:01:56.790> another<00:01:57.790> thing<00:01:57.969> I

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
this thing back together another thing I

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.959 
this thing back together another thing I
was<00:01:58.180> thinking<00:01:58.240> about<00:01:58.570> maybe<00:01:59.729> could<00:02:00.729> be<00:02:00.759> like<00:02:00.939> a

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
was thinking about maybe could be like a

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:03.030 
was thinking about maybe could be like a
belt<00:02:01.299> alignment<00:02:01.810> issue<00:02:01.899> to<00:02:02.229> some<00:02:02.590> dummy

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
belt alignment issue to some dummy

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.410 
belt alignment issue to some dummy
fluttering<00:02:04.860> back<00:02:05.860> and<00:02:06.070> forth<00:02:06.310> cuz<00:02:07.060> it's<00:02:07.329> a

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
fluttering back and forth cuz it's a

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.389 
fluttering back and forth cuz it's a
pump<00:02:07.630> you<00:02:07.930> know<00:02:08.140> that's<00:02:08.259> that<00:02:08.289> pulley<00:02:08.619> power

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
pump you know that's that pulley power

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.069 
pump you know that's that pulley power
steering<00:02:09.789> pump<00:02:10.060> pretty<00:02:10.479> sure<00:02:10.690> it's<00:02:10.929> like

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:11.079 
steering pump pretty sure it's like

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:12.600 
steering pump pretty sure it's like
almost<00:02:11.470> identical<00:02:12.010> to<00:02:12.040> what<00:02:12.160> it<00:02:12.340> was<00:02:12.459> before

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
almost identical to what it was before

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.880 
almost identical to what it was before
belch<00:02:13.239> we're<00:02:13.900> in<00:02:14.049> the<00:02:14.230> same<00:02:14.410> spot<00:02:14.709> and

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
belch we're in the same spot and

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.920 
belch we're in the same spot and
everything<00:02:14.980> it's<00:02:15.400> not<00:02:15.489> twisting<00:02:16.000> it<00:02:16.150> because

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
everything it's not twisting it because

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.630 
everything it's not twisting it because
we<00:02:17.110> can<00:02:17.290> get<00:02:17.440> a<00:02:17.470> belt<00:02:17.739> noise<00:02:17.980> if<00:02:18.400> two

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
we can get a belt noise if two

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.539 
we can get a belt noise if two
accessories<00:02:18.970> twisted<00:02:19.690> a<00:02:19.750> little<00:02:19.870> bit

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
accessories twisted a little bit

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.490 
accessories twisted a little bit
alternator<00:02:21.549> maybe<00:02:22.090> it's<00:02:22.329> a<00:02:23.019> alternator

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
alternator maybe it's a alternator

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.280 
alternator maybe it's a alternator
I<00:02:23.799> don't<00:02:24.040> know<00:02:24.239> you<00:02:25.239> see<00:02:25.450> Delco<00:02:25.900> made<00:02:26.140> in

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
I don't know you see Delco made in

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.910 
I don't know you see Delco made in
Mexico<00:02:26.739> well<00:02:27.040> really<00:02:27.459> a<00:02:27.519> Remi<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:28.090> swiped<00:02:28.450> gold

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
Mexico well really a Remi I swiped gold

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.650 
Mexico well really a Remi I swiped gold
gold<00:02:29.920> steer<00:02:30.190> another<00:02:30.970> thing<00:02:31.209> I<00:02:31.239> suppose<00:02:31.450> to

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
gold steer another thing I suppose to

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.420 
gold steer another thing I suppose to
your<00:02:31.780> bracket<00:02:32.260> that<00:02:32.620> goes<00:02:32.680> here<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.190> there<00:02:33.400> but

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
your bracket that goes here to there but

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.980 
your bracket that goes here to there but

up against with this tension or back on

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.930 
up against with this tension or back on
hope<00:02:47.470> for<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.710> best<00:02:47.920> maybe<00:02:48.220> tightening<00:02:48.730> that

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.800 

little<00:03:37.580> bit<00:03:37.730> quieter<00:03:38.270> huh

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
little bit quieter huh

I<00:03:40.390> still<00:03:41.390> say<00:03:41.599> that<00:03:41.630> tension<00:03:42.440> is<00:03:42.590> junk<00:03:42.860> telling

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
I still say that tension is junk telling

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
so easy to turn to

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.809 
so easy to turn to
it<00:04:01.730> is<00:04:01.850> a<00:04:01.880> real<00:04:02.209> jock<00:04:02.959> belt<00:04:03.380> setup<00:04:04.069> that's
