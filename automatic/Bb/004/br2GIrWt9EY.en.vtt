00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.980
 but that's what I brought you that put 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:17.020
 what is your name 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.340
 pedreira no no no no no 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.410
 I brought that to you so that you would have what 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.870
 said father was what he put father earl in 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:28.990
 the future and what he put as it is called pp 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.990
 lie to me why I brought you what happened 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:38.440
 andrés estupiñán now 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:38.440
 yes, I do not care 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.520
 if it was hard or if they were two 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.320
 now let's go to what they were 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.230
 trusting that the two minds 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.079
 they are not telling us that it is not possible 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.320
 I have to leave 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.469
 it is there I see it and if I have 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.510
 discrepancies 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:09.240
 history is created but that 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:11.880
 come all arguing is these fifteen 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.530
 twenty years and in twenty years not 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.430
 They know that inbreeding has 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.430
 worked at home 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:35.549
 Andres despite what has happened to that 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.409
 good keeps line is one of the few 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.130
 in Havana that keeps good lines 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.130
 for the ancients 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.299
 that was pure baths that said that 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.090
 andrés your opinion before what there is 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.090
 past 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.380
 where they see that is separate if not the 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.270
 you can discover and can only that what 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.430
 can go find 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.430
 l of the previous form 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.370
 but hey you worry you do not care 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.890
 backwards 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.710
 the sea 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.020
 certainly here in Havana who has not 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.790
 made dragons who has not done another 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.930
 I have with the pigeon quina 10 saints 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.650
 in the dove here nobody knows 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.650
 twenty 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:55.210
 now what to act count 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:59.470
 now right now still pretty 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:10.060
 genetically consanguineous of that line 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:20.470
 if he is the only one in almost all 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:22.830
 you have consanguinity of knowledge and 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.830
 if you have them
