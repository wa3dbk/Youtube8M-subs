00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 The cat is exposed at night 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.569
 were and we found it as 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.220
 we got work early on by that 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.599
 it had snowed, the basket was fuller 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.030
 snow and we did it only once did 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.130
 not taken for full then to us 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.420
 gone to the building and moved 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.340
 then we clicked on it 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.810
 The zookeeper , we thought with city 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.640
 stand basket not stand yesterday 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.439
 maybe you should have a look 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.539
 that always went back and have 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.250
 seen that it moves and this 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.300
 blanket under this neckline 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.090
 tragic blanket 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.030
 There was a very young cat in it 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.219
 scared in a totally dirty 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.930
 Towel wrapped up so she herself 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.899
 Can protect you from the cold 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.559
 It's totally dirty, fuller 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.719
 urine full of feces full of dirt and yes and 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.430
 of course the frustration and the zones 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.260
 We are big again with the 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.059
 animal directly in op have gone first 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.230
 sometimes free the box from the cable ties 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.820
 that was really right too 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.510
 dangerous the theater no chance 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.590
 to look for a warm blanket yes 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.620
 seen that one again an exposed 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.329
 cat in the basket sat there the animal 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.739
 has been exposed, it is natural 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.810
 a violation of the Animal Welfare Act 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.810
 and of course we have an ad 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.490
 refunded if that then results 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.290
 whether the holder is detected 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.810
 Of course in question in cats anyway 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.430
 but of course we hope for that, too 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.630
 great article on facebook that me 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.240
 but people report the animal 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.979
 maybe recognize or because what 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.740
 it would have been a cat noticed 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.270
 recently which is suddenly gone and 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.740
 that people will contact us but 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.240
 when cats come that few before us 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.130
 are now in our shelter in 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.740
 the quarantine station for the cats 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.390
 by exposing the animal 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.220
 We do not know anything about her 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.439
 she was vaccinated if she ever had one 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.210
 wormkur the flight or get something 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.070
 has and therefore it must first with 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.750
 sit in the quarantine until the 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.939
 vaccine protection is not allowed before 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.649
 to our other more animals doing the 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.240
 cat without us knowing if you 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.740
 is vaccinated or if she ever lives or 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.329
 Klokov got to the others 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.710
 Of course, putting animals on is 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.869
 danger very big that I have ours 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.649
 actually healthy animals in the animal 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.149
 infect 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.649
 we can not do it with certainty 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.340
 say maybe yes is also vaccinated 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.079
 were and 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.519
 is very healthy, but we know it 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:18.030
 just not and that is why in the 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:28.349
 quarantine for girls yes they would be 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:30.090
 There are migrants from cats 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.459
 very often also exposed just as 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.470
 The sammer has me very many in baskets 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.000
 abandoned cats in the forest and knows where 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.150
 synonymous always ask where you the 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.340
 cat does not necessarily find so fast 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.060
 because I have to very the 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.200
 irresponsibility of the 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.950
 human grade if you are here 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.180
 assuming you can do that too 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.650
 really talk to us and the cat 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.720
 completely regular 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.040
 and she makes such an impression that 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.530
 a flat-cat she has no now 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.110
 dense winterfell strays that's up 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.150
 no case a cat alone in the 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.030
 get a flat or too little outside 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.680
 it forgives in winter a flat cat 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.510
 which does not finish the winterfell 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.459
 has for which it may already be problems 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.440
 outside with our wicker basket 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.880
 what is now not protected from the wind 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.340
 not really moisture protection of the 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.109
 unbolted to the day 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.180
 cold wind the format had then 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.370
 already too lucky had that 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.349
 not really devices did wise ours 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.180
 Cat of China will be and then cold wind 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:30.239
 is exposed then can already 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:32.099
 One night outside heavy week 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.380
 thinks there are a lot of them 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.540
 reasons some make themselves thoughtless 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.380
 theirs are next to clear what im 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.090
 Animal costs may not have 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.739
 thought she was at the space need 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.190
 what time will the animal raise 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.410
 have to 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.269
 It may be a change of residence of the reason 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.859
 his couple are the dog , for example 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.329
 buy and then give yourself a break 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.650
 Also like your dog off because she 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.540
 who can decide who the animal 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.840
 take along there are many 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.810
 different reasons so currently have 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.849
 At our core we only have about 60 animals 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.139
 there are about 30 of them for us 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.840
 Now farms are looking for the 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:07.830
 can record as a mouse catcher 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.840
 Of course we have our theme 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.910
 Many old animals carry the animals small 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.650
 cats all looking for that at home 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.570
 Siegel difficult now comes too 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.130
 soon the time again where legal 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.170
 cats come to us to the shelter yet 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.120
 small cats always very fast 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.200
 again crowded and all the animals 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.720
 Of course, I want to go somewhere 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.820
 the a girls are accommodated 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.590
 in the mediation already desired 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.450
 but rather in space time where 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.790
 one is also cuddly on the couch 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.140
 in the months now where it gets warm where 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.120
 everything want to move again and 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.250
 go out patients are already rather 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.770
 the dogs again the more coveted im 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.360
 season phenomenon so far you can tell 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.490
 that in the winter months in the 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.410
 church months rather the cats 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.510
 go or small cats then 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.370
 even if they are sitting in the shelter and in the 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.750
 spring when people move 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.370
 if the sun comes out then 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.040
 all become athletic and active again 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.160
 every year then comes both children 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.160
 Yes
