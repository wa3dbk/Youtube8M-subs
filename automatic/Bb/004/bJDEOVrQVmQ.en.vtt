we'll<00:00:13.440> be<00:00:13.530> talking<00:00:13.710> about<00:00:13.950> how<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.429> set<00:00:14.790> up

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
we'll be talking about how to set up

we'll be talking about how to set up
your<00:00:15.000> rates<00:00:15.210> correctly<00:00:15.839> there<00:00:16.410> seems<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.680> be<00:00:16.830> a

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
your rates correctly there seems to be a

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.590 
your rates correctly there seems to be a
lot<00:00:17.070> of<00:00:17.100> confusion<00:00:17.520> about<00:00:17.730> race<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.390> what<00:00:18.510> the

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
lot of confusion about race and what the

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.510 
lot of confusion about race and what the
right<00:00:18.779> settings<00:00:19.109> are<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.560> lot<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.130> people<00:00:20.460> who

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
right settings are a lot of people who

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.130 
right settings are a lot of people who
don't<00:00:20.760> play<00:00:20.939> competitively<00:00:21.570> will<00:00:21.810> probably

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
don't play competitively will probably

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.080 
don't play competitively will probably
not<00:00:22.320> have<00:00:22.410> heard<00:00:22.590> anything<00:00:22.800> about<00:00:23.220> rates<00:00:23.550> and

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
not have heard anything about rates and

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.519 
not have heard anything about rates and
that's<00:00:24.330> no<00:00:24.480> surprise<00:00:24.660> as<00:00:25.109> they<00:00:25.230> really<00:00:25.500> are

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
that's no surprise as they really are

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.019 
that's no surprise as they really are

notifications<00:00:27.689> rates<00:00:28.529> are<00:00:28.710> basically

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
notifications rates are basically

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.710 
notifications rates are basically

now<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:04.979> need<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.280> briefly<00:01:05.580> explain<00:01:05.760> what

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
now I need to briefly explain what

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.730 
now I need to briefly explain what
server<00:01:06.479> tick<00:01:06.659> rate<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.290> how<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.619> can

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
server tick rate is and how it can

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.800 
server tick rate is and how it can
affect<00:01:07.860> your<00:01:08.220> game<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:09.060> every<00:01:09.360> server<00:01:09.570> will

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
affect your game so every server will

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.660 
affect your game so every server will
have<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> tick<00:01:10.200> rate<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.950> higher<00:01:11.159> tick<00:01:11.460> rate

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
have a tick rate the higher tick rate

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.000 
have a tick rate the higher tick rate
the<00:01:11.850> bear<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.570> csgo<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.320> server's<00:01:13.619> tick<00:01:13.830> rate

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
the bear in csgo the server's tick rate

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.080 
the bear in csgo the server's tick rate
will<00:01:14.159> vary<00:01:14.430> from<00:01:14.700> over<00:01:14.850> 64<00:01:15.570> 100<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.090> 128

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
will vary from over 64 100 to and 128

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.090 
will vary from over 64 100 to and 128
when<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.020> have<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> higher<00:01:19.439> amount<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.860> ticks

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
when you have a higher amount of ticks

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.679 
when you have a higher amount of ticks
it<00:01:20.369> means<00:01:20.549> your<00:01:20.700> world<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.060> updated<00:01:21.509> with

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
it means your world is updated with

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.480 
it means your world is updated with
server<00:01:21.990> information<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.650> lot<00:01:22.979> faster

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
server information a lot faster

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.490 
server information a lot faster
resulting<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.450> best<00:01:24.659> possible<00:01:25.110> gameplay

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
resulting in the best possible gameplay

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.350 
resulting in the best possible gameplay
you<00:01:26.100> want<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.340> make<00:01:26.460> sure<00:01:26.490> your<00:01:26.820> update<00:01:27.180> rate

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
you want to make sure your update rate

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.300 
you want to make sure your update rate
and<00:01:27.540> CMV<00:01:27.960> rate<00:01:28.200> match<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.590> server<00:01:28.829> tick<00:01:29.100> rate

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
and CMV rate match the server tick rate

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.730 
and CMV rate match the server tick rate
at<00:01:29.490> all<00:01:29.640> times<00:01:29.939> if<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.900> use<00:01:31.110> an<00:01:31.290> update<00:01:31.409> rate

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
at all times if you use an update rate

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.770 
at all times if you use an update rate
is<00:01:31.950> lower<00:01:32.220> than<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.549> server<00:01:32.790> tick<00:01:33.030> rate<00:01:33.240> then

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
is lower than the server tick rate then

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.450 
is lower than the server tick rate then
you<00:01:33.869> ignore<00:01:34.020> crucial<00:01:34.560> information<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.340> you

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
you ignore crucial information and you

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.980 
you ignore crucial information and you
force<00:01:35.729> your<00:01:35.850> game<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.270> predict<00:01:36.600> what's

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
force your game to predict what's

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.020 
force your game to predict what's
happening<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:37.920> can<00:01:38.159> result<00:01:38.310> in<00:01:38.579> poor<00:01:38.820> hit

you<00:01:47.340> are<00:01:47.399> playing<00:01:47.729> on<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.909> valve<00:01:48.210> matchmaking

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
you are playing on a valve matchmaking

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.469 
you are playing on a valve matchmaking
server<00:01:49.110> with<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.380> 64<00:01:50.070> tick<00:01:50.280> rate<00:01:50.490> your<00:01:51.149> update

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
server with a 64 tick rate your update

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.630 
server with a 64 tick rate your update
rate<00:01:51.659> in<00:01:51.780> CMD<00:01:52.110> rate<00:01:52.439> will<00:01:52.590> adjust<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.100> 64

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
rate in CMD rate will adjust to 64

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.300 
rate in CMD rate will adjust to 64
automatically<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:55.290> that's<00:01:55.470> pretty<00:01:55.710> much<00:01:55.799> it

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
automatically so that's pretty much it

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.499 
automatically so that's pretty much it
use<00:01:56.610> these<00:01:56.790> rates<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.329> should

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
use these rates and you should

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.690 
use these rates and you should
experience<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:58.049> lot<00:01:58.200> finer<00:01:58.500> gameplay<00:01:59.040> just

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
experience a lot finer gameplay just

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.700 
experience a lot finer gameplay just
make<00:01:59.909> sure<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.240> are<00:02:00.329> playing<00:02:00.540> on<00:02:00.719> 128<00:02:01.409> ticks

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
make sure you are playing on 128 ticks

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.440 
make sure you are playing on 128 ticks
server<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.280> there<00:02:02.460> should<00:02:02.610> be<00:02:02.640> no<00:02:02.729> problem

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450
