00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello girls so today we get 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.370
 find for a new video you 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.410
 will talk about American products 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:15.809
 fight in France so here I have 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:20.279
 started so that's saying here it looks like 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.050
 so what is the purpose for applications 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.500
 web with peanut butter and 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.289
 chocolate 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:31.080
 I bought them at 90 cents per 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:33.210
 package we will find taste like that so 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.210
 you can find them at giant and at 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.680
 leclerc I believe so if there are some 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.270
 supermarkets it takes departments of the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.510
 taste and so you go tomorrow serillon 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:48.860

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.860
 taste to tell you if even the mango 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:59.579

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.469

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.189

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:24.659
 paw a little bit like saying a little sand and 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:26.430

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.740

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.420
 I 'm just going to light so 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.619

 and there is everywhere there is singing 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:53.270
 at migros there is the same age and years 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:57.240

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:20.210
 had seen them so age and act 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:22.490
 an attack against me, I find that 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.630
 good there are a lot of people who 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.030
 do not like cocoa butter but me 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.070

 So here we go to the last thing 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:00.080
 intrigue it's always there yeah that to 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.480
 fruit it's a taste it's like the 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.150

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.140
 last thing it's river so I 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.520
 taken strawberry so frozen for a little 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.280
 longer than there I just bought

 but you talk about products that we 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.620
