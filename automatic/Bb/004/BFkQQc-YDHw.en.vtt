to<00:00:41.040> start<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.460> weekend<00:00:41.760> we<00:00:41.879> needed<00:00:42.210> that

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
to start the weekend we needed that

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.139 
to start the weekend we needed that
especially<00:00:43.890> after<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.430> first<00:00:44.640> weekend<00:00:45.000> we

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
especially after the first weekend we

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.470 
especially after the first weekend we
were<00:00:45.239> really<00:00:45.450> quite<00:00:45.840> poor<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.789> I<00:00:47.789> think<00:00:48.420> I

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
were really quite poor and I think I

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.700 
were really quite poor and I think I
think<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.809> went<00:00:48.899> pretty<00:00:48.989> well<00:00:49.170> but<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.620> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
think it went pretty well but in the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.740 
think it went pretty well but in the
week<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:50.010> had<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.190> cup<00:00:50.489> match<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:51.000> we<00:00:51.539> won<00:00:51.570> that

in<00:00:51.960> golden<00:00:52.289> goal<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.559> was<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.680> really<00:00:52.800> good

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
in golden goal that was a really good

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.529

other time throughout the week maybe the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.689 
other time throughout the week maybe the
friday<00:00:57.899> i<00:00:58.289> haven't<00:00:58.949> really<00:00:59.129> decided<00:00:59.309> too<00:00:59.550> much

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
friday i haven't really decided too much

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:00.439 
friday i haven't really decided too much
in<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.850> moment<00:00:59.940> but<00:01:00.149> this<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> first

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
in the moment but this is the first

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.510 
in the moment but this is the first
match<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.260> against<00:01:01.530> at<00:01:01.710> nat<00:01:01.890> cabretta<00:01:02.250> i

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
match this is against at nat cabretta i

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.590 
match this is against at nat cabretta i
think<00:01:02.699> that's<00:01:02.850> how<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:02.969> say<00:01:03.210> i'm<00:01:03.359> not<00:01:03.480> too

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
think that's how you say i'm not too

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.840 
think that's how you say i'm not too
sure<00:01:03.629> never<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.769> pronounce<00:01:05.010> names<00:01:05.339> but<00:01:05.700> this

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
sure never can pronounce names but this

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.550 
sure never can pronounce names but this

reason being that throughout this

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.660

that<00:03:12.959> much<00:03:13.140> spacing<00:03:13.560> see<00:03:13.709> from<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:13.920> replay

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
that much spacing see from the replay

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.370 
that much spacing see from the replay
here<00:03:14.490> but<00:03:15.360> unlucky<00:03:15.690> with<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.870> people<00:03:16.140> missing

lower<00:03:20.340> left<00:03:20.580> side<00:03:20.790> which<00:03:21.150> is<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.300> good<00:03:21.510> shot<00:03:21.750> I

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
lower left side which is a good shot I

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.600 
lower left side which is a good shot I
should<00:03:22.080> have<00:03:22.170> probably<00:03:22.260> had<00:03:22.530> it<00:03:22.610> another

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
should have probably had it another

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.840 
should have probably had it another
chance<00:03:23.700> here<00:03:24.150> easily<00:03:24.750> collected<00:03:25.290> by<00:03:25.440> me

nothing<00:03:26.850> really<00:03:26.970> to<00:03:27.180> trilogy<00:03:27.570> at<00:03:27.660> this<00:03:27.750> point

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
nothing really to trilogy at this point

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.660 
nothing really to trilogy at this point
except<00:03:28.320> for<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.500> one<00:03:28.650> go<00:03:28.860> that<00:03:28.980> they<00:03:29.100> had<00:03:29.340> they

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
except for the one go that they had they

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.430 
except for the one go that they had they
didn't<00:03:30.209> think<00:03:30.330> they<00:03:30.540> outplayed<00:03:30.959> us<00:03:31.170> at<00:03:31.320> all

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
didn't think they outplayed us at all

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.979 
didn't think they outplayed us at all
really<00:03:31.800> and<00:03:31.980> I<00:03:32.730> think<00:03:33.090> we<00:03:33.239> all<00:03:33.269> we<00:03:33.630> play<00:03:33.810> to<00:03:33.870> a

really and I think we all we play to a

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.380 
really and I think we all we play to a
similar<00:03:34.230> level<00:03:34.470> in<00:03:34.680> this<00:03:34.769> match<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:35.880> is<00:03:36.180> either

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
similar level in this match it is either

similar level in this match it is either
going<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:36.690> go<00:03:36.810> one<00:03:36.989> way<00:03:37.019> on<00:03:37.200> FIFA<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:37.680> that's

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
going to go one way on FIFA and that's

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.740 
going to go one way on FIFA and that's
how<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.130> is<00:03:38.220> on<00:03:38.250> fifa<00:03:38.700> fifa<00:03:39.209> is<00:03:39.420> never<00:03:39.600> that

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
how it is on fifa fifa is never that

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.560 
how it is on fifa fifa is never that
great<00:03:39.959> it<00:03:40.230> is<00:03:40.260> like<00:03:40.800> that<00:03:40.920> sometimes<00:03:40.980> and<00:03:41.760> a

bore<00:03:48.630> their<00:03:48.750> goalie<00:03:49.459> and<00:03:50.459> we<00:03:50.940> did<00:03:51.330> need<00:03:51.480> to

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
bore their goalie and we did need to

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.270 
bore their goalie and we did need to
beat<00:03:51.690> these<00:03:51.780> guys<00:03:51.840> and<00:03:52.410> we<00:03:52.560> all<00:03:52.680> knew<00:03:52.830> that<00:03:53.040> and

beat these guys and we all knew that and

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.580 
beat these guys and we all knew that and
I<00:03:53.459> think<00:03:53.489> we're<00:03:53.760> concentrating<00:03:54.060> on<00:03:54.570> one<00:03:55.500> of

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
I think we're concentrating on one of

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.410 
I think we're concentrating on one of
the<00:03:55.650> defenders<00:03:56.070> is<00:03:56.489> playing<00:03:56.760> really<00:03:56.880> really

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
the defenders is playing really really

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.530 
the defenders is playing really really
really<00:03:57.570> stupid<00:03:58.130> and<00:03:59.130> we<00:03:59.250> and<00:03:59.489> we<00:03:59.519> knew<00:03:59.730> he<00:04:00.510> was

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
really stupid and we and we knew he was

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.150 
really stupid and we and we knew he was
maybe<00:04:00.720> in<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:00.989> left<00:04:01.170> in<00:04:01.380> the<00:04:01.410> back<00:04:01.470> area<00:04:01.769> I

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
maybe in the left in the back area I

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.630 
maybe in the left in the back area I
believe<00:04:02.790> multi<00:04:03.209> short<00:04:03.420> of<00:04:03.570> my<00:04:03.690> head<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:04.640> he

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
believe multi short of my head and he

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.740 
believe multi short of my head and he
should<00:04:05.820> have<00:04:05.910> had<00:04:06.030> he<00:04:06.090> should<00:04:06.390> have<00:04:06.480> been<00:04:06.600> in

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
should have had he should have been in

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.199 
should have had he should have been in
position<00:04:07.170> and<00:04:07.290> I<00:04:07.980> think<00:04:08.190> people<00:04:08.340> were<00:04:08.820> I<00:04:09.090> think

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
position and I think people were I think

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.880 
position and I think people were I think
people<00:04:09.540> are<00:04:09.630> watching<00:04:09.900> him<00:04:10.019> quite<00:04:10.230> a<00:04:10.260> lot<00:04:10.470> I'm

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
people are watching him quite a lot I'm

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.229 
people are watching him quite a lot I'm
not<00:04:11.010> too<00:04:11.160> sure<00:04:11.340> I<00:04:11.370> think<00:04:11.760> I<00:04:11.850> think<00:04:12.060> we<00:04:12.120> just

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
not too sure I think I think we just

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.390 
not too sure I think I think we just
generally<00:04:12.660> didn't<00:04:12.989> perform<00:04:13.140> to<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.130> best<00:04:14.160> of

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
generally didn't perform to the best of

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.009 
generally didn't perform to the best of
our<00:04:14.489> ability<00:04:14.850> I<00:04:14.880> came<00:04:15.180> out<00:04:15.299> there<00:04:15.450> to<00:04:15.570> punch<00:04:15.780> it

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
our ability I came out there to punch it

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.770 
our ability I came out there to punch it
I<00:04:16.200> needed<00:04:17.010> a<00:04:17.190> punchy<00:04:17.519> at<00:04:17.609> that<00:04:17.729> point<00:04:17.970> and<00:04:18.269> I

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
I needed a punchy at that point and I

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.900 
I needed a punchy at that point and I
don't<00:04:19.200> know<00:04:19.320> I<00:04:19.350> think<00:04:19.769> we<00:04:20.190> really<00:04:20.519> need<00:04:20.669> to

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
don't know I think we really need to

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.700 
don't know I think we really need to
make<00:04:21.780> the<00:04:21.900> most<00:04:21.959> of<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.200> transfer<00:04:22.560> window

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
the moment in the league as well it's

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.110

there's<00:05:01.300> only<00:05:01.479> really<00:05:01.599> close<00:05:01.930> gap<00:05:02.169> the<00:05:02.289> games

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
that we have lost have been for a really

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.710 
that we have lost have been for a really
close<00:05:05.160> annoyingly<00:05:06.160> close<00:05:06.520> sort<00:05:07.389> of<00:05:07.479> school

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
close annoyingly close sort of school

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.499

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
90th minute it was a bit of a pointless

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.939 
90th minute it was a bit of a pointless
tackle<00:05:12.970> but<00:05:13.780> obviously<00:05:14.289> then<00:05:14.560> they're<00:05:14.860> going

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:14.949 
tackle but obviously then they're going

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:16.740 
tackle but obviously then they're going
to<00:05:15.039> go<00:05:15.099> ahead<00:05:15.190> and<00:05:15.310> put<00:05:15.490> it<00:05:15.580> away<00:05:15.750> straight

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750
