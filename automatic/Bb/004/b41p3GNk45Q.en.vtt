00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.020
 the boy a doctor is one of the four 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.549
 branches of traditional Chinese medicine 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.889
 the first series of acupuncture by 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:12.740
 example in moxibustion then you have the 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.389
 manual therapy the twin poplar to the dgt 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.550
 pressure the siat on all the techniques 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.220
 similar then you have the herbal medicine 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.970
 which is the oral use of herbs and formulas 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.859
 and finally we have chi like chi 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.109
 kung looks like the king that and does not look like 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.109
 to the king who in the sense that in the 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.540
 King, what are you going to project? 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.030
 be undifferentiated universal energy not 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.550
 polarized you're just going to make 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.079
 channel between the patient's universe and 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.239
 let the patient and his energy 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.730
 own balance in the boy a 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.960
 very different doctor what are we going to 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.440
 do is first a diagnosis 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.339
 differential let's see exactly 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.379
 where is the imbalance in the 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:54.140
 patient let's see which organ is more 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:57.789
 let's see if it's a typology 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.620
 of difference by excess or by 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:03.199
 deficiency then let's drain or 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.720
 let's stimulate we have a series of 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.980
 factors that will contribute to the 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.380
 therapy be much 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.120
 powerful much more accurate much more 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.490
 directed and therefore the effect 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.610
 therapeutic is more dramatic instead of 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.580
 wait many sessions in little 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.990
 patient is already healing something else is also 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.360
 that not only the patient will receive 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.120
 passive energy but we 're going to give it 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.490
 recipes based on that differentiation 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.800
 what we have done in the course of chi kung 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.450
 doctor you will learn to give recipes to 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.040
 patient so that apart from the emission 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.010
 that he receives when he is with you in 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.480
 stretcher you can take it almost tell 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.850
 look at home three times a day during 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.610
 15 minutes a day you have to do this 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.880
 this this and this therefore we are 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.830
 accumulating more layers of the onion and the 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.659
 healing will be faster more powerful 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.700
 more dramatic what are we looking for 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.969
 another thing for or would be to have the expertise 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.819
 of reik and reiki is not very extensive 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:02.460
 theoretically the three levels four with 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.869
 a lot and expertise and then more then 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.539
 for those of you who have been doing 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.660
 the king who and you are looking for the most the course 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:11.879
 forgive the boy a therapeutic too 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.060
 We do this course as a branch but 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:17.069
 boy, a therapist is going to give you a lot 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.930
 more theoretical extension is going to give you many 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.180
 more tools and if you already come with a 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.519
 good base of the reiki you are going to carry 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.200
 your king that to the next level by 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.510
 so I recommend it to you as 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.250
 expansion of studies as beyond 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.230
 the mastery and the ricky is pretty 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.720
 limited chi kung is much more 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.840
 much more complete complex so 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.150
 say it also as you will be trying 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.910
 with cancer patients with diabetes 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.430
 with all kinds of harmful energies is 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.720
 important that you protect you for you 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.030
 So the first thing you are going to learn 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.500
 It is energetic protection for the 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.299
 cancer energy for example not 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.950
 penetrate your body and this 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.750
 energy protection then it serves to 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.700
 all kinds of vampires and hickeys 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.900
 energy that you can find in 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.870
 our personal life 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.659
 they are not a clinical practice finally 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.370
 you are going to learn to give recipes you are going to 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.760
 learn to protect you energetically and 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.489
 you will learn to project an energy 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.689
 differentiated and as a colophon what you're going to 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.019
 to do is that your personal culture 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:19.079
 of the energy cci will increase a lot 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:21.870
 more to think that there are ten methods of 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.430
 cultivation of chi and in the past is in 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.230
 the prohibition to cure others 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.769
 people so that the energy comes out of your 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.019
 body and they are together with the projection to 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.900
 advanced levels and the preparation of 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.780
 body for the transition from death to 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.220
 other non-physical planes then there is 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.900
 where we concentrate ourselves that 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.659
 means that the other nine levels 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.980
 you will dominate us therefore yours 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.230
 practice 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.250
 will increase much more and at the level 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.040
 personal 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.000
 you will reach higher levels of 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.000
 personal knowledge
