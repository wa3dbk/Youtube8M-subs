duty<00:03:06.280> was<00:03:06.549> to<00:03:06.579> pursue<00:03:07.409> using<00:03:08.430> competitive<00:03:09.430> in

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
duty was to pursue using competitive in

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.670 
duty was to pursue using competitive in
our<00:03:09.970> DLC<00:03:10.390> maps<00:03:10.599> in<00:03:10.840> competitive<00:03:11.230> play<00:03:11.260> then<00:03:11.650> I

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
our DLC maps in competitive play then I

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.649 
our DLC maps in competitive play then I
think<00:03:11.980> it<00:03:12.040> would<00:03:12.159> really<00:03:12.310> be<00:03:12.430> a<00:03:12.730> huge<00:03:13.060> huge

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
think it would really be a huge huge

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:15.899 
think it would really be a huge huge
thing<00:03:13.810> for<00:03:13.989> not<00:03:14.409> only<00:03:14.579> competitive<00:03:15.579> call<00:03:15.760> duty

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 
thing for not only competitive call duty

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:17.550 
thing for not only competitive call duty
but<00:03:16.090> call<00:03:16.299> duty<00:03:16.480> itself<00:03:16.870> because<00:03:17.230> I<00:03:17.349> mean

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
but call duty itself because I mean

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.740 
but call duty itself because I mean
ethical<00:03:18.459> duty<00:03:18.670> is<00:03:18.730> probably<00:03:19.000> one<00:03:19.569> of<00:03:19.599> the

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
ethical duty is probably one of the

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.119 
ethical duty is probably one of the
biggest<00:03:19.930> things<00:03:20.260> one<00:03:20.680> of<00:03:20.739> the<00:03:20.829> two<00:03:20.950> biggest

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:21.129
