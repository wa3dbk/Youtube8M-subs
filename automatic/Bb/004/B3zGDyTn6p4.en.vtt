00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.230 

so<00:00:00.299> far<00:00:00.570> I<00:00:00.599> think<00:00:00.780> we've<00:00:01.399> put<00:00:02.399> in<00:00:02.610> what<00:00:02.790> maybe

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
so far I think we've put in what maybe

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.650 
so far I think we've put in what maybe
two<00:00:03.480> or<00:00:03.510> three<00:00:03.659> sets<00:00:04.080> and<00:00:05.000> they're<00:00:06.000> all<00:00:06.120> motion

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
two or three sets and they're all motion

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.660 
two or three sets and they're all motion
kind<00:00:07.500> of<00:00:07.589> offenses<00:00:08.040> where<00:00:08.160> we're<00:00:08.309> working<00:00:08.610> off

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
kind of offenses where we're working off

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.879 
kind of offenses where we're working off
of<00:00:08.730> each<00:00:08.940> other<00:00:09.349> kind<00:00:10.349> of<00:00:10.410> staying<00:00:10.650> away<00:00:10.860> from

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
of each other kind of staying away from

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.230 
of each other kind of staying away from
the<00:00:11.099> ball<00:00:11.280> screen<00:00:11.670> as<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:12.480> primary<00:00:13.080> option<00:00:14.240> or

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
the ball screen as a primary option or

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.269 
the ball screen as a primary option or
more<00:00:15.540> just<00:00:15.690> cutting<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.320> screening<00:00:17.070> for<00:00:17.220> each

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
more just cutting and screening for each

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.070 
more just cutting and screening for each
other<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.609> moving<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.910> ball<00:00:18.060> it's<00:00:18.869> like<00:00:18.990> you

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
other and moving the ball it's like you

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.750 
other and moving the ball it's like you
said<00:00:19.170> everybody<00:00:19.529> can<00:00:19.800> make<00:00:20.070> plays<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.490> pass

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
said everybody can make plays and pass

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.120 
said everybody can make plays and pass
so<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.270> think<00:00:22.050> that's<00:00:22.260> what<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.710> know<00:00:22.830> coach

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
so I think that's what you know coach

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.560 
so I think that's what you know coach
Martin<00:00:23.460> once<00:00:23.580> if<00:00:23.789> you<00:00:24.090> know<00:00:24.210> certain

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
Martin once if you know certain

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.179 
Martin once if you know certain
possessions<00:00:25.170> during<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.590> game<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:25.830> don't

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189
