00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.320
 the image has to appear 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:49.659
 we're already going to see hesperia type that is 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.370
 where I have the application installed and 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:57.110
 let's find the application 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.660
 which is called file transfer is very very 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.949
 good you can pass files 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.839
 exaggeratedly fast at the speed of 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.720
 wifi in what the bluetooth can be 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:08.890
 let's say a 300 megabyte video 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.890
 movie takes about 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.759
 an hour and a half here you can take 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.630
 about five minutes 300 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:22.920
 ok ok ok let's start looking for the 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.930
 application and is the one that I have up 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.270
 top left to right spillett 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.189
 files strike and good we go the aceiticos 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.110
 to feel we're just going to set the 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.759
 name of our wifi and this time 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.649
 I put him to blue perote and if we want him 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.320
 put password I'll leave it like that 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.780
 so that they see ok we save everything 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.429
 we want to do and now we are going to 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.490
 look for a file I'm going to look for a 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:45.649
 movie 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.900
 I'm going to search there among so many movies 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:51.020
 they have to go to choose from 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.810
 what are they called 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.079
 pirates of silicon valley pesa 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.700
 approximately 300 megabytes and good 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:00.200
 let's select it as it is 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.409
 we were to send via bluetooth 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.859
 okay 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:09.569
 it's send options and we look for the option 

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:12.480
 of filet fighter filial fillets fire 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:15.269
 In order to transfer we select ok 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.829
 here is going to start what starts we're going to 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.230
 go to our other cell phone we go to 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:20.819
 search and now if our wifi collection 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.129
 that has to be called exactly like that 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.569
 guapote there is already appearing and 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.310
 we connect to it we do not need 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.989
 have internet for nothing believe me not 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.189
 we need to have internet neither balance nor 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.659
 nothing 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:32.340
 ok we are now connected to the side 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.780
 you can see that an ip address appears 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.269
 then we go to our browser 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.169
 in the mini s3 which is the one that we're going to 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.169
 receive the file 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.670
 and well there we have to place the 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:51.400
 ip address that shows us under the 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.400
 192 points and something point and something 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:03:00.550
 in 192,600 68 points 43 point 12 points 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.310
 80 80 here I was wrong because instead of 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.480
 put two points I put a semicolon like that 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.480
 that's why the error is going to come out 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.120
 as you can see then right now 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.090
 I'm going to write again this time because 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:22.530
 putting correctly how is it like 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:25.530
 it has to be not the 192 point 168 point 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.530
 43.1 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.340
 80 80 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.340
 talk to me about hurry up 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.390
 80 80 and I'll start the download 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.069
 as you can see on one side it appears and on 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.620
 the other also the transfer them 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.549
 I say it's about 3 megabytes per 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.799
 every second and a half or 4 megabytes 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.239
 it really is very very fast and good my 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.519
 people this video would leave it here 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.950
 I hope you liked all this 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.510
 that we saw this application is very useful to 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.330
 it helped me a lot because many 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.709
 sometimes even if they are android we do not find 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.760
 or we actually get to receive the 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.440
 file who knows because it has 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.390
 happened several times he does not accept it 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.340
 then already with this obviously already what 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.739
 downloads and without any problem you 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.060
 you can pass the song to the song 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.060
 music video 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.740
 what else can files happen to them but 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.630
 very heavy things for this is the 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.130
 program so my people this video already 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.830
 is ending do not forget to subscribe 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:35.210
