00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.480
 hi sony board we are live from 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.460
 warsaw we will introduce you to a small 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.010
 video on the photos in long 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.279
 exhibitions to show you that all of 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.779
 after 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.300
 how to make the settings on your 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.490
 sony device so the first thing 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.720
 that you have to do is past the 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.550
 focus in manual mode 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.260
 so removed the autofocus then you 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.270
 have you put on the value iso the 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.600
 lower than you have on the device 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.040
 Photo 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.040
 here we are in iso 50 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.450
 then on europe 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.370
 you will put a self-timer of 10 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.690
 seconds which allowed you to have 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.670
 a very stable image because at the moment 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.170
 you will press the button you 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.960
 have to move devices 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.550
 delay the self-timer avoids 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.550
 that sweet 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:06.460

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.460
 here we stay 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.119
 duty 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.410
 the 10-second self - timer 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.100
 Let's go 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:26.110

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.910
