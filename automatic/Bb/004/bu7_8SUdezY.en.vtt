00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.400
 fuck I never thought that a manga of the 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.740
 nothing will start to be much more 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.600
 philosophical and deep that naruto fuck 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.640
 What a spectacular way to resume the 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.310
 great son of d'or fairy tail sleeve 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.110
 hi people good how am I a little 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.360
 boring to always talk about the 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.460
 lousy incoherent and at the same time hilarious 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.050
 naruto manga now I will talk about the 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.570
 wea that is fashionable 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.390
 that's how I'll talk about singer and nokia gym 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.190
 fucking mother I do not know why the japs 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.100
 love to invent in such names 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.260
 complicated for your sleeves good as 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.629
 many of you will know this has been 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.789
 currently the fashion anime as well as what 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.069
 they went to an exorcist rosary more 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:49.870
 vampire follows school of the dead la wea 

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:52.149
 that we call sao because his fucking mother 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.010
 can pronounce his name among others 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.769
 footprints without importance and that were the 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.619
 bitch host in their respective years or 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:01.929
 good months this footprint is set 

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:03.699
 in the middle ages and the premise would be that 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:06.130
 out of nowhere appear giants 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.110
 called titans which devour 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.270
 humans that are in their 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.189
 path for simple fun or whim 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.439
 leading to the near extinction of the 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:16.600
 human species but the few humans 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:18.759
 that were still with the laws of the 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.470
 improbability they managed to build a 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.450
 super hyper mega city or country 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.310
 totally surrounded by a huge 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.020
 wall which guaranteed the 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.350
 survival of humans during 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.720
 about 100 years but good people like 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.880
 we all know if the wea was about 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.979
 a normal young man who lives a normal life 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.110
 in the middle ages within your city 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.209
 walled then that would not be very 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.429
 commercial so a super hyper arrives 

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:44.709
 mega sexy titan of the host without skin 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:46.539
 Fucking fuck and nothing shit that 

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:48.310
 comes from nowhere and makes shit one of 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.380
 the walls in which they were 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.780
 humans and logically all 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.580
 titans nothing good very assholes come into 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.099
 the city and they start doing the 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.229
 desmadre and talking about the chaos a 

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:01.209
 titan eats the mother of the prota and 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.880
 After a while, he takes revenge and 

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:06.189
 annihilate the titans kicking off 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.440
 the cartoon is fuck I followed 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.810
 religiously to this anime and I'll just say 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.360
 fuck depressed as a good idea is very 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.820
 poorly executed 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.560
 or yes of course I will only judge the girl of 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.600
 this footprint and not the manga since a 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.760
 difference of the anime which I follow 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.010
 religiously since it came out I have not 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.560
 read not a page of the manga which is 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.480
 base the good anime as I do not want that 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.910
 this web lasts for me who knows how many 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.520
 I will only limit myself to showing only 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.740
 some of the good and bad points to 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.690
 its favor the premise although a little 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.910
 cliché with that of murdering certain 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.770
 monster by X or motive which 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.990
 makes the prota have a deep 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.720
 desire for resentment and revenge towards 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.690
 these beings is certainly interesting 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.510
 another good thing would be the suspense or as 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.130
 some would call it the surprise factor 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.530
 I say the fact of seeing how everything goes 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.690
 pretty good the prota along with some 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.700
 secondary characters is in the middle of 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.800
 a shameful scene about friendship 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.840
 what causes you to vomit becomes 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.030
 matter of seconds in a semi scene 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.160
 epic where everything goes practically 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.140
 to hell or the fact that the author 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.360
 makes believe that it is of those who do not 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.400
 it hurts in the least to kill 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.560
 brutal to the unimportant characters 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.750
 leaving you waiting to see which 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.170
 another character dies or what shit will happen 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.170
 with the 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.510
 of the titans another point in favor of the 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.069
 series would be the character my house I know that 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.440
 There are many the over valued as 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.200
 character besides that he urges a good 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.390
 character development but fuck that 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.370
 find a main character that 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.260
 Do not be a fucking clitoris with a couple of 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.540
 talking tits that only serves to 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.489
 clog and need stupid mourners 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.620
 machines to even be something useful to 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.080
 cost to look like a being monstrously 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.180
 superficial and egotistical in an anime manga 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.489
 tion in this era is fucking 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.890
 difficult but in this anime footprint 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.810
 manga you will also find the author 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.970
 he takes the trouble to give us almost 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.920
 no fan service to the character thing 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.049
 that you are also grateful for what I have 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.910
 heard the author will not be fooled 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.100
 stupidly to this character as 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.170
 happened to her since the hueón is 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.690
 busy deifying another character 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.910
 although I insist the na na need something 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.730
 more development and another point in favor 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.850
 of this series are the titans or fuck is 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.829
 for that reason I started watching the series 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.780
 fuck those monsters at first they 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.640
 they made me look like zombies with 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.010
 that they were so delayed that 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.840
 they had little mobility and did not feel pain 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.880
 time to be riddled and in addition to 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.830
 share the insatiable appetite for 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.630
 human flesh making them take advantage 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.400
 any chance to murder and 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.800
 devour their prey as well as 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.380
 zombies only disagree in the aspect of 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.810
 size compared to these but 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.460
 after advancing the series or my god you 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.710
 realize that those shits are 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.200
 much more fucking to kill than the 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.390
 zombies fuck it does not matter if you fly 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.520
 baskets or blow up the titan if 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.980
 do not shoot or cut exactly in 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.660
 the nape then you already valued mothers already 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.060
 that those prints have an incredible 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.100
 super regeneration of the host without 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.350
 count on that unlike what you 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.940
 they showed at the beginning of the anime you give 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.820
 mind that those things are pretty 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.250
 agile to such an extent that they are capable of 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.080
 run climb sen by the buildings of 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.820
 give huge jumps and devour be 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.210
 someone who is transporting to or 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.460
 spiderman of a simple jump now if what 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.150
 that all of you wait for what I fuck 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.270
 of this web 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:26.670
 the protagonist is very flat and boring 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.860
 the hueón when starting the series is a 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:31.410
 fucked brat very irritating more than 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.409
 naruto after he swears revenge and he 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.110
 list 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:37.179
 you think or less bad hopefully hueón 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.189
 mature and grow as a character at least 

00:05:37.179 --> 00:05:41.110
 in a somewhat notorious way and when 

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:42.969
 do you believe or do you hope that mature 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.819
 even if it's something and that's going to prove it 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:47.499
 you look at him on his first day as a soldier and 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:49.539
 after the hueón is sent to him 

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:51.580
 asshole to a titan who devoured his 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:53.499
 little friend without even thinking that they had 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.929
 other titans out there and surprise 

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:58.209
 surprise the hueón loses a leg a 

00:05:55.929 --> 00:06:00.489
 arm and is devoured miserably by 

00:05:58.209 --> 00:06:02.199
 a titan ah but wait for the prota 

00:06:00.489 --> 00:06:04.599
 and can not die so the power of the 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:06.909
 power up is on your side that's another 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:08.589
 aspect because the author does not fuck 

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:10.509
 He could wait until the prota 

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:12.369
 develop and grow as a character or 

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:14.259
 that at least will show us that the prota 

00:06:12.369 --> 00:06:16.479
 He was able to kill titans like 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:19.449
 other human soldiers before giving him 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:21.249
 similar power I say make the hueón 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:23.110
 become titan to the first 

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:25.599
 opportunity gives us to understand that the 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.789
 lion alone will be another empty shell without 

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:29.559
 personality that will only depend on power 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:31.300
 ubs throughout the series and which 

00:06:29.559 --> 00:06:33.459
 you know he will not die as you know 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.739
 perfectly that if the lion is devoured 

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:38.620
 then it will emerge from the titan as a 

00:06:35.739 --> 00:06:40.389
 fucked titan go and think that this case 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.580
 an emptiness that together with a group of 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:44.680
 detestable characters like the head of 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.020
 coconut and other characters equal or more 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.940
 empty that these and adding the eagerness 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.190
 of the author for giving power oops to his 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.020
 characters before developing them and 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:55.180
 do entertaining for the reader or 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.729
 viewer make the series sink 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.860
 little by little with the passing of time and 

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:01.750
 by the way as shits it is possible that 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.900
 the hueón which is bleeding and 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:06.100
 agonizing over losing a leg can 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:08.080
 materialize from nothing within the 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.699
 mouth of the titan to take out the head of 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.610
 coconut from the mouth of the titan in which 

00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:14.620
 I was fuck the straw cheer up better 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:17.110
 let's materialize the lion inside out of nowhere 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:20.260
 from the mouth of the titan and ready we have 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:22.270
 our epic scene summarizing chingue 

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.430
 that and not who is an anime manga that 

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:26.620
 it could have been really good but 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.030
 final account the author did not know how 

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.820
 develop in a satisfactory way 

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:32.620
 to his work for the desire to put him
