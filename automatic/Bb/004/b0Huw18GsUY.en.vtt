 [Music] 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:26.290
 the artistic aspect of 320 be like the 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.450
 origin of the idea and it really depends 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.950
 a lot of that the oven atmosphere that 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.789
 atmosphere is considered great with 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.760
 with respect to the sun 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.510
 the palette the ambience all that is 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:43.659
 pretty careful not to screw up 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.659
 [Music] 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.920
 The two main guidelines are the 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.900
 hyperrealism and the overexposed light that 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.030
 does not come within the blackboard itself is a 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.250
 activity and a pictorial approach to 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.780
 not really losing real 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.080
 but they 're making a feeling that 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:12.100
 rapidly read to play 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:15.670
 [Music] 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:19.030
 the own image of the game is not dirty 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.750
 emaciated and then the cover that is not 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.210
 a render options made great we can 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.070
 put a drawing of an uncle bursting the 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.810
 head returning to the price of betting 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.289
 for something more psychological a proposal 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.729
 very sober reinforce the psychology 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:38.970
 character of the relationship character 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.970
 logo is my fun doing it the first 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.259
 [Music] 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.060
 we are in a realistic world here you have 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.070
 reality as a reference you believe in 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.840
 against a hospital is a sensation 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.369
 how is the hospital that was the object 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.469
 I am by air what is the atmosphere 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.359
 general once the look is already defined 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:57.460
 you throw reality football for 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:59.939
 expand it to everything that is the level of 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.939
 low 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:28.479
 and 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:28.479
 [Music] 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.240
 a lot of work 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.200
 Research research to make sure 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.200
 that things are the way they are 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.180
 in these cinematic scenes and they 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.709
 they serve Antonio to baste the high 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.810
 I have the opportunity to tell how it was 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.930
 sun and for it old art director 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.870
 of mercurysteam inherits part of the aspect 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.209
 visual of the position as mobile pallets 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.430
 Restricted very strong chiaroscuro 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.620
 a dirty looking movement that you 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.159
 really allows with little road 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.159
 show us 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.990
 [Music] 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.140
 ronald wayne is one of the last 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.900
 live people there is a lot for the design 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.540
 final it seems that the disc more equally 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.760
 went through many stages and a lot of 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.790
 drawings before you get to how it looks 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.230
 now I do not want it to look oracle but 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.340
 had multiple looks 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.340
 [Music] 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.710
 for example Ã³scar and sea for 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.120
 if they love each other or a lot of love 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.440
 fast on slips and this is the 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.310
 original that was used to make the 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.970
 animation a lot of digital people are 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.970
 signed 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.370
 the retailer ray until I ask the 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.740
 stage have a polishing level a 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.630
 pretty careful exam to see what 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.460
 have to paint I know what I do not when 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.800
 a scenario every registration of being 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.200
 finished he still spins 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.240
 nut has no staging 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.320
 quite pretty well done is wrong 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.320
 that we say it, I think 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:19.459
