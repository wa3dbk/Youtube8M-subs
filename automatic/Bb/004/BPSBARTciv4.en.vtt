 this time what I want to share with you 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.930
 is how to make a Mexican sauce 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.610
 very easy in three steps this is going to be 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.529
 okay fast then I'm trying to 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.690
 make my videos a little bit shorter 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.640
 I also can not bore you so much 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.039
 Sometimes in the bakery is where it takes 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.260
 one more time but for this it's fine 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:42.699
 simple good this salsa a la mexicana 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.319
 we will be occupying it as for 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:48.310
 make some eggs to the Mexican ones 

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:50.940
 eggs divorced eggs ranchers 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.460
 Mexican steak 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.649
 in short, many things can be done with 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.260
 I recommend this sauce to have it 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.539
 already ready in your refrigerator do it and 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.250
 so they can make their breakfasts or meals 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.100
 and well , this way they are going to 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.890
 save time then I have tomato 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.649
 I already have it chopped finely chopped 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.540
 I try to do it as finite as I can 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:14.810
 I have cilantro, I put this 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.380
 touch of cilantro 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.170
 chopped onion jalapeÃ±o chile minced a 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.390
 little garlic and garlic so use it 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.329
 chopped garlic if it does not apply on a tooth 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:30.010
 garlic a little water olive oil 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:33.100
 but what I'm going to do is fry 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:36.740
 what is my onion and the jalapeÃ±o pepper 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.899
 with olive oil 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.369
 and well, in fact, this sauce 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.530
 they can use it as a taquera sauce 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.259
 they would only be adding or 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.970
 about a little more chili and well then 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.850
 The amounts that I am giving you are 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.040
 approximate remember the quantities with 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.380
 the end of the video 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.160
 but you are going to add spicy 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.840
 according to you his taste another little thing that 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.000
 it happened to me and I always tell them that later 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.250
 they forget me why I almost do not get used to 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.080
 to work the ingredients to 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.750
 principle but pay attention to the list 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.780
 pepper ingredients and those that putting 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.780
 from now on they can put broth or salt 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.640
 I'm going to add a little salt to 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.050
 that right now I'm taking flavor 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.050
 onion and chili 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.269
 and this I do later because if not the 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.269
 garlic can burn us 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.799
 and then the tomato arrived 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:40.549
 and then he does not have the secret of this 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:43.969
 salsa is in the tomato, choose it well 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:45.550
 mature well red and that are very cold 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:47.470
 all right 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.020
 in this way they will look good 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.240
 sauce we will leave here it would be 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:56.140
 very good and donaldo well I already have others 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:58.240
 tomatoes nothing more apart two of the 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.950
 total amount that I will give you the 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.690
 let's fly with a little bit of water 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.940
 that is not much water a half cup 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.160
 well only that they reach to grind 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.070
 and since it is well but we will add 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.950
 here today I am going to add a little salt 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:16.730
 or consommÃ© I'm doing it like this in 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.630
 little ones already until later rectified if 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.060
 It's very good salt 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.000
 I'm going to stir very well that it gets really cold 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.400
 very well this tomato until it 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.200
 undo very well and look I'll pass them 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.240
 another trick if they want their sauce 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.850
 they are very rich and really that 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.780
 It seems strange but it really is 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.390
 change the taste 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.310
 mazza that the little bit crush the 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.790
 little bit with the crusher of the 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.490
 beans we 're going to as well as to grind 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.950
 a little bit and they're going to see what's going 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:52.580
 look good rich sauce 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.580
 here is boiling 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.050
 undo very well take out that juice from 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.380
 tomato that is chopped 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.150
 It is not the same to grind in the blender 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.520
 Sometimes I tell them a blender that swims 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.100
 more press that are playing with the 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.380
 little buttons to get this whole 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.140
 the sauce but if they do it in this way 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.040
 also here he knows them completely 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.840
 different the taste changes a lot 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.880
 well it's already boiling what I'm going to 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.150
 do now is add the tomato that 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.139
 already moli 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:28.930
 and this is where I'm going to rectify 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:32.500
 if it's fine salt added more can 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:36.129
 add more pepper and now I'm going to put 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:39.460
 Consomme powder can be left if it is 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:40.930
 fish and it's here this thick depends for 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.199
 what you want can be done 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.490
 more broth appointment or so specific when 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:47.620
 the goal in the fridge because they are going to 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.750
 express simply add a little 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.389
 more water and already good because this sauce 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.340
 is already ready and I really do not stop 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.560
 to be trying because it is very rich 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.960
 the truth won as well as I am 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.629
 saying last I'm going to add the 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.569
 cilantro and in fact this I do since 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:06.909
 have I turned off and then you are going to 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:08.860
 give an account here the afternoon about 10 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:11.439
 minutes that is grass boils on fire 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.569
 well low when you see that 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:16.620
 the fat we use is going to be 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:19.689
 up as a capital see how it is 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.460
 then I set aside a little bit of this 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:22.569
 well it is more complete to see if they reach 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.460
 Let's see 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:28.280
 because well this from the photos of 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:30.680
 presentation is a show that I do 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.830
 but in fact they are going to look like him 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.200
 It has to be like this 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.570
