trying to indicate some of the
differences<00:00:16.350> that<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:16.560> should<00:00:16.710> be<00:00:16.830> looking

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
differences that you should be looking

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.250 
differences that you should be looking
for<00:00:17.160> just<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:18.000> help<00:00:18.240> those<00:00:18.390> who<00:00:18.449> think<00:00:19.050> you

for just to help those who think you
know<00:00:19.380> there's<00:00:19.560> no<00:00:19.680> differences<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:20.789> on<00:00:21.000> so

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
know there's no differences and so on so

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.880 
know there's no differences and so on so
the<00:00:22.020> first<00:00:22.230> one<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.439> we're<00:00:22.590> going<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.769> look

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
the first one that we're going to look

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.400 
the first one that we're going to look
at<00:00:23.039> now<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.609> law<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.119> sines<00:00:24.420> as<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.320> can

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
at now is the law of sines as you can

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.609 
at now is the law of sines as you can
see<00:00:25.560> there<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:25.920> no<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:27.150> light<00:00:28.019> shafting

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
see there is no of the light shafting

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.620 
see there is no of the light shafting
and<00:00:28.859> textures<00:00:29.760> are<00:00:29.849> gonna<00:00:29.970> be<00:00:30.119> lower<00:00:30.269> eyes<00:00:30.510> are

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
and textures are gonna be lower eyes are

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.049 
and textures are gonna be lower eyes are
gonna<00:00:30.720> see<00:00:30.929> when<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.230> changes<00:00:31.529> just<00:00:31.800> now<00:00:32.059> as

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
gonna see when it changes just now as

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.549 
gonna see when it changes just now as
you<00:00:33.180> can<00:00:33.270> see<00:00:33.420> we<00:00:33.570> get<00:00:33.660> some<00:00:33.870> strong<00:00:34.079> chefs

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
you can see we get some strong chefs

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.220 
you can see we get some strong chefs
the<00:00:34.890> textures<00:00:35.340> do<00:00:35.520> increase<00:00:35.969> my<00:00:36.390> increase<00:00:36.930> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
the textures do increase my increase the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.819 
the textures do increase my increase the
resolution<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.670> video<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.149> see<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:39.510> and

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
resolution of the video to see this and

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:41.990 
resolution of the video to see this and
come<00:00:40.829> on<00:00:40.890> up<00:00:40.980> now<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.280> decided<00:00:41.670> by<00:00:41.730> side

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
come on up now is decided by side

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.850 
come on up now is decided by side
comparison<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.320> course<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.649> main

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
comparison and of course the main

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.229 
comparison and of course the main
difference<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.520> will<00:00:44.579> see<00:00:44.640> through<00:00:45.059> more

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
difference you will see through more

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.520 
difference you will see through more
throughout<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.660> video<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.050> tiny

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
throughout the video is tiny

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.440 
throughout the video is tiny
improvements<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.370> textures<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.030> this

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
improvements in the textures and this

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.260 
improvements in the textures and this
some<00:00:48.960> lighting<00:00:49.940> moving<00:00:50.940> on<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.239> other

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
some lighting moving on to the other

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.700 
some lighting moving on to the other
testing<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.199> having<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.559> beautiful

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
testing this is I having a beautiful

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.670 
testing this is I having a beautiful
show<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.789> even<00:00:54.059> on<00:00:54.149> law<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:55.410> mean<00:00:55.559> if

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
show this is even on law and I mean if

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.869 
show this is even on law and I mean if
you<00:00:55.770> fall<00:00:55.949> screen<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.190> video<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.730> see

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
you fall screen a video to see

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:57.979 
you fall screen a video to see

you<00:00:58.379> know<00:00:58.500> it's<00:00:58.649> not<00:00:58.770> as<00:00:58.980> square<00:00:59.190> as<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.489> could

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
you know it's not as square as it could

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.090 
you know it's not as square as it could
be<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.059> crystal<00:01:00.449> low<00:01:00.570> resolution<00:01:01.140> as<00:01:01.829> we<00:01:01.949> go

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
be the crystal low resolution as we go

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.889 
be the crystal low resolution as we go
this<00:01:02.430> one<00:01:02.609> as<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.910> can<00:01:02.940> see<00:01:03.059> there<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.719> not

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
this one as you can see there is not

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.950 
this one as you can see there is not
here<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.530> my<00:01:04.650> differences<00:01:05.250> shadows<00:01:05.790> sly<00:01:06.540> I

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
here you to my differences shadows sly I

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.460 
here you to my differences shadows sly I
would<00:01:07.380> say<00:01:07.619> minor<00:01:09.020> differences<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.290> the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
would say minor differences in the

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.399 
would say minor differences in the
textures<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.689> maybe<00:01:12.689> that's<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.260> my

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
textures and maybe that's a in my

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.899 
textures and maybe that's a in my
opinion<00:01:13.770> going<00:01:14.010> onto<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.310> side-by-side

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
opinion going onto the side-by-side

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.420 
opinion going onto the side-by-side
comparison<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.659> can<00:01:15.990> look<00:01:16.170> yourself<00:01:16.430> there

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
comparison you can look yourself there

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.980 
comparison you can look yourself there
isn't<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.880> huge<00:01:18.270> amount<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.780> detail

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
isn't a huge amount of detail

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.780 
isn't a huge amount of detail
differences<00:01:19.770> neither<00:01:20.040> one<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.369> them<00:01:20.549> looking

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
differences neither one of them looking

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.380 
differences neither one of them looking
amazing<00:01:21.330> now<00:01:22.320> moving<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.860> another<00:01:22.890> test

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
amazing now moving on to another test

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.480 
amazing now moving on to another test
this<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:25.049> with<00:01:25.350> inside<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> shop<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.400> I

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
this is is with inside of a shop and I

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.550 
this is is with inside of a shop and I
really<00:01:26.909> like<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.630> shot<00:01:27.810> but<00:01:27.960> give<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.140> really

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
really like this shot but give a really

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.819 
really like this shot but give a really
big<00:01:29.509> ambient<00:01:30.509> warm<00:01:30.780> feeling<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.470> if<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.680> keep

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
big ambient warm feeling and if you keep

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:32.899 
big ambient warm feeling and if you keep
an<00:01:32.009> eye<00:01:32.159> on<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.430> chest

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
an eye on the chest

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.270 
an eye on the chest
I<00:01:33.259> see<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.380> quality<00:01:34.740> difference<00:01:35.070> on<00:01:35.189> the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
I see the quality difference on the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.310 
I see the quality difference on the
chest<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.820> word<00:01:36.320> increases

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
chest and the word increases

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.890 
chest and the word increases
substantially<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.360> think<00:01:39.540> that's<00:01:39.720> one<00:01:39.869> of

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
substantially and I think that's one of

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.630 
substantially and I think that's one of
the<00:01:40.020> main<00:01:40.229> key<00:01:40.470> areas<00:01:40.829> about<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.250> game<00:01:41.490> is

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
the main key areas about this game is

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.210 
the main key areas about this game is
it's<00:01:41.820> just<00:01:41.850> trying<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.390> little<00:01:42.630> details

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
it's just trying to little details

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.620 
it's just trying to little details
provided<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.310> way<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.729> game<00:01:44.909> looks<00:01:45.149> amazing

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
provided the way the game looks amazing

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.170 
provided the way the game looks amazing
the<00:01:45.720> live<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.899> sentence<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:47.700> as<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.909> can<00:01:48.060> see

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
the live a sentence and as you can see

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.090 
the live a sentence and as you can see
here<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.780> side-by-side<00:01:49.020> comparison

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
here this is a side-by-side comparison

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.750 
here this is a side-by-side comparison
mainly<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.119> chest<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.840> partially<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.829> water

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
mainly the chest and partially the water

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.210 
mainly the chest and partially the water
mainly<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.210> differences<00:01:54.750> here<00:01:54.890> this<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:56.070> what

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
mainly the differences here this is what

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.650 
mainly the differences here this is what
I<00:01:56.250> want<00:01:56.400> to<00:01:56.490> call<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> quality<00:01:57.090> test<00:01:57.270> as<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.480> can

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
I want to call a quality test as you can

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.200 
I want to call a quality test as you can
see<00:01:57.780> this<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.110> all<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.500> little<00:01:58.770> detail<00:01:59.210> the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
see this is all the little detail the

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.330 
see this is all the little detail the
chest<00:02:00.870> over<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:01.260> far<00:02:01.470> other<00:02:01.920> side<00:02:02.220> of<00:02:02.280> the

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
chest over the far other side of the

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.400 
chest over the far other side of the
bookshelf<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.880> real<00:02:03.120> locally<00:02:03.660> including<00:02:03.960> the

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
bookshelf is real locally including the

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.620 
bookshelf is real locally including the
sheds<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:04.980> as<00:02:05.070> we<00:02:05.220> go<00:02:05.370> to<00:02:05.430> ultra<00:02:05.850> everything

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
sheds and as we go to ultra everything

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.719 
sheds and as we go to ultra everything
gets<00:02:07.080> slightly<00:02:07.440> more<00:02:07.590> defined<00:02:08.130> a<00:02:08.369> little<00:02:08.640> bit

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
gets slightly more defined a little bit

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.969 
gets slightly more defined a little bit
more<00:02:08.880> detail<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.500> think<00:02:10.680> the<00:02:10.770> lighting

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
more detail and I think the lighting

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.650 
more detail and I think the lighting
increases<00:02:11.640> just<00:02:11.820> a<00:02:11.880> little<00:02:12.090> bit<00:02:12.180> but<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.480> could

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
increases just a little bit but I could

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.570 
increases just a little bit but I could
that<00:02:12.990> could<00:02:13.140> just<00:02:13.380> be<00:02:13.470> my<00:02:13.650> opinion<00:02:13.740> but<00:02:14.280> cooler

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
that could just be my opinion but cooler

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.420 
that could just be my opinion but cooler
to<00:02:14.730> say<00:02:15.500> side-by-side<00:02:16.500> comparison<00:02:17.130> as<00:02:17.250> you

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
to say side-by-side comparison as you

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.080 
to say side-by-side comparison as you
can<00:02:17.550> see<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:18.360> difference<00:02:18.780> is<00:02:19.020> I<00:02:19.790> mean<00:02:20.790> you'd

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
can see the difference is I mean you'd

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.730 
can see the difference is I mean you'd
have<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.360> make<00:02:21.570> about<00:02:21.870> yourself<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.410> can<00:02:22.590> see

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
have to make about yourself I can see

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.080 
have to make about yourself I can see
quite<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:22.980> lot<00:02:23.100> of<00:02:23.130> difference<00:02:23.430> especially<00:02:23.700> the

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
quite a lot of difference especially the

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.480 
quite a lot of difference especially the
shares<00:02:24.420> but<00:02:24.660> this<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:25.110> another<00:02:25.410> one<00:02:25.590> now<00:02:26.160> I<00:02:26.190> can

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
shares but this is another one now I can

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.210 
shares but this is another one now I can
see<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.970> huge<00:02:27.570> amount<00:02:27.810> of<00:02:27.900> detail<00:02:28.070> what<00:02:29.070> I<00:02:29.100> do

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
see a huge amount of detail what I do

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.010 
see a huge amount of detail what I do
suggest<00:02:29.610> that<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.090> keep<00:02:30.270> your<00:02:30.510> eyes<00:02:30.660> out<00:02:30.990> for

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
suggest that you keep your eyes out for

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.530 
suggest that you keep your eyes out for
is<00:02:31.470> anti-aliasing<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.520> larger<00:02:32.940> resolutions

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
is anti-aliasing and larger resolutions

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.010 
is anti-aliasing and larger resolutions
and<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:34.380> shadows<00:02:34.740> start<00:02:35.280> appearing<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:36.020> I

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
and the shadows start appearing and I

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.390 
and the shadows start appearing and I
would<00:02:37.230> guess<00:02:37.440> maybe<00:02:37.830> better<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:39.830> guess<00:02:40.860> ambient

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
would guess maybe better I guess ambient

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.920 
would guess maybe better I guess ambient
occlusion<00:02:41.700> around<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:43.850> characters<00:02:44.850> and<00:02:45.570> I'm

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
occlusion around the characters and I'm

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.630 
occlusion around the characters and I'm
not<00:02:46.080> really<00:02:46.200> live<00:02:46.530> side<00:02:46.800> by<00:02:46.830> side<00:02:47.010> of<00:02:47.340> this<00:02:47.430> one

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
not really live side by side of this one

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.110 
not really live side by side of this one
this<00:02:47.940> is<00:02:48.180> another<00:02:48.209> big<00:02:48.900> one<00:02:49.050> which<00:02:49.260> I<00:02:49.410> think

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
this is another big one which I think

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.699 
this is another big one which I think
listen<00:02:51.120> we'll<00:02:51.300> be<00:02:51.420> sharing<00:02:51.570> now<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.900> Sun

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
listen we'll be sharing now the Sun

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.190 
listen we'll be sharing now the Sun
lighting<00:02:53.130> changes<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:53.940> adapts<00:02:54.270> with<00:02:54.630> objects

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
lighting changes and adapts with objects

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.960 
lighting changes and adapts with objects
that<00:02:55.230> move<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.620> it's<00:02:55.800> from<00:02:55.980> this<00:02:56.730> is<00:02:56.880> of

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
that move and it's from this is of

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.270 
that move and it's from this is of
course<00:02:57.209> it's<00:02:57.360> love<00:02:57.690> with<00:02:57.989> none<00:02:58.200> of<00:02:58.350> that<00:02:58.380> I<00:02:58.860> was

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
course it's love with none of that I was

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.650 
course it's love with none of that I was
enough<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.580> alter<00:02:59.730> you'll<00:03:00.120> see<00:03:00.300> it<00:03:00.450> pretty

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
enough to alter you'll see it pretty

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.840 
enough to alter you'll see it pretty
much<00:03:00.780> instantly<00:03:01.320> as<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:01.770> can<00:03:01.920> see<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.640> Sun

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
much instantly as you can see the Sun

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.930 
much instantly as you can see the Sun
lighting<00:03:03.180> is<00:03:03.300> adaptive<00:03:03.810> as<00:03:04.020> the<00:03:04.610> cats<00:03:05.610> move

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
lighting is adaptive as the cats move

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.990 
lighting is adaptive as the cats move
past<00:03:06.300> them<00:03:06.570> and<00:03:07.459> also<00:03:08.459> do<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.730> side-by-side

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
past them and also do a side-by-side

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.330 
past them and also do a side-by-side
comparison<00:03:09.420> of<00:03:10.050> this<00:03:10.260> amino<00:03:10.800> so<00:03:10.980> if<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.160> look

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
comparison of this amino so if you look

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.009 
comparison of this amino so if you look
at<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.550> smaller<00:03:11.820> details<00:03:12.269> of<00:03:12.450> me<00:03:12.630> you<00:03:12.720> can<00:03:12.870> see

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
at the smaller details of me you can see

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.040 
at the smaller details of me you can see
that<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.260> Sun<00:03:13.470> graphical<00:03:13.890> increases<00:03:14.580> in

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
that the Sun graphical increases in

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.280 
that the Sun graphical increases in
majority<00:03:16.050> of<00:03:16.140> all<00:03:16.290> areas<00:03:16.880> or

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
majority of all areas or

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.949 
majority of all areas or
over<00:03:19.280> them<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.519> hammer<00:03:19.700> popping<00:03:20.090> up<00:03:20.209> very

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
over them the hammer popping up very

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.890 
over them the hammer popping up very
much<00:03:21.049> difference<00:03:22.150> why<00:03:23.150> are<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.450> one<00:03:23.629> of<00:03:23.659> them

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
much difference why are the one of them

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.039 
much difference why are the one of them
still<00:03:24.140> look<00:03:24.290> pretty<00:03:24.470> amazing<00:03:25.659> now<00:03:26.659> moving<00:03:26.870> on

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
still look pretty amazing now moving on

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.979 
still look pretty amazing now moving on
to<00:03:27.079> the<00:03:27.290> next<00:03:27.439> test<00:03:27.680> this<00:03:27.980> is<00:03:28.189> a<00:03:28.750> kind<00:03:29.750> of<00:03:29.780> the

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
to the next test this is a kind of the

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.319 
to the next test this is a kind of the
gun<00:03:30.230> because<00:03:31.099> I<00:03:31.250> think<00:03:31.579> the<00:03:31.670> guns<00:03:31.819> look<00:03:32.060> really

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
gun because I think the guns look really

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.210 
gun because I think the guns look really
good<00:03:32.480> no<00:03:32.810> sense<00:03:33.140> but<00:03:33.409> they've<00:03:33.530> also<00:03:33.709> got<00:03:33.860> more

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
good no sense but they've also got more

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.000 
good no sense but they've also got more
defined<00:03:34.670> details<00:03:35.209> on<00:03:35.510> ultra<00:03:35.959> and<00:03:36.530> I<00:03:36.739> guess<00:03:36.890> you

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
defined details on ultra and I guess you

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.649 
defined details on ultra and I guess you
can<00:03:37.190> look<00:03:37.370> at<00:03:37.489> the<00:03:37.579> background<00:03:38.000> especially

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:38.659 
can look at the background especially

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:41.559 
can look at the background especially
those<00:03:39.110> railings<00:03:39.409> see<00:03:40.129> how<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:40.730> little

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
those railings see how the little

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.110 
those railings see how the little
spirals<00:03:42.110> get<00:03:42.260> extra<00:03:42.560> details<00:03:43.040> along<00:03:43.909> with

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
spirals get extra details along with

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.420 
spirals get extra details along with
pretty<00:03:44.329> much<00:03:44.450> everything<00:03:45.310> including<00:03:46.310> the

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
pretty much everything including the

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.729 
pretty much everything including the
guns<00:03:46.670> and<00:03:47.359> then<00:03:48.140> moving<00:03:48.349> on<00:03:48.530> to<00:03:48.650> the

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
guns and then moving on to the

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.020 
guns and then moving on to the
side-by-side<00:03:49.370> comparison<00:03:50.030> I<00:03:51.700> think<00:03:52.700> there's

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
side-by-side comparison I think there's

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.569 
side-by-side comparison I think there's
extra<00:03:53.420> shadows<00:03:53.840> on<00:03:54.349> England's<00:03:54.950> cartridges

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
extra shadows on England's cartridges

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.930 
extra shadows on England's cartridges
but<00:03:56.150> that's<00:03:56.420> against<00:03:57.200> the<00:03:57.349> minor<00:03:57.620> detail<00:03:58.069> now

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
but that's against the minor detail now

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.910 
but that's against the minor detail now
this<00:03:59.090> is<00:03:59.239> a<00:03:59.269> next<00:04:00.200> three<00:04:00.440> of<00:04:00.560> these<00:04:00.650> are<00:04:00.829> going

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
this is a next three of these are going

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.960 
this is a next three of these are going
to<00:04:00.980> be<00:04:01.099> quality<00:04:01.280> chests<00:04:01.670> and<00:04:01.790> that's

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
to be quality chests and that's

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.830 
to be quality chests and that's
conceived<00:04:02.299> in<00:04:03.109> the<00:04:03.290> low<00:04:03.500> resolution<00:04:03.709> textures

these vgpu to render now as we go to
ultra<00:04:08.780> you<00:04:09.440> get<00:04:09.620> extra<00:04:10.370> detail<00:04:11.030> and<00:04:11.799> more

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
ultra you get extra detail and more

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
a a side-by-side comparison to help you

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.150 
a a side-by-side comparison to help you
take<00:04:43.550> a<00:04:43.610> look<00:04:43.729> at<00:04:44.060> both<00:04:44.270> together

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
take a look at both together

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.280 
take a look at both together
you<00:04:46.400> can<00:04:46.670> see<00:04:46.850> there's<00:04:47.480> no<00:04:47.660> shadows<00:04:48.080> in<00:04:48.230> the

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
you can see there's no shadows in the

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.450 
you can see there's no shadows in the
law<00:04:48.550> slightly<00:04:49.550> better<00:04:50.080> detail<00:04:51.080> on<00:04:51.380> ultra<00:04:51.830> with

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
law slightly better detail on ultra with

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.160 
law slightly better detail on ultra with
it<00:04:52.760> is<00:04:52.970> fairly<00:04:53.240> minimal<00:04:53.480> but<00:04:53.930> you<00:04:54.020> can

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
it is fairly minimal but you can

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:55.510 
it is fairly minimal but you can
definitely<00:04:54.350> tell<00:04:54.710> the<00:04:54.830> difference<00:04:54.890> when<00:04:55.370> you

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
definitely tell the difference when you

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.850 
definitely tell the difference when you
play<00:04:55.760> the<00:04:55.910> game<00:04:55.940> now<00:04:56.840> this<00:04:56.990> one<00:04:57.230> I<00:04:57.260> want<00:04:57.590> you<00:04:57.710> to

play the game now this one I want you to

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.370 
play the game now this one I want you to
keep<00:04:58.250> an<00:04:58.430> eye<00:04:58.580> on<00:04:58.610> the<00:04:59.210> extra<00:04:59.780> you<00:05:00.110> know<00:05:00.200> the

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
keep an eye on the extra you know the

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.290 
keep an eye on the extra you know the
detail<00:05:00.800> the<00:05:01.040> really<00:05:01.430> really<00:05:01.700> small<00:05:01.910> details

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
detail the really really small details

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.050 
detail the really really small details
to<00:05:02.510> share<00:05:03.110> textures<00:05:03.620> the<00:05:04.280> floor<00:05:04.550> and<00:05:04.760> the<00:05:04.850> meat

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060

to share textures the floor and the meat
as<00:05:05.900> you<00:05:06.110> can<00:05:06.230> see<00:05:06.380> you<00:05:06.830> know<00:05:06.950> if<00:05:07.430> then<00:05:07.730> it

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
as you can see you know if then it

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.240 
as you can see you know if then it
sounds<00:05:08.120> appearing<00:05:08.480> at<00:05:08.570> the<00:05:08.720> middle<00:05:09.080> now<00:05:09.290> you

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
sounds appearing at the middle now you

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.790 
sounds appearing at the middle now you
know<00:05:10.430> the<00:05:10.550> chairs<00:05:10.850> of<00:05:11.000> extra<00:05:11.540> detail<00:05:11.800> floors

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
know the chairs of extra detail floors

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.680 
know the chairs of extra detail floors
definitely<00:05:13.340> got<00:05:13.460> bit<00:05:13.700> more<00:05:13.910> detail<00:05:14.300> and<00:05:14.510> a

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
definitely got bit more detail and a

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.630 
definitely got bit more detail and a
little<00:05:15.020> I<00:05:15.140> don't<00:05:15.200> know<00:05:15.440> if<00:05:15.500> as<00:05:15.620> turds<00:05:15.920> are<00:05:16.280> for

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
little I don't know if as turds are for

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.110 
little I don't know if as turds are for
me<00:05:16.790> and<00:05:17.480> there's<00:05:18.290> a<00:05:18.410> side<00:05:18.620> by<00:05:18.830> side<00:05:18.860> comparison

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
me and there's a side by side comparison
