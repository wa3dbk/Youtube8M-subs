it's<00:00:49.339> not<00:00:49.489> to<00:00:49.579> say<00:00:49.760> you're<00:00:49.879> going<00:00:50.059> to<00:00:50.089> use<00:00:50.269> this

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:50.479 
it's not to say you're going to use this

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:53.079 
it's not to say you're going to use this
method<00:00:50.899> for<00:00:50.930> lift<00:00:51.620> and<00:00:51.829> every<00:00:52.309> time<00:00:52.579> you<00:00:52.940> know

method for lift and every time you know

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:55.539 
method for lift and every time you know
it'll<00:00:53.930> give<00:00:54.079> you<00:00:54.170> a<00:00:54.199> number<00:00:54.649> different<00:00:54.949> ways

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:55.549 
it'll give you a number different ways

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:58.780 
it'll give you a number different ways
to<00:00:56.059> use<00:00:56.299> lift<00:00:57.140> hands<00:00:57.409> and<00:00:58.189> it's<00:00:58.309> just<00:00:58.519> a<00:00:58.610> much

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
to use lift hands and it's just a much

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.240 
to use lift hands and it's just a much
easier<00:00:58.820> way<00:00:59.269> to<00:00:59.809> get<00:01:00.259> it<00:01:00.350> into<00:01:00.470> your<00:01:00.680> mind<00:01:00.920> to

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
easier way to get it into your mind to

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.249 
easier way to get it into your mind to
learn<00:01:01.430> that<00:01:01.699> the<00:01:02.119> applications<00:01:02.780> rather<00:01:03.019> than

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:03.259 
learn that the applications rather than

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:04.780 
learn that the applications rather than
saying<00:01:03.470> I'll<00:01:03.710> see<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.040> good<00:01:04.220> bits<00:01:04.400> for<00:01:04.610> this

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
saying I'll see the good bits for this

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.350 
saying I'll see the good bits for this
for<00:01:05.720> this<00:01:05.810> and<00:01:06.140> then<00:01:06.229> it's<00:01:06.380> this<00:01:07.150> just<00:01:08.150> gives

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
for this and then it's this just gives

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.390 
for this and then it's this just gives
you<00:01:08.450> a<00:01:08.479> little<00:01:08.750> form<00:01:09.140> and<00:01:09.320> then<00:01:09.530> pretty<00:01:09.979> forms

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
you a little form and then pretty forms

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.780 
you a little form and then pretty forms
they're<00:01:10.549> not<00:01:10.700> very<00:01:10.880> difficult<00:01:11.180> to<00:01:11.540> learn<00:01:12.790> and

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
they're not very difficult to learn and

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.120 
they're not very difficult to learn and
just<00:01:14.030> gives<00:01:14.210> you<00:01:14.299> something<00:01:14.509> extra<00:01:15.200> to<00:01:15.470> do<00:01:15.650> and

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
just gives you something extra to do and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.399 
just gives you something extra to do and
each<00:01:16.250> of<00:01:16.430> the<00:01:16.520> forms<00:01:16.939> works<00:01:17.659> upon<00:01:17.990> the

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
each of the forms works upon the

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
application to forgiveness some of them

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.259 
application to forgiveness some of them
be<00:03:31.950> given<00:03:32.159> with<00:03:32.250> a<00:03:32.310> different<00:03:32.609> application<00:03:32.730> of

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
be given with a different application of

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.940 
be given with a different application of
some<00:03:33.419> of<00:03:33.569> the<00:03:33.720> good<00:03:33.870> with<00:03:34.109> an<00:03:34.500> application

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
some of the good with an application

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.550 
some of the good with an application
from<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.459> next<00:03:35.760> set<00:03:35.939> of<00:03:35.970> moves<00:03:36.239> even<00:03:36.629> so<00:03:37.349> this

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
from the next set of moves even so this

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.559 
from the next set of moves even so this
one<00:03:37.799> starts<00:03:38.310> with<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.519> basic<00:03:38.939> alphago<00:03:39.269> so<00:03:39.480> you

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
one starts with the basic alphago so you

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.599 
one starts with the basic alphago so you
take<00:03:39.780> your<00:03:39.810> hand<00:03:39.959> back<00:03:40.349> there's<00:03:41.310> a<00:03:41.400> little

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
take your hand back there's a little

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.110 
take your hand back there's a little
cool<00:03:41.959> straight<00:03:42.959> back<00:03:43.139> there's<00:03:43.620> less<00:03:43.859> of<00:03:44.120> like

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
cool straight back there's less of like

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.599 
cool straight back there's less of like
