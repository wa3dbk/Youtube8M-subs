00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
engineering tutorialhub hi our today

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.970 
engineering tutorialhub hi our today
we'll<00:00:05.279> be<00:00:05.400> learning<00:00:05.609> about<00:00:05.879> the<00:00:06.210> different

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:06.980 
we'll be learning about the different

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.790 
we'll be learning about the different
types<00:00:07.980> or<00:00:08.280> grades<00:00:08.610> of<00:00:08.880> you<00:00:09.059> oil<00:00:09.410> actually<00:00:10.410> the

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
types or grades of you oil actually the

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.820 
types or grades of you oil actually the
engine<00:00:11.190> oils<00:00:11.490> used<00:00:12.030> in<00:00:12.210> automobiles<00:00:12.840> starting

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
engine oils used in automobiles starting

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:22.160 
engine oils used in automobiles starting
from<00:00:14.059> CF<00:00:15.059> CF<00:00:15.900> for<00:00:16.369> CG<00:00:17.369> for<00:00:18.199> ch4<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.820> latest<00:00:21.170> ci4

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
from CF CF for CG for ch4 and latest ci4

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.689 
from CF CF for CG for ch4 and latest ci4
oils<00:00:22.470> these<00:00:23.369> oils<00:00:24.150> have<00:00:25.070> different<00:00:26.070> types<00:00:26.430> of

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
oils these oils have different types of

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.570 
oils these oils have different types of
properties<00:00:27.420> which<00:00:28.080> actually<00:00:29.010> make<00:00:29.310> them

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
properties which actually make them

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.740 
properties which actually make them
unique

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
unique

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.659 
unique
so<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.619> different<00:00:31.920> properties<00:00:32.160> are

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
so the different properties are

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.090 
so the different properties are
mentioned<00:00:33.030> here<00:00:33.090> in<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.450> graph<00:00:33.840> as<00:00:34.140> per<00:00:35.090> the

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
mentioned here in this graph as per the

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.150 
mentioned here in this graph as per the
grade<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.309> oil<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:38.879> as<00:00:39.570> per<00:00:39.870> what<00:00:40.500> these

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
grade of the oil and as per what these

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.270 
grade of the oil and as per what these
always<00:00:41.399> stand<00:00:41.879> for<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:43.020> these<00:00:43.829> different

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
always stand for so these different

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.010 
always stand for so these different

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
called pump ability ten is oxidation 11

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.210

we<00:01:15.720> have<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.400> oil<00:01:17.540> aeration<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.830> the<00:01:19.830> last<00:01:20.009> one

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
we have a oil aeration and the last one

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.300 
we have a oil aeration and the last one
is<00:01:20.340> shear<00:01:21.240> stability<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:22.350> these<00:01:22.740> are<00:01:23.070> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
is shear stability so these are the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.210 
is shear stability so these are the
different<00:01:23.700> properties<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:24.750> always<00:01:25.500> should

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
different properties that always should

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.910 
different properties that always should
have<00:01:27.710> four<00:01:30.020> different<00:01:31.020> type<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.170> automobiles

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
have four different type of automobiles

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.289 
have four different type of automobiles
to<00:01:32.159> satisfy<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:34.070> pollution<00:01:35.070> norms<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.579> also

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
to satisfy the pollution norms and also

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.499 
to satisfy the pollution norms and also
the<00:01:36.570> design<00:01:36.930> standards<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.880> a<00:01:38.880> particular

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
the design standards of a particular

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.190 
the design standards of a particular
engine<00:01:39.960> for<00:01:40.710> providing<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.909> maximum

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
engine for providing the maximum

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.789 
engine for providing the maximum
efficiency<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.979> if<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.729> take<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.180> CF<00:01:45.570> oil<00:01:46.380> it

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
efficiency so if you take the CF oil it

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.450 
efficiency so if you take the CF oil it
has<00:01:47.420> the<00:01:48.420> properties<00:01:48.899> like<00:01:49.079> between<00:01:49.740> the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
has the properties like between the

has the properties like between the
piston<00:01:50.880> deposits<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.600> can<00:01:51.750> see<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.990> piston

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
piston deposits you can see the piston

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.670 
piston deposits you can see the piston
deposit<00:01:52.740> sits<00:01:52.920> there<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:54.320> corrosion<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.380> also

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
deposit sits there and corrosion is also

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.709 
deposit sits there and corrosion is also
corrosion<00:01:56.159> resistant<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.149> also<00:01:57.479> will<00:01:57.630> not

have been found out to improve the
quality<00:04:33.020> of<00:04:33.470> the<00:04:34.250> oil<00:04:34.550> so<00:04:34.970> that<00:04:35.170> the

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.170 
quality of the oil so that the

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.960 
quality of the oil so that the

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
efficiency of the engine can be further

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.650 
efficiency of the engine can be further

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
improved and increased so this we talked

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.890 
improved and increased so this we talked
