00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
look where the glint is it's right where

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.710 
look where the glint is it's right where
the<00:01:34.010> antenna<00:01:34.370> on<00:01:34.550> the<00:01:34.670> astronauts<00:01:35.180> backpack

Killian had sped the footage up way too

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.140 
Killian had sped the footage up way too
fast<00:03:19.820> and<00:03:20.299> that's<00:03:20.989> why<00:03:21.350> it<00:03:21.410> looked<00:03:21.680> unnatural

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
fast and that's why it looked unnatural

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.240 
fast and that's why it looked unnatural
you<00:03:24.150> got<00:03:24.420> this<00:03:24.540> this<00:03:24.750> is<00:03:24.930> a<00:03:24.960> jump<00:03:25.950> salute

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
you got this this is a jump salute

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.530 
you got this this is a jump salute
showing<00:03:27.290> John<00:03:28.290> young<00:03:28.500> jumping<00:03:29.040> no<00:03:29.460> oh<00:03:29.700> yeah

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
showing John young jumping no oh yeah

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.190 
showing John young jumping no oh yeah
jumped<00:03:30.990> out<00:03:31.610> okay<00:03:32.610> now<00:03:32.790> now<00:03:33.600> they<00:03:33.720> can<00:03:33.840> see

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
jumped out okay now now they can see

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.990 
jumped out okay now now they can see
there<00:03:34.410> he<00:03:34.500> is<00:03:34.530> that<00:03:35.010> it's<00:03:35.220> been<00:03:35.460> slowed<00:03:35.790> down

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
there he is that it's been slowed down

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.360 
there he is that it's been slowed down
by<00:03:36.150> fifty<00:03:36.390> percent<00:03:36.420> so<00:03:37.050> if<00:03:37.680> this<00:03:37.950> clip<00:03:38.160> was

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
by fifty percent so if this clip was

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.310 
by fifty percent so if this clip was
slowed<00:03:38.610> down<00:03:38.640> by<00:03:38.820> fifty<00:03:39.210> percent<00:03:39.240> what<00:03:40.230> we

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
slowed down by fifty percent what we

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.150 
slowed down by fifty percent what we
would<00:03:40.470> want<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:40.710> do<00:03:40.860> here<00:03:41.160> go<00:03:41.700> here<00:03:42.050> insert

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
would want to do here go here insert

velocity<00:03:44.160> and<00:03:44.940> we've<00:03:45.030> got<00:03:45.150> our<00:03:45.270> velocity<00:03:45.690> up

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810

here<00:03:45.990> now<00:03:46.230> we're<00:03:46.380> going<00:03:46.500> to<00:03:46.590> do<00:03:46.800> what<00:03:47.520> we<00:03:47.580> want

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
here now we're going to do what we want

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.000 
here now we're going to do what we want
to<00:03:47.820> do<00:03:47.910> now<00:03:48.060> is<00:03:48.360> increase<00:03:49.200> its<00:03:49.380> velocity<00:03:49.590> by

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
to do now is increase its velocity by

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.170 
to do now is increase its velocity by
fifty<00:03:50.700> percent

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
fifty percent

I<00:06:49.150> think<00:06:49.600> it's<00:06:49.720> very<00:06:50.050> clear<00:06:50.440> that<00:06:50.860> in<00:06:51.040> Percy's

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430 
I think it's very clear that in Percy's

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.210 
I think it's very clear that in Percy's
case<00:06:51.700> it<00:06:52.000> can<00:06:52.419> only<00:06:52.690> be<00:06:53.500> a<00:06:53.530> lie

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:54.220 
case it can only be a lie

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.909 
case it can only be a lie
and<00:06:54.490> yes<00:06:55.030> we've<00:06:55.630> done<00:06:55.840> the<00:06:55.930> necessary<00:06:56.410> work<00:06:56.500> to

00:06:56.909 --> 00:06:56.919 
and yes we've done the necessary work to

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:00.000 
and yes we've done the necessary work to
establish<00:06:57.040> that<00:06:57.490> percentage<00:06:57.940> bogus<00:06:58.870> he<00:06:59.740> lies

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.010 
establish that percentage bogus he lies

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.010 
establish that percentage bogus he lies
yet<00:07:00.460> again<00:07:00.760> we<00:07:01.030> need<00:07:01.180> a<00:07:01.240> bunch<00:07:01.479> David<00:07:01.900> are

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:02.020 
yet again we need a bunch David are

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.960

now if we slow it down by the

now if we slow it down by the

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:34.120 
6 g environment ok so what's wrong with

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.910 
6 g environment ok so what's wrong with
that<00:07:34.330> let's<00:07:34.990> look<00:07:35.170> at<00:07:35.320> the<00:07:35.410> slow<00:07:35.680> version

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:35.920 
that let's look at the slow version

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:41.340 
that let's look at the slow version
again<00:07:36.370> and<00:07:36.640> look<00:07:37.060> at<00:07:37.180> his<00:07:37.300> hands<00:07:39.870> see<00:07:40.870> his

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:41.350 
again and look at his hands see his

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.220 
again and look at his hands see his
hands<00:07:41.920> didn't<00:07:42.490> move<00:07:42.820> after<00:07:43.210> he<00:07:43.660> dropped<00:07:43.960> the

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:44.230 
hands didn't move after he dropped the

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:48.930 
hands didn't move after he dropped the
objects<00:07:44.890> but<00:07:45.370> Scots<00:07:45.850> did<00:07:46.950> see<00:07:47.950> his<00:07:48.160> arms<00:07:48.520> they

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:48.940 
objects but Scots did see his arms they

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:53.370 
objects but Scots did see his arms they
move<00:07:49.150> off<00:07:49.360> to<00:07:49.570> the<00:07:49.690> side<00:07:51.720> now<00:07:52.720> let's<00:07:53.080> see<00:07:53.260> it's

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:53.380 
move off to the side now let's see it's

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.440 
move off to the side now let's see it's
fed<00:07:53.680> up<00:07:53.890> what<00:07:54.250> we<00:07:54.400> know<00:07:54.760> to<00:07:54.820> be<00:07:55.030> the<00:07:55.180> right

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:55.450 
fed up what we know to be the right

00:07:55.450 --> 00:08:02.130 
fed up what we know to be the right
amount<00:07:56.640> 246<00:07:57.640> %<00:07:59.520> look<00:08:00.520> at<00:08:00.670> that<00:08:00.880> can<00:08:01.540> you<00:08:01.570> move

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:02.140 
amount 246 % look at that can you move

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.530 
amount 246 % look at that can you move
your<00:08:02.200> arms<00:08:02.650> that<00:08:02.800> fast<00:08:03.130> in<00:08:03.460> a<00:08:03.880> bulky<00:08:04.360> space

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:04.540
