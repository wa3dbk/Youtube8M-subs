us the new case which is quite original
in<00:00:21.330> shape<00:00:21.570> so<00:00:22.080> random<00:00:22.590> can<00:00:22.710> you<00:00:22.800> tell<00:00:22.950> us

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
in shape so random can you tell us

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.800 
in shape so random can you tell us
something<00:00:23.340> about<00:00:23.430> this<00:00:23.730> yes<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.510> our<00:00:24.630> new

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
something about this yes this is our new

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.230 
something about this yes this is our new
case<00:00:25.050> based<00:00:25.320> on<00:00:25.470> an<00:00:25.590> armor<00:00:25.920> series<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.940> armor

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.750 
case based on an armor series the armor
830<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:28.619> only<00:00:29.039> reason<00:00:29.369> we<00:00:29.490> create<00:00:29.730> these

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
830 the only reason we create these

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.240 
830 the only reason we create these
cases<00:00:30.300> we<00:00:30.780> actually<00:00:30.810> restructure<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:32.009> looks

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
cases we actually restructure it looks

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.850 
cases we actually restructure it looks
like<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.489> landmarks<00:00:33.120> but<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.750> doesn't<00:00:34.079> we

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
like a landmarks but it doesn't we

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.950 
like a landmarks but it doesn't we
restructure<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.730> can<00:00:35.820> fit<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.420> latest

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
restructure that so it can fit a latest

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.149 
restructure that so it can fit a latest
graphic<00:00:37.350> card<00:00:37.530> which<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.239> 12<00:00:39.239> inch<00:00:39.359> long<00:00:39.539> and

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:40.159 
graphic card which is a 12 inch long and

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:43.549 
graphic card which is a 12 inch long and
we<00:00:41.159> have<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.309> top<00:00:41.579> fan<00:00:41.819> on<00:00:41.969> top<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:43.050> dissipate

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
we have a top fan on top to dissipate

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.599 
we have a top fan on top to dissipate
the<00:00:43.620> heat<00:00:43.789> it's<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.909> 23<00:00:45.449> cm<00:00:45.780> fan<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.710> that's<00:00:47.429> a

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
the heat it's a 23 cm fan and that's a

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:51.169 
the heat it's a 23 cm fan and that's a
90<00:00:48.510> million<00:00:48.780> millimeter<00:00:49.679> fan<00:00:49.949> in<00:00:50.550> front<00:00:50.609> and

00:00:51.169 --> 00:00:51.179 
90 million millimeter fan in front and

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:54.649 
90 million millimeter fan in front and
then<00:00:51.839> we<00:00:52.019> open<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.559> on<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> site<00:00:53.010> van<00:00:53.510> so<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:54.659 
then we open it on a site van so the

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:57.709 
then we open it on a site van so the
heat<00:00:54.870> can<00:00:54.899> dissipate<00:00:55.469> at<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.739> back<00:00:55.949> with<00:00:56.909> 260

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
heat can dissipate at the back with 260

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.800 
heat can dissipate at the back with 260
million<00:00:58.019> event

00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.810 
million event

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.230 
million event
we<00:01:00.290> adjust<00:01:00.710> a<00:01:00.830> high<00:01:01.040> so<00:01:01.400> you<00:01:01.460> can<00:01:01.670> fit<00:01:01.910> a<00:01:01.940> better

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:02.240 
we adjust a high so you can fit a better

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.990 
we adjust a high so you can fit a better
cooler<00:01:02.540> instead<00:01:02.990> of<00:01:03.260> low-profile<00:01:03.860> cooler<00:01:04.129> and

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
cooler instead of low-profile cooler and

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.720 
cooler instead of low-profile cooler and
besides<00:01:05.810> that<00:01:06.050> installation<00:01:06.650> is<00:01:07.250> really

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:07.730 
besides that installation is really

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.150 
besides that installation is really
critical<00:01:08.390> in<00:01:08.630> this<00:01:08.810> case<00:01:09.080> so<00:01:09.800> we<00:01:09.950> make<00:01:10.130> a

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
critical in this case so we make a

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.030 
critical in this case so we make a
malleable<00:01:10.580> tray<00:01:10.880> and<00:01:11.180> hopefully<00:01:11.960> to<00:01:12.650> enhance

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
malleable tray and hopefully to enhance

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.910 
malleable tray and hopefully to enhance
the<00:01:13.190> user<00:01:13.400> experience<00:01:13.520> on<00:01:14.180> putting<00:01:14.780> on<00:01:14.990> the

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
the user experience on putting on the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.630 
the user experience on putting on the
system<00:01:16.310> back<00:01:16.910> in<00:01:17.090> peace<00:01:17.380> so<00:01:18.380> how<00:01:18.740> many<00:01:18.800> hard

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
system back in peace so how many hard

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.620 
system back in peace so how many hard
drives<00:01:19.850> can<00:01:20.060> it<00:01:20.180> support

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
drives can it support

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.320 
drives can it support
well<00:01:21.200> actually<00:01:21.619> support<00:01:22.100> two<00:01:22.670> three<00:01:23.060> and<00:01:23.240> a

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
well actually support two three and a

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.630 
well actually support two three and a
three<00:01:23.600> and<00:01:23.720> a<00:01:23.780> half<00:01:23.960> inch<00:01:24.200> and<00:01:24.800> then<00:01:25.070> two<00:01:25.250> two

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
three and a half inch and then two two

already starting to support the USB 3
yes<00:01:43.940> right<00:01:44.899> now<00:01:45.050> the<00:01:45.110> USB<00:01:45.590> 3<00:01:46.039> is<00:01:46.280> actually<00:01:46.550> from

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
yes right now the USB 3 is actually from

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.840 
yes right now the USB 3 is actually from
the<00:01:47.630> external<00:01:48.080> like<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.649> motherboard<00:01:49.130> ok<00:01:49.610> and

in<00:01:50.119> future<00:01:50.479> of<00:01:50.630> course<00:01:50.869> we<00:01:51.080> will<00:01:51.229> make<00:01:51.440> some

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
in future of course we will make some

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.660 
in future of course we will make some
changes<00:01:52.759> to<00:01:52.820> feed<00:01:53.270> those<00:01:53.810> 3.0<00:01:54.770> that<00:01:55.460> has<00:01:55.640> a

but<00:02:04.369> are<00:02:04.490> we<00:02:04.610> created<00:02:04.939> on<00:02:05.119> go<00:02:06.130> something<00:02:07.130> like

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
but are we created on go something like

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.809 
but are we created on go something like
that

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
that

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.270 
that
oh<00:02:08.849> I<00:02:09.390> see<00:02:09.869> so<00:02:10.049> it's<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.259> dongle<00:02:10.590> connected<00:02:11.129> onto
