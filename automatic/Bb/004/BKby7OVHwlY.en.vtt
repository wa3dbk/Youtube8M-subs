00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.620
 hello youtube friends we are this time 

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:09.500
 in a tutorial that I'm going to teach you 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.390
 record videos of your games on the 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.160
 desktop any application that 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.350
 you have and upload it to youtube in a 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.130
 more or less simple quality like 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.650
 just have on my channel 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.110
 that is by the way 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.800
 the program is called band and cam is a 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.910
 program style 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.180
 fraps which is worth 33 euros so now 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.430
 you know if you want to buy it from your 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.020
 web pages I already have it downloaded and 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.330
 others so the step we're going to 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.240
 obviate and let's start from the 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:43.010
 principle is worth this 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.900
 and I talk about the program 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.260
 quantum 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:53.309
 very well 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:56.769
 this is what we are going to put right now 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.920
 to see the program will give us two options 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:02.289
 a record by selecting the size of the 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.960
 screen here or section we will do by 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:08.049
 He sat example 160 as not marked 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.590
 a picture like this or full screen and we have 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:14.320
 the whole screen or full windows and 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.330
 we choose the rectangle for example from 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.110
 this window and it will record only the 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.770
 this window this is valid for games 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.960
 in window mode and others very well 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.550
 for now let's leave it like that 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.880
 and berga 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.940
 and there it does not bother 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.070
 we start with the options 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.590
 and I think we can put it in English 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.300
 truth to see if I remember how it was that 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.380
 say in Spanish 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.150
 in general it can be 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.630
 tongues 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.579
 Spanish 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.530
 It should be noted that the game although 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:55.240
 you can buy also you can play not 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.399
 I wanted you can also use it 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.409
 in test mode let's just let you 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.890
 a watermark will come up 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:05.390
 with the handicap website as usual 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.330
 be the same job 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.330
 cool to see how I configured it for 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.790
 record the videos in full hd 720p 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.200
 obviously because if it would not be a 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.209
 Fucking to be uploading videos 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.600
 centralizing and so on to start the 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:23.300
 output folder will acquire everything 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.760
 what we record, I have it in 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.270
 the folder by default document 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.920
 quantum 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.770
 alteration completed here we do not touch 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.980
 nothing is worth this is if we want it to be 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:38.310
 stop the recording when they pass 15 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.220
 minutes when they pass I do not know the weight of 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.860
 500 megs 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.990
 I leave it like that and then after 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.500
 when I start producing the video 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.870
 and short what I see that's enough to 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.200
 cut it to lower the weight and I 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.700
 I advise you to do the same as me 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.530
 in video here we put the hot cakes in 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.780
 this case f 12 that comes by default I 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.459
 I will leave the same because it is not 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.080
 now with no game except for 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.520
 some of sting what happens the catches and 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:11.180
 but nothing happens 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:14.840
 here comes the good in the format of 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.180
 video there are some presets 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.930
 default settings that I 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.660
 I advise to ignore them totally because 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:29.330
 I like nothing as I do as I left 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:33.230
 my videos like this we set size 1280 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:37.700
 x 720 worth this is done so that the 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:40.930
 Video come out in good quality 720p fps 30 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.689
 or 25 the truth is that the same thing 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.730
 the mpg codec i leave it so you can 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:47.590
 choose different styles of codec with 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.159
 this with what the video will be recorded 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.319
 speed goes well also what happens is that 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:56.049
 for example if you want to avoid it in the 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:04:00.549
 sony vegas xvii I think it does not pick you up 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:02.260
 audio mpeg1 if the activity I do not 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.750
 it would also leave the same as it is or 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:10.430
 It also ends quality has always 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:14.210
 Storm quality stereo channels 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:17.720
 without perfect stretch marks I would not record in hd 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:20.480
 720p would go well that thing you can play 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.970
 If you see that you are too much 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.010
 audio would leave it like that if I would not put it 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.350
 pcm but I think this gets 122 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.030
 sure you can also leave it as well 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.810
 If you put it on pcm, also what it comes 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.910
 sony vegas 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.880
 You can download the drop 80 too 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:39.690
 you can be changing the codes you can 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.610
 download this at 25 fps I recorded it like this and I 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.750
 it is well worth 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:47.730
 what else to record the sound 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.400
 the primary device the sounds of 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:54.960
 Windows 7 with this you pick everything 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.820
 that what the pc emits or that is what 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.840
 take out your speakers or helmets 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:03.030
 whatever headphones and devices 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.130
 secondary if you want to speak for 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.260
 microphone as I do I can select 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.030
 the microphone of your france telecom o 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.030
 desktop 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.160
 and click on the option that both 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.420
 primary device as the secondary 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.420
 are recorded at the same time 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:24.930
 nothing to touch this already the configuration 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:28.500
 of windows just in case you want to 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:31.350
 I know how to raise the level decrease it is worth 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.480
 but in theory we already supposed to 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:36.490
 you have set the theme no and the logo 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.440
 I have a logo 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.940
 and added what the video is going to 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:44.169
 add we select them this 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:47.480
 choice 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:51.020
 here he is worth 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:54.020
 the logo of the opposite png so that the 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.910
 background does not look and pick it up pretty 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:00.010
 all right 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:02.200
 and try as you can see and that 's where the 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:05.630
 I put it up there because it is not 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.460
 crazy any videogame site 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.430
 It's done 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.229
 the image this is to make screenshots of 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.449
 screen I do not do screen contrast 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:18.330
 well so I do not touch it 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:22.680
 now let's record a moment with the 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:24.720
 thematic software and see you 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.820
 very good we are already here with the 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.389
 Van Dyck and software you will note 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.530
 because this will make the logo up 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:33.570
 and because I guess it will have changed 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:36.720
 a little bit what is the quality of the video 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:40.440
 we are not going to minimize this and I'm going now 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:43.259
 to instruct a little if this is annoying 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.360
 or we're worth it, I think by default this 

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:47.220
 it's always up so what 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.840
 we must do is remove it from something it is a 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.940
 top 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.470
 so that it is not always above 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.180
 france for example if we open one 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:55.800
 folder folder of the program yes 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.660
 we had so possible we will do something 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:02.280
 comfortable window this would always be 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:05.850
 up we're going to see her, and it's a little 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:07.949
 Oil vale I do what I see 

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:10.770
 I always put it here in a little way and 

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:12.449
 I put a little opacity like this is this 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:16.440
 percent so that it does not harm the 

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:19.050
 no view and if you want then if you want 

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:21.210
 see how it goes in the games because you have my 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.070
 youtube channel that will be here 

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:24.270
 you have my YouTube channel and you can see 

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.700
 any of the videos and you see the 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:29.160
 quality with which it records the weight of the 

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.260
 videos is not bad at all is very 

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.680
 all right 

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:35.420
 and it was edited with you sing more 

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.700
 forward because there is a small tutorial 

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:40.910
 how to render it so that everything comes out 

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:45.100
 perfect so I hope nothing to see you 

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:45.100
 new in a new tutorial see you later
