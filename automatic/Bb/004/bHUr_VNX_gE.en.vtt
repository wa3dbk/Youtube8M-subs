00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
general I don't know if it's a really a

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.789 
general I don't know if it's a really a
MOBA<00:01:26.400> but<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.270> sense<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.780> but<00:01:28.619> it's

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
MOBA but in a sense it is but it's

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.520 
MOBA but in a sense it is but it's
really<00:01:29.009> like<00:01:29.280> breaking<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:30.140> you<00:01:31.140> met<00:01:31.409> with

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
really like breaking the you met with

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.920 
really like breaking the you met with
the<00:01:31.680> structure<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.369> low<00:01:32.670> bar<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.600> it's<00:01:33.810> an

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
the structure of the low bar so it's an

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.929 
the structure of the low bar so it's an
arena<00:01:34.350> game<00:01:34.590> but<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.400> end<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.790> day

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
arena game but in the end of the day

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.580 
arena game but in the end of the day
it's<00:01:36.210> kind<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.659> like<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.840> mobile<00:01:37.079> because<00:01:37.350> it

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
it's kind of like a mobile because it

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.880 
it's kind of like a mobile because it
has<00:01:37.799> an<00:01:38.009> objectives<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.850> has<00:01:39.060> turrets<00:01:39.390> and

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
has an objectives and has turrets and

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.530 
has an objectives and has turrets and
the<00:01:40.890> other<00:01:41.040> mode<00:01:41.310> actually<00:01:41.729> has<00:01:41.850> base<00:01:42.210> which

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
the other mode actually has base which

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.090 
the other mode actually has base which
you<00:01:42.659> need<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.930> destroy<00:01:43.350> but<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.710> doesn't<00:01:44.009> have

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
you need to destroy but it doesn't have

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.719 
you need to destroy but it doesn't have
minions<00:01:44.430> or<00:01:44.670> anything<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:46.220> the<00:01:47.220> other<00:01:47.520> thing

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
minions or anything and the other thing

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.270 
minions or anything and the other thing
about<00:01:47.970> this<00:01:48.450> game<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:48.780> really<00:01:49.110> cool<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.829> it

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
about this game is really cool is it

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.039 
about this game is really cool is it
actually<00:01:50.700> has<00:01:50.820> last<00:01:51.360> amount<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.810> characters

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
actually has last amount of characters

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.139 
actually has last amount of characters
like<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.649> think<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:52.920> has<00:01:52.979> 34<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.820> that's<00:01:53.970> not

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
like I think it has 34 and that's not

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.800 
like I think it has 34 and that's not
even<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.509> all<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:56.060> things<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.180> can<00:01:57.360> do<00:01:57.540> like

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
even the all and things you can do like

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.260 
even the all and things you can do like
the<00:01:58.439> item<00:01:58.619> system<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.280> totally<00:01:59.430> different<00:02:00.030> so

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
the item system is totally different so

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.200 
the item system is totally different so
you<00:02:00.360> have<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.719> pretty<00:02:00.930> much<00:02:01.640> choose<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.820> items

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
you have to pretty much choose the items

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.780 
you have to pretty much choose the items
before<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:04.259> hop<00:02:04.590> into<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.950> game<00:02:05.219> so<00:02:05.549> just

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
before you hop into the game so just

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.300 
before you hop into the game so just
pretty<00:02:06.509> much<00:02:06.689> unlike<00:02:06.899> an<00:02:07.020> item<00:02:07.259> set<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.770> each

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
pretty much unlike an item set and each

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.869 
pretty much unlike an item set and each
other<00:02:08.580> camp<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:09.000> created<00:02:09.420> five<00:02:09.690> times<00:02:09.989> and

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
other camp you created five times and

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.979 
other camp you created five times and
then<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:11.970> have<00:02:12.120> of<00:02:12.270> course<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.690> four

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
then you have of course the four

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.900 
then you have of course the four
abilities<00:02:13.560> I<00:02:13.590> think<00:02:13.980> there's<00:02:14.129> passive<00:02:14.670> two

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
abilities I think there's passive two

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.160 
abilities I think there's passive two
and<00:02:15.739> one<00:02:16.739> ultimate<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.700> all<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.720> general

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
and one ultimate and all the general

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.530 
and one ultimate and all the general
stuff<00:02:19.500> there's<00:02:20.160> mana<00:02:20.400> potions<00:02:20.940> also<00:02:21.390> this

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
stuff there's mana potions also this

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.390 
stuff there's mana potions also this
like<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.780> trap<00:02:22.110> system<00:02:22.590> which<00:02:22.739> you<00:02:22.860> can<00:02:23.010> enter

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
like a trap system which you can enter

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.630 
like a trap system which you can enter
traps<00:02:23.730> but<00:02:24.090> these<00:02:24.300> cost<00:02:24.599> like<00:02:24.780> fifty<00:02:25.020> cold

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
traps but these cost like fifty cold

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.320 
traps but these cost like fifty cold
whatever<00:02:26.640> they're<00:02:26.879> called<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:29.030> those<00:02:30.030> like

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
whatever they're called and those like

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.210 
whatever they're called and those like
I'm<00:02:30.540> implies<00:02:31.080> when<00:02:31.290> people<00:02:31.620> walk<00:02:31.920> through

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
I'm implies when people walk through

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.100 
I'm implies when people walk through
them<00:02:32.430> then<00:02:32.730> there's<00:02:32.940> like<00:02:33.180> this<00:02:33.330> radar<00:02:33.599> system

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
them then there's like this radar system

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.839 
them then there's like this radar system
which<00:02:34.260> kind<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:34.590> reveals<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.099> traps<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.700> I

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
which kind of reveals the traps and I

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.820 
which kind of reveals the traps and I
think<00:02:36.269> it<00:02:36.390> rid<00:02:36.569> of<00:02:36.660> those<00:02:36.750> trapped<00:02:37.080> in<00:02:37.290> it

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
think it rid of those trapped in it

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.280 
think it rid of those trapped in it
Wiggles<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.430> brew<00:02:38.640> system<00:02:38.970> also<00:02:39.599> like<00:02:40.110> if

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
Wiggles the brew system also like if

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.339 
Wiggles the brew system also like if
somebody<00:02:40.709> is<00:02:40.800> taking<00:02:40.980> on<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.400> brush<00:02:41.640> um<00:02:42.349> this

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
if you really solve around at least it

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.259 
if you really solve around at least it
may<00:02:51.269> be<00:02:51.330> on<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.629> very<00:02:51.870> first<00:02:52.260> minute<00:02:52.560> or<00:02:52.739> two
