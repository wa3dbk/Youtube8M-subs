00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.370
 jams 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.960

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.960
 to contradict you but nique your mother 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.520
 the problem of nice brandy and that it's 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.100
 a big con you agree the problem of 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.680
 nordine and that's that I give you a 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.529
 example is that a kid of two years 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.930
 and meat to eat an ox that's 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.669
 meat to eat morandini it's from 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.930
 too expensive chopped meat I made a 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.760
 program for children at the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.700
 television that was called how to deny 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.379
 the children have leveled all the 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.570
 evenings is what you find it's 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.219
 not completely con that when you 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.450
 question a bad you him from our 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.010
 chocolate comes from where they answer you to 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.690
 these convoys when I hear that then 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.680
 just at school we were learning 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.180
 unfortunately it's done more to 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.180
 school january today your mother 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.920
 it despairs me when I hear that 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.789
 I swear I want to shit it's 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.739
 the fault is the poop of shit 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:07.439
 situation of the kids is appalling and 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.049
 his school mayor me of my time on 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.150
 was learning to shit in the sea 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.439
 so you know it's happening 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.640
 by the television then is what you 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.600
 would like to think about that because you 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.340
 animates a show that works very well 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.720
 on France inter which is called this 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.350
 do not eat it's been moving for years 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.090
 said m 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.369
 ten years for four years forgiveness is this 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.650
 that you would like 15 years of forgiveness is this 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.540
 that you might like to transfer 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.380
 this show on TV where 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.090
 the fit you would touch 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.460
 certainly a lot more young people and 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.299
 on France inter auctions I pooped 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.299
 in a summer camp 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.810
 I took 400 go to the bank room 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.500
 who had never seen when standards 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.030
 are six 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.009
 understand the problem is that there are 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.200
 kids who have never seen a huge are 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.890
 six we are big shots that 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.440
 they have nothing 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.549
 think of tribes who know egypt 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.770
 what it's like to shoot a good 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.660
 huge on six 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.660
 [Music]
