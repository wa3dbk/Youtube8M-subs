00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.220
 hi hello everyone for me it's a pleasure 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:09.210
 be back with you and good at 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.210
 this design of 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:15.400
 easy lionesses from let's see what it is 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:20.290
 what I'm going to use I 'm going to use this 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:22.529
 phoenix enamel is the hot name 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.529
 beach 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:31.620
 and I'm going to use these 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:37.670
 enamels that are for designs this is from 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:37.670
 l to color if it is of the brand absolut 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.510
 this is in the tone 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.450
 baby peak and this one I think it has no tone 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.140
 but good or as you see are those who 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.140
 they have him 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:59.510
 the long brush to make them 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.030
 the designs that well 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:06.470
 what I'm going to do is put a very 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:09.860
 thin of this enamel would not be very 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.720
 good that it resembled the enamel that 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.299
 let's put as a base one of the two 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.310
 this is the one that I have more like no 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.920
 I have a shorter pink like this but 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.710
 well, it does not matter what I'm going to use 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.159
 I'm just going to put a very 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.159
 thin 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:42.770
 If you want this step this can be 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:47.100
 providing this is not totally necessary 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:50.340
 do it but if you do not want them to be left 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:54.300
 holes in the nail that look the color of 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.940
 the color of the natural nail can 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.350
 do it if I do not tell them they can leave the 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:03.450
 Natural nail so natural is not this 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.940
 totally necessary to do it but good 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.010
 in this case I'm going to do that I'm going to 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.039
 first use the short blue 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.950
 very good 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:16.740
 and this design I said is not practical how 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:21.300
 There are lines 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:23.760
 vertical is a rose a blue pink blue and 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.590
 so in itself is the pure design by the 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.970
 pure lines 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.970
 it does not force and open it 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.800
 I have to use my teeth 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.800
 and good 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.540
 I'm going to start with the blue me 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.209
 I usually start with the sun but 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.780
 can start with you stay and well I'll 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.780
 to start with 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.250
 horizontal lines 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:55.370
 that I'm going to leave a space more or less 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:58.269
 of the size of the line for this doing 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.269
 the pink lines 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.910
 and they can do the amount that you 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.780
 want lines and for which they are 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.650
 reach in your 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.650
 the dream 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.790
 ok and well I will continue with the 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.340
 next nails and right now it returns 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:46.140
 well already finished putting on the blue 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:50.810
 now I'm going to put the pink lines ok 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.810
 with the rose jito very well 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.330
 and I'm going to put in the spaces that I left 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.210
 if they pass 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:16.160
 or stain can correct 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.160
 there is no problem 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.630
 and if they go to blue this can 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:29.540
 Wait for it to dry and pass the 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.540
 blue color as you see that is how it looks 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:39.379
 ok and well I will continue with 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.810
 besides nails 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.190
 you can use the colors that you 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.190
 want 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.960
 I really like this combination of a 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:14.919
 light pink with 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.919
 with this blue 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:20.889
 and good 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:24.400
 this is how it is already only clean 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:27.849
 a little and put on your dryer coat or 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:31.539
 of brightness and this and this is how is the 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:34.919
 design that I hope you have them
