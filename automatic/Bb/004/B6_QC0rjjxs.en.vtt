00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 Hi, how are you, good guys, I'm with 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.660
 a new gameplay from the lego batman game 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.580
 2 I'm with a special Friday and 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.199
 this Friday special because I bring 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.240
 unlocking lego cars from 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.670
 goldman 2 ok guys we are going to 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.140
 unlock our first car 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.140
 airplane vehicle 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.970
 or object that helps us to mobilize 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.970
 OK 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.620
 ok let's go for this we enter 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.110
 the map we have to go to the plant 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.660
 wastewater treatment 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.260
 and the first one that we are going to unblock is 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.810
 the one that I just pointed out on the map 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.450
 I recommend that you activate jce 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.510
 all the red legos blocks since 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.120
 will help us a lot look how I 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:59.200
 help me find these objects 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:02.080
 for example and here we have the micro vtol 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.659
 from the ex corp we can buy it for a 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.700
 million pieces of lego guys 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.560

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.270

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.000

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.250

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.689
