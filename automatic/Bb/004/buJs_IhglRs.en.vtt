 interesting today I make you 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.690
 exactly the video we are today 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.500
 it's the 4th of June at 16 hours 52 years old 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.689
 and that there may be some stuff that 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.430
 will have evolved I speak with you 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.689
 ask questions you answer them in 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.910
 the comments a next video at 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.340
 early I put the advice that I preferred 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.800
 finally here and that's how it is 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.630
 this party has the first a big info 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.610
 of the day is the soap opera marco 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.730
 garatti so why the real 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.890
 madrid would have made a big offer for 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.390
 marco v ratiches starts at the beginning of 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.309
 the afternoon or the morning maybe 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.410
 it started with that we were talking about a 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.399
 big offer for marco garatti from the 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.379
 share of real madrid 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.329
 according to the gazzetta dello sport it's ed 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.520
 60 million euro for the 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.500
 Paris midfielder with 6 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.129
 million euros net per year to the key in 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.410
 as wages in the end then the 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.629
 rim to ati we will have learned so who 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.280
 would have gone three times 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.530
 madrid to discuss his client 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.140
 then we would have an info according to di mare 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.119
 diot that the agreement would have even been 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.280
 found but not the sum of 60 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.560
 million boe of 50 million euros for 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.330
 that in the end we are told by 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.490
 me m drink so thanks again to him who 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.500
 is he really very great journalist 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.060
 like what finally no money 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.880
 would have denied and he was in Italy 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.219
 and that he would have seen no faith 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.439
 florentino perez so voila it was 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:32.399
 really today's soap opera 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.799
 it was this story mark 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.700
 operation went from nothing to nothing so 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.920
 I still had a question to 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.140
 to ask you his imaginations that marco will see 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.240
 if they go to real madrid at barça where 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.470
 you want this season do you 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.030
 think it would be a big loss 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.009
 for paris saint germain and that with 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.549
 his sous he can not find better 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.590
 finally 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.670
 I give you my opinion 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.490
 reply in the comments and I 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.659
 will put the reviews after me I think 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.920
 it would be a real loss for the paris 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.329
 holy germain it will be really a very 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.340
 good rookie for any club 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.049
 what it is really a very very big 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.459
 player then will not have to make jealous 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.310
 we talked about real madrid 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:08.610
 we speak barcelona pedro extended with 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.170
 the fc barcelona then he is 27 years old he 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.780
 shut up we will say he is imprisoned 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.830
 even in paris Saint-Germain his pole has 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.140
 says on twitter I'm completely 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.660
 agree with him in his under the guy at 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.610
 27 years old he does not play and they extend and 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.940
 its release clause is at 150 million 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.230
 euros 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.750
 that is, nobody will buy it 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.160
 for already for that sum and he goes 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.310
 certainly not played there is neymar 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.540
 suarez and messi 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.040
 even in small matches am not 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.350
 make sure that the already play there he wants 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.430
 really put very very little so I 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.720
 think it's a shame 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.510
 he may have had a future in 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.090
 arsenal we talked about maybe me at his 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.650
 place I would have I would have left and I 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.150
 wanted to know your opinion is this 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.340
 it's a good choice for pedro 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.650
 to have extended with the FC Barcelona 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.019
 then we learned at the beginning after 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.220
 noon that chiellini would be forfeit 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.930
 the final champions league is 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.910
 really a very hard blow a roof 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.280
 anything is really a very 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.720
 very big blow for the juventus 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.900
 because it's really low their 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.690
 shock advocates to this team of 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.459
 iowa and it's going to be really very very 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.829
 big misses I think for them for the 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.359
 champions league final 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.980
 we'll see we'll see how it's going 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.380
 pass for them and I wanted to know 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.549
 your opinion the winner it's worth 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.609
 think he will win this final 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.810
 the league champions say me the score 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.639
 extension not prolongation between the 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.569
 juventus and fc barcelona i think that 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.130
 most will lift me this is 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.349
 barcelona we'll see if there are any 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.889
 try the surprise juventus I'm told that 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.680
 in the comments 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.599
 for me my opinion 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.670
 I think the var is very very strong 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.090
 this year but that as it plays on 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.430
 a match 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.200
 the juventus can do something if 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.120
 extension 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.620
 even without the extension it is possible 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.549
 that the jura he beats everything is possible 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.230
 way it's a final in football 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.640
 everything is possible always juventus we have 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.379
 learned today that dibala has 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.780
 engaged with juventus the attacker 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.579
 Argentinian very very very good rookie 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.560
 for juventus this is my opinion of course 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.750
 that he is a very good recruit he has 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.819
 signed for five years 32 million euros 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.159
 + € 8 million bonus 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.780
 so frankly very very big shot the 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:03.650
 share of juventus a very young player 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.870
 very talented 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.220
 do you think that's it 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.620
 a good rookie for juventus 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.700
 chapel to you the supporters of the 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.870
 wolf and to me responds to what you 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.669
 think it's going to be a very good 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.430
 rook knowing you have morata 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:17.389
 carlos tevez is what it prevents 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.579
 departure from tevez 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.989
 I do not know what to say to you 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.919
 in the comments last point the 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.889

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:26.330
