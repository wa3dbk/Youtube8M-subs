 hello friends with you again to the artery 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.230
 if you have not subscribed 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.610
 subscribe to my channel so 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.210
 greet you friends with you again 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.070
 flat and today i will talk about 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:17.130
 transitions in sony vegas and although i'm honest 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.050
 saying I will say this I practically them I 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.430
 In general, I do not use it because 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.519
 I do not see the point in having them 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.470
 possible to use someone 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.510
 need and means I was asked a question 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.230
 The question was whether it can be done 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.719
 bulk add transitions in order 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:39.300
 so as not to sweat with the addition 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.739
 transitions between each fragment for 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.899
 those who do not know the transition is such 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.000
 the thing is when we change pictures 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:51.260
 and it is usually inserted between 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.760
 certain pieces of our video 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.629
 how to add just transition i think you 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.949
 know you just drag in between 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.170
 between the pieces 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.899
 then tune it up and ready before but 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.200
 What if we have, for example, very 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.570
 many pieces and you need to add in each 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.900
 transition and we don't want to bother with 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.979
 by this 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.170
 for this there is a very simple way so 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.049
 where is there to go then there was my transition 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.040
 favorite favorite in that its 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.750
 very clearly visible on the image then 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.520
 There is such a good strip from 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.799
 principle so that you can see just 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.320
 what where does he go so look 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.340
 just how do i think i think yes 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.020
 push 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:41.220
 clamp shift select and take the transition 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.840
 our and insert between choose any 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.780
 the place is no matter because 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.000
 transitions are put everywhere that is immediately 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.170
 customize 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.750
 on the left to the left is not important at all here and 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.360
 Here we have transitions pasted everywhere 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.219
 there is between each between each column 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.619
 that is all you need to do it 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.460
 pre-select your pieces where 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.159
 you want to leave transitions 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.259
 but pay attention to what happened and we 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:12.040
 although we set up this period but 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.470
 so that all transitions go on the right side 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.270
 they all go on the left side that is what 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.910
 it means it means it is configured 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.150
 only the first shift and you will need to 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.280
 individually configure each transition 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.580
 it is very uncomfortable so i advise 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.020
 so as not to waste your nerves if you 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.200
 want to use transitions 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.690
 use transitions with settings by 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.570
 default that is, by default or not 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.959
 use them altogether because well I don't 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.550
 I know I see no point in using them 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:46.510
 so if you use choose 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.340
 transition which you like that's not 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.489
 change the settings there in this case yes 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:55.230
 here you can highlight add transitions and 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:58.630
 they are placed between each piece of roller 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.060
 that's all for today only 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.250
 such a short answer to short 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.530
 question thank you for watching 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.760
 subscribe to my channel put 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.760
 thumbs up given meetings yet
