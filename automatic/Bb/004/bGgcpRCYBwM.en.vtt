the trick is pour the water a little bit

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.499 
the trick is pour the water a little bit
at<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.840> time<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:53.700> water<00:01:53.909> can<00:01:54.149> get<00:01:54.450> through

those little holes in that filter yeah I
think<00:01:59.490> that's<00:01:59.759> okay<00:02:00.090> if<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.240> water<00:02:00.390> level

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
think that's okay if the water level

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.389 
think that's okay if the water level
goes<00:02:00.780> down<00:02:00.840> we<00:02:01.200> can<00:02:01.320> always<00:02:01.530> add<00:02:01.679> some<00:02:01.710> more<00:02:02.160> I

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
goes down we can always add some more I

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.449 
goes down we can always add some more I
think<00:02:02.970> you<00:02:03.179> could<00:02:03.390> see<00:02:03.690> it<00:02:03.869> going<00:02:03.899> down<00:02:05.570> and

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
think you could see it going down and

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:09.380 
think you could see it going down and
that's<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.789> want<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.060> allow<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.239> little

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
that's it you want to allow a little

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.990 
that's it you want to allow a little
space<00:02:09.929> on<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.200> top<00:02:10.530> for<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.860> pig<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.280> sit<00:02:11.730> well

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
space on the top for the pig to sit well

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.570 
space on the top for the pig to sit well
so<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.780> water<00:02:12.959> doesn't<00:02:13.170> spill<00:02:13.410> over<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:14.010> that

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
so the water doesn't spill over and that

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.750 
so the water doesn't spill over and that
should<00:02:14.820> take<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.390> few<00:02:16.080> minutes<00:02:16.500> -<00:02:17.040> all<00:02:17.550> right

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760

should take a few minutes - all right
