7000<00:04:18.989> is<00:04:19.140> the<00:04:19.320> phone<00:04:19.530> to<00:04:19.769> go<00:04:19.890> for<00:04:20.630> allow<00:04:21.630> us<00:04:21.750> to

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
7000 is the phone to go for allow us to

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.150 
7000 is the phone to go for allow us to
compare<00:04:22.140> the<00:04:22.320> camera<00:04:22.800> on<00:04:22.980> both<00:04:23.220> phones<00:04:23.550> guys

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
compare the camera on both phones guys

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.280 
compare the camera on both phones guys
so<00:04:26.160> I<00:04:26.220> click<00:04:26.490> some<00:04:26.669> images<00:04:27.150> and<00:04:27.390> let<00:04:27.570> me<00:04:27.720> jump

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
so I click some images and let me jump

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:36.460 
so I click some images and let me jump
to<00:04:29.100> the<00:04:29.250> gallery<00:04:29.760> I<00:04:30.080> show<00:04:31.080> you<00:04:31.110> the<00:04:31.740> same<00:04:31.950> image

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.680 

so<00:04:37.470> in<00:04:37.950> this<00:04:38.130> case<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.520> flash<00:04:38.730> was<00:04:39.090> used<00:04:39.419> by

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
so in this case the flash was used by

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.560 
so in this case the flash was used by
both<00:04:40.350> the<00:04:40.560> phones<00:04:40.830> and<00:04:41.220> see<00:04:41.850> the<00:04:42.000> result<00:04:42.330> of

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
both the phones and see the result of

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.930 
both the phones and see the result of
worth<00:04:42.750> in<00:04:42.960> text<00:04:43.290> the<00:04:44.040> picture<00:04:44.400> is<00:04:44.550> rendered

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.909 
worth in text the picture is rendered
almost<00:04:45.210> useless<00:04:45.870> I<00:04:46.290> mean<00:04:46.470> it's<00:04:46.620> too<00:04:46.740> much

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
almost useless I mean it's too much

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.770 
almost useless I mean it's too much
