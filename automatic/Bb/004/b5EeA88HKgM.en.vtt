00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.760
 bringing you another gameplay 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:22.580
 commented on the channel and for young Americans 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.580
 another episode of our series playing 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.920
 with 11 inscribed gurizada 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.010
 This is the series that the name already says is the 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.079
 series that is a game with you but today 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.370
 here guys I'm not with comments to 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.749
 I'm actually doing a post comment there 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.449
 because I really liked this gameplay 

00:00:38.749 --> 00:00:43.519
 I got some kilda time there at the beginning. 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.999
 one of the bada had to kill with two 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:49.010
 shots kind of shoot out coaches pr but 

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:50.569
 It's because she gives a lot of pace, mark Carlito. 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.329
 you have to improve a lot with it to 

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:55.489
 able to hit because he wanted to because 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.109
 very difficult expensive but I liked it 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.030
 gameplay took an hour and I think now 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.829
 that commerce would kill everyone and not 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.769
 stopped more and got the medal of 10 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.860

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.100

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.930
 people were giving fish to my xr 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.760
 dude then that's why she's from 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.800
 That's the agreement and that's why I'm 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.650
 playing pepe that in my opinion is the 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.300
 worst weapon is one of the worst in the 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.160
 all codes are not expensive 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.310
 and I was giving the fish window then 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.480
 everyone was there says the hyper guy 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.090
 It's been an hour since I told you everything. 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.680
 world put xr but at that time there I 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.540
 had just assembled the crowd then 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.820
 I just wrote I picked up, I looked for a 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.830
 Personal room and called the cards 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.240
 I played vambora galera for a 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.520
 gap and such 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.350
 It was really cool, I had a lot of fun then. 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.540
 why will often turn seriously 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.850
 once I bring more I do not know 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.680
 whether it will be live commentary always or 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.110

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.090

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.890
 you unfortunately do not have a face yet 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.630
 Someone is already arriving in the end guys 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.640
 I entered very quickly here I 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.240
 I got to surf very fast or three 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.310
 few minutes of gameplay 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.540
 I hope you have enjoyed yourself 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.520

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.080
 thousand shot in the face was fucking new 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.860
 I think I'm going to die one more time and 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:41.080
 then I almost die, man, go there for the 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.660
 Who now was in the here and now is not anymore 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:47.620

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:53.220
