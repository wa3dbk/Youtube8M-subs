00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.040
 with grand thef auto 5 rock star has 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.100
 tried to reinvent different 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.110
 ways the open world game 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.370
 the world of coconut is wonderful 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.370
 gigantic and varied 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.920
 a satirical and immense version of 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.250
 modern south california 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.580
 with seas and mountains luxury shops and 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.160
 shopping centers urban decadence and 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.630
 virgin nature beaches and areas 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:44.440
 isolated the sublime and the ridiculous 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.440
 greed and hypocrisy 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.620
 back yesterday poly explain crew white 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.620
 left and work 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.100
 for the first time the game does not have 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.900
 a single aspiring hero but with 3 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.880
 maikel in his day a successful robber of 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.030
 banks and today a not so successful father of 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.030
 family 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.750
 franklin a street hustler 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.750
 convinced to be surrounded by imbeciles 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.570
 and then this truce 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.570
 The less I say about him the better 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.910
 thanks to the three protagonists 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.310
 they remodel both the narration in a 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.909
 interlaced history as the structure 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.770
 of individual missions 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.030
 players can alternate between 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.579
 prospects 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.819
 and go from a dizzying moment to 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.819
 other 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.390
 and it would be very weird 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.250
 and this allows missions 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.729
 acquire new levels of diversity and 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.729
 intensity 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:10.099
 outside of a mission the use of three 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.030
 protagonists also allows adding a 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:16.280
 touch of voyeurism since you can 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.410
 find out when you want in 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.410
 that your new friends have been involved 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.640
 the world is not only huge but it is 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.920
 full of things to see and do 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.090
 customize cars 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:52.050
 pilot aircraft buy clothes to do 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:55.020
 sport go in search of nirvana 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.410
 dive in the ocean observe animals 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.850
 hunt and be hunted out weird guys that 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:05.100
 watch or know tomorrow 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:08.100
 collect rewards and much more 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.100
 good 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.540
 There has also been a lot of emphasis on 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.370
 game mechanics so that all your 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.090
 aspects are so fun and fluid 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.090
 as broad 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.769
 all either drive and shoot 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.410
 or tennis and riding a bike results 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.660
 fun and interactive 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.850
 however in addition to engaging in leisure 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.880
 people should also address their 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:44.320
 business for all your pretensions 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.320
 These men are dangerous thieves 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.240
 and to survive they have to plan 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.390
 and perform a series of blows each 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.790
 more audacious times 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.340
 are the players plan for themselves 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.120
 themselves and then decide how and with whom 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.120
 execute them 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:14.189
 I 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:26.160
 of the loot you decide what to spend the 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.720
 money from sensible investments like 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.720
 tattoos and fast cars 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.409
 to risky projects like actions and 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:37.919
 properties in the saints 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:41.909
 and there 's also grand thef auto online 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.909
 that we will show shortly
