 finally you're here invited like 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.600
 but you actually have that on 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.670
 an artist name so my artist 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.880
 But must hobby but facebook has me 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.220
 once blocked and wanted to stop that 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.199
 I give my and then you have 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:37.170
 made so that the third air 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:38.730
 mammut promises that right on everyone 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.070
 find a case and we have already 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.270
 Open your side for those who are 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.820
 not knowing 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:50.700
 you have 80,000 subscribers listening so thinks 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.190
 you look at what the guy in a 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.770
 private side there is a thousand 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:02.460
 Subscribe because you like funny videos 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:03.690
 Do it right and I think it is 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.939
 we sleep directly my 1 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.460
 look at it because otherwise you'll break it 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.590
 not what's going on here 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.780
 I have now just one 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.920
 favorites picked out 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.530
 I 'm pretty much so you're doing 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.540
 different videos but we go there 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.100
 is not all in style but us 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.400
 Nevertheless, let us watch it 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.400
 force 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:49.070
 very briefly where do you have this woman 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.259
 found and why do you hate me 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.320
 Why do you have such a thing? 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.819
 so how can you insist on his 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.909
 home she is what your colleagues 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:00.890
 steer or something and that falls immediately 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.689
 there on this too conspicuous the 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.979
 Exaggerates the situation a bit then 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.990
 I thought I know what transmits too 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.149
 a little bit later made easy 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.099
 but that was not your first video 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.099
 No, that was not even the video 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:15.890
 first video supermarket with the purchase us 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.900
 exactly what made because we were a 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.530
 head with my colleagues now brings 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:29.349
 also brought on so a few of them 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:32.170
 for a small follow-up we were there 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:34.280
 shopping in any case in Kaufland and 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.650
 there the snake was too long 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.310
 and thought there were smocks on so 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.130
 a freezer and we thought 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.109
 we can come all the way to the front now 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.299
 is so brother knows what makes my video 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.709
 the catastrophe is another video 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.030
 I now have this smock on it 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.650
 this deep culture and that's what I give 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.569
 me just as a Kaufland employee 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.109
 and then just have her swifter 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.910
 can now go to checkout 5 comes in the front 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:00.350
 later because there because the snake 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.239
 Less was the one we all wanted 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.590
 consequences 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.630
 that was really sympathetic to this one 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.190
 followed a bit and then this has 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.299
 fully absorbed tumor 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:15.639
 So actually you have one then 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:15.639
 a little per minute 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.900
 you posted that because somehow 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:25.010
 but I was funny you are whole 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.260
 normal man with few friends like that and 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.220
 Suddenly, what does all of a sudden mean but you 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.079
 have in any case 80 thousand 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.579
 subscribers is how does that work ? 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.889
 you just have to be funny gives me 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:36.109
 Just as I am and I am 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:39.109
 just a spontaneous guy and I do 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.829
 just so few crazy things and has 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:41.810
 I did not expect it now 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.720
 that it comes to that, I said 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.459
 I just posted it and suddenly 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.069
 that's divided by paid to split 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.930
 and yes that's the video thing 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.040
 Actually, then quite around 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.659
 So people went 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.760
 and then it started 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:57.620
 otherwise they have subscribed to you as well 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.180
 So it looks like then subscribed 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.269
 I uploaded another video and you 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:06.950
 never before and so on it was just with 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:11.870
 just show it again 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.769
 but again something else and indeed 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.510
 that's nice, too 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:17.799
 that show again from the beginning 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.799
 so much fun 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:58.449
 the whole studio I can do it somehow 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:02.530
 somehow 100 facial muscles more than 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:05.380
 I kinda brown your eyes so folks 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.360
 because she why so i mean ok 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.889
 somehow you have such an effect that 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.720
 all people have to laugh about themselves 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.789
 and somehow you have this too 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.169
 Effect that all directly this 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:15.789
 I have to need a message 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.460
 because someone has seen it quite funny 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:19.900
 but how was that for you as you? 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.599
 somehow app have noticed the 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.949
 paying subscribers rising like hell straight 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:27.250
 somehow yes that gives me a lot 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:28.539
 motivation has bock you go genuine 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.610
 to make people laugh so one 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:32.139
 looks okay you will succeed 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.639
 People like and like people I like 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:36.580
 funny then you have more desire to lust 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.360
 But then, of course, every time 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.009
 everything spontaneously 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.690
 every time you think of something then 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:43.690
 Do it easy and if it's good 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.880
 is over because yes that exaggerates 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.370
 again, on the other hand, this is already one more time 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:52.500
 Girl exaggerates the sweet though 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.500
 but knows about the stairs a bit and 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:06:06.310
 based on java company even or human 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:07.479
 until I mean you do too we can 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.039
 So you should be too 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:11.500
 somehow among those just closing the 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:17.620
 dm hinz without it all synonymous somehow 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:20.080
 Shit Yes I do not have a bad if 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.030
 you can make the stuff but I do 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.370
 my there are so many comedians on the 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:27.610
 world that really makes money from it 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:29.440
 want to write and the skits and that 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.960
 very meticulous planning and somehow 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:35.169
 planning jokes and so you fall for it 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.669
 is a bit too close anyway and me 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:37.840
 believe you can so I do not know if 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:39.280
 you can do that yourself if you 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.080
 somehow 80,000 at a time to the 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.759
 just so funny because you 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.830
 somehow uploaded private video 

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:49.419
 but these people are planning something 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:51.099
 so often they are not funny so you 

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:52.659
 often realizes what is planned and 

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:54.430
 that's written and what's funny 

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:56.400
 but want to be ours if you just 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.870
 to be as good as you are 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.729
 So I did not expect it 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.840
 I did not even know what 

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:02.699
 I want to make money with it now or 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.139
 anything else but if you then 

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:05.400
 gives as it is then that's easy 

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:08.639
 Do you want to do it all up ? 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:11.460
 his private profile looks like it 

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:12.930
 with any youtube channel or 

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.780
 other plans we will be the same 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.979
 In any case, still discuss everything 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.479
 He will definitely stay one more time 

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:20.479
 a little bit with us and I hope you too 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.659
 was 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.780
 more
