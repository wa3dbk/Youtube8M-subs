right now um please have a look have it
ready<00:01:53.490> for<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.899> new<00:01:54.899> stereo<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.470> be<00:01:55.619> I'm<00:01:55.860> wired

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
ready for the new stereo to be I'm wired

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.740 
ready for the new stereo to be I'm wired
up<00:01:56.369> we<00:01:56.490> just<00:01:56.610> need<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.850> unplug<00:01:57.119> those<00:01:57.390> and

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
up we just need to unplug those and

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.490 
up we just need to unplug those and
unplug<00:01:58.590> those<00:01:58.680> boys<00:01:58.920> I'm<00:01:59.640> gonna<00:01:59.820> be<00:02:00.000> um

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
unplug those boys I'm gonna be um

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.289 
unplug those boys I'm gonna be um
crimping<00:02:01.500> cutting<00:02:01.979> soldering<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.790> so<00:02:02.939> forth

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
crimping cutting soldering and so forth

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.109 
crimping cutting soldering and so forth
but<00:02:03.920> that's<00:02:04.920> pretty<00:02:05.250> much<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.729> get<00:02:06.030> the

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
but that's pretty much it to get the

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.350 
but that's pretty much it to get the
stereo<00:02:06.360> in<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.819> so<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:08.879> basically<00:02:09.090> just

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
stereo in a so you basically just

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.929 
stereo in a so you basically just
reverse<00:02:09.810> all<00:02:10.020> those<00:02:10.140> steps<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.739> just<00:02:10.770> said

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:11.939 
reverse all those steps that I just said

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:16.440 
reverse all those steps that I just said
to<00:02:12.939> put<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.209> new<00:02:13.329> stereo<00:02:13.629> back<00:02:13.870> in<00:02:15.450> wiring

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
to put the new stereo back in wiring

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.270 
to put the new stereo back in wiring
diagrams<00:02:17.019> and<00:02:17.170> so<00:02:17.319> forth<00:02:17.620> you<00:02:17.680> can<00:02:17.920> find<00:02:18.159> on

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
diagrams and so forth you can find on

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
the internet if not the off got wiring

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.209 
the internet if not the off got wiring

website bolting it on to the stereo

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.020 
website bolting it on to the stereo
where<00:02:30.250> you<00:02:30.310> can<00:02:30.459> see<00:02:31.290> right<00:02:32.290> there<00:02:32.349> where<00:02:33.030> the

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
where you can see right there where the

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.819 
where you can see right there where the
brackets<00:02:34.450> didn't<00:02:34.719> quite<00:02:34.930> fit<00:02:35.200> this<00:02:35.469> stereo

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
brackets didn't quite fit this stereo

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:37.740 
brackets didn't quite fit this stereo
when<00:02:35.980> I<00:02:36.010> first<00:02:36.400> installed<00:02:36.549> it<00:02:36.909> so<00:02:37.659> you're

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
when I first installed it so you're

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.420 
when I first installed it so you're
basically<00:02:38.049> going<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.349> skip<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.799> custom<00:02:39.250> fit

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
basically going to skip the custom fit
