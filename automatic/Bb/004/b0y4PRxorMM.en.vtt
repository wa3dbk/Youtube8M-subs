bass sounds and also there'll be some
dancing<00:00:47.840> okay<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.739> now<00:00:49.890> we're<00:00:50.070> looking<00:00:50.160> at<00:00:50.340> the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
dancing okay so now we're looking at the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.700 
dancing okay so now we're looking at the
screen<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.180> HD<00:00:51.660> 500<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.410> can<00:00:52.530> see<00:00:52.680> I

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
screen of the HD 500 and you can see I

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.380 
screen of the HD 500 and you can see I
have<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.949> very<00:00:53.280> simple<00:00:53.730> signal<00:00:54.030> chain<00:00:54.180> here

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
have a very simple signal chain here

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.229 
have a very simple signal chain here
just<00:00:54.780> one<00:00:55.140> amp<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.460> new<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.969> PEG

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
just one amp and that is the new and PEG

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.939 
just one amp and that is the new and PEG
inspired<00:00:57.690> b15<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.530> flip-top

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
inspired b15 the flip-top

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.549 
inspired b15 the flip-top
so<00:00:59.820> you've<00:01:00.090> got<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.570> cabinet<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.379> goes

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
so you've got the cabinet that goes

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.319 
so you've got the cabinet that goes
right<00:01:01.739> along<00:01:01.859> with<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.520> have<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.149> amp

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
right along with it and you have the amp

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.520 
right along with it and you have the amp
so<00:01:03.449> if<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.719> double<00:01:03.989> click<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.199> enter<00:01:04.379> button

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
so if you double click the enter button

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.920 
so if you double click the enter button
you<00:01:04.769> can<00:01:04.890> get<00:01:05.070> into<00:01:05.390> basically<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.510> editing

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
you can get into basically the editing

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.109 
you can get into basically the editing
area<00:01:07.320> for<00:01:07.860> all<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.549> parameters<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.000> the

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
area for all of the parameters of the

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.760 
area for all of the parameters of the
amp<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.689> can<00:01:09.930> see<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.290> actually<00:01:10.470> has

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
amp and you can see that it actually has

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.240 
amp and you can see that it actually has
eight<00:01:11.040> different<00:01:11.100> microphones<00:01:11.990> so<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.380> ton<00:01:14.220> of

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
eight different microphones so a ton of

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.890 
eight different microphones so a ton of
brand-new<00:01:14.939> microphones<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.630> were<00:01:15.720> all

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
brand-new microphones that were all

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.570 
brand-new microphones that were all
captured<00:01:16.229> just<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:17.009> cabinet<00:01:17.430> which<00:01:17.549> is

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
captured just on this cabinet which is

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.630 
captured just on this cabinet which is
pretty<00:01:17.820> cool<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:19.619> see<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.860> same<00:01:20.070> exact

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
pretty cool and you see the same exact

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.359 
pretty cool and you see the same exact
sort<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.600> granularity<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.860> power<00:01:23.100> amp

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
sort of granularity in the power amp

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.980 
sort of granularity in the power amp
section<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.939> had<00:01:24.240> when<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:24.720> started

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
section that you had when we started

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.780 
section that you had when we started
adding<00:01:25.200> this<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.710> last<00:01:25.920> pot<00:01:26.220> update<00:01:26.549> so

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
adding this and the last pot update so

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.210 
adding this and the last pot update so
you've<00:01:26.909> got<00:01:27.150> master<00:01:27.960> volume<00:01:28.140> sag<00:01:28.680> you've<00:01:29.070> got

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
you've got master volume sag you've got

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.429 
you've got master volume sag you've got
hum<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.880> have<00:01:30.090> all<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.479> bias<00:01:30.659> excursion<00:01:31.350> and

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
hum you have all the bias excursion and

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.960 
hum you have all the bias excursion and
the<00:01:31.530> bias<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.070> traditionally<00:01:32.610> had<00:01:32.790> in

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
the bias that you traditionally had in

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.819 
the bias that you traditionally had in
last<00:01:33.119> update<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:33.900> can<00:01:34.110> still<00:01:34.350> tweak<00:01:34.500> the

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
last update so you can still tweak the

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.649 
last update so you can still tweak the
bass<00:01:34.979> amp<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.400> same<00:01:35.610> way<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.240> same<00:01:36.270> thing

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
bass amp the same way and the same thing

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.810 
bass amp the same way and the same thing
works<00:01:36.780> for<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.049> plexi<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:38.340> have<00:01:38.579> the

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
works for the plexi and you have the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.630 
works for the plexi and you have the
same<00:01:39.090> cabinet<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:40.020> page<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.280> had<00:01:41.460> before

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
same cabinet a page that you had before

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.730 
same cabinet a page that you had before
with<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.150> addition<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.720> new<00:01:42.960> one<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.470> so

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
with the addition of a new one and so

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.039 
with the addition of a new one and so
now<00:01:43.979> you've<00:01:44.280> got<00:01:44.430> some<00:01:44.610> deep<00:01:44.880> cabinet<00:01:45.750> editing

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
now you've got some deep cabinet editing

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.690 
now you've got some deep cabinet editing
parameters<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:46.619> you've<00:01:46.770> got<00:01:46.950> resonance<00:01:47.340> level

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
parameters so you've got resonance level

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.539 
parameters so you've got resonance level
you've<00:01:48.210> got<00:01:48.240> thump<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.409> also<00:01:49.619> have<00:01:50.040> decay

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
you've got thump and you also have decay

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.330 
you've got thump and you also have decay
so<00:01:50.880> between<00:01:51.030> decay<00:01:51.509> on<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.409> page<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.979> early

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
so between decay on this page and early

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.620 
so between decay on this page and early
reflection<00:01:53.850> on<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.149> other<00:01:54.270> page<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.540> can

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
reflection on the other page you can

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.569 
reflection on the other page you can
actually<00:01:54.810> sort<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.140> dial<00:01:55.380> in<00:01:55.590> or<00:01:55.710> dial<00:01:56.040> out<00:01:56.310> any

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
actually sort of dial in or dial out any

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.550 
actually sort of dial in or dial out any
ambient<00:01:57.420> room<00:01:57.540> noise<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.079> might<00:01:58.259> want

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
ambient room noise that you might want

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.350 
ambient room noise that you might want
on<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.860> speaker<00:01:59.159> cabinet<00:01:59.549> so<00:02:00.149> it's<00:02:00.240> actually

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
on that speaker cabinet so it's actually

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.999 
on that speaker cabinet so it's actually
really<00:02:00.659> really<00:02:00.780> flexible<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:01.680> let's<00:02:01.920> go

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
really really flexible so let's go

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:02.749 
really really flexible so let's go

slap baseline and a little P bass style
baseline<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.540> hear<00:02:06.780> what<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:06.990> sounds<00:02:07.229> like

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
baseline to hear what it sounds like

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:29.319 
baseline to hear what it sounds like
with<00:02:07.530> just<00:02:07.770> his<00:02:07.950> very<00:02:08.190> simple<00:02:08.610> signal<00:02:08.879> chain

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.339 

you<00:02:30.329> can<00:02:30.450> tell<00:02:30.569> that<00:02:30.629> the<00:02:30.750> bass<00:02:30.870> sounds<00:02:31.140> really

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
you can tell that the bass sounds really

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.680 
you can tell that the bass sounds really
nice<00:02:31.440> in<00:02:31.709> multiple<00:02:32.129> pickup<00:02:32.430> positions<00:02:32.849> so<00:02:33.180> it

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
nice in multiple pickup positions so it

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.030 
nice in multiple pickup positions so it
sounds<00:02:34.019> like<00:02:34.110> a<00:02:34.140> my<00:02:34.290> cabinet<00:02:34.650> it's<00:02:34.769> awesome

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
then I have the NPAC again but I'm gonna

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.379 
then I have the NPAC again but I'm gonna
switch<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.709> mic<00:02:55.950> let's<00:02:56.280> switch<00:02:56.519> that<00:02:56.639> to<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:56.790> 57

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:57.389 
switch the mic let's switch that to a 57

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:58.849 
switch the mic let's switch that to a 57
on<00:02:57.510> axis<00:02:57.959> there<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:58.500> go

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
on axis there you go

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.759 
on axis there you go
and<00:02:59.090> I've<00:03:00.090> got<00:03:00.239> a<00:03:00.269> low<00:03:00.480> res<00:03:00.690> delay<00:03:01.049> and<00:03:01.379> also<00:03:01.590> a

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
and I've got a low res delay and also a

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.670 
and I've got a low res delay and also a
little<00:03:02.159> bit<00:03:02.280> of<00:03:02.370> reverb<00:03:02.579> so<00:03:03.239> um<00:03:03.560> let<00:03:04.560> us

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
little bit of reverb so um let us

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:44.630 
little bit of reverb so um let us
commence<00:03:05.069> with<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.430> dancing

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.830 

all<00:03:45.640> right<00:03:45.760> so<00:03:45.850> we're<00:03:45.970> done<00:03:46.030> with<00:03:46.120> base<00:03:46.390> let's

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
all right so we're done with base let's

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.180 
all right so we're done with base let's
go<00:03:46.960> in<00:03:47.080> here<00:03:47.230> with<00:03:47.290> this<00:03:47.380> new<00:03:47.530> plexi<00:03:47.920> sounds

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
go in here with this new plexi sounds

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.280 
go in here with this new plexi sounds
like<00:03:48.370> by<00:03:48.580> recalling<00:03:48.970> it's<00:03:49.120> reset<00:03:49.510> and<00:03:49.870> now<00:03:50.230> you

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
like by recalling it's reset and now you

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.270 
like by recalling it's reset and now you
can<00:03:50.440> see<00:03:50.590> that<00:03:50.710> I<00:03:50.770> have<00:03:50.920> two<00:03:51.130> different

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
can see that I have two different

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.890 
can see that I have two different
versions<00:03:51.550> of<00:03:51.820> that<00:03:51.940> I<00:03:51.970> am<00:03:52.120> PI<00:03:52.360> but<00:03:52.510> normal<00:03:52.810> and

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
versions of that I am PI but normal and

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.170 
versions of that I am PI but normal and
bright<00:03:53.110> and<00:03:53.320> both<00:03:53.860> of<00:03:53.890> them<00:03:54.160> default<00:03:54.520> to<00:03:55.150> a

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
bright and both of them default to a

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.320 
bright and both of them default to a
4-12<00:03:55.810> with<00:03:56.590> 25<00:03:57.310> watt<00:03:57.490> greenbacks<00:03:57.850> in<00:03:58.000> them<00:03:58.120> and

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
4-12 with 25 watt greenbacks in them and

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.750 
4-12 with 25 watt greenbacks in them and
a<00:03:58.420> 421<00:03:58.960> on<00:03:58.990> it<00:03:59.200> if<00:03:59.410> I<00:03:59.620> recall<00:03:59.980> my<00:04:00.130> preset<00:04:00.550> you

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
a 421 on it if I recall my preset you

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.360 
a 421 on it if I recall my preset you
can<00:04:00.910> see<00:04:01.090> that<00:04:01.360> I've<00:04:01.840> got<00:04:02.020> a<00:04:02.080> 4038<00:04:02.830> ribbon<00:04:03.190> on

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
can see that I've got a 4038 ribbon on

if<00:04:15.760> you<00:04:15.880> look<00:04:15.970> at<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.150> signal<00:04:16.420> chain<00:04:16.540> from

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
if you look at the signal chain from

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.140 
if you look at the signal chain from
left<00:04:16.930> to<00:04:16.989> right<00:04:17.170> I<00:04:17.380> have<00:04:17.799> a<00:04:17.830> fuzz<00:04:18.130> I<00:04:18.580> have<00:04:19.060> the

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
left to right I have a fuzz I have the

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.449 
left to right I have a fuzz I have the
amp<00:04:19.299> I<00:04:19.660> have<00:04:20.320> an<00:04:20.410> EQ<00:04:20.769> which<00:04:20.950> is<00:04:21.070> pulling<00:04:21.340> out

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
amp I have an EQ which is pulling out

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.790 
amp I have an EQ which is pulling out
just<00:04:21.640> a<00:04:21.670> little<00:04:21.700> bit<00:04:21.970> of<00:04:22.030> low<00:04:22.150> mid<00:04:22.360> and<00:04:22.800> a

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
just a little bit of low mid and a

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.680 
just a little bit of low mid and a
ping-pong<00:04:24.370> delay<00:04:24.580> and<00:04:24.910> that's<00:04:25.030> it<00:04:25.210> now<00:04:25.570> the

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
ping-pong delay and that's it now the

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.510 
ping-pong delay and that's it now the
whole<00:04:25.840> idea<00:04:26.230> behind<00:04:26.290> this<00:04:26.680> example<00:04:27.010> is<00:04:27.340> I'm

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
whole idea behind this example is I'm

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.100 
whole idea behind this example is I'm
going<00:04:27.700> to<00:04:27.760> be<00:04:27.820> using<00:04:28.120> the<00:04:28.210> guitars<00:04:28.570> volume

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
going to be using the guitars volume

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.650 
going to be using the guitars volume
knob<00:04:29.290> to<00:04:29.530> do<00:04:29.620> all<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:30.010> changes<00:04:30.490> for<00:04:30.730> me<00:04:30.910> so

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
knob to do all the changes for me so

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.720 
knob to do all the changes for me so
until<00:04:32.080> I<00:04:32.140> hit<00:04:32.230> the<00:04:32.290> fuzz<00:04:32.620> all<00:04:33.040> of<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.430> changes

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
until I hit the fuzz all of the changes

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.100 
until I hit the fuzz all of the changes
you're<00:04:33.880> hearing<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:34.210> tone<00:04:34.420> are<00:04:34.720> based<00:04:34.960> upon

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
you're hearing the tone are based upon

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.140 
you're hearing the tone are based upon
me<00:04:35.410> just<00:04:35.620> turning<00:04:35.920> the<00:04:35.980> guitar<00:04:36.280> up<00:04:36.490> so<00:04:36.970> it's<00:04:37.060> a

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
me just turning the guitar up so it's a

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.240 
me just turning the guitar up so it's a
very<00:04:37.360> natural<00:04:37.630> feeling<00:04:38.260> tactile<00:04:39.010> feeling

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
very natural feeling tactile feeling

00:04:39.250 --> 00:05:59.330 
very natural feeling tactile feeling
amplifier<00:04:39.760> so<00:04:40.060> here<00:04:40.300> we<00:04:40.390> go

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.460 

and<00:06:00.750> finally<00:06:01.750> if<00:06:01.870> you<00:06:01.960> want<00:06:02.110> to<00:06:02.169> check<00:06:02.320> out

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
and finally if you want to check out

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.350 
and finally if you want to check out

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
what that vintage tube mic preamp sounds

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.060 
what that vintage tube mic preamp sounds
like<00:06:04.540> that<00:06:04.900> would<00:06:05.020> be<00:06:05.139> under<00:06:05.380> the<00:06:05.410> preamp<00:06:05.889> and

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
like that would be under the preamp and

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.439 
like that would be under the preamp and
EQ<00:06:06.430> section<00:06:07.919> scroll<00:06:08.919> to<00:06:09.070> the<00:06:09.190> end<00:06:09.340> and<00:06:09.669> those

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:10.449 
EQ section scroll to the end and those

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:13.879 
EQ section scroll to the end and those
parameters<00:06:10.930> are<00:06:10.960> gain<00:06:11.729> output<00:06:12.729> phase<00:06:13.540> reverse

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:13.889

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:17.760 
parameters are gain output phase reverse
high-pass<00:06:14.889> filter<00:06:15.280> and<00:06:15.520> low-pass<00:06:16.510> filter<00:06:16.900> so

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
high-pass filter and low-pass filter so

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.200 
high-pass filter and low-pass filter so
it<00:06:17.800> sounds<00:06:18.070> great<00:06:18.250> in<00:06:18.400> front<00:06:18.729> of<00:06:18.940> or<00:06:19.180> behind

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.969 
it sounds great in front of or behind
instruments<00:06:20.020> it<00:06:20.139> also<00:06:20.320> sounds<00:06:20.680> great<00:06:20.830> when

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:20.979 
instruments it also sounds great when

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:22.439 
instruments it also sounds great when
you<00:06:21.100> combine<00:06:21.490> it<00:06:21.520> with<00:06:21.699> the<00:06:21.880> optical<00:06:22.240> tube

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:22.449 
you combine it with the optical tube

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:23.700 
you combine it with the optical tube
limiter<00:06:22.840> because<00:06:23.050> that<00:06:23.169> makes<00:06:23.290> a<00:06:23.380> really<00:06:23.530> nice

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710
