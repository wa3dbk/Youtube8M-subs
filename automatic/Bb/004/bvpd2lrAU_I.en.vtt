out<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.640> downside<00:01:45.450> though<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.049> voice

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
out a downside though is that the voice

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.350 
out a downside though is that the voice
command<00:01:46.829> doesn't<00:01:47.250> work<00:01:47.399> for<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.729> Entune<00:01:48.060> apps

so<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.869> can<00:01:49.110> use<00:01:49.229> voice<00:01:49.409> command<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.890> do<00:01:49.979> all

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
so you can use voice command to do all
