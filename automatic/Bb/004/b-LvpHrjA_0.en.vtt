 this is the first fully game pc 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:32.460
 in the console format in the small 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.079
 housing only a volume of 25 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.070
 Liters have a concept to hide 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.420
 processor has a full-fledged 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.430
 graphics card geforce gtx 750i at the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.789
 especially narrow front one sees here 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.730
 already the power switch including one 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.379
 button for mirja ks the wireless 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.750
 transmission standard below

 mini jack connections for headphones and 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.360
 microphone or headsets two 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.920
 USB ports so you just mouse fast 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.210
 and the keyboard or a usb-stick 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.129
 can connect and not behind that 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.960
 housing must crawl the lower 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.540
 usb-port is even suitable for 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.610
 very fast loading of 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.570
 smartphones or tablets the others 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.600
 Connections are located on the 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.600
 back 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.540
 here you can see the hd led so the 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.670
 equipment indicator below again 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.170
 three more minijack connections 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.729
 as well as a digital sound connection hdmi 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.579
 and displayport both for the 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.040
 image output a network connection if 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.540
 one wants to play by cable the chip 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.829
 but also supports the latest wifi 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.930
 standard 802.11 ac the usb 3.0 ports 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.610
 are not dyed black here now 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.950
 blue as usual just to make it so 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.770
 Black and red design fits though 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.420
 still full usb3 speed and 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.210
 here finally the connection for 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.979
 the external power supply my personal 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.020
 highlight with the animal is that one 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.009
 him even despite his small size 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.400
 can still upgrade 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:02.450
 this is easy 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:05.060
 take off the side flap and then see 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.410
 here already a free bay me 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.180
 have to just go screw around us 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.619
 save time 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:14.090
 Here you can just an ordinary 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:16.870
 Then install the 2.5 inch hdd or ssd 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.910
 simply connected by sata 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.610
 By default, a 250 gigabyte ssd 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.520
 or a terabyte hdtv installed 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.380
 which is firmly integrated in the housing and 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.450
 because the user before buying the choice 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.180
 would like to use water in this 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.530
 flap, the memory is also 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.090
 Here you can use the modules if needed 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.459
 exchange 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.370
 by default it is 8gb ddr3 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.350
 1600 save as we have already 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.230
 seen the jet is very suitable 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.750
 good for current games but he is 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.670
 also very economical 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.530
 so you can see it here though like crysis 3 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.950
 play consumes the entire system 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.120
 only about 67 watts this 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.780
 Power consumption is at larger 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.670
 pc already do not do anything in this if the sb 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.040
 little burden is, for example, the 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.410
 surfing is only possible at even 15 to 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.800
 20 watts less than some 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.800
 energiesparlampe 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:16.269
 Of course, the rat is also suitable 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.269
 Perfect on the machines more often go 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:28.200
 at first nine games if that's you 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.230
 video has fallen then give us 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.340
 please a thumbs up 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.200
