00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.999
Today's topic is the mysterious paper mache.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.999
This material seems to be quite mysterious to some folks

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.999
so now I'm gonna show you how to work with it on my sword!

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.999
First of all, we have the carved expanding foam here, 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.999
the problem  however is that there are a lot of little holes everywhere 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.999
and if we were to work on it as it is, we'd have to fill them up first. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.999
So first we grab some painters tape and wrap it around.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.999
So! But now everything still is very soft and breakable,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.999
therefore the next layer will be newspaper.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.999
I have little pieces prepared for this,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.999
and use them with wallpaper paste.  

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I'll use this brand.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.999
Dip it in to cover it with glue.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.999
So when you covered it with layers of newspaper you can

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.999
either wait for it to dry or you can use a hairdryer. 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.999
I'll normaly use a hot air dryer.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.999
Now we take some paper mache, which comes packed in bags, 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
that's basically paper in powderform mixed with wallpaper paste,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:55.999
mix it up with some water, so it looks like this,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:06.999
Lay it down somewhere on a plate, and begin covering (smear away!).    

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.999
With some water you can also smooth the surface.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:23.999
Then take your hot air gun and begin to dry.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.999
As you can see it's smooth now. You can smooth it even more with some

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.999
sanding paper.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.999
If you used much water you'll get such a surface,  

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.999
and if you used little water, you'll get this kind of surface.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
So that's the entire mystery of paper mache. As you can see there is

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
not much behind it all, it's very easy to work with.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Hope you like it! See you next time!
