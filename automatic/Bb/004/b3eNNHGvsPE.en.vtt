 I know a few years already htc 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.460
 somehow see the way through the move 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:36.440
 to detours to me because christian found 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.390
 away he says happily or comes 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.620
 christian com-von powerlifting and 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.379
 would like to go into bodybuilding 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.110
 more precisely in classic bodybuilding 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.699
 christian hardt counter what about you man 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.199
 the so powerlifting come they know 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.510
 but still start again 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:52.249
 train powerlifting romans pauli 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.100
 building easier especially about yours 

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:56.390
 person as give it 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.789
 also a hello from me so my name 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.620
 is christian upper class and i am on 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.929
 and already 17 years now in the 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.100
 I am loyal to training or most sports 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:04.909
 At that time said that powerlifter 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.740
 started 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.909
 Therefore, I also know the nano because we 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.440
 trained to earlier in the same studio 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:14.000
 have and have to say I have five 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.110
 years of performance in combat 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.660
 I stopped then 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.730
 due to multiple injuries has 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.890
 2000 until now only more 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.290
 as a hobby athlete at home to compensate 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.630
 trained for office life and have now 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.250
 actually the need my best form 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.800
 bringing why I have to on the way 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.690
 make or found and with them 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.790
 to aim for the goal together as at 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.130
 the Austrian championship good 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:41.990
 to cut off and not good on the 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.340
 stage to present the crisis of his 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.840
 Garden of the week doing the training plan 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.880
 to make and shape already the first one 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.200
 injury more or less together 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.540
 brought 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.040
 back in the rotation even put the 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.990
 Now, christian has a problem 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.940
 So a very heavy weights used 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.130
 so certainly some serious than me 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.410
 because here or some form athletes 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.150
 train in the three-fight problem but 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.030
 Now we have a need to 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.430
 even the high volume will win more 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.170
 Repetitive movements toxic 10 15 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.270
 repetitions as I said I believe 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.120
 Ten repetitions was the maximum 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.890
 if any and really the problem 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.420
 is talking to the body to win 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.400
 the muscles get used transform the 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.290
 Bands and longing to do more 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.210
 higher volume and hard outside too 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.120
 train and then he was yesterday 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.530
 during training noticed that certain 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.790
 things not yet to play 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.280
 helped that now relative 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.250
 quickly stops again and full again 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.440
 can start weakening of christian 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.000
 changed many weaknesses there are just 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.550
 not say what is relatively balanced up 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.860
 on prescription I should now always where 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.630
 It is said that there is also a need to catch up 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.480
 where I have to say the values 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.180
 really good 97 8 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.040
 so it's okay if you instead of a week 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.690
 long power has gone up 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.920
 The quality is still really great outside 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:00.050
 good as I said a kind of fight 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:05.980
 Lacroix also backs off says something 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:10.370
 I am also very much involved in schooling 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.290
 biceps are also clear were the typical 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.850
 muscle typical muscle mass thickness 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.740
 orders for not so many used 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.709
 close temporal rear offspring says 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.700
 but that was a foregone conclusion 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.570
 Christian with states in the classic 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.040
 bodybuilding over 180 weight yes if 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.570
 it's see where you here again if 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.459
 You can see if you can easily see the 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.440
 bonner office of the last weeks but then 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.630
 let's go down christian 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.190
 job-wise, but maybe an office like that 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.740
 just mention it like that again 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.870
 daily routine farewell to the early morning 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.150
 get up to sleep late at night 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.760
 go average in the morning 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.530
 5 o'clock on the one as an assistant in 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.590
 I am also involved in interventions 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.030
 therefore have the text placed in it 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.530
 get up early at five o'clock 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.040
 In the morning this is my day starts in the morning 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:59.030
 with a breakfast that insists on 250 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:02.780
 50 grams of oatmeal mixed with protein 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.770
 and a piece of banana or fruit 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.840
 also be an apple 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.760
 then try it every day 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.540
 Of course every two hours forget 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.340
 that most 250 grams of chicken and round 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.080
 70 grams rice or 80 grams 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.630
 noodles 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.000
 that will last until we actually do 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.709
 training come from the coach there 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.510
 a booster so i get more energy 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.360
 I'm in the office at the day 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.740
 but sleep is and after training 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.970
 Of course, we try customer data 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.800
 to bring in again so with one 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.930
 post worker check after that it goes again 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.700
 Chicken with rice and late at night 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.350
 we are still working before we go to sleep 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:40.740
 with nuts so healthy fats and 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.740
 pound fruit again and that was it for 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.400
 Christian Giesen was one of the few 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.080
 Transform athletes are told he 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.640
 What two holidays can do is lie 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.380
 because of the reason there just very good 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.150
 metabolism has everything very short 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.420
 it is metabolized by the primus 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.210
 do not really spend that now 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.530
 approaches to much water we save 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.760
 have to look that we have the volume in 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.590
 get the muscle through one and then 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.170
 the volume until the end of one 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:08.820
 diet phase until the day of competition and that 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:10.960
 the volume of the muscle or those remains 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.360
 Many now think of an office everyday 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.070
 is good very briefly addressed it is 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.320
 yes, it is not that way yet 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.150
 just like I said on the way 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:23.560
 pays euro expensive things mainstÃ¤dter 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:25.030
 christ contact is okay today is after 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.520
 one during training sideways the 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:30.430
 specialty of christian we become we 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.020
 will look like today we are 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.280
 have and have the end of the crisis 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.200
 Security in the week now with 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.560
 bench presses what he his 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.810
 paradedical discipline they speak or were 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.580
 already misjudged as I said I have 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:47.770
 also said that will be at the 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:49.450
 cross-lift since there was over 250 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.460
 then not so it is more likely 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.720
 First of all, hydropower has it 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.580
 I've been home for the last five years 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.190
 trained in his home studio which also 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.020
 very well equipped, of course, in 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.820
 this thesis, of course, far from 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.570
 what I did before or what 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.880
 we do 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:06.790
 good that we are very close again very different 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.169
 to find history is also because of that 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.729
 the training is completely different 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:11.620
 education high volume 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:12.850
 there's even so say we also 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.430
 Strong guys then talk fast 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.960
 but then they are weak in time 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:20.550
 after that, the necessary force would increase 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.690
 get is a very briefly 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.820
 We already have the goal in Austria 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.800
 Austrian championship 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:29.560
 in principle, with the one state 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.020
 stay which eleventh start or only 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.210
 once what when or acer back in 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.440
 powerlifting in powerlifting no 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.880
 case now let's see the 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.380
 cut off at the recent 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.669
 championship as that goes on 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.260
 I do not want to be too into it 

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:42.730
 look ahead and make forecasts 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.380
 which may not arrive then 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:47.080
 and say yes you said you have there 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.880
 probably now, too 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.320
 be the wm to you in november 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.970
 only takes place that is still one 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.190
 very far away and look how 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.990
 will run again april 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.880
 if I am mentally and physically 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.380
 the preparation gets through 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.700
 Show everything and I think I am 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:04.229
 good things that I'm at the best 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:09.100
 preparer in Austria 

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:10.870
 thank you my side say bms is 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.150
 next picture develops in the autumn 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.979
 classic bodybuilding if the classic 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.960
 bodybuilding if it will be like that 

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:19.210
 Austria a great athlete 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.919
 will also say three times 

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.570
 quarter of the athletes of transformers 

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:24.160
 are classic bodybuilders that we 

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:27.010
 try again to great there 

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.930
 of course, look in best form 

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.310
 So I hope that works me 

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.140
 hope that the flat-rate fare well 

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.250
 if she 'll do a good job then 

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:36.039
 I confess it can Austria 

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:38.680
 undressing faith can emigrate which 

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:39.760
 going wrong from binding over 

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.400
 have lots of fun with it 

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:45.720
 and who will look at who 

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.720
 Squats packed
