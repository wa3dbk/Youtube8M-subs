00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:07.670
 hello friends today I want you 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:11.450
 show how easy it is to noodle 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:14.929
 eg to make google yourself 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:20.400
 for this simple recipe we need 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:25.160
 two eggs about four to five tablespoons 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.160
 flour and salt 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:37.100
 let's start with our means 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.100
 to open the eggs 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:01:06.960
 Add a little salt and good times 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:01:13.100
 Every so to come now gradually 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.100
 After undergoes four tablespoons of flour 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:21.979
 it will be alright 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.979
 the world now she finds the dough for 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.509
 about half an hour into the 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:32.280
 fridge and then it goes on 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:35.240
 important to the hormones the work surface 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.240
 should be well chosen 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:53.289
 then the criticism is also nice 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:55.869
 roll out and you have to do some now 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:58.740
 let it dry time then he can 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.740
 get cut 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:06.369
 after some time has passed now 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:09.429
 I 've rolled dough and rolled out 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:13.390
 Formally cut in stripes is now 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.180
 already well dried and now 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.250
 I can start 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:23.530
 to cut noodles is best 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:25.030
 With such a tag made of plastic you 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.730
 Of course you can also take a knife 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:35.680
 that really does not matter where ours 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:39.340
 Mothers can now easily with 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.510
 cut like a scraper and leaves it 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.760
 then a little bit to lie to 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.139
 dry out 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.100
 Of course that does a bit of a job 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:51.250
 work but homemade noodles in 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.590
 a homemade stew or in 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.260
 a home- made soup 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.160
 of course something fine and that works 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.840
 really very fast and makes 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.489
 also fun for example with children 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.989
 together the cut noodles rest 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.180
 just a bit are the 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.150
 can dry well 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:19.410
 and yes at about three minutes in 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.410
 Cooked salt water they are ready
