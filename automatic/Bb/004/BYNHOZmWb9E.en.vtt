00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:11.010
 hello to all today we must be 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.460
 February 3, it is super nice 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:19.170
 it's raining more the earth is pretty weak 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:21.680
 and we can work it so we go 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:28.519
 start today old already started 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.519
 I planted the peas I showed 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:41.820
 so I posed drama everywhere and 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.940
 so I planted all the peas at 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:49.680
 side I 'm going to do a new test 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:51.840
 I tested it a Day 2 bed 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.510
 raised for my 40 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.690
 so in early February it's a bit 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.670
 early to plant the 40 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.789
 we will try what I did 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.150
 it's that I put borders that 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.460
 I had close enough so buried 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.630
 close enough and I put a 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.509
 mixture of potting soil and earth and I 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.990
 planted all this I covered with a 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:22.580
 tarp to make a small greenhouse and we 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.580
 will see what it gives and I show 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:36.780
 so we have but g of peas 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:43.920
 well it's not very right and so that 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:44.490
 like c is next out here so a 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.800
 little furrow 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.040
 I 'm going to fill her with dirt and 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.040
 mold 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.810
 and I planted my carrots very much 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.030
 advanced 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.330
 I move on and we'll get back just now 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:09.070
 so here I put a first layer 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:09.070
 of earth and I put my little cren 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.720
 I have all my little creams 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.940
 tiles toulouse so here I go 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:30.930
 water slightly for hermes message 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:35.570
 and I'm going to cover up our earth and 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:42.660
 hero this is gone 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:47.970
 so here I watered the seeds on 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:50.630
 handed a layer of earth and I watered 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.630
 on top 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.000
 each side we can already see a little 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:01.870
 see also the carrots of my last 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.360
 this plant having end of August 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.790
 yeah that's it's good it's not good 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.020
 awesome for now 6 but hey it's 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.020
 away and carrots 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.880
 so here it is now it remains 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:21.370
 more than the 1st stage puts a little 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:23.490
 plastic pocket on it and so that's it 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.670
 It's finish 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.670
 so here we go 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.480
 and the post 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:55.130
 so why there are several advantages 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:58.840
 if it works so it's sure high so 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.840
 it does not take all the freshness of the soil 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.849
 the weeds I think they 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.950
 will be much less and with 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.620
 tarpaulin it is possible that it is in 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:13.959
 advanced 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.959
 so we will follow the results 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.169
 I think that wraps it up before at least 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.940
 two months 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:23.720
 but at least it's the cpi 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.770
 we will see over the days as long as there is 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.870
 is we going to do a little garden tour 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:35.449
 even so we are so what raised for 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:42.379
 the moment these are my dreams is my 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:48.550
 emond planted in November we will see 

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:52.189
 that also note we have three so honda y 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.199
 so was not very right I'll do better 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:56.499
 the next time 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:56.499
 So here is 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.290
 pretty lift it must be said there is more 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:12.290
 so much that I believed it more 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:15.440
 honestly I thought that that the 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:20.140
 shots the garlic cloves that I had 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.140
 planted answered completely 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.090
 tokyo 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:37.720
 in the rest of the body or the leek 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:43.240
 is still pretty morfler they have 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:44.890
 took the glass so I found a 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.500
 new technique with bleach 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:51.880
 we use that in the next plan even if 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:54.520
 those who remain have started the bed and 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:58.320
 next we have the beans very beautiful feint 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.320
 so here I am quite happy for them 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.790
 they resisted the few frosts 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.790
 we had 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:16.680
 very him 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:20.190
