00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.040
 not bad not bad finally good after you me 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.019
 say what you thought about it but in 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.610
 anyway this title screen I find it 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.740
 has something promising 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.299
 we want to start 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.250
 this hall 1 stone rising go hi all 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.109
 the world knows best and welcome to 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.730
 indymac for the preview as I say 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.130
 two olympia rising a game that is 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.470
 currently on kickstarter a game that 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.720
 I support I tell you directly 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.980
 why well already because it is 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.170
 quite modest in what they ask 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.149
 you only have ten thousand dollars for 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.040
 get funding for this game which 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.630
 is still not huge and in 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.460
 more next to that if you provide a 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.590
 minimum of $ 5 and well you will have the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.480
 chance the privilege the honor of being able 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.950
 receive a version of the game in drm free 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.140
 from the moment it becomes available this 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.610
 which is not nothing in passing 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.800
 I take this opportunity to thank sir 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.210
 john google who made me discover it and 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.350
 so I'll talk to you about it no more 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.640
 delay then as you see it's 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.110
 a platform action game all he 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.600
 is more classic in a world of 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.649
 more retro that gives pride to the 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.800
 Greek mythology that you will have 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.899
 basically we embody a 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.880
 a lady who is a heroine a 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.729
 little particular that in fact you will have a 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.270
 goal will have a goal this is the one 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.640
 to reach this time the top we go 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.290
 to say of the Olympus they by very very 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.970
 down obviously because in fact 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.500
 it starts from hell simply 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.720
 in fact it's this case it's funny it's 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.729
 you are in a world where 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.909
 hell is purged regularly by a 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.070
 kind of huge acid bath and you eh 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.210
 well you start the challenge it says 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.430
 there is a legend that says it's 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.440
 possible to escape and escape 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.110
 of this huge prison that is in the 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.430
 down world wholesale and well you go 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.140
 try to get away from it and so for 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.090
 this you will face a whole bunch 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.710
 of obstacles and you are finally going to 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.390
 face you will be facing 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.220
 a whole bunch of obstacles and you go 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.289
 like that to actually climb the 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.280
 dirty one after another at will 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.360
 several tests 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.500
 so I quickly explain 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.850
 how does it work but before that 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.770
 just a little precision it's a 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.830
 demo that I show you there a demo that 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.620
 is available on the 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.110
 the kickstarter page of the game is actually 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.790
 do not really see there a finite game 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.230
 already you hear there are no sound effects 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.390
 so it's not a bug it's well and good 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.430
 the game that is proposed like that and in 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.550
 more not to propose sound effects 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.810
 know that it's also a game that does not 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.730
 proposes for the moment that a vast 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.470
 soundtrack making the soundtrack that 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.880
 goes on without any linking there is 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.770
 no theme for example for each 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.790
 zone or anything it's just 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.840
 extracts from the soundtrack you are 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.160
 diffuse in the ears story of 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.210
 tell you look like it will look like little 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.580
 close to that at the level of the atmosphere what 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.610
 and for the moment there is nothing else 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.870
 understand the link so there actually we have 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.280
 several actions then send you 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.600
 some see it I'm walking a 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.980
 little bit good I 'm not going all you 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.490
 explain because I do not want either 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.850
 for neuneus 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.620
 but basically you're going to have to 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.320
 very interesting abilities in addition to 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.540
 the one to jump double jumped and shoot 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.190
 finally in any case given a sword stroke 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.720
 to listen to this music 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.590
 she's really great at the transition to 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.510
 big you will be able to give shots 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.340
 sword that will allow you to ride 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.810
 more so what does it want 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.640
 say what I tell you there in 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.870
 it's quite simple when you 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.300
 give a shot yes there is a species 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.070
 of bullet time effect that operates then 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.120
 I'll show you that we'll try to 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.290
 I wanted to show not meet the 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.340
 the other power first so the other 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.709
 power is actually doing 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.970
 a loaded show actually see hop there 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.200
 this is if I do a triple jump that 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.420
 consumes a mana gauge that is 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.420
 indicated at the bottom or a magic gauge and 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.280
 basically that's how I can do 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.050
 huge sow that are going to be very 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.160
 very impressive very hard to 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.870
 handle at first but after once 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.190
 that we understand the thing is ok and so there 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.360
 here we come in the stuff is 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.280
 nice is the fact of being able to give 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.540
 sword blows 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.310
 so I'm going to try to do that 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.800
 these problems it's not easy for 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.750
 ability to reload his double jump gauge 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.769
 basically explain to you I'm doing a double 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.180
 jump and there I can not do a 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.950
 third fourth jump by cons I 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.989
 can give a sword blow that goes to me 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.519
 allow to reload this gauge and 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.000
 so I want to make up and then the 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.440
 journey to ride up so on 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.340
 yes it gives me the right to make a 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.019
 thing we did it against I'm dead because 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.370
 that I'm doing very badly but basically 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.320
 that's the idea pretty much of the thing so 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.160
 that's what is interesting I find it 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.410
 I find this not bad at all 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.600
 and I would even say it 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.010
 carries a personal i like 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.549
 frankly it's very 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.140
 pleasant to play 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.040
 from a gameplay point of view is good 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.040
 it's not the game of the 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.900
 Revolution has 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.459
 not see here the game that will revolutionize 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.620
 completely the kind and who will you 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.819
 surprise you at everything but by 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.859
 against you there is still a 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.120
 very solid experience and bleating 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.979
 for an alfa frankly it makes 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.150
 pleasure now have to see a little me 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.109
 I do not hide from you that the only thing 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.220
 for the mans I blame this game 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.810
 there are the beautiful design after we 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.759
 will see if it's a level design that 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.050
 will look like this from end to end or if 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:29.490
 we will have created a little bit of 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.020
 change then there implacable for 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.000
 recover the coins because otherwise I 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.820
 I can not 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.320
 hop there really going out was going to give back 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.669
 a few small strokes I can do 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.410
 also walt jump to infinity it's 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:41.639
 it is a concern and here it is for example to 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.690
 what can it look like when we arrive 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.190
 to master a little bit this cloak to 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.479
 who could just look a little 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.099
 little shit and still and so the 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.300
 this is new level so here it is 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:50.250
 again the acid bath that 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.259
 climbs or so be careful 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.900
 avoid it you have to give baskets 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.889
 short to see it's the one in regards to 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.270
 I invite you to do so 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.789
 yourself in the demo yourself there you have 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.169
 access you directly on the page 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:02.370
 of kickstarter or even I think 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.479
 Anyway I lai put on IndyMac 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.250
 if you want to try it like that 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.590
 will you even be able to do your 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.620
 own opinion about this title I got 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.270
 gets fucked salma go on this well 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.590
 listen I wish you all

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.190

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.990
 hoping hoping as always 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.409
