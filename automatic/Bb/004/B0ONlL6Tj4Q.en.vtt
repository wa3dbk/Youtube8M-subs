the<00:01:51.750> legs<00:01:51.960> are<00:01:52.170> wound<00:01:52.650> so<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.370> will<00:01:53.760> get<00:01:53.970> this

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
the legs are wound so you will get this

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.370 
the legs are wound so you will get this
big<00:01:55.680> view<00:01:56.510> actually<00:01:57.510> when<00:01:57.720> you<00:01:57.810> have<00:01:57.960> these<00:01:58.140> on

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
you can look up you can look down to the

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.190 
you can look up you can look down to the
side<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:01.080> can<00:02:01.260> look<00:02:01.700> freely<00:02:02.700> around<00:02:03.200> then

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
side you can look freely around then

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.560 
side you can look freely around then
even<00:02:04.800> you<00:02:04.890> can<00:02:05.070> look<00:02:05.220> behind<00:02:05.729> yourself<00:02:06.090> so

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
even you can look behind yourself so

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.980 
even you can look behind yourself so
that's<00:02:06.810> pretty<00:02:07.080> cool

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
that's pretty cool

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.920

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
here and you just swipe it down when the

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.590 
here and you just swipe it down when the
magnet<00:02:30.780> changes<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:32.100> phone<00:02:32.340> can<00:02:32.550> break<00:02:33.480> is

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
magnet changes the phone can break is

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.490

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
that this has a button and it would

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:54.190 
that this has a button and it would
activate<00:02:37.830> there

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.289
