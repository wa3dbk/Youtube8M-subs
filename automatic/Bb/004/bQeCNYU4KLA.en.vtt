00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
so we removed the little twist tie that

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.330 
so we removed the little twist tie that
are<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.050> cut<00:03:25.290> that<00:03:25.470> was<00:03:25.590> in<00:03:25.740> there<00:03:25.920> so<00:03:26.130> we<00:03:26.190> took

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
are the cut that was in there so we took

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.640 
are the cut that was in there so we took
it<00:03:26.490> off<00:03:26.610> this<00:03:27.180> little<00:03:27.720> thing<00:03:27.990> here<00:03:28.200> is<00:03:28.350> just<00:03:28.560> a

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
it off this little thing here is just a

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.350 
it off this little thing here is just a
little<00:03:28.890> wrap<00:03:29.040> around<00:03:29.340> so<00:03:29.520> when<00:03:29.700> you<00:03:29.820> put<00:03:30.240> the

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
little wrap around so when you put the

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.820 
little wrap around so when you put the
cable<00:03:30.630> back<00:03:30.810> you<00:03:30.990> can<00:03:31.140> just<00:03:31.170> wrap<00:03:31.500> it<00:03:31.530> right

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
cable back you can just wrap it right

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.320 
cable back you can just wrap it right
around<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:32.280> cable<00:03:32.580> to<00:03:32.670> make<00:03:32.820> sure<00:03:33.060> it's<00:03:33.180> in

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
around the cable to make sure it's in

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.220 
around the cable to make sure it's in
there<00:03:33.510> and<00:03:33.690> that's<00:03:34.320> it<00:03:34.560> alright<00:03:34.770> so<00:03:35.600> as<00:03:36.600> we<00:03:37.080> are

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
there and that's it alright so as we are

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.800 
there and that's it alright so as we are
taking<00:03:37.470> this<00:03:37.740> apart<00:03:39.890> this<00:03:40.890> leg<00:03:41.360> has<00:03:42.360> the

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
taking this apart this leg has the

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.310 
taking this apart this leg has the
electronics<00:03:43.500> that<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:44.130> pedal<00:03:44.490> attaches<00:03:45.030> to

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
electronics that the pedal attaches to

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.980 
electronics that the pedal attaches to
this<00:03:46.320> little<00:03:46.620> thing<00:03:47.360> plugs<00:03:48.360> right<00:03:48.600> back<00:03:48.810> in

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
this little thing plugs right back in

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.300 
this little thing plugs right back in
here<00:03:49.910> very<00:03:50.910> carefully<00:03:51.709> but<00:03:52.709> I<00:03:53.010> think<00:03:53.220> to

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
here very carefully but I think to

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.130 
here very carefully but I think to
transport<00:03:53.880> you<00:03:54.270> have<00:03:54.360> to<00:03:54.480> take<00:03:54.660> this<00:03:54.780> off<00:03:54.990> so

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
transport you have to take this off so

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.680 
transport you have to take this off so
we're<00:03:55.260> gonna<00:03:55.350> cut<00:03:55.620> this<00:03:55.740> little<00:03:55.980> tie<00:03:56.910> here<00:03:57.420> and

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
we're gonna cut this little tie here and

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.740 
we're gonna cut this little tie here and
then<00:03:58.560> you<00:03:59.220> know<00:03:59.340> you<00:03:59.430> can<00:03:59.700> either<00:03:59.820> reattach<00:04:00.600> it

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
then you know you can either reattach it

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.240 
then you know you can either reattach it
with<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:00.930> tie<00:04:01.140> or<00:04:01.350> not<00:04:01.500> worry<00:04:01.709> about<00:04:01.770> it

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
with the tie or not worry about it

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.760 
with the tie or not worry about it
but<00:04:02.760> we<00:04:02.940> are<00:04:03.090> going<00:04:03.330> to<00:04:03.480> take<00:04:03.690> this<00:04:03.900> tie<00:04:04.230> off<00:04:04.470> so

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
but we are going to take this tie off so

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.470 
but we are going to take this tie off so
that<00:04:04.950> this<00:04:05.070> leg<00:04:05.340> can<00:04:05.520> come<00:04:05.700> out<00:04:05.820> and<00:04:05.970> be<00:04:06.209> free

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
that this leg can come out and be free

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.320 
that this leg can come out and be free
alright<00:04:07.320> alright<00:04:08.310> so<00:04:08.550> there's<00:04:08.760> gonna<00:04:08.940> a<00:04:09.000> left

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
alright alright so there's gonna a left

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.280 
alright alright so there's gonna a left
leg<00:04:09.510> in<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:09.720> right<00:04:09.900> leg

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
leg in the right leg

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.449 
leg in the right leg
you'll<00:04:10.440> know<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:10.650> leg<00:04:10.950> that<00:04:11.100> goes<00:04:11.160> through

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
you'll know the leg that goes through

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.130 
you'll know the leg that goes through
here<00:04:11.610> because<00:04:11.700> it's<00:04:11.910> got<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.239> connections

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
here because it's got the connections

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.900 
here because it's got the connections
for<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.590> electronics<00:04:14.370> alright

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
for the electronics alright

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.530 
for the electronics alright
which<00:04:15.060> plug<00:04:15.390> in<00:04:15.480> right<00:04:15.630> there<00:04:16.580> so<00:04:17.580> now<00:04:17.910> we're

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
which plug in right there so now we're

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.430 
which plug in right there so now we're
going<00:04:18.630> to<00:04:18.720> take<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:20.120> these<00:04:21.120> screws<00:04:21.600> out<00:04:21.780> of

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
going to take the these screws out of

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.290 
going to take the these screws out of

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.330 

so<00:04:30.879> as<00:04:31.629> we<00:04:31.930> took<00:04:32.080> the<00:04:32.199> legs<00:04:32.409> off<00:04:32.620> we<00:04:33.009> noticed

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
so as we took the legs off we noticed

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.540 
so as we took the legs off we noticed

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
so you'll have to attach that before you

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.520 
so you'll have to attach that before you
put<00:04:39.430> the<00:04:39.520> legs<00:04:39.699> on<00:04:40.139> first<00:04:41.139> thing<00:04:41.349> we're<00:04:41.500> doing
