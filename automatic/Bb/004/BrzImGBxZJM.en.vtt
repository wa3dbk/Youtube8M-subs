00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.910
 very good to all and welcome to this 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.410
 new video of grand theft auto 'online 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.360
 in which we are going to teach you how to power 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.309
 see inside the game the egg someone is 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.049
 the famous egg someone the mystery so 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.029
 large there after 10 to 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.520
 clijsters this egg and we can see it 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.140
 repeated many times within the 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.480
 departure but this time I'm 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.769
 accompanied by game vader if no one gets you 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.150
 like but before it begins 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.859
 video I would like to ask you not to 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.560
 forget to like it if you like it without 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.839
 nothing more to add we start well 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.400
 you will all remember that in the mural of the 

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:38.850
 mount exiled in that famous mural in 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.320
 those hieroglyphics we would have a UFO 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.210
 we would have an egg and we would have a 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.070
 jetpack then apparently this egg 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.830
 the egg matches someone with a 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.379
 mysterious egg someone who shines 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.140
 has a texture like chromed like 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.629
 metallized quite strange and the certain 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.040
 is that there is a way to see it inside 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.839
 of the game although there is still no way to 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.489
 find it anyway for all 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:01.619
 those who want to see them inside the 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.420
 game play with him more or less is going to 

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:04.680
 explain my partner and good guys what 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.299
 first thing we'll have to do is 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.070
 go to the link that is down here 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.630
 in the description is a link asia are 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.580
 software and they will see that when 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.200
 we open it opens like a game 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.790
 the content creator and the only 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.250
 what we have to do is press the 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.020
 button that says add to the game once 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.690
 done this we are going to address our 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.950
 playstation3 then when jay online 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.480
 what you are going to do is that you are going to leave 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.130
 and you'll put back to you 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.750
 save the changes once inside 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.520
 equity and online what we are going to do is 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.350
 let's press start let's go 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.760
 direct us to activities to host 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.220
 of an activity and we will select 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.870
 the option marked there will appear the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.760
 activity the differential basis of all 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.430
 because it has a strange half name a 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.930
 little as interested in something like that and 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.479
 another one with the guys this game is 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.160
 exclusive of playstation 3 to be able 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.840
 play you have to obviously have the 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.940
 play station 3 and in the lobby you have to 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.250
 have a person with minimum level 20 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.020
 tell you as well curious facts that 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.150
 there is also the meteor that famous 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.800
 meteorite is huge and we can 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.090
 find also near the map not 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.560
 it would be only one but it is like 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.360
 multiplied there are two too 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.980
 we would find the rosemary the car what 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.410
 it's the hearse 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.940
 the van of the lost and also we 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.430
 we will realize that the egg is like 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.080
 stuck in the middle of the earth and that 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.940
 has an easy explanation and that is 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.280
 simply the egg has been replaced 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.110
 by map objects in this case there would be 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.240
 been by stones and that like stones 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.850
 they are as embedded within the map 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.050
 Well we would see the egg embedded 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.580
 between the map that's why you only see the 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.710
 half or for example we can also 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.210
 see above a tree that looks like a 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.980
 game we go that is not half egg but 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.020
 which is a whole egg only this one 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.240
 as cut when it is on the ground 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.130
 I hope this video do not forget 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.750

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.760
