00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.230
 organizing documents on your work 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.810
 table I'm not a computer I mean 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.210
 the very office desktop that 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.950
 do if you don't like stickers or 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.640
 you are tired of their customers you want 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.890
 to save 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.379
 but you want the necessary documents always 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.030
 were in sight next time going 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:40.890
 from home to work grab with you 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.809
 clothespin basically you can 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.999
 use any clothespin but 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.309
 Agree bright colors will only decorate 

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:49.079
 your desktop for fixing is better 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.749
 just use double sided tape 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.909
 then place the clothespin as follows 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:56.159
 way on your monitor that's all now 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:58.379
 necessary business card documents or even 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:00.870
 favorite cards and photos will not be 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.120
 occupy too much on your desktop 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.339
 place and will always be before eyes 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.140
 if you put the clothespin on the bottom 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.780
 the screen will always be at hand and 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.590
 extension cord for yusb or charging for 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.590
 your mobile phone 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.420
 by the way the clothespin can be used for 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.430
 organizing your fridge but to 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.770
 example, it will help much easier and 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.320
 easier to store any sauces or 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.509
 mayonnaise everything is clear and easy when 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.119
 the sauce or ketchup package becomes 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.850
 tuck up the empty part of the pack less 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:40.860
 and secure with a clothespin now extrude 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.860
 residues are much simpler and more convenient 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.620
