00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.050
 good i'm walker stimulus ace for 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:07.700
 explain the first part of the search engine 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.250
 of bands that as you know the fusion 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.430
 greater day December 10 of this year of 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.619
 2014 a new option will appear in 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.300
 the band finder that is called the 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.640
 walled city if we meet the 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.160
 requirements so we do not get to be level 100 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.929
 and have 615 of minimum equipment 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.329
 rudy up in the search engine 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:27.820
 bands in this option in the city 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:31.909
 walled we have put three heads 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.440
 load the butcher and frond spore and 

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:35.690
 taking baby they are going to put texts 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.340
 proposed garments so I 'm going to 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.310
 explain a little bit so you know 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.590
 what's going on because it has improved and it did not come out very 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.480
 clear or you have not been yet if 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.760
 you want to enter a little before this 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.060
 way is it is easy enough nothing more 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.400
 get to agropolis from the band where 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.250
 we are not only a bit there will be a 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.140
 elevator that will raise us an arena if not 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.370
 We are in the elevator when it goes up 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.990
 nothing happens when you finish uploading 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.150
 we can talk to the ogre that there we 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.369
 teleportation from above before 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.120
 appear to load will appear pool of two 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.190
 shoulders 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.410
 tiger panther 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.360
 an animal man then I do not remember 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.240
 what is the truth called and whenever 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.880
 kill the others before him because 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.340
 as long as he has savings he is not going 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.380
 to be able to hurt will go pulling golds 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.960
 once in a while in palms to hit the 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.570
 ogres before once this pool is killed 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.330
 the charge appears quite the strategy 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.490
 simple to get away from the fire you have to 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.740
 take out some big fire columns do not 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.780
 apart a lot to give us but 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.060
 they were close because once in a while 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.400
 charge to follow a player not to 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.560
 follow it until I killed it or it's the 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.750
 player get the boss to go through one 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.070
 of the sand games with if it happened 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.960
 for one of the games of the arenas 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.140
 stumble falls to the ground and stops 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.690
 follow what will continue to hit the boss 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.490
 normal from time to time push everything 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.680
 the world and will set it apart 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.340
 the search engine will choose a minimum of five 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.830
 players tank gear and dps and throwing 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.360
 to the stands to the group that launches 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.849
 bleachers have to kill everything that 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.190
 may because after a while they 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.260
 thrown in the bleachers and the bugs that 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.930
 they stay up alive they will start attacking 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.540
 the root above all kill the beings there 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.700
 many normal and some elites the 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.940
 elites that is a priority before the 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.770
 normal because they make quite damaged 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.090
 and there are only the shelves left 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.760
 they have to change the boss every two 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.990
 impaling marks when they can compare 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.080
 it shows a lot when you put the brand 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.240
 because load picks up the weapon he has in 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.830
 place of hands you nail and what 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.410
 lift up by beings that's pretty 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.120
 putting a stop mark after 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.520
 a very difficult pullman we will reach the 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.530
 butcher the butcher has a pig or 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.470
 boar circling where he is 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.570
 is a huge boar looks very good there 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.670
 have to fight it far away from the butcher and 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.280
 kill him away now because if he does not charge 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.300
 we'll finish taking care of the butcher too 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.830
 once we have started with the 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.060
 butcher the tanks have to 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.770
 put the band together 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.819
 They must be the closest one is 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.499
 be of faith 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.380
 on the feet they have to be on the feet 

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:10.150
 of the boss 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.670
 that's changed by every four brands 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.470
 explanation of the four chief brands 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.260
 puts two types of different brands one 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.020
 has two different weapons one brand per 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.300
 something has to change only with the sum of 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.780
 the brands can be or four brands of 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.180
 a weapon 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.490
 one brand of one weapon and three of another or 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.740
 two and two wings one of the marks when 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.350
 have four you change those of pepe is 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.630
 that distance and lodges away from the boss 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.569
 and everyone doing pineapple because it will charge 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.300
 against one of the group and if they are all 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.250
 world together is divided so much if you load one 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.440
 and it's separate I kill it 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.990
 It frees us, pushes us to do it again 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.250
 the little group and that's it and the fish 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.890
 I'll explain to you that 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.480
 the search engine works and because the 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.300
 strategy is different but in the 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.710
 seeker is doing so cap that 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.350
 melee are receiving some 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.080
 accumulations of bleeding wounds 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.720
 when you have four of you apart from the 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.910
 large group of people or aside 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.130
 it takes us away and directly the 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.709
 four brands and you go back to the boss is already 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:17.000
 the theory is there must be two groups of 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:19.730
 melee close to the boss 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.709
 although they are distance groups with the 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.709
 same number of people let's say two and two 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.300
 then one of pes at a distance will be one 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.150
 from the melee groups the group 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:35.120
 that more people have receives marks when 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:38.300
 has four remote stps brands that 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.610
 has gone to help the group and other 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.700
 different one goes to the other group then 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:46.310
 is always putting marks to the group of 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.050
 melee more people have 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.150
 supposed to be swinging so that 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.640
 brands are never common many in 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.490
 groups to thousands to try on the 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.440
 see you know what sir knows 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:00.830
 As four brands I move away and I'll be back 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.780
 and already that will be coming out pretty easy 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.180
 It does not hurt much, but with ten 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.580
 marks or maurice if or if not for the damage 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.740
 but because it's branded it kills not once 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.080
 dead the butcher after I think that 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.319
 it's a pool 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.430
 nothing difficult we came to flanders by a no 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:17.319
 get there and we'll see that two 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.599
 flamethrower on the ground before you start 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:21.310
 the fight you have to catch those that you take 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:22.689
 they have to take care of burning the moss 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.030
 green that is putting the boss by the 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:27.669
 floor of the room thus accumulates and pilla 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:30.159
 the dps is bad although attentive to the 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:32.680
 burning of the govern if you have if you take in 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:34.599
 Flamethrower will put an extra button the 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.280
 skill and there are those of fish to 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:39.099
 distance they have to kill all the 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:42.340
 mushrooms that can and the plants if you see 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:43.930
 one hour orange you rubbing you will see 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.539
 which is directed to by one of the groups 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.669
 great of the band if you put in the 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:50.500
 medium will give to you and they will only have 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:53.139
 to cure you and not the band 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.490
 whole, those balls are not supposed to be 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:56.710
 they have to sacrifice and I will give in 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.719
 the medium although it is much better for everything 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.909
 the world will also come out even bigger 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:02.440
 that you have to kill and cut all 

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:03.879
 skills that throws good just throwing 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.590
 a skill but do not try to do 

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:08.020
 several times a single person can not 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.330
 cut so but with two that you 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.409
 synchronize or three as much can be 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.749
 cut all 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:15.939
 from time to time mushrooms appear 

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:18.249
 friendly life tool if you 

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:19.539
 they cure they maintain themselves with life to the fullest 

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:22.149
 all the time you can give benefits 

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:23.979
 to the band the ideal is that everyone 

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:27.069
 stay close to the mushroom that is being 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:29.529
 healing and the tanks are changed to the boss 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:30.879
 every four brands of rot and the one that does not 

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:33.129
 has the tank chief at the same time 

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:34.539
 it appears big will also cut you 

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:37.779
 skill like those of ps whenever 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:40.689
 can and here forced the boss never 

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:42.819
 mine the band because it makes one today and with 

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:44.769
 a sticker awarding to and this would be 

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:48.279
 everything there is for now in the search engine 

00:06:44.769 --> 00:06:50.409
 of bands that in the walled city and 

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:53.939
 I hope the video serves you like it and 

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:53.939
 tomorrow more until tomorrow
