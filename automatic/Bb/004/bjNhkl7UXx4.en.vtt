00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
mess up once that has to make another

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.790 
mess up once that has to make another
round<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.920> should<00:00:38.129> get<00:00:38.309> up<00:00:38.960> it<00:00:39.960> should<00:00:40.170> implode

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
round it should get up it should implode

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.950 
round it should get up it should implode
before<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.790> now<00:00:42.210> launched<00:00:42.450> one<00:00:42.629> up<00:00:42.780> there

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
before that now launched one up there

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.690 
before that now launched one up there
and<00:00:43.140> watch<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.829> second<00:00:44.309> with<00:00:44.430> your<00:00:44.579> back

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
and watch a second with your back

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.430 
and watch a second with your back
towards<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.120> glass<00:00:45.420> now<00:00:46.200> here<00:00:46.410> I

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
towards the glass now here I

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.680 
towards the glass now here I
accidentally<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.460> do<00:00:47.640> an<00:00:47.820> extra<00:00:48.120> step<00:00:48.270> here<00:00:48.480> to

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
accidentally I do an extra step here to

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.479 
accidentally I do an extra step here to
launch<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.140> wrong<00:00:49.260> portal<00:00:49.680> but<00:00:50.160> it's<00:00:50.280> all<00:00:50.370> the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
same once you get you your first one up

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.229 
same once you get you your first one up
there<00:00:52.890> then<00:00:53.129> launch<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.430> opposite<00:00:53.969> with<00:00:54.120> your

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239

for when you have all the panels opened
so<00:01:37.890> once<00:01:38.310> it's<00:01:38.520> it's<00:01:38.970> up<00:01:39.119> there<00:01:39.299> just<00:01:39.540> launched

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
so once it's it's up there just launched

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.300 
so once it's it's up there just launched
whatever<00:01:40.110> portal<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.530> have<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.829> coming<00:01:41.040> out

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
whatever portal you have it coming out

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.670 
whatever portal you have it coming out
of<00:01:41.479> launch<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.689> one<00:01:42.840> first<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.290> now<00:01:43.530> it's

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
of launch that one first so now it's

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.100 
of launch that one first so now it's
trapped<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.670> watch<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.329> one<00:01:45.600> after<00:01:46.020> you've

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
trapped and watch that one after you've

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.389 
trapped and watch that one after you've
pressed<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.530> first<00:01:46.740> button<00:01:46.950> press<00:01:47.250> the

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
pressed the first button press the

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.980 
pressed the first button press the
second<00:01:47.850> button<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.360> it'll<00:01:48.630> pass<00:01:48.810> right

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
second button and it'll pass right

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.560 
second button and it'll pass right
through<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.799> you'll<00:01:50.549> have<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.939> with<00:01:51.119> plenty

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
through and you'll have it with plenty

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.120 
through and you'll have it with plenty
of<00:01:51.689> seconds<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.170> spare<00:01:52.380> if<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.619> don't<00:01:52.799> get<00:01:52.979> it

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
of seconds to spare if you don't get it

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.100 
of seconds to spare if you don't get it
then<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.820> can<00:01:53.970> just<00:01:54.090> keep<00:01:54.329> on<00:01:54.509> trying<00:01:54.840> again

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
then you can just keep on trying again

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.109 
then you can just keep on trying again
until<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.380> do<00:01:55.619> but<00:01:56.520> it's<00:01:56.610> relatively<00:01:56.969> simple

the the glass closest to the red men

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.110 
the the glass closest to the red men
down<00:02:41.350> you're<00:02:41.740> going<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:41.920> block<00:02:42.220> off<00:02:42.459> like<00:02:42.850> this

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
down you're going to block off like this

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.940 
down you're going to block off like this
using<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.510> ones<00:02:43.720> that<00:02:43.870> are<00:02:43.959> in<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.230> rat<00:02:44.770> man

using the ones that are in the rat man

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.430 
using the ones that are in the rat man
down<00:02:45.160> and<00:02:45.570> then<00:02:46.570> once<00:02:46.780> you<00:02:46.930> have<00:02:47.140> it<00:02:47.260> blocked

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
down and then once you have it blocked

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.750 
down and then once you have it blocked
off<00:02:47.740> you're<00:02:47.920> going<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.100> do<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.280> same<00:02:48.520> thing<00:02:48.730> to

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
off you're going to do the same thing to

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.610 
off you're going to do the same thing to
this<00:02:49.150> one<00:02:49.780> on<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:49.990> right<00:02:50.170> so<00:02:50.380> that<00:02:50.500> you're

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
this one on the right so that you're

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.050 
this one on the right so that you're
able<00:02:50.650> to<00:02:50.980> launch<00:02:51.130> a<00:02:51.250> portal<00:02:51.610> and<00:02:51.760> give<00:02:51.850> that

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
able to launch a portal and give that

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.760 
able to launch a portal and give that
corner<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:53.050> then<00:02:53.170> just<00:02:53.290> start<00:02:53.500> feeding

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
corner and then just start feeding

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.530 
corner and then just start feeding
blocks<00:02:54.130> in<00:02:54.340> bed<00:02:54.520> now<00:02:54.730> this<00:02:54.910> is<00:02:55.060> where<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.330> wall

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
blocks in bed now this is where the wall

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.510 
blocks in bed now this is where the wall
method<00:02:55.930> comes<00:02:56.050> into<00:02:56.350> play<00:02:56.500> you're<00:02:57.190> just<00:02:57.370> going

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
method comes into play you're just going

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.640 
method comes into play you're just going
to<00:02:57.670> keep<00:02:57.820> on<00:02:58.000> putting<00:02:58.420> blocks<00:02:58.660> in<00:02:59.020> here<00:02:59.350> and

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
to keep on putting blocks in here and

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.020 
to keep on putting blocks in here and
it's<00:02:59.739> going<00:02:59.890> to<00:02:59.980> block<00:03:00.160> off<00:03:00.370> all<00:03:00.550> the<00:03:01.650> all<00:03:02.650> the

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
it's going to block off all the all the

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.220 
it's going to block off all the all the
shots<00:03:04.030> that<00:03:04.209> are<00:03:04.330> being<00:03:04.510> fired<00:03:04.780> by<00:03:04.959> all<00:03:05.110> the
