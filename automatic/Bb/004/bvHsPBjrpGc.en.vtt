00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:10.340
 Hello everyone 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:10.340
 This time I would like to focus only on my attitude or half 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.500
 At first it becomes a fan and is light 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.690
 Before going 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.980
 I will 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:22.580
 It is the width of the stance, and there are people who are spread 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:31.550
 Even if if narrowed 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:34.630
 I think if I have a width that makes me lightly step or the end is a little more stable 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.630
 I think it's good 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.040
 There is no my 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:44.560
 Slightly inside 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:46.070
 This is It will open with Shi protrude to say that the stance that it is straight 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.480
 It is hard to beat 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.140
 not really 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:55.250
 Even if this is too much to eat , this time on the contrary 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:58.540
 As it will be difficult for stars to enter 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.540
 Doing on the inside 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.390
 Well later beginners 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.330
 Seems that many Masakoko 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.540
 Forefoot and backfoot in a straight line 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.520
 Become 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.520
 I think it is easy 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.720
 Back legs 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.470
 No sideways 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.730
 Why width 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.730
 I try to take 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.259
 With the back foot always floating 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.259
 I'm doing 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.060
 Reason 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.990
 By raising this or stock 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.920
 The body Mobame 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.920
 It becomes usable 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.230
 Even at the time of attack 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.659
 Solution 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:59.170
 Also a dredging event 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.170
 It is possible to increase the attack power of the opponent 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.390
 Even when stepping back 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.470
 And it is not put Kakazu 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:13.140
 It is easy to do it 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.010
 In thenar not put the thumb of his right foot 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.520
 Cutting out is 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.660
 Cheapest 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:25.300
 There was one more thing I heard once 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.580
 There was Toka machine using in you to be placed heel of the forefoot 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.540
 Also I'd be noticed doing this 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.540
 Is it broken? 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.890
 I feel like this 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.520
 Become a feeling that stood little Ukiashi 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.640
 Even when the bread condition 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.050
 I can not help 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.460
 There is nothing I can not do but 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.160
 Again, my forefoot is a solid foot day 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.940
 In snack feels like a simple mind 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.940
 I'm doing 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.420
 By all means 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.770
 Follow 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.770
 As you grow up 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:13.380
 It is stationary at first 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:16.120
 I will do, but if I get used it will gradually shift my weight back and forth 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.440
 Take a rhythm that you want to let 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.260
 Men's wording by side 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.760
 With some movement 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.760
 I have practiced 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.000
 I do not see from the side 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:40.140
 What if to show this 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:44.120
 I noticed that something was wrong 4 here 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.120
 I 'm glad if you can tell me again 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.270
 More than mine 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:02.840
 I focused on the story only 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.840
 It was
