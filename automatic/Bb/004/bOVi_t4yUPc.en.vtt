00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:54.239 

00:05:54.239 --> 00:05:56.609 

you<00:05:55.239> know<00:05:55.300> I<00:05:55.330> think<00:05:55.419> today's<00:05:56.050> one<00:05:56.289> was<00:05:56.409> a<00:05:56.439> big

00:05:56.609 --> 00:05:56.619 
you know I think today's one was a big

00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:59.219 
you know I think today's one was a big
one<00:05:56.769> for<00:05:56.979> us<00:05:57.089> because<00:05:58.089> you<00:05:58.659> know<00:05:58.779> last<00:05:58.989> time<00:05:59.139> I

00:05:59.219 --> 00:05:59.229 
one for us because you know last time I

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:00.509 
one for us because you know last time I
played<00:05:59.259> his<00:05:59.529> guys<00:05:59.709> if<00:05:59.860> it<00:05:59.979> was<00:06:00.099> a<00:06:00.129> really<00:06:00.309> tough

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:00.519 
played his guys if it was a really tough

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:02.219 
played his guys if it was a really tough
game<00:06:00.789> we<00:06:01.449> left<00:06:01.629> on<00:06:01.779> at<00:06:01.869> the<00:06:01.959> end<00:06:02.050> of<00:06:02.110> the<00:06:02.199> game

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:02.229 
game we left on at the end of the game

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:03.749 
game we left on at the end of the game
and<00:06:02.589> I<00:06:02.679> thought<00:06:02.829> that<00:06:02.889> we<00:06:03.099> played<00:06:03.279> a<00:06:03.309> good<00:06:03.489> 90

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 
and I thought that we played a good 90

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:05.710 
and I thought that we played a good 90
minutes<00:06:04.059> today

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 
minutes today

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.320
