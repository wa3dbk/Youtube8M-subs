several here on site and I'll show you
some<00:01:34.540> of<00:01:34.570> those<00:01:34.720> at<00:01:34.960> another<00:01:35.200> time<00:01:35.440> you<00:01:35.830> may

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
some of those at another time you may

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.890 
some of those at another time you may
have<00:01:35.979> seen<00:01:36.220> them<00:01:36.400> on<00:01:36.490> some<00:01:36.670> early<00:01:36.910> videos<00:01:37.270> but

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
have seen them on some early videos but

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.780 
have seen them on some early videos but
for<00:01:38.110> this<00:01:38.229> range<00:01:38.530> since<00:01:39.130> we<00:01:39.310> use<00:01:39.490> it<00:01:39.640> as<00:01:39.759> a

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
for this range since we use it as a

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.999 
for this range since we use it as a
multi-purpose<00:01:40.360> as<00:01:40.690> well<00:01:40.869> what<00:01:41.500> we've<00:01:41.650> done<00:01:41.830> is

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
multi-purpose as well what we've done is

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:48.749 
multi-purpose as well what we've done is
we've<00:01:42.190> hinged<00:01:42.550> this<00:01:43.150> so<00:01:45.180> with<00:01:46.180> a<00:01:46.210> rope<00:01:47.550> we<00:01:48.550> can

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
we've hinged this so with a rope we can

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.219 
we've hinged this so with a rope we can
actually<00:01:49.410> lift<00:01:50.410> this<00:01:50.710> up<00:01:50.950> and<00:01:51.990> right<00:01:52.990> out<00:01:53.020> of

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
actually lift this up and right out of

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.910 
actually lift this up and right out of
the<00:01:53.380> way<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:55.360> extends<00:01:55.930> all<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.590> way

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
the way and it extends all the way

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.510 
the way and it extends all the way
straight<00:01:57.100> up<00:01:57.670> so<00:01:58.360> it<00:01:58.690> allows<00:01:59.050> us<00:01:59.259> to<00:01:59.470> do<00:02:00.310> some

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
straight up so it allows us to do some

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.999 
straight up so it allows us to do some
shotgun<00:02:00.940> shooting<00:02:01.360> do<00:02:02.200> some<00:02:02.410> binaries

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
shotgun shooting do some binaries

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:04.830 
shotgun shooting do some binaries
whatever<00:02:03.700> it<00:02:03.850> is<00:02:03.880> that<00:02:04.119> we're<00:02:04.240> using<00:02:04.390> when<00:02:04.720> we

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
whatever it is that we're using when we

whatever it is that we're using when we
don't<00:02:05.020> want<00:02:05.170> to<00:02:05.259> ruin<00:02:05.470> this<00:02:05.830> like<00:02:06.310> buckshot

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
don't want to ruin this like buckshot

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.719 
don't want to ruin this like buckshot

gets<00:02:09.940> it<00:02:10.060> right<00:02:10.179> out<00:02:10.360> of<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.569> way<00:02:10.690> now<00:02:10.980> what

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
gets it right out of the way now what

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.030 
gets it right out of the way now what
you<00:02:12.130> see<00:02:12.310> behind<00:02:12.490> here<00:02:13.110> is<00:02:14.110> called<00:02:14.470> mill<00:02:14.770> felt

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
you see behind here is called mill felt

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.830 
you see behind here is called mill felt
and<00:02:15.340> I<00:02:15.910> don't<00:02:16.090> know<00:02:16.180> if<00:02:16.270> you<00:02:16.390> have<00:02:16.510> a<00:02:16.540> lot<00:02:16.810> of

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
and I don't know if you have a lot of

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.620 
and I don't know if you have a lot of
paper<00:02:17.230> mills<00:02:17.590> in<00:02:17.800> your<00:02:18.310> area<00:02:18.700> or<00:02:21.390> if<00:02:22.390> you<00:02:22.510> have

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
paper mills in your area or if you have

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.220 
paper mills in your area or if you have
mill<00:02:22.930> felt<00:02:23.230> available<00:02:23.890> but<00:02:24.550> what<00:02:24.760> this<00:02:24.910> does

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
mill felt available but what this does

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.460 
mill felt available but what this does
is<00:02:26.230> act<00:02:26.709> as<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.130> buffer<00:02:27.400> between<00:02:28.209> the<00:02:28.870> dirt<00:02:29.140> pile

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
is act as a buffer between the dirt pile

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.960 
is act as a buffer between the dirt pile
and<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:32.140> target<00:02:32.560> frame<00:02:32.800> and<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.580> shooter

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
and the target frame and the shooter

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.440 
and the target frame and the shooter
there<00:02:34.900> are<00:02:35.050> two<00:02:35.230> layers<00:02:35.470> of<00:02:35.800> it<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:36.760> it's

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
there are two layers of it and it's

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.949 
there are two layers of it and it's
about<00:02:38.250> maybe<00:02:39.250> six<00:02:39.610> inches<00:02:39.790> apart<00:02:40.209> of<00:02:40.480> dead

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
about maybe six inches apart of dead

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.949 
about maybe six inches apart of dead
space<00:02:41.230> so<00:02:41.950> when<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.520> shoot<00:02:42.760> around<00:02:43.120> from<00:02:43.810> your

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
space so when you shoot around from your

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.830 
space so when you shoot around from your
perspective<00:02:44.319> this<00:02:45.310> way<00:02:45.580> it<00:02:46.209> goes<00:02:46.420> through<00:02:46.690> the

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
perspective this way it goes through the

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.620 
perspective this way it goes through the
targets<00:02:47.290> through<00:02:48.099> two<00:02:48.640> layers<00:02:48.819> of<00:02:49.000> mill<00:02:49.330> felt

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
and hits the sand behind it which will

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.180 
and hits the sand behind it which will
go<00:02:52.630> around<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:53.080> I'll<00:02:53.200> show<00:02:53.380> you<00:02:53.440> in<00:02:53.560> a<00:02:53.709> second

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
go around and I'll show you in a second

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.880 
go around and I'll show you in a second
because<00:02:55.030> we<00:02:55.420> shoot<00:02:55.599> in<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:55.810> winter<00:02:56.260> we<00:02:56.740> have

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
because we shoot in the winter we have

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.339 
because we shoot in the winter we have
frozen<00:02:57.099> ground<00:02:57.580> a<00:02:57.760> lot<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.180> it's<00:02:59.080> not

frozen ground a lot and it's not

frozen ground a lot and it's not
uncommon<00:02:59.890> to<00:03:00.160> have<00:03:00.340> ricochets<00:03:00.970> come<00:03:01.270> back<00:03:01.510> and

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
uncommon to have ricochets come back and

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.740 
uncommon to have ricochets come back and
we<00:03:03.010> want<00:03:03.490> to<00:03:03.580> do<00:03:03.670> anything<00:03:03.940> that<00:03:04.240> we<00:03:04.360> can<00:03:04.569> to

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
we want to do anything that we can to

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.270 
we want to do anything that we can to
avoid<00:03:04.900> anything<00:03:05.709> that's<00:03:06.069> avoidable

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
avoid anything that's avoidable

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.420 
avoid anything that's avoidable
obviously<00:03:07.150> so<00:03:07.690> with<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.680> mill<00:03:08.860> felt<00:03:09.099> by<00:03:09.370> the

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
obviously so with the mill felt by the

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.970 
obviously so with the mill felt by the
time<00:03:09.730> it<00:03:09.879> goes<00:03:10.030> through<00:03:10.420> it<00:03:11.110> expends<00:03:11.620> a<00:03:11.680> lot<00:03:11.829> of

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
time it goes through it expends a lot of

the grounds frozen and and bounces back

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.710 
the grounds frozen and and bounces back
it's<00:03:18.310> very<00:03:18.640> unlikely<00:03:19.060> that<00:03:19.240> it's<00:03:19.480> going<00:03:19.660> to

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
it's very unlikely that it's going to

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.270 
it's very unlikely that it's going to

get through two layers of mill felt

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.940 
get through two layers of mill felt
especially<00:03:21.550> with<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.240> dead<00:03:22.450> air<00:03:22.770> let's<00:03:23.770> take

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
especially with the dead air let's take

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.070 
especially with the dead air let's take
a<00:03:23.980> look<00:03:24.250> behind<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:24.970> felt<00:03:25.270> and<00:03:25.390> behind<00:03:25.959> the

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
a look behind the felt and behind the

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.809 
a look behind the felt and behind the
target<00:03:26.260> frame<00:03:26.620> that's<00:03:27.340> where<00:03:27.610> the<00:03:27.670> magic

target frame that's where the magic
happens<00:03:29.040> this<00:03:30.040> is<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:31.060> rear<00:03:31.300> of<00:03:31.570> the<00:03:32.200> impact

happens this is the rear of the impact

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.390 
happens this is the rear of the impact
area<00:03:32.830> as<00:03:33.790> you<00:03:34.030> can<00:03:34.209> see<00:03:34.480> that's<00:03:35.200> a<00:03:35.380> big<00:03:35.740> pile<00:03:36.190> of

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
area as you can see that's a big pile of

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.690 
area as you can see that's a big pile of
sand<00:03:36.640> there<00:03:37.570> are<00:03:37.780> 40<00:03:38.260> tractor<00:03:39.040> trailer<00:03:39.280> tires

40 tires there are also 50 yards of sand
piled<00:03:51.520> up<00:03:51.640> in<00:03:51.790> here<00:03:52.060> as<00:03:52.209> well<00:03:52.390> and<00:03:52.950> it's

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
piled up in here as well and it's

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.890 
piled up in here as well and it's
important<00:03:54.519> to<00:03:54.580> put<00:03:54.760> sand<00:03:55.060> in<00:03:55.239> front<00:03:55.660> of<00:03:55.780> your

of them because that hard rubber can can
certainly<00:04:01.180> initiate<00:04:01.720> ricochets<00:04:02.260> as<00:04:02.470> well<00:04:02.650> so

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
certainly initiate ricochets as well so

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.770 
certainly initiate ricochets as well so
you<00:04:02.920> want<00:04:03.160> to<00:04:03.250> make<00:04:03.280> sure<00:04:03.430> that<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.269> tie<00:04:04.450> is<00:04:04.510> it

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
you want to make sure that the tie is it

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.110 
you want to make sure that the tie is it
to<00:04:04.870> the<00:04:04.989> back<00:04:05.260> of<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:05.560> impact<00:04:06.340> area<00:04:06.550> so<00:04:07.090> that

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
to the back of the impact area so that

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.570 
to the back of the impact area so that
they<00:04:07.480> expel<00:04:08.320> all<00:04:08.500> of<00:04:08.650> their<00:04:08.769> energy<00:04:08.950> in<00:04:09.340> the

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
they expel all of their energy in the

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.360 
they expel all of their energy in the
sand<00:04:09.850> and<00:04:10.120> just<00:04:10.720> use<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:11.080> tires<00:04:11.470> for<00:04:11.800> a<00:04:12.160> little

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
sand and just use the tires for a little

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.970 
sand and just use the tires for a little
bit<00:04:12.580> of<00:04:12.700> extra<00:04:12.910> stopping<00:04:13.600> power<00:04:13.769> let's<00:04:14.769> take<00:04:14.950> a

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
bit of extra stopping power let's take a

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.280 
bit of extra stopping power let's take a
look<00:04:15.190> at<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.430> side<00:04:15.720> so<00:04:16.720> you've<00:04:16.900> seen<00:04:17.079> the

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
look at the side so you've seen the

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.550 
look at the side so you've seen the
front<00:04:17.590> and<00:04:18.250> you've<00:04:18.760> seen<00:04:18.970> the<00:04:19.150> back<00:04:19.359> now<00:04:20.260> this

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
front and you've seen the back now this

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.060 
front and you've seen the back now this
is<00:04:20.769> the<00:04:20.799> side<00:04:21.220> it's<00:04:22.120> not<00:04:22.419> only<00:04:22.600> wide<00:04:23.050> it's<00:04:23.830> not

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
is the side it's not only wide it's not

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.880 
is the side it's not only wide it's not
only<00:04:24.280> tall<00:04:24.700> but<00:04:25.690> it<00:04:25.840> but<00:04:26.050> it's<00:04:26.229> very<00:04:26.530> very

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
only tall but it but it's very very

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.560 
only tall but it but it's very very
thick<00:04:27.460> it's<00:04:27.729> very<00:04:27.940> deep<00:04:28.380> it's<00:04:29.380> 15<00:04:29.800> to<00:04:30.010> 20<00:04:30.340> feet

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
thick it's very deep it's 15 to 20 feet

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.690 
thick it's very deep it's 15 to 20 feet
wide<00:04:31.570> at<00:04:31.990> the<00:04:32.050> base<00:04:32.410> and<00:04:32.680> then<00:04:32.890> it<00:04:33.040> tapers<00:04:33.220> up<00:04:33.580> a

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
wide at the base and then it tapers up a

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.880 
wide at the base and then it tapers up a
little<00:04:33.970> bit<00:04:34.150> now<00:04:34.720> this<00:04:35.260> gives<00:04:35.500> you<00:04:35.620> a<00:04:35.650> good

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
little bit now this gives you a good

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.860 
little bit now this gives you a good
look<00:04:36.070> at<00:04:36.190> that<00:04:36.370> buffer<00:04:36.729> zone<00:04:36.940> between<00:04:37.180> the

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
look at that buffer zone between the

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.800 
look at that buffer zone between the
mill<00:04:38.410> felt<00:04:38.710> in<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.580> actual<00:04:39.880> impact<00:04:40.360> area

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
mill felt in the actual impact area

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.330 
mill felt in the actual impact area
where<00:04:41.020> we've<00:04:41.200> got<00:04:41.380> the<00:04:41.500> sand<00:04:41.770> and<00:04:41.979> then<00:04:42.220> the

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
where we've got the sand and then the

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.730 
where we've got the sand and then the
tires<00:04:42.760> further<00:04:43.090> back<00:04:43.390> inside<00:04:43.930> the<00:04:44.200> sand<00:04:44.470> and

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
tires further back inside the sand and

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.090 
tires further back inside the sand and
in<00:04:45.729> between<00:04:45.970> the<00:04:46.330> mill<00:04:46.510> felt<00:04:46.780> is<00:04:47.440> the<00:04:47.710> second

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
in between the mill felt is the second

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.190 
in between the mill felt is the second
layer<00:04:48.250> for<00:04:48.910> the<00:04:49.000> second<00:04:49.390> layer<00:04:49.510> of<00:04:49.780> mill<00:04:49.960> felt

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
layer for the second layer of mill felt

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.980 
layer for the second layer of mill felt
so<00:04:50.500> it<00:04:50.860> may<00:04:51.220> be<00:04:51.280> a<00:04:51.400> little<00:04:51.610> bit<00:04:51.990> over

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
so it may be a little bit over

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.260 
so it may be a little bit over
engineered<00:04:53.530> but<00:04:54.130> in<00:04:54.250> our<00:04:54.400> business<00:04:54.430> you<00:04:55.060> can

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
engineered but in our business you can

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.870 
engineered but in our business you can
never<00:04:55.390> ever<00:04:55.720> be<00:04:56.050> too<00:04:56.410> safe<00:04:56.680> and<00:04:56.950> the<00:04:57.700> best

never ever be too safe and the best
thing<00:04:57.970> about<00:04:58.120> this<00:04:58.570> is<00:04:58.780> it<00:04:59.500> wasn't<00:04:59.890> a<00:04:59.979> lot<00:05:00.250> of

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
thing about this is it wasn't a lot of

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.180 
thing about this is it wasn't a lot of
money<00:05:00.640> to<00:05:00.970> put<00:05:01.120> together<00:05:01.510> you<00:05:02.350> can<00:05:02.560> probably

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
money to put together you can probably

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.659 
money to put together you can probably
find<00:05:03.430> no<00:05:04.210> matter<00:05:04.450> what<00:05:04.870> your<00:05:05.050> area<00:05:05.669> somebody

willing to get rid of tires and also
dead<00:05:10.840> sand<00:05:11.260> is<00:05:11.530> not<00:05:12.100> very<00:05:12.370> expensive<00:05:12.850> it's

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
dead sand is not very expensive it's

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.020

totally seed in because we give it quite

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.460 
totally seed in because we give it quite
a<00:05:34.460> workout<00:05:34.670> regularly<00:05:35.060> but<00:05:35.840> it<00:05:35.960> will<00:05:36.110> hold<00:05:36.290> the

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
a workout regularly but it will hold the

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.210 
a workout regularly but it will hold the

rest of the sand together so mihlfeld if

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.550 
rest of the sand together so mihlfeld if
you<00:05:40.460> do<00:05:40.670> live<00:05:40.880> in<00:05:40.910> a<00:05:41.120> mill<00:05:41.390> area<00:05:41.690> or<00:05:42.020> a<00:05:42.080> textile

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
you do live in a mill area or a textile

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.700 
you do live in a mill area or a textile
area<00:05:43.210> it's<00:05:44.210> not<00:05:44.450> it's<00:05:44.510> not<00:05:45.050> very<00:05:45.290> expensive

area it's not it's not very expensive

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.410 
area it's not it's not very expensive
they<00:05:46.070> typically<00:05:46.520> throw<00:05:46.760> it<00:05:46.910> away<00:05:47.000> when<00:05:47.300> they

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:47.420 
they typically throw it away when they

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.060 
they typically throw it away when they
are<00:05:47.510> done<00:05:47.630> with<00:05:47.840> the<00:05:47.960> run<00:05:48.170> so<00:05:48.530> if<00:05:48.680> you<00:05:48.770> get<00:05:48.920> in

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
are done with the run so if you get in

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.410 
are done with the run so if you get in
good<00:05:49.220> with<00:05:49.280> one<00:05:49.550> of<00:05:49.670> the<00:05:49.730> mill<00:05:49.910> workers<00:05:50.300> you

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:50.420 
good with one of the mill workers you

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.300 
good with one of the mill workers you
can<00:05:50.600> get<00:05:50.750> this<00:05:50.900> stuff<00:05:51.140> if<00:05:51.560> you<00:05:51.770> don't<00:05:52.040> live<00:05:52.190> in

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
can get this stuff if you don't live in

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.130 
can get this stuff if you don't live in
a<00:05:52.400> mill<00:05:52.550> area<00:05:52.730> or<00:05:53.150> even<00:05:53.540> know<00:05:53.660> what<00:05:53.840> the<00:05:53.990> hell

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.140 
a mill area or even know what the hell

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.990 
a mill area or even know what the hell
I'm<00:05:54.290> talking<00:05:54.320> about<00:05:54.710> when<00:05:55.220> I<00:05:55.250> talk<00:05:55.490> about<00:05:55.520> mill

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
I'm talking about when I talk about mill

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.640 
I'm talking about when I talk about mill
felt<00:05:56.270> I'm<00:05:56.780> sure<00:05:56.990> that<00:05:57.230> there's<00:05:57.380> something

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
felt I'm sure that there's something

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.400 
felt I'm sure that there's something
similar<00:05:58.220> that<00:05:58.250> you<00:05:58.550> can<00:05:58.730> use<00:05:58.910> to<00:05:58.940> so<00:05:59.810> you<00:06:00.260> can

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
similar that you can use to so you can

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.230 
similar that you can use to so you can
have<00:06:00.530> something<00:06:00.770> that's<00:06:01.100> very<00:06:01.160> safe<00:06:01.700> that's

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
have something that's very safe that's

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.540 
have something that's very safe that's
very<00:06:02.570> big<00:06:02.930> that<00:06:03.470> has<00:06:03.680> several<00:06:04.070> levels<00:06:04.280> of

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
very big that has several levels of

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.400 
very big that has several levels of
redundancy<00:06:05.120> built<00:06:05.270> into<00:06:05.630> it<00:06:05.780> and<00:06:05.960> you<00:06:06.200> don't

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.410 
redundancy built into it and you don't

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.010 
redundancy built into it and you don't
have<00:06:06.530> to<00:06:06.710> mortgage<00:06:06.950> your<00:06:07.130> home<00:06:07.400> to<00:06:07.610> do<00:06:07.760> it<00:06:08.020> so
