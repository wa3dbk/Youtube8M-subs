00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
adapter check out the little tape and

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.110 
adapter check out the little tape and
you<00:03:01.590> get<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:01.980> pretty<00:03:02.190> standard<00:03:02.760> you<00:03:02.970> know

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
you get the pretty standard you know

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.340 
you get the pretty standard you know
this<00:03:04.050> is<00:03:04.230> voice<00:03:04.440> gain<00:03:05.480> you<00:03:06.480> get<00:03:06.690> I<00:03:06.930> guess<00:03:07.140> like

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
this is voice gain you get I guess like

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.030 
this is voice gain you get I guess like
a<00:03:07.560> boost<00:03:08.430> type<00:03:08.910> of<00:03:09.060> mode<00:03:09.239> and<00:03:09.590> this<00:03:10.590> is<00:03:10.830> your

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
a boost type of mode and this is your

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.479 
a boost type of mode and this is your
mute<00:03:12.080> and<00:03:13.080> I<00:03:13.200> guess<00:03:13.380> this<00:03:13.530> is<00:03:13.739> overall<00:03:14.190> volume

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
mute and I guess this is overall volume

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.520 
mute and I guess this is overall volume
I'm<00:03:15.180> guessing<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:17.120> again<00:03:18.120> this<00:03:18.330> is<00:03:18.510> also<00:03:18.690> 3.5

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
I'm guessing and again this is also 3.5

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.710 
I'm guessing and again this is also 3.5
millimeter<00:03:19.739> audio<00:03:20.280> jack<00:03:20.610> and<00:03:21.320> yeah<00:03:22.730> now<00:03:23.730> let's

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
millimeter audio jack and yeah now let's

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.540 
millimeter audio jack and yeah now let's
get<00:03:25.050> a<00:03:25.110> closer<00:03:25.709> look<00:03:26.070> at<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.400> headset<00:03:28.489> okay<00:03:29.489> so

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
get a closer look at the headset okay so

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.000 
get a closer look at the headset okay so
the<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:30.780> boom<00:03:30.989> mic<00:03:31.230> you<00:03:31.380> actually<00:03:31.739> could

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
the the boom mic you actually could

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.259 
the the boom mic you actually could
remove<00:03:32.340> completely<00:03:33.470> like<00:03:34.470> so<00:03:34.890> nice<00:03:35.850> little

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
remove completely like so nice little

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.380 
remove completely like so nice little
white<00:03:36.510> like<00:03:37.380> off-white<00:03:37.680> kind<00:03:38.280> of<00:03:38.370> color<00:03:38.550> with

white like off-white kind of color with
the<00:03:39.540> black<00:03:39.810> inside<00:03:41.060> so<00:03:42.060> there<00:03:42.209> you<00:03:42.239> go<00:03:43.130> there's

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
the black inside so there you go there's

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.729 
the black inside so there you go there's
more<00:03:44.400> like<00:03:44.519> a<00:03:44.550> gray<00:03:44.910> and<00:03:45.209> this<00:03:45.810> is<00:03:45.959> a<00:03:45.989> gray<00:03:46.470> and

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
more like a gray and this is a gray and

every<00:03:50.130> pops<00:03:50.459> out<00:03:50.730> of<00:03:51.030> course<00:03:51.630> you<00:03:51.720> can<00:03:51.870> remove

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
every pops out of course you can remove

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.170 
every pops out of course you can remove
the<00:03:53.040> plates<00:03:53.400> to<00:03:53.970> get<00:03:54.090> custom<00:03:54.480> plates<00:03:54.780> and<00:03:56.180> it

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
the plates to get custom plates and it

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.260 
the plates to get custom plates and it
comes<00:03:57.540> should<00:03:57.870> rotate<00:03:58.140> pretty<00:03:58.590> easily<00:03:59.270> like

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
comes should rotate pretty easily like

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.770 
comes should rotate pretty easily like
so<00:04:00.630> and<00:04:01.410> it<00:04:01.620> has<00:04:01.800> a<00:04:02.100> wii<00:04:02.550> padding<00:04:03.270> the<00:04:03.390> padding

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
so and it has a wii padding the padding

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.990 
so and it has a wii padding the padding
seems<00:04:04.020> very<00:04:04.200> weird<00:04:04.620> it<00:04:05.520> seemed<00:04:05.760> like<00:04:05.790> a

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
seems very weird it seemed like a

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.740 
seems very weird it seemed like a

to explain it more my review but the

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.660 
to explain it more my review but the
padding<00:04:13.230> is<00:04:13.320> very<00:04:13.530> weird<00:04:13.800> material<00:04:14.460> i<00:04:14.490> don't

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
know why they went with this material

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.500 
know why they went with this material
this<00:04:17.220> seemed<00:04:17.850> to<00:04:17.880> be<00:04:18.030> a<00:04:18.450> bit<00:04:18.540> annoying<00:04:20.510> check

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
this seemed to be a bit annoying check

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.210 
this seemed to be a bit annoying check
out<00:04:21.660> the<00:04:21.750> top<00:04:21.989> Astros<00:04:23.060> 840<00:04:24.470> course<00:04:25.470> pretty

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
the aqua blue looks really good with it

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.550 
the aqua blue looks really good with it
and<00:04:37.620> that's<00:04:37.860> pretty<00:04:37.980> much<00:04:38.100> about<00:04:38.340> it<00:04:39.530> you<00:04:40.530> know

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560
