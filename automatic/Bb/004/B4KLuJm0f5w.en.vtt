 I'll start a bluff interview from now on. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.440
 As you know the cheaper setter weather today and the weather on the rails we are now 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:41.839
 Itguyo like to pass another and what is going to like 3 products Newsflash is nothing like teupo 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:44.140
 Make your life a role that is responsible for the weather in your life 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:44.140
 I did 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:56.409
 I am now in charge of jc and I am in charge of three to seven and nine. 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:01:01.619
 When I go to work on the race, I get a makeup. 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:08.070
 So understand that the weather and weather information for each new home, we meteorology 

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:11.770
 I'm so check the weather at tha anti-haves to send meteorology 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.520
 The Meteorological Agency has sent four times a day . 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:18.490
 Based on that puzzle, we put it in and write it. 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:24.060
 Create graphics 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.060
 After that , it ends at 7 o'clock news and 9 o'clock news 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:33.750
 Well that's really between 1 minute and 1 minute and 3 seconds in the weather. 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:37.680
 I'm going to tell you why I spend a lot all trough the wind pressure 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:44.400
 But because the car is such a short time is really huge in size easily loosen 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:49.970
 I'm trying to explain that once the high pressure is clear, the cyclone is cloudy and rainy 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.970
 If you understand this much, you can easily do it. 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:02:03.470
 Well, when I live , of course I get a little bit wet 9 I make a lot of mistakes 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:08.619
 Actually, it is difficult to live , and Seo Hee is plugging in the earphone . 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:13.400
 I do not see a transparent and program fits well go do not see the attachment 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:15.020
 Give me the weather or lengthen it. 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.600
 I only envy it when I am. 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:23.360
 This is what we face is laughing the whole country tomorrow, so generally sunny but 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:27.230
 Please briefly weather isnt the opportunity 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:31.670
 I got your phone, but you keep talking. 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:36.670
 I can not nod and I can not do it because I'm broadcasting. 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:43.580
 I got the answer so far. Okay. Fortunately at the age of 100, 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:45.970
 And that will make you incompetent , but you can make mistakes when you broadcast a little 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.970
 A ride 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:53.760
 Oh, I like it so much. 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:57.239
 Oh, I think it's an honor. 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:03.299
 I'm ashamed to leave 4c 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:06.989
 4 I love traveling a lot 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:13.019
 I have never been to Jeju Island , especially in Korea .

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:38.780
 Jeju-do in Korea is now making s2 efforts to improve the natural landscape. 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:45.200
 I have. 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:48.440
 Jeju Island in Korea is not really a treasure in Korea, 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:53.780
 I think this is good for Daegu. 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.040
 Your precious votes can make our country's Jeju Island into three Jeju Island. 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.030
