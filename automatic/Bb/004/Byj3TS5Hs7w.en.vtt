yeah<00:00:03.880> I<00:00:03.909> mean<00:00:04.210> I<00:00:04.620> guess<00:00:05.620> it's<00:00:06.009> what<00:00:06.129> makes<00:00:06.279> it

00:00:06.449 --> 00:00:06.459 
yeah I mean I guess it's what makes it

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:07.980 
yeah I mean I guess it's what makes it
so<00:00:06.640> difficult<00:00:06.879> because<00:00:07.209> I<00:00:07.419> know<00:00:07.479> Melbourne<00:00:07.930> is

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:07.990 
so difficult because I know Melbourne is

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.209 
so difficult because I know Melbourne is
coming<00:00:08.290> up<00:00:08.380> and<00:00:08.530> I<00:00:08.590> want<00:00:08.620> to<00:00:08.800> start<00:00:08.980> playing

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:13.200 
coming up and I want to start playing
well<00:00:09.460> and<00:00:10.469> you<00:00:11.469> know<00:00:11.559> I<00:00:11.620> think<00:00:11.710> going<00:00:12.670> on<00:00:12.940> what

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:13.210 
well and you know I think going on what

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.560 
well and you know I think going on what
I<00:00:13.540> thought<00:00:14.230> I<00:00:14.290> did<00:00:14.980> pretty<00:00:15.040> poorly<00:00:15.669> last<00:00:16.240> week

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
I thought I did pretty poorly last week

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.990 
I thought I did pretty poorly last week
to<00:00:16.810> this<00:00:16.930> week<00:00:16.990> but<00:00:17.950> it<00:00:18.070> better<00:00:18.280> I<00:00:18.400> just<00:00:18.550> didn't

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000 
to this week but it better I just didn't

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.040 
to this week but it better I just didn't
play<00:00:19.780> well<00:00:19.990> enough<00:00:20.140> and<00:00:20.560> I<00:00:20.830> think<00:00:21.040> I<00:00:21.160> got<00:00:22.050> you

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
play well enough and I think I got you

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.070 
play well enough and I think I got you
know<00:00:23.140> the<00:00:23.380> whole<00:00:24.390> emotional<00:00:25.390> side<00:00:25.840> of<00:00:25.960> things

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080 
know the whole emotional side of things

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.510 
know the whole emotional side of things
just<00:00:26.350> really<00:00:26.590> took<00:00:26.740> over<00:00:26.890> today<00:00:27.190> and<00:00:27.220> never

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520 
just really took over today and never

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.730 
just really took over today and never
felt<00:00:27.850> like<00:00:27.970> I<00:00:28.120> was<00:00:28.270> able<00:00:28.390> to<00:00:28.570> be<00:00:28.690> kind<00:00:29.440> of<00:00:29.560> loose

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740 
felt like I was able to be kind of loose

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.350 
felt like I was able to be kind of loose
and<00:00:30.040> free<00:00:30.280> with<00:00:30.550> the<00:00:30.580> way<00:00:30.790> that<00:00:30.940> I<00:00:31.000> wanted<00:00:31.270> to

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
and free with the way that I wanted to

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.810 
and free with the way that I wanted to
play<00:00:31.570> and<00:00:31.780> there<00:00:31.900> was<00:00:32.020> kind<00:00:32.200> of<00:00:32.349> a<00:00:32.590> few<00:00:33.429> points

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
play and there was kind of a few points

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.130 
play and there was kind of a few points
here<00:00:33.850> and<00:00:34.000> there<00:00:34.239> where<00:00:34.449> I<00:00:34.480> felt<00:00:34.750> like<00:00:34.870> yep

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
here and there where I felt like yep

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.040 
here and there where I felt like yep
it's<00:00:35.679> there<00:00:35.949> and<00:00:35.980> then<00:00:36.539> goes<00:00:37.539> away<00:00:37.570> pretty

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
it's there and then goes away pretty

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.989 
it's there and then goes away pretty
quick<00:00:38.320> so<00:00:38.589> I<00:00:38.649> guess<00:00:38.859> that's<00:00:38.980> the<00:00:39.160> the<00:00:39.699> hardest

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:39.999 
quick so I guess that's the the hardest

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:42.180 
quick so I guess that's the the hardest
thing<00:00:40.269> to<00:00:40.300> kind<00:00:41.230> of<00:00:41.350> walk<00:00:41.469> away<00:00:41.710> from<00:00:41.890> today's

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
thing to kind of walk away from today's

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.130 
thing to kind of walk away from today's
that<00:00:42.429> it<00:00:42.550> was<00:00:42.640> kind<00:00:42.850> of<00:00:42.910> very<00:00:43.149> in<00:00:43.600> and<00:00:44.019> out<00:00:44.109> of

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
that it was kind of very in and out of

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.709 
that it was kind of very in and out of
being<00:00:44.710> the<00:00:44.859> way<00:00:44.980> that<00:00:45.010> I<00:00:45.219> want<00:00:45.519> oh<00:00:45.699> I<00:00:46.210> mean<00:00:46.570> yeah

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 
being the way that I want oh I mean yeah

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:50.310 
being the way that I want oh I mean yeah
I<00:00:46.749> think<00:00:47.109> today<00:00:48.300> I'd<00:00:49.300> certainly<00:00:49.780> didn't

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
I think today I'd certainly didn't

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.869 
I think today I'd certainly didn't
handle<00:00:50.649> that<00:00:50.800> side<00:00:51.070> of<00:00:51.100> things<00:00:51.219> at<00:00:51.550> all<00:00:51.609> well

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
handle that side of things at all well

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.619 
handle that side of things at all well
and<00:00:52.149> I<00:00:52.809> mean<00:00:53.399> yeah<00:00:54.399> I<00:00:54.429> think<00:00:54.879> being<00:00:55.300> in

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
and I mean yeah I think being in

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.049 
and I mean yeah I think being in
Australia<00:00:56.499> plane<00:00:57.100> is<00:00:57.280> tray<00:00:57.429> of<00:00:57.550> course<00:00:57.789> I<00:00:57.879> want

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
Australia plane is tray of course I want

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.119 
Australia plane is tray of course I want
to<00:00:58.120> play<00:00:58.809> the<00:00:58.960> best<00:00:59.109> I<00:00:59.289> can<00:00:59.350> play<00:00:59.589> and<00:00:59.800> do<00:00:59.979> it

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
to play the best I can play and do it

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:01.739 
to play the best I can play and do it
all<00:01:00.249> here<00:01:00.550> this<00:01:00.760> month<00:01:00.999> right<00:01:01.300> here<00:01:01.359> right<00:01:01.719> now

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:01.749 
all here this month right here right now

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:03.059 
all here this month right here right now
and<00:01:01.899> then<00:01:02.140> when<00:01:02.229> it<00:01:02.379> doesn't<00:01:02.530> happen<00:01:02.679> it's

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:03.069 
and then when it doesn't happen it's

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:05.250 
and then when it doesn't happen it's
obviously<00:01:03.540> disappointing<00:01:04.540> it<00:01:05.019> probably

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
obviously disappointing it probably

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.290 
obviously disappointing it probably
makes<00:01:05.410> them<00:01:05.560> more<00:01:05.680> disappointing<00:01:06.280> here<00:01:07.090> than

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
makes them more disappointing here than

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.800 
makes them more disappointing here than
anywhere<00:01:07.600> else<00:01:07.660> so<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:09.060> yeah<00:01:10.060> I<00:01:10.090> guess<00:01:10.630> it's

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
anywhere else so that yeah I guess it's

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.800 
anywhere else so that yeah I guess it's
all<00:01:11.410> part<00:01:12.160> of<00:01:12.280> it<00:01:12.400> is<00:01:12.520> that<00:01:12.550> what<00:01:12.970> I<00:01:13.000> choose<00:01:13.750> to

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
all part of it is that what I choose to

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.200 
all part of it is that what I choose to
be<00:01:14.230> playing<00:01:14.890> big<00:01:15.160> tournaments<00:01:15.670> in<00:01:15.760> Australia

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
be playing big tournaments in Australia

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.940 
be playing big tournaments in Australia
rather<00:01:16.480> than<00:01:16.690> not<00:01:16.930> of<00:01:17.110> course<00:01:17.290> i<00:01:17.500> would<00:01:17.680> but<00:01:17.890> i

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
rather than not of course i would but i

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.840 
rather than not of course i would but i
want<00:01:18.610> to<00:01:18.700> make<00:01:19.390> it<00:01:19.600> all<00:01:19.690> good<00:01:19.840> too<00:01:20.170> oh<00:01:20.820> yeah<00:01:21.820> i

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
want to make it all good too oh yeah i

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.760 
want to make it all good too oh yeah i
mean<00:01:22.120> i<00:01:22.180> think<00:01:22.240> she<00:01:22.510> played<00:01:22.690> aggressive<00:01:23.500> i<00:01:23.590> was

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
mean i think she played aggressive i was

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.110 
mean i think she played aggressive i was
trying<00:01:24.040> to<00:01:24.130> do<00:01:24.250> that<00:01:24.370> as<00:01:24.520> well<00:01:24.550> but<00:01:24.850> i<00:01:24.940> think

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
trying to do that as well but i think

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.140 
trying to do that as well but i think
the<00:01:25.270> biggest<00:01:25.660> thing<00:01:25.840> that<00:01:26.290> i<00:01:26.910> didn't<00:01:27.910> do<00:01:28.000> well

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
the biggest thing that i didn't do well

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.760 
the biggest thing that i didn't do well
is<00:01:28.390> exactly<00:01:28.750> what<00:01:28.930> i<00:01:28.960> just<00:01:29.050> said<00:01:29.320> I'd<00:01:29.440> I<00:01:29.470> think

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
is exactly what i just said I'd I think

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.720 
is exactly what i just said I'd I think
it<00:01:29.890> was<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:31.060> know<00:01:31.180> that<00:01:31.360> she<00:01:31.630> did<00:01:32.620> that<00:01:32.650> I<00:01:33.130> mean

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
it was you know that she did that I mean

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.760 
it was you know that she did that I mean
she<00:01:33.940> played<00:01:34.270> well<00:01:34.540> and<00:01:34.810> played<00:01:35.260> aggressive

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
she played well and played aggressive

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.490 
she played well and played aggressive
but<00:01:35.890> i<00:01:35.920> think<00:01:36.130> i<00:01:36.250> would<00:01:36.310> if<00:01:37.180> I'm<00:01:37.480> up<00:01:37.930> to<00:01:37.990> it<00:01:38.320> i

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
but i think i would if I'm up to it i

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.260 
but i think i would if I'm up to it i
should<00:01:38.980> be<00:01:39.100> able<00:01:39.130> to<00:01:39.370> handle<00:01:39.520> that<00:01:39.730> in<00:01:39.970> and

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
should be able to handle that in and

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.210 
should be able to handle that in and
come<00:01:40.750> back<00:01:40.930> with<00:01:41.260> that<00:01:41.500> same<00:01:41.890> sort<00:01:41.920> of

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
come back with that same sort of

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.680 
come back with that same sort of
aggression<00:01:42.640> in<00:01:42.730> game<00:01:42.880> style<00:01:43.210> and<00:01:43.390> that's<00:01:43.510> the

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
aggression in game style and that's the

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.480 
aggression in game style and that's the
way<00:01:43.810> that<00:01:44.050> I've<00:01:44.470> beaten<00:01:44.800> her<00:01:44.890> in<00:01:44.980> the<00:01:45.070> past<00:01:45.280> so

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
way that I've beaten her in the past so

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.590 
way that I've beaten her in the past so
I'm<00:01:45.790> capable<00:01:46.300> of<00:01:46.660> doing<00:01:46.960> that<00:01:47.400> yeah<00:01:48.570> yeah<00:01:49.570> I

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
I'm capable of doing that yeah yeah I

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.960 
I'm capable of doing that yeah yeah I
think<00:01:49.900> it's<00:01:49.990> just<00:01:50.170> the<00:01:50.260> whole<00:01:51.190> expectation

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
think it's just the whole expectation

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.430 
think it's just the whole expectation
that<00:01:52.060> I<00:01:52.150> try<00:01:52.360> and<00:01:52.420> put<00:01:52.600> on<00:01:52.690> myself<00:01:52.840> to<00:01:53.170> it<00:01:53.320> and

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
that I try and put on myself to it and

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.100 
that I try and put on myself to it and
and<00:01:54.150> you<00:01:55.150> know<00:01:55.180> you<00:01:55.300> do<00:01:55.480> all<00:01:55.570> the<00:01:55.660> work<00:01:55.840> leading

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
and you know you do all the work leading

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.350 
and you know you do all the work leading
up<00:01:56.320> and<00:01:56.500> you<00:01:56.650> feel<00:01:57.100> like<00:01:57.280> hey<00:01:57.460> and<00:01:57.490> today<00:01:58.210> all

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
up and you feel like hey and today all

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.420 
up and you feel like hey and today all
of<00:01:58.480> a<00:01:58.540> sudden<00:01:58.840> it's<00:01:58.990> just<00:01:59.230> like<00:01:59.410> a<00:01:59.440> bombshell

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
of a sudden it's just like a bombshell

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.930 
of a sudden it's just like a bombshell
hit<00:02:00.850> you<00:02:01.060> so<00:02:01.360> it's<00:02:01.600> I<00:02:02.310> guess<00:02:03.310> it's<00:02:03.460> hard<00:02:03.580> at<00:02:03.760> a

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
hit you so it's I guess it's hard at a

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.600 
hit you so it's I guess it's hard at a
door<00:02:04.150> when<00:02:04.270> you<00:02:04.420> don't<00:02:04.930> really<00:02:05.620> expect<00:02:05.770> it<00:02:06.370> to

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
door when you don't really expect it to

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.279 
door when you don't really expect it to
come<00:02:07.300> out<00:02:07.420> like<00:02:07.480> that<00:02:07.660> when<00:02:07.960> you're<00:02:07.990> playing

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
come out like that when you're playing

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.080 
come out like that when you're playing
out<00:02:08.500> on<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.709> court<00:02:09.509> um<00:02:11.159> yeah<00:02:12.159> I<00:02:12.189> think<00:02:12.370> it's<00:02:12.700> I

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
out on the court um yeah I think it's I

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.760 
out on the court um yeah I think it's I
guess<00:02:13.420> it's<00:02:13.719> same

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
guess it's same

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.140 
guess it's same
current<00:02:15.310> levels<00:02:15.580> but<00:02:15.700> it's<00:02:15.820> just<00:02:15.970> two

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
current levels but it's just two

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.970 
current levels but it's just two
completely<00:02:16.630> different<00:02:17.080> circumstances<00:02:17.770> and<00:02:17.890> I

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
completely different circumstances and I

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.550 
completely different circumstances and I
think<00:02:18.220> for<00:02:18.490> sure<00:02:18.520> that<00:02:18.940> can<00:02:19.240> absolutely<00:02:20.140> help

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
think for sure that can absolutely help

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.020 
think for sure that can absolutely help
me<00:02:20.710> like<00:02:20.860> I've<00:02:21.010> said<00:02:21.160> in<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.310> past<00:02:21.370> I<00:02:21.820> think

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
me like I've said in the past I think

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.420 
me like I've said in the past I think

right<00:02:35.050> frame<00:02:35.680> of<00:02:35.710> mind<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:36.430> got<00:02:37.120> out<00:02:37.270> there

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
right frame of mind and got out there

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
and kind of hit me so that I think it

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.440 
and kind of hit me so that I think it
was<00:02:40.240> any<00:02:40.420> thing<00:02:41.260> from<00:02:41.440> lack<00:02:42.280> of<00:02:42.420> you<00:02:43.420> know

you<00:03:11.350> know<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:11.590> last<00:03:11.770> few<00:03:12.010> years<00:03:12.130> have<00:03:12.910> lost

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
you know the last few years have lost

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.910 
you know the last few years have lost
third<00:03:13.900> and<00:03:14.050> fourth<00:03:14.230> rounds<00:03:14.620> but<00:03:14.740> it's<00:03:14.800> a<00:03:14.890> very

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
third and fourth rounds but it's a very

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.890 
third and fourth rounds but it's a very
good<00:03:15.130> place<00:03:15.460> so<00:03:15.850> i<00:03:15.880> guess<00:03:16.150> that<00:03:16.300> is<00:03:16.330> definitely

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
good place so i guess that is definitely

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.840 
good place so i guess that is definitely
one<00:03:17.080> thing<00:03:17.260> that<00:03:17.440> i<00:03:17.530> can<00:03:18.160> take<00:03:18.340> away<00:03:18.550> from<00:03:18.700> it

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
one thing that i can take away from it

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.820 
one thing that i can take away from it
is<00:03:19.000> that<00:03:19.030> I<00:03:19.180> do<00:03:19.330> have<00:03:19.840> a<00:03:19.870> week<00:03:20.140> to<00:03:20.380> go<00:03:20.560> and

thing this year yeah I guess it's nice

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.449 
thing this year yeah I guess it's nice
to<00:03:26.170> know<00:03:26.290> but<00:03:26.320> of<00:03:26.740> course<00:03:27.070> you're<00:03:27.250> going<00:03:27.370> to

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
to know but of course you're going to

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.000 
to know but of course you're going to
treat<00:03:28.120> everyone<00:03:28.420> on<00:03:28.720> their<00:03:28.900> merits<00:03:29.290> and<00:03:29.500> I

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
treat everyone on their merits and I

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.560 
treat everyone on their merits and I
mean<00:03:30.190> I'm<00:03:30.430> not<00:03:30.580> expecting<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.209> first<00:03:31.420> round

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
mean I'm not expecting the first round

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:32.940 
mean I'm not expecting the first round
to<00:03:31.720> be<00:03:31.810> easy<00:03:31.990> that's<00:03:32.260> for<00:03:32.320> sure<00:03:32.500> no<00:03:32.650> matter<00:03:32.680> who

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
to be easy that's for sure no matter who

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.800 
to be easy that's for sure no matter who
I<00:03:33.010> play<00:03:33.250> but<00:03:33.459> I<00:03:33.490> guess<00:03:33.670> it<00:03:33.790> is<00:03:33.910> comforting

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
I play but I guess it is comforting

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.990 
I play but I guess it is comforting
knowing<00:03:34.959> that<00:03:35.280> you<00:03:36.280> know<00:03:36.310> you've<00:03:36.550> got<00:03:36.790> that

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
knowing that you know you've got that

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.940 
knowing that you know you've got that
maybe<00:03:37.780> that<00:03:37.930> higher<00:03:38.110> number<00:03:38.530> next<00:03:38.680> to<00:03:38.830> your

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
maybe that higher number next to your

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.620 
maybe that higher number next to your
name<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.340> that<00:03:39.370> you're<00:03:39.910> gonna<00:03:40.000> be<00:03:40.240> out<00:03:40.390> there

really<00:03:43.420> come<00:03:43.600> through<00:03:43.630> next<00:03:44.020> week<00:03:45.150> yeah

I like hearing the crowd out there and
being<00:04:04.510> you<00:04:04.990> know<00:04:05.080> I'd<00:04:05.140> much<00:04:05.350> rather<00:04:05.380> play<00:04:05.740> in
