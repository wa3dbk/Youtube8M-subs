00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.370 

note<00:02:03.670> that<00:02:04.090> on<00:02:04.209> the<00:02:04.359> other<00:02:04.450> side<00:02:04.569> is<00:02:05.229> where

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
note that on the other side is where

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.719 
note that on the other side is where
your<00:02:05.560> masking<00:02:06.100> tape<00:02:06.429> was<00:02:06.819> placed<00:02:08.550> should<00:02:09.550> be

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
your masking tape was placed should be

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.370 
your masking tape was placed should be
in<00:02:09.850> line<00:02:10.179> with<00:02:10.209> this<00:02:10.660> mark<00:02:11.050> I<00:02:12.900> will<00:02:13.900> now<00:02:14.080> create

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
in line with this mark I will now create

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.190 
in line with this mark I will now create
a<00:02:14.560> guide<00:02:15.000> using<00:02:16.000> a<00:02:16.090> two-by-four

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
a guide using a two-by-four

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.949 
a guide using a two-by-four
so<00:02:17.650> we<00:02:17.860> can<00:02:18.069> take<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.970> saul<00:02:19.270> straight<00:02:19.720> down

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
so we can take the saul straight down

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.830 
so we can take the saul straight down
that<00:02:20.140> line<00:02:20.730> for<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:21.760> smooth<00:02:22.180> cut<00:02:24.390> take<00:02:25.390> your<00:02:25.569> saw

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
that line for a smooth cut take your saw

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.270 
that line for a smooth cut take your saw
and<00:02:27.450> lower<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.750> stage<00:02:29.080> to<00:02:29.590> where<00:02:29.860> you<00:02:30.069> have

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
and lower the stage to where you have

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.840 
and lower the stage to where you have
your<00:02:30.340> blade<00:02:30.819> resting<00:02:32.130> perfectly<00:02:33.130> Center<00:02:33.610> on

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
your blade resting perfectly Center on

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.350 
your blade resting perfectly Center on
the<00:02:34.030> line<00:02:34.300> that<00:02:34.630> you<00:02:34.750> created<00:02:36.060> making<00:02:37.060> sure

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
the line that you created making sure

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.070 
the line that you created making sure
that<00:02:37.630> you<00:02:37.750> are<00:02:37.840> snug<00:02:38.200> against<00:02:38.680> this<00:02:38.800> back<00:02:39.100> wall

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.630 

now<00:02:44.080> you<00:02:44.140> will<00:02:44.470> take<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:44.680> 2x4<00:02:47.099> and<00:02:48.099> put<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:48.370> right

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
now you will take a 2x4 and put it right

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.360 
now you will take a 2x4 and put it right
against<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.209> saw<00:02:49.510> for<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.200> edge<00:02:50.380> and<00:02:50.830> you

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
against the saw for the edge and you

00:02:51.370 --> 00:03:03.840 
against the saw for the edge and you
will<00:02:51.489> clamp<00:02:51.850> this<00:02:52.120> in<00:02:52.360> place<00:02:53.459> using<00:02:54.459> C<00:02:54.760> clamps

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.830 

once<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:05.090> clamps<00:03:05.600> are<00:03:05.780> in<00:03:05.900> place<00:03:06.200> for<00:03:07.840> your

once the clamps are in place for your
guide

guide

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.860 
guide
check<00:03:11.420> with<00:03:12.410> a<00:03:12.470> square<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:14.120> make<00:03:14.270> sure<00:03:14.570> it's<00:03:14.750> a

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
check with a square to make sure it's a

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
check with a square to make sure it's a
perfect<00:03:15.110> 90<00:03:15.680> degrees<00:03:16.070> you<00:03:20.410> will<00:03:21.410> now<00:03:21.590> take<00:03:21.650> a

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
perfect 90 degrees you will now take a

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.280 
perfect 90 degrees you will now take a
smaller<00:03:22.340> block<00:03:22.730> and<00:03:23.090> put<00:03:23.990> it<00:03:24.080> on<00:03:24.170> the

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
it is perfectly in line at a 90 degrees

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:47.460 
it is perfectly in line at a 90 degrees
you<00:03:35.530> will<00:03:36.530> clamp<00:03:36.860> that<00:03:37.130> small<00:03:37.520> block<00:03:37.820> down

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.490 

you

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.790 

you<00:03:51.500> have<00:03:51.650> now<00:03:51.920> created<00:03:52.220> a<00:03:52.610> perfect<00:03:53.030> guide<00:03:53.800> to

you have now created a perfect guide to
run<00:03:55.010> your<00:03:55.190> saul<00:03:55.490> down<00:03:55.959> to<00:03:56.959> cut<00:03:57.200> a<00:03:57.230> straight<00:03:57.800> and

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069

run your saul down to cut a straight and
smooth<00:03:58.700> line<00:04:00.040> when<00:04:01.040> you<00:04:01.160> do<00:04:01.340> this<00:04:01.550> it<00:04:01.940> is<00:04:02.900> good

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
smooth line when you do this it is good

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.250 
smooth line when you do this it is good
to<00:04:03.380> have<00:04:03.560> somebody<00:04:03.980> to<00:04:04.520> hold<00:04:04.790> the<00:04:05.690> end<00:04:05.930> of<00:04:06.050> this

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
to have somebody to hold the end of this

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.790 
to have somebody to hold the end of this
so<00:04:06.530> it<00:04:06.650> doesn't<00:04:06.890> snap<00:04:07.340> off<00:04:08.440> make<00:04:09.440> sure<00:04:09.650> you

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
cutting deep this will make a straighter

00:04:15.350 --> 00:05:12.290 
cutting deep this will make a straighter
line<00:04:15.440> when<00:04:16.340> you<00:04:16.459> cut

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:22.749 
and inspect the edge and it should be

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:26.249 
and inspect the edge and it should be
perfect<00:05:22.990> and<00:05:23.889> it<00:05:24.009> looks<00:05:24.219> good<00:05:24.809> I've<00:05:25.809> checked

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:26.259

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:29.269 
perfect and it looks good I've checked
for<00:05:26.499> square<00:05:26.889> it<00:05:27.520> is<00:05:27.669> a<00:05:27.699> perfect<00:05:28.179> 90<00:05:28.389> degrees

00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:29.279 
for square it is a perfect 90 degrees

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:32.279 
for square it is a perfect 90 degrees
there<00:05:30.279> isn't<00:05:30.429> any<00:05:30.699> chipping<00:05:31.089> on<00:05:31.389> the<00:05:31.689> edge<00:05:31.869> and

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 
there isn't any chipping on the edge and

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:34.799 
there isn't any chipping on the edge and
it<00:05:32.439> is<00:05:32.559> smooth<00:05:32.889> and<00:05:33.129> straight<00:05:33.509> just<00:05:34.509> what<00:05:34.659> we
