nose<00:03:59.870> to<00:04:00.049> mouth<00:04:00.200> lines<00:04:00.590> would<00:04:01.310> be<00:04:01.760> very<00:04:02.510> good

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
nose to mouth lines would be very good

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.630 
nose to mouth lines would be very good
value<00:04:02.959> for<00:04:03.140> money<00:04:03.320> because<00:04:03.739> it<00:04:04.190> would<00:04:04.400> soften

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
value for money because it would soften

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.450 
value for money because it would soften
the<00:04:04.910> nose<00:04:05.060> too

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
the nose too

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.640 
the nose too
it<00:04:06.120> would<00:04:06.240> last<00:04:06.420> probably<00:04:06.840> six<00:04:07.050> to<00:04:07.410> nine

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
it would last probably six to nine

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.070 
it would last probably six to nine
months<00:04:07.680> easily<00:04:08.490> and<00:04:08.730> with<00:04:09.240> top-ups<00:04:09.720> at<00:04:09.930> that

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
months easily and with top-ups at that

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.170 
months easily and with top-ups at that
time<00:04:10.350> probably<00:04:10.770> eventually<00:04:11.220> last<00:04:11.820> a<00:04:12.120> year

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
time probably eventually last a year

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.290 
time probably eventually last a year
plus<00:04:12.600> so<00:04:13.500> I<00:04:13.530> think<00:04:13.950> that<00:04:14.340> would<00:04:14.670> be<00:04:14.730> the<00:04:15.150> most

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
plus so I think that would be the most

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.900 
plus so I think that would be the most
cost<00:04:15.570> effective<00:04:15.980> treatment<00:04:16.980> available<00:04:17.400> and

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
cost effective treatment available and

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.810 
cost effective treatment available and
how<00:04:18.540> I<00:04:18.570> would<00:04:18.900> one<00:04:19.080> syringe<00:04:19.410> go<00:04:19.710> it<00:04:20.520> depends

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
how I would one syringe go it depends

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.130 
how I would one syringe go it depends
how<00:04:20.850> old<00:04:21.090> you<00:04:21.270> are<00:04:21.420> and<00:04:21.450> what<00:04:21.690> result<00:04:22.020> you

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
how old you are and what result you

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.650 
how old you are and what result you
wanted<00:04:22.560> certainly<00:04:23.430> to<00:04:23.760> soften<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.270> nose<00:04:24.450> to

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
wanted certainly to soften the nose to

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.080 
wanted certainly to soften the nose to
mouth<00:04:24.780> lines<00:04:25.110> is<00:04:25.440> there<00:04:25.740> 30<00:04:26.250> to<00:04:26.520> 40<00:04:26.730> year<00:04:26.940> old

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
mouth lines is there 30 to 40 year old

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.050 
mouth lines is there 30 to 40 year old
woman<00:04:27.300> once<00:04:27.870> orange<00:04:28.170> probably<00:04:28.740> is<00:04:28.830> enough<00:04:29.130> as

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
woman once orange probably is enough as

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.850 
woman once orange probably is enough as
you<00:04:30.240> get<00:04:30.390> older<00:04:30.870> and<00:04:31.080> the<00:04:31.260> lines<00:04:31.470> become

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
you get older and the lines become

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.070 
you get older and the lines become
deeper<00:04:32.340> maybe<00:04:32.910> someone<00:04:33.510> would<00:04:33.600> need<00:04:33.750> to<00:04:33.870> go<00:04:34.020> up

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
deeper maybe someone would need to go up

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.020 
deeper maybe someone would need to go up
to<00:04:34.260> two<00:04:34.500> syringes<00:04:34.860> so<00:04:35.430> it<00:04:35.550> would<00:04:35.670> cost<00:04:35.850> them

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
to two syringes so it would cost them

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.150 
to two syringes so it would cost them
obviously<00:04:36.210> more<00:04:36.750> but<00:04:37.380> nonetheless<00:04:37.680> the

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
obviously more but nonetheless the

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.650 
obviously more but nonetheless the
top-up<00:04:38.520> treatments<00:04:39.000> would<00:04:39.120> then<00:04:39.300> only<00:04:39.480> be

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
top-up treatments would then only be

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.420 
top-up treatments would then only be
about<00:04:39.900> one<00:04:40.140> syringe<00:04:40.530> so<00:04:40.860> I<00:04:40.890> think<00:04:41.040> that's<00:04:41.280> very

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
about one syringe so I think that's very

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.250 
about one syringe so I think that's very
good<00:04:41.910> value<00:04:42.030> for<00:04:42.210> money<00:04:42.420> when<00:04:42.660> you<00:04:42.900> consider

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
good value for money when you consider

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.130 
good value for money when you consider
that's<00:04:43.560> about<00:04:43.830> 350<00:04:44.760> pounds<00:04:45.210> lasting<00:04:46.050> you

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
that's about 350 pounds lasting you

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.590 
that's about 350 pounds lasting you
about<00:04:46.350> nine<00:04:46.590> months<00:04:46.800> plus<00:04:47.390> that's<00:04:48.390> fantastic

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
about nine months plus that's fantastic

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.210 
about nine months plus that's fantastic
thank<00:04:49.110> you<00:04:49.200> so<00:04:49.350> much<00:04:49.500> for<00:04:49.620> your<00:04:49.710> time<00:04:49.860> Tracy
