00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.290 

we<00:00:15.530> can<00:00:15.680> always<00:00:15.830> dream<00:00:16.550> of<00:00:16.610> what<00:00:16.910> what<00:00:17.120> could

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
we can always dream of what what could

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.660 
we can always dream of what what could
have<00:00:17.390> been<00:00:17.510> but<00:00:17.810> I<00:00:18.310> personally<00:00:19.310> feel<00:00:19.610> that

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
have been but I personally feel that

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.090 
have been but I personally feel that
even<00:00:20.630> even<00:00:21.170> if<00:00:21.260> we<00:00:21.350> didn't<00:00:21.560> have<00:00:21.590> the<00:00:21.740> traffic

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
even even if we didn't have the traffic

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.109 
even even if we didn't have the traffic
it<00:00:22.190> would<00:00:22.279> have<00:00:22.369> been<00:00:22.460> very<00:00:22.640> difficult<00:00:22.910> to

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
it would have been very difficult to

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.109 
it would have been very difficult to
beat<00:00:23.320> Sebastian<00:00:24.320> I<00:00:24.500> think<00:00:25.310> they<00:00:25.400> were<00:00:25.460> looking

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
beat Sebastian I think they were looking

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:27.640 
beat Sebastian I think they were looking
after<00:00:26.570> the<00:00:26.660> car<00:00:26.869> a<00:00:26.900> little<00:00:27.050> bit<00:00:27.200> towards<00:00:27.529> into

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
after the car a little bit towards into

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.530 
after the car a little bit towards into
the<00:00:27.740> race<00:00:27.890> even<00:00:28.849> though<00:00:28.939> I<00:00:28.970> pace<00:00:29.150> was<00:00:29.360> very

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:29.540 
the race even though I pace was very

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.359 
the race even though I pace was very
very<00:00:29.630> good<00:00:29.900> I<00:00:30.200> don't<00:00:30.950> think<00:00:31.130> we<00:00:31.189> could<00:00:31.340> have

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
very good I don't think we could have

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.300 
very good I don't think we could have
really<00:00:31.939> had<00:00:32.150> a<00:00:32.210> go<00:00:32.390> at<00:00:32.419> him<00:00:32.540> but<00:00:32.900> um<00:00:33.160> you<00:00:34.160> know<00:00:34.280> I

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.310 
really had a go at him but um you know I

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.440 
really had a go at him but um you know I
think<00:00:34.400> we<00:00:34.579> can<00:00:34.700> take<00:00:34.850> some<00:00:34.970> positives<00:00:35.180> from

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
think we can take some positives from

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.220 
think we can take some positives from
the<00:00:35.600> weekend<00:00:35.930> at<00:00:36.079> least<00:00:36.290> and<00:00:36.730> hopefully<00:00:38.230> you

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
the weekend at least and hopefully you

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:48.340 
the weekend at least and hopefully you
know<00:00:39.350> mount<00:00:39.890> a<00:00:40.070> a<00:00:40.579> good<00:00:40.970> challenge<00:00:41.210> in<00:00:41.750> Japan

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.329 

yeah<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.379> mean<00:00:49.530> Vettel's<00:00:49.949> going<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.129> win<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:50.339 
yeah I mean Vettel's going to win the

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:51.680 
yeah I mean Vettel's going to win the
chairmanship<00:00:50.699> whatever<00:00:51.030> happens<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.539> you

chairmanship whatever happens is you
know<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:52.409> always<00:00:52.620> got<00:00:52.859> to<00:00:52.949> do<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.129> get<00:00:53.250> one<00:00:53.399> more

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
know it always got to do is get one more

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.450 
know it always got to do is get one more
point<00:00:53.789> but<00:00:54.149> it's<00:00:55.079> it's<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.620> take<00:00:55.979> great<00:00:56.010> pride

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
point but it's it's I take great pride

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.860 
point but it's it's I take great pride
in<00:00:56.579> knowing<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.210> I'm<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.449> person<00:00:57.750> have

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
in knowing that I'm the person have

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.060 
in knowing that I'm the person have
stopped<00:00:58.079> him<00:00:58.199> from<00:00:58.289> celebrating<00:00:58.829> this

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
stopped him from celebrating this

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.799 
stopped him from celebrating this
weekend<00:01:00.289> so<00:01:01.339> yeah<00:01:02.339> you<00:01:02.399> know<00:01:02.640> I've<00:01:03.120> really

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
weekend so yeah you know I've really

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.139 
weekend so yeah you know I've really
enjoyed<00:01:03.839> the<00:01:04.680> last<00:01:04.799> year<00:01:05.039> asus<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.850> feel

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149 
enjoyed the last year asus and I feel

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.870 
enjoyed the last year asus and I feel
that<00:01:06.299> I've<00:01:06.590> worked<00:01:07.590> very<00:01:07.710> well<00:01:07.920> with<00:01:08.070> with<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
that I've worked very well with with the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.310 
that I've worked very well with with the
engineers<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.450> finding<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.840> balance<00:01:09.990> with<00:01:10.200> the

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
engineers and finding a balance with the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.230 
engineers and finding a balance with the
car<00:01:11.180> and<00:01:12.470> yeah<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.530> know<00:01:13.710> I've<00:01:14.100> had<00:01:14.909> some<00:01:15.119> good

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
car and yeah you know I've had some good

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.910 
car and yeah you know I've had some good
finishes<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:15.930> have<00:01:16.049> winning<00:01:16.380> one<00:01:16.740> race

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
finishes so you have winning one race

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.969 
finishes so you have winning one race
two<00:01:17.520> seconds<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.090> third<00:01:18.500> if<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.649> was<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.800> long

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
two seconds and a third if it was a long

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.440 
two seconds and a third if it was a long
time<00:01:20.220> ago<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.550> I<00:01:20.789> last<00:01:21.000> won<00:01:21.149> a<00:01:21.210> race<00:01:21.420> in

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
time ago that I last won a race in

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.580 
time ago that I last won a race in
Hungary<00:01:21.990> but<00:01:22.789> we<00:01:24.020> were<00:01:25.020> working<00:01:25.200> as<00:01:25.409> hard<00:01:25.440> as

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
Hungary but we were working as hard as

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.350 
Hungary but we were working as hard as
we<00:01:25.649> can<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.950> really<00:01:26.280> challenge<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:27.000> best<00:01:27.179> in<00:01:27.330> a

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
we can to really challenge the best in a

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.690 
we can to really challenge the best in a
rebel<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.840> think<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.490> think<00:01:29.490> there's<00:01:29.640> a

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
rebel and I think I think there's a

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.620 
rebel and I think I think there's a
there's<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.179> wind<00:01:30.330> around<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.569> corner<00:01:30.869> soon

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.810 

suzuka<00:01:37.980> probably<00:01:38.980> be<00:01:39.100> most<00:01:39.340> challenging

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
suzuka probably be most challenging

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.290 
suzuka probably be most challenging
circuit<00:01:40.240> one<00:01:40.810> because<00:01:41.200> of<00:01:41.550> the<00:01:42.550> layout<00:01:43.090> of<00:01:43.120> the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
circuit one because of the layout of the

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.860 
circuit one because of the layout of the
circuit<00:01:43.660> is<00:01:43.690> very<00:01:43.930> fast<00:01:44.230> it's<00:01:44.560> very<00:01:44.770> flowing

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
circuit is very fast it's very flowing

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.030 
circuit is very fast it's very flowing
you<00:01:46.870> don't<00:01:47.020> really<00:01:47.110> get<00:01:47.260> a<00:01:47.320> lot<00:01:47.470> of<00:01:47.530> time<00:01:47.800> to

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
you don't really get a lot of time to

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.410 
you don't really get a lot of time to
rest<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.770> also<00:01:51.460> because<00:01:51.760> it's<00:01:51.910> a<00:01:51.970> very<00:01:52.000> narrow

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
rest and also because it's a very narrow

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.720 
rest and also because it's a very narrow
circuit<00:01:52.930> is<00:01:52.990> very<00:01:53.200> narrow<00:01:53.410> and<00:01:53.710> there's<00:01:54.460> no

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
circuit is very narrow and there's no

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.640 
circuit is very narrow and there's no
room<00:01:55.060> for<00:01:55.270> error<00:01:55.390> if<00:01:55.960> you<00:01:56.050> make<00:01:56.200> a<00:01:56.230> mistake<00:01:56.320> you

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
room for error if you make a mistake you

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.220 
room for error if you make a mistake you
got<00:01:56.980> onto<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.400> grass<00:01:57.840> through<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:58.990> gravel

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.230 
got onto the grass through the gravel

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.470 
got onto the grass through the gravel
into<00:01:59.680> the<00:01:59.830> various<00:02:00.160> you<00:02:00.400> know<00:02:00.430> it's<00:02:00.670> not<00:02:00.820> one

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
into the various you know it's not one

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.630 
into the various you know it's not one
of<00:02:01.510> these<00:02:01.690> circuits<00:02:02.230> is<00:02:02.350> like<00:02:02.530> a<00:02:02.560> car<00:02:03.400> park

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
of these circuits is like a car park

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.020 
of these circuits is like a car park
it's<00:02:04.450> not<00:02:04.660> all<00:02:04.780> asphalt<00:02:05.260> it's<00:02:05.620> still<00:02:06.010> a<00:02:06.430> proper

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
it's not all asphalt it's still a proper

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.859 
it's not all asphalt it's still a proper
old<00:02:07.660> school<00:02:08.140> racing<00:02:08.530> circuit<00:02:08.979> so<00:02:09.600> yeah<00:02:10.600> one

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
old school racing circuit so yeah one

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.290 
old school racing circuit so yeah one
mistake<00:02:11.230> and<00:02:11.470> you're<00:02:12.100> in<00:02:12.220> trouble<00:02:12.400> so<00:02:12.730> it's

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
mistake and you're in trouble so it's

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.690 
mistake and you're in trouble so it's
tough<00:02:13.540> from<00:02:13.750> that<00:02:13.900> that<00:02:14.320> respect<00:02:14.709> and<00:02:14.950> I<00:02:15.430> think

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
tough from that that respect and I think

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.520 
tough from that that respect and I think
we<00:02:15.790> all<00:02:15.820> really<00:02:16.660> respect<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.080> circuit

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
we all really respect the circuit

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.060 
we all really respect the circuit
because<00:02:17.770> of<00:02:17.890> that<00:02:18.040> and<00:02:19.020> yeah<00:02:20.020> have<00:02:20.830> a<00:02:20.860> good

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
because of that and yeah have a good

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.410 
because of that and yeah have a good
result<00:02:21.250> in<00:02:21.490> Suzuka<00:02:21.880> would<00:02:22.000> really<00:02:22.180> mean<00:02:22.270> a<00:02:22.330> lot

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
result in Suzuka would really mean a lot

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.120 
result in Suzuka would really mean a lot
because<00:02:22.570> I<00:02:22.900> loved<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.230> circuit<00:02:23.650> i<00:02:23.709> love<00:02:23.920> i

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
because I loved the circuit i love i

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.960 
because I loved the circuit i love i
love<00:02:24.610> japan<00:02:25.150> and<00:02:25.360> i<00:02:26.140> think<00:02:26.890> we<00:02:27.010> really<00:02:27.790> need<00:02:27.880> to

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
love japan and i think we really need to

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.070 
love japan and i think we really need to
put<00:02:28.090> on<00:02:28.180> a<00:02:28.209> good<00:02:28.330> show<00:02:28.390> for<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.750> japanese

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
put on a good show for the japanese

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.460 
put on a good show for the japanese
people

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.870 

I<00:02:34.670> think<00:02:35.670> in<00:02:35.820> its<00:02:36.090> Singapore<00:02:36.570> we<00:02:36.780> did<00:02:37.500> a

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
I think in its Singapore we did a

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.770 
I think in its Singapore we did a
spotless<00:02:38.880> job<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.210> know<00:02:39.300> I<00:02:39.330> think<00:02:39.390> we<00:02:39.600> did<00:02:39.750> a

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
spotless job you know I think we did a

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.110 
spotless job you know I think we did a
great<00:02:39.960> job<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.350> getting<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.490> best<00:02:41.670> at<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.940> car

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
great job of getting the best at the car

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.810 
great job of getting the best at the car
and<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.900> think<00:02:43.170> seconds<00:02:43.650> really<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:44.670> best

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
and I think seconds really the best

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.990 
and I think seconds really the best
result<00:02:45.150> would<00:02:45.210> come<00:02:45.450> away<00:02:45.600> with<00:02:46.880> so<00:02:47.880> I<00:02:47.910> think

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
result would come away with so I think

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.310 
result would come away with so I think
as<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.180> team<00:02:48.390> we<00:02:48.480> doing<00:02:48.630> a<00:02:48.690> great<00:02:48.840> job<00:02:48.870> I<00:02:49.140> just

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
as a team we doing a great job I just

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.090 
as a team we doing a great job I just
don't<00:02:49.470> think<00:02:49.650> we<00:02:49.740> quite<00:02:49.860> have<00:02:49.950> the

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
don't think we quite have the

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.240 
don't think we quite have the
performance<00:02:50.640> at<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.850> moment<00:02:51.210> and<00:02:52.070> it's<00:02:53.070> not<00:02:53.220> a

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
performance at the moment and it's not a

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.680 
performance at the moment and it's not a
long<00:02:53.580> way<00:02:53.790> away<00:02:53.910> from<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.210> red<00:02:54.390> ball<00:02:54.510> but

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
long way away from the red ball but

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.470 
long way away from the red ball but
there's<00:02:54.840> still<00:02:54.960> some<00:02:55.950> work<00:02:56.100> needed<00:02:56.460> we<00:02:57.360> have

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
there's still some work needed we have

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.030 
there's still some work needed we have
some<00:02:57.660> new<00:02:57.690> parts<00:02:58.020> coming<00:02:58.320> to<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.620> zucher

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
some new parts coming to the zucher

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.090 
some new parts coming to the zucher
which<00:02:59.370> will<00:02:59.490> hopefully<00:02:59.640> bridge<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.630> gap<00:03:01.100> and

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
which will hopefully bridge the gap and

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.550 
which will hopefully bridge the gap and
I<00:03:02.790> don't<00:03:03.060> know<00:03:03.150> how<00:03:03.330> hard<00:03:03.600> red<00:03:04.080> ball<00:03:04.290> pushing

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
I don't know how hard red ball pushing

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.810 
I don't know how hard red ball pushing
at<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:04.830> moment<00:03:05.130> because<00:03:05.340> they've<00:03:05.490> pretty

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
at the moment because they've pretty

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.390 
at the moment because they've pretty
much<00:03:05.910> wrapped<00:03:06.270> up<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.510> championship<00:03:07.020> so<00:03:07.860> it'd

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
much wrapped up the championship so it'd

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.530 
much wrapped up the championship so it'd
be<00:03:08.459> interesting<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.970> see<00:03:09.120> if<00:03:09.209> they<00:03:09.300> have<00:03:09.420> any

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
be interesting to see if they have any

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.270 
be interesting to see if they have any
new<00:03:09.660> parts<00:03:09.959> on<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.110> car<00:03:10.140> we<00:03:10.740> definitely<00:03:11.130> do

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
new parts on the car we definitely do

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.449 
new parts on the car we definitely do
and<00:03:11.490> it<00:03:11.580> should<00:03:11.900> should<00:03:12.900> bridge<00:03:13.740> that<00:03:13.950> gap<00:03:14.130> and

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
and it should should bridge that gap and

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.050 
and it should should bridge that gap and
help<00:03:15.060> us<00:03:15.240> challenge<00:03:15.450> for<00:03:15.720> victory
