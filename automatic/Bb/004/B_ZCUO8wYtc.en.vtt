00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.840
 bake forgiveness at 350 degrees by 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.329
 approximately 10 to 12 minutes as 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.040
 all like all cookies we're going to 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.040
 see how our mix goes 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.390
 absolutely everything was made of 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.190
 I remember that we have the processor 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.690
 always the knives and knives 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:23.290
 they go out of the sink 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.090
 how are we doing, what is good 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.300
 that today I have a good assistant the day 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.300
 from today 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:39.460
 so I'm going to lower the mix paris 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:42.190
 lower it and I'm going to beat a little bit more 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.950
 little bit more to take a more color 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.540
 pale and a little bit creamier and 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.600
 the crystals of sugar begin to 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:53.800
 break between the finer sugar 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.710
 much more crispy are those cookies 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.250
 we are going to add the egg so that 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.250
 incorporate 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.150
 and I'm going to refrigerate this dough 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.620
 about an hour I will tell you 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.060
 because it has a lot of butter and has 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.580
 a lot of fat that is not going to be given 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.640
 almonds ok I'm going to lower the mixture 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.010
 again rather rum you do not need 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.860

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:25.330
 true for carla and it's your mommy christmas 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:28.630

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.060
 all children help every day 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.290
 but the mix looks a little play thing 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.290
 absolutely nothing happens 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.310
 and now yes 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:43.040
 I'm going to download the version completely 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.489
 and I'm going to add all this mixture of one 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.489
 just hit 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.480
 We are making many presents 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.799
 Christmas are the first days of 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.140
 December so that you in your homes 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:57.469
 I can do them and I will discount them 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.599
 something people when we give away these 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:02.989
 small details like that you value it more 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.760
 that a gift that one is going to buy if 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.250
 you take the trouble to do it like 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.720
 which is how very rich these little ones 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.459
 details 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.470
 So if you have a heart tie 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.070
 Country remembers perfect touch I'll 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.930
 gift a tie 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.710
 I do not think that much progress has been made since 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.710
 camera but good 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:31.170
 Clearly not look so that 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.380
 put and I'm like this is a ball and 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.540
 this mix that I have here look at what 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.330
 soft if it 's too soft you have 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.000
 much much fat is not is 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.830
 sticky but anyway I'm going to 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.690
 put in the refrigerator but again 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.310
 comes to us in disk form since 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.230
 we have in shape is how I have it here 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.670
 I already have this inside the 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.530
 cement refrigerator about 30 minutes 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.220
 It has a slightly hard consistency 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.110
 we can see and I'm going to start cutting like this 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.640
 the cookies and to cut them as 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.800
 we always mention we put our 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.850
 cutter in enough flour and 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.770
 we started cutting 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.970
 so that it does not hit us if we do not 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.970
 we flours cows 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.990
 we have to look back the whole nasa 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.810
 rodrigo all truth there is no work 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:21.299
 double and it is very important 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.299
 you see how easy it is with the cutter 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.990
 I myself immediate external is very 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.200
 important also to leave them with certain 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.210
 from this certain distance not much though 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.010
 they will not expand much but certain 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.300
 distance please from each other to 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.419
 soon two or three centimeters 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.680
 so that they will not have us ok as 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.380
 you ended up making our cookies that 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.169
