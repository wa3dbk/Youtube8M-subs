00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.930
 welcome today we will learn to do 

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:09.690
 This pretty one that will serve us for a 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.000
 headband to put him as an entrepreneur in 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.830
 the hair on the clothes and what you 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.010
 want here I have it in a peak of 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.690
 heron and it's in these two models but 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.060
 let's learn how to do this time 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.769
 this and it is very simple very elegant and 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.140
 very easy to do let's see 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.289
 communication what we are going to occupy will be 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.390
 three strips of the ribbon in this case only 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.910
 have to contrast for example here 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.920
 I'm going to use red and white and one 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.469
 it has to be wider than the other in 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.260
 this case this is two and a half and the 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.719
 red measures one and a half each of the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.149
 strips measure 20 centimeters let's occupy 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.770
 also thread and needle in this case 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.789
 I should be white but because you 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.219
 you can notice 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.160
 I'm going to take the black and something to 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.280
 paste in the center to begin we're going to 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.930
 put our strip in this way and let's go 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.930
 to sew the ends 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.820
 now let's see what is the half that 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.200
 is this one here then we join and we will do 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:20.320
 the same 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.320
 we are going to sew in such a way 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.470
 that we can win 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.360
 here and now we are going to press like this 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:35.319
 and there we are going to tie a knot in the 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.770
 from behind and we make a knot we will do this 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:41.770
 same with the other two strips now that 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.590
 we already have the three little monkeys ready 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:48.969
 to place them in such a way that the three 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:54.149
 be as provided now we are going to 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:54.149
 pass the bid for the center of the three 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.890
 we search 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.380
 again in the middle 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.739
 well and we're going to give another one more pass for 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.739
 not 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:30.030
 now we make a knot we are and we are going to 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.030
 stick the center with a little silicone 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:40.630
 we paste from the center 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:43.690
 and is let 's put the nap petals 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.780
 and we have it ready now we can 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.810
 paste it on our headband to use it as 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.540
 pin or what we want here 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.900
 I also have another one ready that is the 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.540
 black and we can also use it they are already 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.130
 Ready to use is very simple and 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.260
 we can do it with the colors that 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.300
 we want, I hope I have you 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.880
