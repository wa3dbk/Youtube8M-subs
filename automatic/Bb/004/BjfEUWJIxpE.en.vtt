00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.510
 Hello and welcome to here 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:18.890
 my youtube channel to another 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:21.590
 movie about the dji phantom two yes today 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.070
 let's talk about how you care about it 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:27.619
 new transmitter with a new remote control 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.180
 you could connect your phantom 2 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.849
 speaks of pairing or too 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.739
 binding and how that works i want 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.170
 Show you today, for example 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.780
 could that be necessary if yours 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.109
 sender broke down here or you 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.440
 a new remote control with the phantom 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:47.600
 2 want to connect because of thom two 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.910
 which has a receiver of the 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.800
 based on the almost protocol of 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.620
 Futaba and that means you can 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.629
 actually almost every better one 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.690
 remote control of futaba without problems 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:03.909
 connect with the phantom 2 like this 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.909
 I can show you how to connect 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.010
 how the binding is going on is shown 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.570
 I now tell you about the food at 14 sg 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.820
 that is a very high quality 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.030
 remote control of food but the under 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.970
 also the almost protocol of the 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.130
 phantom two here supports that 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.650
 but the principle of finding works 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.930
 of course as well as here with the 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.700
 original remote control of deo the so 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.420
 if you have them you can do the same 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.040
 Action 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.050
 it is quite simple in principle 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.610
 made first of all the 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:50.860
 remote control on then you go and 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:52.540
 Do the guy's job when the phantom 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.729
 then it's up here then looks like this 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.920
 a hectic yellow flash that 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.800
 means that the yolk in the fail safe 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.810
 So no remote control is found 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.250
 yes is also clear the old one 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.650
 remote control with which he still 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.150
 this is tied off the new one 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.250
 we have already turned on that 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.230
 but he is not connected with that 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.820
 but there is another place where 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.910
 the head of the flashes and that is here 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.739
 a tiny hole on the side that 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.930
 but you only see it when I see the light 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.959
 always a bit turn off here 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.769
 then you can take such a yes one 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.510
 recognize small green flash and that 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.610
 is the point where the transmitter and the receiver 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.250
 can be reconnected with each other 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.690
 to make the needed her so here 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.420
 I take a heavy object 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.040
 now here this screwdriver 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.810
 and I push in here 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.470
 that's because it's the same time 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:48.130
 the limit switch then flashes red and stops 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.380
 then directly to red flashing and 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.420
 then shines permanently green and with it 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.440
 is the binding complete you have it 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.980
 also recognized 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.160
 here is the status led again 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.440
 has stopped the fans to signal 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.450
 So here is everything 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.940
 normal we are now in normal condition 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.650
 and the spark is now with the kopftor 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.540
 connected 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.400
 The whole thing slow and in the 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.150
 close here you can see the now 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.080
 switch with the led of the receiver 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.480
 you always have the status of 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.180
 the current connection status if 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.630
 This lamp shines red as here 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.400
 then that means the copter has no 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.380
 Remote control has found with the he 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.910
 he can work together then he is quasi 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.680
 in fail safe mode when we have our new one 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.470
 then switch on the remote control 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.390
 then the copter recognizes that one here 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.250
 remote control is available but he 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.020
 he also does not realize he is yet with this one 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.330
 Remote control connected and that 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.090
 he signals with a green flash 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.610
 is now almost ready for this 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.070
 connection process must next 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.650
 Then we have a sharp object in there 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.520
 insert the switch channel and the 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.090
 Press the button 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:04.880
 and as soon as we do that then it flashes 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.950
 the switch is red and that means that 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.110
 he is in the connection phase 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.720
 and now with the new one 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.290
 remote control connects that is now 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.840
 the case 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.209
 and as soon as this connection 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.010
 was performed and the cotta with the 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.130
 new remote control is connected then 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.110
 he shines permanently green that this 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.460
 connection process actually 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.580
 it worked out here now 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.610
 if I turn on the script here 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.680
 then you see that the gÃ¼mbel 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.560
 moved here and I tell them about it 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.910
 can align accordingly 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.830
 yes if the remote control then new 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.870
 bound then you have to do it again 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.520
 I will go into the system software here 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.130
 ever started and there the 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.430
 recalibrate remote control goes there 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.290
 in the area basic and then here 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.030
 tell the rider and then tell 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.130
 Do you see the command sticks here ? 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.169
 Calibration this area and there 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.970
 you have to click start 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.700
 and then if that did then 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.600
 you move all sides sticks 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:09.919
 once in all directions in all ends 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:13.340
 also the second and then presses 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:15.740
 Finnish then he comes here a message 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.410
 She just clicks away with tea and 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.450
 then place the thrust lever in the middle 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.190
 if he does not automatically and with you 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.710
 there is about as geo the 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:27.530
 Remote control must have all four controllers 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.470
 here on green if you are then 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.290
 as far as you have done then 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:35.260
 still the x1 channel calibrated clicks to it 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:37.360
 here on x1 calibration and then there 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.330
 on start and now you have to yours 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.250
 remote control the partial turn what the 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.070
 x1 channel regulates that is with me here 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.790
 above the once in both directions 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.280
 rotate 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.500
 where the tax is on the 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.000
 back yes a corresponding switch 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.190
 you then have to move back and forth 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.890
 and when you're done with it 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:06:00.490
 you also here in finnish then ask 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:03.910
 her the boat in the middle and then 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.810
 must also here the x1 sticks monitor on 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.520
 be green 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.260
 if you did that then it is 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.850
 the renovation completed and the 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.850
 remote control is to be re- established 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:17.380
 yes that was it from me like you 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.830
 such a great remote control as the 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:23.320
 food at 14 sg has to program around you 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.660
 here with the phantom compulsion to use 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.120
 I'll show you that in one 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.740
 my upcoming movies if this is you 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.090
 I liked the movie here then 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.950
 me of course, a nice 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.780
 comment down here a positive 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.430
 Assessment recommends me further and 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.680
 if they have not done it yet 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:41.860
 should you subscribe then you should 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:44.320
 have questions about the phantom 2 2 but without 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.030
 on other topics around multi copter 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:50.880
 then visit my forum in any case
