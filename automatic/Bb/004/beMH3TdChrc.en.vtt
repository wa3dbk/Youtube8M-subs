00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.560
 welcome the instructional video of 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.170
 Product applications to more garments 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.080
 This is our exclusive line of 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.359
 thermal insulators thermo fuse them in 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.699
 this opportunity we present you ice 

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:18.890
 latex fusion and we'll explain your 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.420
 correct installation in warehouses 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.610
 previously armed 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.800
 The first thing you have to do is 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.320
 unfold and tension strands of wire has 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.080
 organized every 40 centimeters of 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.200
 separation that will serve as support for 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.600
 the insulator to start with the 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.640
 installation on a flat surface 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.949
 you have to roll out an English roll 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.340
 texu sion taking into account the long 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:47.070
 of the skirt to cover then has 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.710
 that solar to the previous one a second roll 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.500
 so that we can get a 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.190
 welded panel 2 meters wide by 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.460
 the length of the room then they are long a 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.760
 third roll and a quarter to get a 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.540
 final cloth of 4 meters wide by the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.540
 length of the skirt 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.780
 but we recommend performing this function 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.360
 working between two people one 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.730
 person will hold the cloths keeping 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.740
 well together the edges and the other 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.710
 will perform welding with a pistol 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.100
 heat by pressing on a cloth or 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.220
 wet glove on the union you will perform 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.430
 this operation of 15 centimeters in 15 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.100
 centimeters this is a procedure that 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.230
 It is done very quickly 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.900
 advertising of the union seen from below 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.620
 it will depend on keeping well together 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.230
 the edges 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.390
 while soldering the membranes 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.000
 In order to avoid the loss of thickness 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.580
 by melting you should not apply the 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.680
 hot air over the foam is very 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.660
 important not to manipulate is the union 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.140
 until it has not cooled 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:00.680
 below 50 degrees Celsius 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.900
 in this way we will avoid burns a 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.200
 once this step is done you have to upload 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:11.110
 the roll and start with the assembly 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.120
 the installation is quite simple 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.790
 will display the scroll beyond soldier 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.800
 ejection of 4 meters wide by 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.080
 on top of the wire placed with 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.220
 prior to covering the whole 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.220
 of space 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.360
 this is one of the methods that you 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:34.459
 We propose to install the ejection 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.200
 in warehouses already armed ready that's all 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.930
 in this way your roof will remain 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.800
 thermally insulated for greater 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.130
