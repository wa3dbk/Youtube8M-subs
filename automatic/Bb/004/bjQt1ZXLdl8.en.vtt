Robbie's plastic cross front tech tip
just<00:01:31.229> check<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.860> stuff<00:01:32.479> well<00:01:33.479> that's<00:01:33.600> not

here<00:01:38.250> here<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.909> our<00:01:39.030> light<00:01:40.460> you<00:01:41.460> can<00:01:41.640> i'm

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
here here is our light you can i'm

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.580 
here here is our light you can i'm
guessing<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.600> can<00:01:42.780> adjust<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.229> handle<00:01:43.560> like

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
guessing you can adjust the handle like

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.490 
guessing you can adjust the handle like
that<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.369> can<00:01:44.460> carry<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.820> like<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.500> lock

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
that so you can carry it like that lock

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.950 
that so you can carry it like that lock
it<00:01:46.680> down<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:49.560> go<00:01:49.710> really<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.610> all<00:01:50.759> i<00:01:50.960> want

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
it down and go really that is all i want

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.469 
it down and go really that is all i want
to<00:01:52.049> do<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.579> I'm<00:01:53.579> going<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.820> do<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:53.970> video<00:01:54.119> later

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
to do is I'm going to do a video later

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.170 
to do is I'm going to do a video later
when<00:01:55.140> it's<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.350> bit<00:01:55.470> dark<00:01:55.710> up<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.700> use<00:01:56.939> these

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
when it's a bit dark up and use these

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.370 
when it's a bit dark up and use these
for<00:01:57.649> led<00:01:58.969> up<00:01:59.969> lighting<00:02:00.030> that's<00:02:00.960> what<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.140> made

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
for led up lighting that's what I made

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.539 
for led up lighting that's what I made
then<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.130> can<00:02:02.250> do<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.520> this<00:02:02.640> we<00:02:02.850> just<00:02:04.520> lock<00:02:05.520> it

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
then you can do to this we just lock it

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.949 
then you can do to this we just lock it
down

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.880 

but<00:02:10.959> maybe<00:02:11.110> lock<00:02:11.319> it<00:02:11.470> down<00:02:11.530> to<00:02:11.709> a<00:02:11.739> piece<00:02:11.860> of

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
but maybe lock it down to a piece of

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.589 
but maybe lock it down to a piece of
wood<00:02:12.010> or<00:02:12.310> something<00:02:12.489> so<00:02:13.239> it<00:02:13.300> doesn't<00:02:13.420> actually

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
wood or something so it doesn't actually

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.059 
wood or something so it doesn't actually
fall<00:02:14.050> over<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:15.629> fingerprint<00:02:16.629> flips<00:02:17.230> or

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
fall over the fingerprint flips or

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.199 
fall over the fingerprint flips or
fingerprints<00:02:18.640> on<00:02:18.730> it<00:02:20.129> upright<00:02:21.129> it<00:02:21.310> or<00:02:21.459> open

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209

for me was probably going to have it

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.070 
for me was probably going to have it
aiming<00:02:27.580> up<00:02:27.700> like<00:02:28.890> that's<00:02:29.890> somehow<00:02:30.190> but<00:02:30.670> anyway
