00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.590
 connected 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.090
 this should be correctly measured 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.250
 after all, even the 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.350
 highest quality receiver on the market only the 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.680
 power bring which the antenna

 allows for use from single to full 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.640
 the agus supports three plants like ip 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:13.720
 30 to version 1.2 as well as usals 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.640

 brilliant quality signals up to 10 80 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.720
 ii the argus like ip has one 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.390
 hdmi jack a matching hdmi cable 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.550
 is already in the scope of delivery 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.440
 the digital sound for the surround system 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.830
 can of course also about the 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.630
 optical was the coaxial spd fw 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.840
 output be tapped 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.690
 the commissioning of the argus as ip goes 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.420
 turn it on and start working 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.420
 thanks to the idea of ​​how ip services is

 and just by the hand 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.200
 up to 8000 senders can argus like ip 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.470
 manage 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.910
 the highest level of comfort is provided by the

 between broadcasters in standard resolution 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.220
 as well as between hdtv programs 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.350
 draw the set top box from a 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.150
 clear checklist shows when 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.130

 Also in terms of image quality is 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.850
 the argus like ip do not do half things 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.060
 satisfied because next to high-resolution 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.820
 HDTV programs will also be broadcast in 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.150
 standard resolution via the hdmi output 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:09.070
 up to 1080 ii extrapolated that 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.920
 result is a crisp picture 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.330
 with rich colors even the menus are

 Flat screen optimized in HD quality 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.989
 However, this quality requires 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.200
 necessarily the connection over the 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.970

 overview which show when and where 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.610
 the argus runs like ip is not 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.910
 only a receiver but on request also 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.370

 a usb speedtest in his software 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:25.190
 thus integrates it clearly with one look 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:28.100
 whether the usb stick or the hard disk 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:30.290
 criteria is sufficient for connected 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.720
 storage medium is sufficient pressure on the

 pausing a running broadcast 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.900
 For example, when the phone rings 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:56.420
 to then enter again seamlessly 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.880
