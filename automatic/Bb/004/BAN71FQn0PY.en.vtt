I<00:00:26.320> need<00:00:26.529> an<00:00:26.680> eraser<00:00:28.020> and<00:00:29.020> you<00:00:29.169> can<00:00:29.380> start<00:00:30.130> by

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
I need an eraser and you can start by

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.639 
I need an eraser and you can start by
just<00:00:31.660> drawing<00:00:32.020> a<00:00:32.470> simple<00:00:33.480> oval<00:00:34.480> at<00:00:34.810> a<00:00:35.230> slight

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:35.649 
just drawing a simple oval at a slight

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:41.250 
just drawing a simple oval at a slight
angle<00:00:36.780> like<00:00:37.780> so<00:00:38.170> and<00:00:39.690> connected<00:00:40.690> beneath<00:00:41.019> it

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
angle like so and connected beneath it

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.020 
angle like so and connected beneath it
you<00:00:41.469> could<00:00:41.620> draw<00:00:41.829> another<00:00:42.190> oval<00:00:42.579> which<00:00:42.820> will

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
you could draw another oval which will

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.270 
you could draw another oval which will
be<00:00:43.180> his<00:00:43.539> cheeks<00:00:45.269> like<00:00:46.269> that<00:00:46.480> and<00:00:47.260> for<00:00:48.190> the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
be his cheeks like that and for the

and<00:00:58.499> before<00:00:59.499> let's<00:00:59.710> just<00:00:59.949> draw<00:01:00.300> rectangles

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
and before let's just draw rectangles

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.829 
and before let's just draw rectangles
and<00:01:02.699> one<00:01:03.699> of<00:01:03.820> his<00:01:03.910> legs<00:01:04.089> bent<00:01:04.510> so<00:01:04.690> it'll<00:01:04.809> be

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
and one of his legs bent so it'll be

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.290 
and one of his legs bent so it'll be
smaller<00:01:05.230> rectangle<00:01:05.830> and<00:01:06.070> his<00:01:06.700> arms<00:01:07.120> are

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
rectangles as well and he's kind of like

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.120 
rectangles as well and he's kind of like
there's<00:01:10.690> a<00:01:10.810> sassy<00:01:12.360> pose<00:01:13.360> I<00:01:13.840> guess<00:01:14.290> hands<00:01:14.890> on<00:01:15.010> my

feet you could draw circles for the toe

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.250 
feet you could draw circles for the toe
part<00:01:30.220> and<00:01:30.550> connect<00:01:31.240> it<00:01:31.390> to<00:01:31.570> the<00:01:32.940> like<00:01:33.940> the<00:01:34.810> ears

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
part and connect it to the like the ears

diamonds<00:01:36.940> going<00:01:37.900> at<00:01:38.020> an<00:01:38.140> angle<00:01:38.590> toward<00:01:38.920> the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 
diamonds going at an angle toward the

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.780 
diamonds going at an angle toward the
way<00:01:39.220> his<00:01:39.550> head<00:01:39.820> is<00:01:39.940> tilted<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:42.400> know<00:01:42.550> that<00:01:42.700> we

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
way his head is tilted you know that we

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.100 
way his head is tilted you know that we
have<00:01:42.910> the<00:01:43.030> basic<00:01:43.360> shapes<00:01:43.600> we<00:01:43.720> could<00:01:43.900> start

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
have the basic shapes we could start

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.200 
have the basic shapes we could start
adding<00:01:44.530> more<00:01:44.950> detail<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:47.500> like<00:01:47.650> the<00:01:47.860> head<00:01:48.210> so

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
adding more detail to like the head so

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.870 
adding more detail to like the head so
you<00:01:49.810> get<00:01:49.960> your<00:01:49.990> up<00:01:50.200> I<00:01:50.350> like<00:01:50.620> defining<00:01:51.100> the<00:01:51.490> chin

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
you get your up I like defining the chin

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.920 
you get your up I like defining the chin
you<00:01:52.780> draw<00:01:53.140> circles<00:01:53.710> for<00:01:53.980> the<00:01:54.010> eyes<00:01:54.780> cuz<00:01:55.780> it

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
you draw circles for the eyes cuz it

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.900 
you draw circles for the eyes cuz it
ovals<00:01:56.350> like<00:01:56.590> that<00:01:56.830> you<00:01:57.520> could<00:01:57.670> draw<00:01:57.850> the

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
ovals like that you could draw the

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.860 
ovals like that you could draw the
guidelines<00:01:58.510> for<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:58.870> face<00:01:59.200> like<00:01:59.740> a<00:02:00.660> line<00:02:01.660> down

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
guidelines for the face like a line down

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.960 
guidelines for the face like a line down
the<00:02:01.930> center<00:02:02.200> and<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:03.010> direction<00:02:03.250> is<00:02:03.520> facing

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
the center and the direction is facing

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.840 
the center and the direction is facing
and<00:02:04.680> right<00:02:05.680> where<00:02:06.040> the<00:02:06.310> two<00:02:06.550> guidelines

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
and right where the two guidelines

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.440 
and right where the two guidelines
connect<00:02:07.540> will<00:02:08.080> be<00:02:08.319> his<00:02:08.470> nose<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:10.090> could<00:02:10.269> draw

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
connect will be his nose you could draw

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.120 
connect will be his nose you could draw
the<00:02:10.509> fur<00:02:11.110> on<00:02:11.470> these<00:02:11.950> on<00:02:12.610> his<00:02:12.910> cheeks<00:02:13.390> and<00:02:14.130> then

the fur on these on his cheeks and then

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.370 
the fur on these on his cheeks and then
though<00:02:15.400> these<00:02:15.700> kind<00:02:16.030> of<00:02:16.060> like<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.210> big<00:02:16.570> happy

smile

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.820 
smile
just<00:02:20.410> like<00:02:20.590> that<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.840> don't<00:02:23.440> forget<00:02:23.680> his

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
just like that and don't forget his

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.470 
just like that and don't forget his
teeth<00:02:24.100> and<00:02:24.819> his<00:02:25.030> tongue<00:02:25.300> where<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:28.209> then<00:02:28.360> you

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
teeth and his tongue where and then you

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.420 
teeth and his tongue where and then you
can<00:02:28.660> shoot<00:02:28.930> it<00:02:29.080> up<00:02:29.200> by<00:02:29.380> drawing<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.770> outline

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
can shoot it up by drawing the outline

think you would call it that and you

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.870 
think you would call it that and you
draw<00:02:38.020> the<00:02:38.080> you<00:02:38.620> find<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.130> rest<00:02:39.310> of<00:02:39.459> his<00:02:39.610> head
