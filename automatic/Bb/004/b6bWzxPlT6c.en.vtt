00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.890

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.840
 weapons and I the melee good 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.390

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.580
 and as already explained I will show the 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.010
 animations of firearms that 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.019
 they come in this pack before they start 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.320
 I must say that the installation was 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:03.260
 will show at the end of the video 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.540
 this is the new reload animation and 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.830
 of firing crouched with the revolver is 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.830
 a very good animation 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.830
 this is a new way of fastening 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:23.110
 shoot and reload the m4 and cap 47 the 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.360
 truth is a very good animation and with 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.640
 a touch more realism and also 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.380
 change the way you point with the sniper 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.810
 and the common rifle 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.060
 this is the new way of holding the 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.310
 combat shotgun will now fire 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.070
 supporting her on the shoulder instead of the 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.899
 waist as he did before how 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.659
 reload the common shotgun also 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.299
 change now instead of lifting it to 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.890
 reload after firing this reload 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.890
 while he keeps pointing 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.640
 well it's my turn there as you will see in 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.590
 the kickboxing changes at the end of the combo 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.860
 that instead of ending with a nudge 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.259
 ends with a headbutt in boxing as 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.720
 come here it's almost the same now instead 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.870
 to finish with a punch ends with 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.790
 a hook to the chin 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:15.739
 and in the cult as you will see is the one 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.260
 changes has the breasts show 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.030
 these also different animations 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.739
 can see in the yom actors to the 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.659
 time to make a video 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.760
 that's all from the body functions to 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.980

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.140

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.690

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.960

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.110

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.270
 you how it installs good to install it 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.000

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.430
 to open img files I would 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.800

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.910
 program then they go where they have 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.330
 kept his record from there they go to the 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.430
 folder models and open the gta 3 and mc 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.710
 now they give the little arrow pointing 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.470
 down they search where they kept their 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.960
 animations select them and give the 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.780
