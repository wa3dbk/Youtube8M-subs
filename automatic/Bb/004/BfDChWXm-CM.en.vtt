get it all really nice and combined and
then<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.439> put<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.709> back<00:01:52.799> on<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.069> heat<00:01:54.109> okay<00:01:55.109> so

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:55.169 
then I put it back on the heat okay so

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:56.870 
then I put it back on the heat okay so
you<00:01:55.380> want<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.709> have<00:01:55.889> some<00:01:56.130> water<00:01:56.340> boiling<00:01:56.669> or

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
you want to have some water boiling or

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.159 
you want to have some water boiling or
in<00:01:56.999> a<00:01:57.179> kettle<00:01:57.359> cause<00:01:57.630> it's<00:01:57.719> gonna<00:01:57.809> speed<00:01:58.049> up

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:58.169 
in a kettle cause it's gonna speed up

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:59.629 
in a kettle cause it's gonna speed up
the<00:01:58.229> whole<00:01:58.319> process<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:58.919> you<00:01:58.979> pour<00:01:59.249> it<00:01:59.399> into

00:01:59.629 --> 00:01:59.639 
the whole process so you pour it into

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:01.849 
the whole process so you pour it into
the<00:01:59.999> vegetables<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.929> want<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.169> cover<00:02:01.619> the

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:01.859 
the vegetables you want to cover the

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:03.949 
the vegetables you want to cover the
vegetables<00:02:02.059> essentially<00:02:03.059> and<00:02:03.389> as<00:02:03.809> you<00:02:03.899> can

00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:03.959 
vegetables essentially and as you can

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:06.289 
vegetables essentially and as you can
see<00:02:04.020> this<00:02:04.259> pot<00:02:04.469> is<00:02:04.619> too<00:02:04.649> small<00:02:05.219> but<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.270> know

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
see this pot is too small but you know

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.169 
see this pot is too small but you know
that's<00:02:06.840> all<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.079> had<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.289> had<00:02:07.859> to<00:02:07.979> make<00:02:08.129> do<00:02:08.340> just

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
that's all I had so had to make do just

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.750 
that's all I had so had to make do just
pour<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.569> all<00:02:09.689> the<00:02:09.869> way<00:02:09.959> in<00:02:10.110> there<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.760> then

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
pour it all the way in there and then

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.870 
pour it all the way in there and then
you<00:02:11.879> got<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.180> bring<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.659> the<00:02:12.780> boil

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
you got to bring it to the boil

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.430 
you got to bring it to the boil
well<00:02:14.210> first<00:02:14.510> before<00:02:14.660> you<00:02:14.840> do<00:02:14.930> that<00:02:15.080> you<00:02:15.170> put<00:02:15.200> in

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
well first before you do that you put in

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.700 
well first before you do that you put in
some<00:02:15.710> tin<00:02:15.980> tomatoes<00:02:16.490> and<00:02:16.700> go<00:02:16.790> just<00:02:16.970> one<00:02:17.090> tin

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
some tin tomatoes and go just one tin

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.530 
some tin tomatoes and go just one tin
low-sodium<00:02:18.710> organic<00:02:19.520> and<00:02:20.030> it<00:02:20.150> just<00:02:20.300> gives<00:02:20.450> it

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
low-sodium organic and it just gives it

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.870 
low-sodium organic and it just gives it
a<00:02:20.630> nice<00:02:20.750> color<00:02:21.050> a<00:02:21.260> nice<00:02:21.500> flavor<00:02:21.830> push<00:02:22.730> that

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
a nice color a nice flavor push that

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.240 
a nice color a nice flavor push that
around<00:02:26.560> so<00:02:27.560> then<00:02:27.680> you<00:02:27.740> want<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:27.920> bring<00:02:28.070> it<00:02:28.160> to

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
around so then you want to bring it to

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.740 
around so then you want to bring it to
the<00:02:28.340> boil<00:02:28.520> and<00:02:28.670> you<00:02:28.790> can<00:02:28.910> see<00:02:29.060> that<00:02:29.270> that<00:02:29.450> yeah

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
the boil and you can see that that yeah

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.330 
the boil and you can see that that yeah
it's<00:02:30.020> too<00:02:30.170> high<00:02:30.350> so<00:02:30.590> it's<00:02:30.710> kind<00:02:30.860> of<00:02:30.890> toil<00:02:31.160> over

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
it's too high so it's kind of toil over

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.180 
it's too high so it's kind of toil over
a<00:02:31.580> bit<00:02:31.760> but<00:02:32.390> um<00:02:32.690> that's<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.290> idea<00:02:33.620> get<00:02:34.100> it

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
a bit but um that's the idea get it

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.120 
a bit but um that's the idea get it
boiling<00:02:34.520> and<00:02:35.000> keep<00:02:35.180> it<00:02:35.300> boiling<00:02:35.540> for<00:02:36.010> you<00:02:37.010> know

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
boiling and keep it boiling for you know

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.730 
boiling and keep it boiling for you know
maybe<00:02:37.640> like<00:02:37.910> about<00:02:38.180> 15<00:02:38.900> minutes<00:02:39.170> or<00:02:39.320> so<00:02:39.470> you

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
maybe like about 15 minutes or so you

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.850 
maybe like about 15 minutes or so you
want<00:02:39.890> it<00:02:39.920> to<00:02:40.100> reduce<00:02:40.250> down<00:02:41.500> so<00:02:42.500> you<00:02:42.620> want<00:02:42.770> it<00:02:42.800> to

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
want it to reduce down so you want it to

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.710 
want it to reduce down so you want it to
boil<00:02:43.160> and<00:02:43.460> kind<00:02:43.760> of<00:02:43.820> simmer<00:02:44.150> and<00:02:44.330> then<00:02:44.390> you<00:02:44.570> add

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
boil and kind of simmer and then you add

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.570 
boil and kind of simmer and then you add
the<00:02:44.870> lentils<00:02:45.050> so<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:46.010> lentils<00:02:46.340> could<00:02:46.490> have

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
the lentils so the lentils could have

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.220 
the lentils so the lentils could have
been<00:02:46.730> added<00:02:47.030> maybe<00:02:47.300> a<00:02:47.480> little<00:02:47.810> bit<00:02:47.960> later

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
been added maybe a little bit later

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.050 
been added maybe a little bit later
because<00:02:48.830> they<00:02:48.980> kind<00:02:49.340> of<00:02:49.400> disintegrate<00:02:49.940> it

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
because they kind of disintegrate it

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.240 
because they kind of disintegrate it
into<00:02:50.270> nothing<00:02:50.420> but<00:02:51.010> that's<00:02:52.010> good<00:02:52.220> because

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
into nothing but that's good because

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.700 
into nothing but that's good because
they're<00:02:52.700> easier<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.090> digest<00:02:53.300> that<00:02:53.660> way<00:02:53.840> so

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
they're easier to digest that way so

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.220 
they're easier to digest that way so
just<00:02:54.740> push<00:02:55.040> them<00:02:55.220> in<00:02:55.430> there<00:02:55.640> ah

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
just push them in there ah

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.890 
just push them in there ah
super<00:02:57.740> super<00:02:57.890> yummy<00:02:58.340> it<00:02:58.940> was<00:02:59.090> really<00:02:59.390> good<00:02:59.600> no

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900

didn't even think I'm gonna put in these

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.630 
didn't even think I'm gonna put in these
veins<00:03:03.470> because<00:03:03.800> they're<00:03:03.920> like<00:03:04.160> really<00:03:04.550> really
