00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
manageable hair the hair about in here

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.240 
manageable hair the hair about in here
it's<00:01:49.740> probably<00:01:50.100> my<00:01:50.700> most<00:01:50.939> manageable<00:01:51.840> hair<00:01:52.320> so

it's probably my most manageable hair so

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.740 
it's probably my most manageable hair so
that<00:01:53.759> hair<00:01:55.460> it<00:01:56.460> may<00:01:56.969> be<00:01:57.030> late<00:01:57.360> easier<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:59.100> can

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
that hair it may be late easier I can

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.010 
that hair it may be late easier I can
twist<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:01.020> better<00:02:01.350> twist<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.430> faster<00:02:03.149> it's<00:02:03.719> not

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
twist it better twist it faster it's not

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.320 
twist it better twist it faster it's not
so<00:02:04.229> hard<00:02:04.530> on<00:02:04.770> my<00:02:04.950> head

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
so hard on my head

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.630 
so hard on my head
ends<00:02:05.480> so<00:02:06.110> that<00:02:06.140> hair<00:02:06.650> is<00:02:06.800> a<00:02:06.830> different<00:02:07.280> texture

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
ends so that hair is a different texture

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.840 
ends so that hair is a different texture
and<00:02:08.000> then<00:02:08.390> I<00:02:08.420> have<00:02:08.780> some<00:02:09.020> white<00:02:09.410> hair<00:02:09.830> right<00:02:10.640> in

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
and then I have some white hair right in

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.050 
and then I have some white hair right in
here<00:02:11.090> that<00:02:11.420> hair<00:02:11.810> is<00:02:12.020> very<00:02:12.310> very<00:02:13.310> taught<00:02:13.760> me<00:02:14.030> I

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
here that hair is very very taught me I

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.240 
here that hair is very very taught me I
hope<00:02:14.120> you<00:02:14.420> can<00:02:14.600> see<00:02:14.810> it's<00:02:15.410> right<00:02:15.680> in<00:02:15.920> this<00:02:16.070> area

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.790 
hope you can see it's right in this area
I<00:02:16.730> think<00:02:17.440> and<00:02:18.440> there<00:02:18.710> is<00:02:19.220> very<00:02:19.640> very<00:02:20.560> katni<00:02:21.560> and

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
I think and there is very very katni and

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.050 
I think and there is very very katni and
soft<00:02:22.250> so<00:02:23.150> if<00:02:23.750> I<00:02:24.170> twist<00:02:24.740> that<00:02:24.980> hair<00:02:25.310> or<00:02:25.460> load<00:02:25.700> it

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
soft so if I twist that hair or load it

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.980 
soft so if I twist that hair or load it
comes<00:02:26.690> a<00:02:26.990> list<00:02:27.320> very<00:02:27.770> quickly<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:28.760> I<00:02:29.540> have<00:02:29.780> to

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
comes a list very quickly and I have to

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.800 
comes a list very quickly and I have to
retwist<00:02:30.530> it<00:02:30.800> so<00:02:31.070> I<00:02:31.100> always<00:02:31.490> try<00:02:32.030> to<00:02:32.090> twist<00:02:32.510> that

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810
