00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.880
 what's going on from basket kiel 33 again 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.009
 here and there in the background you see a 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.980
 cheap domination gameplay on 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.100
 terminal with the acr in gold on it 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.059
 I packed the ropes too 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.190
 extended magazine 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.500
 i play with the turks raiders 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.329
 hardliner and then stalker with the 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.230
 special as always, of course, may there 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:51.559
 not missing the master marksman 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.969
 interview and dexterity yes to 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.559
 Bonn stairs here a bit and 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.320
 that's why I think here more or 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.170
 less if more or less mine 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.539
 position patrol a bit in the 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.670
 plane and outside of the plane though 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:08.810
 the gameplay is actually only for 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:11.450
 optical eye-catcher because word was yes 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.179
 The weapon looks mega funny from everything 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:19.100
 a little smaller on the weapon in the length 

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:20.869
 what is it that many will be drawn 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.049
 probably only from you pc 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.869
 know or the opc gameplays on 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:31.579
 youtube will also know it 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:34.729
 is the fv changer the people at the pc where 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:37.640
 think on the pc gamble or you 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:41.290
 use it because it seems like benefits 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.659
 brings and you just see more 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.840
 angel has been around for about three days 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.159
 now also for the ps3 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.560
 and yes you just have it 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.210
 larger field of view left or behind 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.549
 right 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:02:00.890
 you can see more of this map more from 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:02.390
 the mep and yes I just think it 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.009
 bit ugly that the weapons like that 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.289
 look funny but otherwise 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.289
 actually very close sm 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.310
 did you ever use the fv changer? 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.760
 if so then yes I could 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.400
 post in the comments and we 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.460
 probably also noticed 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.840
 There's always more hacker lobby in the mp3 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:32.370
 xp lobbies and every little pizza has in 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.750
 his shitty little tech xp 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.250
 question mark question mark question mark 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.490
 I can stand in the meantime 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.670
 is so open up that the little better 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:45.010
 franken always has the lobby blablabla 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.860
 just because they are too ugly to 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.330
 properly decent to level the puke 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.310
 I just have to have it now 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.220
 also within one day 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.740
 prestige and all without xp 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.220
 lobby and i do not know this is easy 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:02.530
 dishonest in my eyes but yes me 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:07.110
 I know again from the actual topic 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:10.420
 from what is actually fi yes that is 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.310
 field of view so you just look 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.540
 more like I have already described of 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:22.360
 the mep one has a larger field of view 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:26.740
 yes I think the fmo changer actually 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.210
 not so bad but yes I am the one 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.820
 opinion that one actually 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:34.330
 could draw relatively much benefits 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:37.150
 compared to other gamers still nothing 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.620
 heard of this effect angel 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.959
 or who do not play with it 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.500
 I think you just have a better one 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.900
 aim and the weapons have in so little 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.840
 recoil the acr for example in the 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.050
 you have no recoil the 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.000
 is really sick and yes I have to 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.530
 Now here's a quick say this is 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.070
 gameplay is still without the sv ried angel 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.350
 been earned 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.440
 yes, then you are probably asking a lot 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.240
 how did you come to this feature 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:12.820
 yes that was actually a very simple one 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:15.490
 thing a buddy of mine has the xbox 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.440
 written in morzg was a pc 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.280
 lobby in it but i can not do it 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.900
 be nobody 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.800
 so that too and watch my cinema mode 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:28.090
 say I grab my ps3 fox and 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:30.310
 his cinema fashion and season are with him 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.660
 the weapons like the pc and so think me 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.730
 there was nothing to play a few rounds then 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:37.690
 everything works with me that way 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:40.270
 the dtmf changer activates a once 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.669
 video in any online store of 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.990
 A friend sows it will be with you too 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:45.970
 so 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.200
 and yes therefore this is gameplay so 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.030
 been recorded 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.810
 because my whole cinema mode and mine too 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.550
 online store floor gives changed and 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.030
 yes and that's why I thought so yes 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:01.419
 then I'll grab the right one 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:03.370
 theme out there and yes I think so 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.620
 actually from fv changer I told you so 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.300
 already briefly mentioned I find the fc 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.490
 Chelsea is not that bad 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.320
 because I think you move now 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.419
 not so much benefit from it 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.040
 personally have up yet again 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:18.520
 Deactivated I better come without a problem 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.800
 the fv tschentscher but I am yes 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.479
 matter of opinion that just something with 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.850
 getting used to it has to be done 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.740
 you got used to the fmo changer 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:30.070
 determines that I'm really sick 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.000
 pals main all year again with the 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.430
 it is much better 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.070
 I think the other way but that can 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.720
 everyone decide for themselves 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.440
 you can tell me in the comments 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:43.360
 Write what you get from the exchange 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.919
 and whether you think that's it 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:49.750
 hack is or whether one from it now 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:51.400
 advantage or no advantage whether it 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.050
 good or bad that would be me 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.310
 just interested 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:59.530
 and yes on the xbox will be this feature 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.500
 probably do not occur for the 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.940
 xbox zocke there everything very much 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.760
 is secured and it is difficult there 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.740
 So what to pack on and ask now 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:12.039
 you determined yes how do you get the 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:15.039
 fv he change away again yes that's all 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:17.140
 you just have to either 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:20.669
 completely unsubscribe the game left 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:23.080
 mw3 or just go to mp3 main menu 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:26.169
 and then again in online games 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:29.110
 go in then you have the fv changer 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:31.150
 also deactivated again and here 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.040
 my gameplay ends already 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:35.010
 I hope my babble has you 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.840
 Please have informed you if you 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.370
 tutorial to the fvw changer want 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.640
 Just write in the comments 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:46.260
 the game ends with a 243 2 many 

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.260
 Thanks for listening until next time
