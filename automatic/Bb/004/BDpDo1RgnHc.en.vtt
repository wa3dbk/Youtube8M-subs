00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
back I actually have to push down on the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.120 
back I actually have to push down on the
bolt<00:01:47.060> catch<00:01:47.240> and<00:01:47.930> order<00:01:48.260> for<00:01:48.470> it<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:48.590> catch<00:01:48.860> the

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
bolt catch and order for it to catch the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.070 
bolt catch and order for it to catch the
invitation<00:01:49.580> bolt<00:01:49.850> and<00:01:50.090> then<00:01:50.510> I<00:01:50.570> can<00:01:50.840> release

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
invitation bolt and then I can release

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.200 
invitation bolt and then I can release
it<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:51.650> vfc<00:01:52.100> gun<00:01:52.310> is<00:01:52.520> a<00:01:52.550> little<00:01:52.940> bit<00:01:53.060> more

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
it the vfc gun is a little bit more

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.120 
it the vfc gun is a little bit more
realistic<00:01:53.390> and<00:01:53.930> that<00:01:54.140> the<00:01:54.890> catch<00:01:55.100> is

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
realistic and that the catch is

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.770 
realistic and that the catch is
automatic<00:01:55.850> I<00:01:55.970> don't<00:01:56.150> have<00:01:56.210> to<00:01:56.300> push<00:01:56.510> down<00:01:56.540> on

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
automatic I don't have to push down on

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.570 
automatic I don't have to push down on
it<00:01:56.990> all<00:01:57.350> I<00:01:57.500> have<00:01:57.650> to<00:01:57.710> do<00:01:57.830> is<00:01:57.920> push<00:01:58.190> it<00:01:58.340> to

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
it all I have to do is push it to

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.630 
it all I have to do is push it to
release<00:01:58.970> it<00:01:59.180> so<00:01:59.830> little<00:02:00.830> extra<00:02:01.100> feature<00:02:01.310> there

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
release it so little extra feature there

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.390 
release it so little extra feature there
a<00:02:01.670> little<00:02:01.910> extra<00:02:02.240> realism<00:02:02.540> from<00:02:02.750> BFC<00:02:03.220> both<00:02:04.220> of

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
a little extra realism from BFC both of

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.150 
a little extra realism from BFC both of
these<00:02:04.460> guns<00:02:04.730> have<00:02:05.060> the<00:02:05.330> standard<00:02:05.690> m4<00:02:05.930> le<00:02:06.680> stock

these guns have the standard m4 le stock

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.619 
these guns have the standard m4 le stock
but<00:02:07.520> one<00:02:07.730> thing<00:02:07.970> that<00:02:08.000> you<00:02:08.149> wouldn't<00:02:08.450> notice

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
but one thing that you wouldn't notice

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.119 
but one thing that you wouldn't notice
by<00:02:08.929> looking<00:02:09.229> at<00:02:09.319> it<00:02:09.500> is<00:02:09.619> that<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:09.920> classic

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
by looking at it is that the classic

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:11.830 
by looking at it is that the classic
Reimer<00:02:10.399> stock<00:02:10.610> actually<00:02:10.970> has<00:02:11.120> six<00:02:11.360> position

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
Reimer stock actually has six position

position you can see the barrels are

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.980 
position you can see the barrels are
about<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.500> same<00:02:32.680> height<00:02:33.030> likewise<00:02:34.030> the

about the same height likewise the

are<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.480> same<00:02:37.870> length<00:02:38.620> so<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.730> BFC<00:02:40.120> has<00:02:40.360> less

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570

guns<00:02:47.650> are<00:02:47.770> very<00:02:47.890> similar<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.610> vfc<00:02:48.940> is<00:02:49.000> a

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
guns are very similar the vfc is a

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.610 
guns are very similar the vfc is a
little<00:02:49.239> more<00:02:49.300> expensive<00:02:49.600> at<00:02:49.959> ten<00:02:50.260> dollars

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
little more expensive at ten dollars

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.770 
little more expensive at ten dollars
they<00:02:50.800> perform<00:02:51.310> very<00:02:51.820> similar<00:02:52.270> as<00:02:52.420> well<00:02:52.600> they

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
they perform very similar as well they

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.020 
they perform very similar as well they
both<00:02:52.959> shoot<00:02:53.140> 400<00:02:53.709> FPS<00:02:53.860> let's<00:02:54.550> go<00:02:54.640> out<00:02:54.790> and<00:02:54.880> find

both shoot 400 FPS let's go out and find

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.880 
both shoot 400 FPS let's go out and find
out<00:02:55.150> what<00:02:55.270> the<00:02:55.390> rate<00:02:55.540> of<00:02:55.570> fire<00:02:55.810> is<00:02:55.840> like<00:02:56.200> after

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
out what the rate of fire is like after

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.229 
out what the rate of fire is like after
that<00:02:57.070> we'll<00:02:57.370> interview<00:02:57.640> some<00:02:57.910> of<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.060> guys

that we'll interview some of the guys
here<00:02:58.480> at<00:02:58.570> airsoft<00:02:58.810> GI<00:02:59.050> and<00:02:59.260> find<00:02:59.440> out<00:02:59.530> what

here at airsoft GI and find out what
they<00:02:59.770> think<00:03:00.040> about<00:03:00.100> these<00:03:00.370> two<00:03:00.550> guns

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.510 

all<00:03:12.650> right<00:03:12.770> now<00:03:12.890> we've<00:03:13.040> already<00:03:13.220> established

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
all right now we've already established

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.120 
all right now we've already established
that<00:03:14.090> these<00:03:14.300> guns<00:03:14.570> are<00:03:14.840> very<00:03:15.170> similar<00:03:15.590> they

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
that these guns are very similar they

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.490 
that these guns are very similar they
shoot<00:03:16.400> very<00:03:16.730> similar<00:03:17.150> FPS<00:03:17.630> as<00:03:18.020> well<00:03:18.200> around

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
shoot very similar FPS as well around

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.650 
shoot very similar FPS as well around
four<00:03:18.860> hundred<00:03:18.890> or<00:03:19.370> so<00:03:19.400> one<00:03:20.240> thing<00:03:20.390> that<00:03:20.570> we

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
four hundred or so one thing that we

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.960 
four hundred or so one thing that we
don't<00:03:20.840> know<00:03:21.050> yet<00:03:21.350> is<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:22.070> rate<00:03:22.250> of<00:03:22.280> fire<00:03:22.640> as

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
don't know yet is the rate of fire as

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.240 
don't know yet is the rate of fire as
far<00:03:23.180> back<00:03:23.360> as<00:03:23.420> I<00:03:23.690> can<00:03:23.720> remember<00:03:23.900> vfc<00:03:24.830> guns<00:03:25.040> have

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
far back as I can remember vfc guns have

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.400 
far back as I can remember vfc guns have
always<00:03:25.550> had<00:03:25.730> a<00:03:26.030> little<00:03:26.600> higher<00:03:26.840> rate<00:03:27.080> of<00:03:27.110> fire

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
always had a little higher rate of fire

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.020

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
them which would it be uh well I'd have

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.500 
them which would it be uh well I'd have
to<00:03:57.620> say<00:03:57.740> the<00:03:57.860> vfc<00:03:58.250> does<00:03:58.459> look<00:03:58.730> better<00:03:58.880> but<00:03:59.450> I

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
to say the vfc does look better but I

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.699 
to say the vfc does look better but I
would<00:03:59.630> personally<00:03:59.780> go<00:03:59.959> to<00:04:00.110> the<00:04:00.200> classic<00:04:00.530> army

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
mostly because it is a little bit

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
go with the BF see myself and why I

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.590 
go with the BF see myself and why I
mainly<00:05:15.370> because<00:05:15.610> I've<00:05:15.880> had<00:05:15.910> the<00:05:16.150> chance<00:05:16.180> to

mainly because I've had the chance to

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.470 
mainly because I've had the chance to
open<00:05:16.900> both<00:05:17.050> guns<00:05:17.410> and<00:05:17.770> the<00:05:18.610> BFC<00:05:19.000> actually<00:05:19.360> has

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
open both guns and the BFC actually has

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.200 
open both guns and the BFC actually has
far<00:05:19.780> better<00:05:19.810> internals<00:05:20.500> than<00:05:20.710> CA<00:05:21.040> does<00:05:21.400> also

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
outside of the ca I think I'd have to go

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
outside of the ca I think I'd have to go
with<00:05:26.620> the<00:05:26.800> vfc<00:05:27.340> and<00:05:27.750> why<00:05:29.190> real<00:05:30.190> absolute

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
with the vfc and why real absolute

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.270 
with the vfc and why real absolute
realism<00:05:31.000> is<00:05:31.390> big<00:05:31.630> for<00:05:31.870> me<00:05:31.990> in<00:05:32.200> terms<00:05:32.890> of<00:05:33.100> how<00:05:33.250> I

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
realism is big for me in terms of how I

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.090 
realism is big for me in terms of how I
play<00:05:33.640> airsoft<00:05:33.850> I<00:05:34.720> do<00:05:35.320> like<00:05:35.620> that<00:05:35.770> is<00:05:35.920> a<00:05:35.950> little

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100

and<00:06:41.110> I've<00:06:41.680> also<00:06:41.770> had<00:06:42.040> the<00:06:42.160> opportunity<00:06:42.220> to<00:06:42.610> see

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:42.820 
and I've also had the opportunity to see

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.090 
and I've also had the opportunity to see
both<00:06:43.030> internals<00:06:43.720> side<00:06:44.320> by<00:06:44.470> side<00:06:44.710> so<00:06:44.860> I<00:06:44.919> would

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:45.100 
both internals side by side so I would

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.650 
both internals side by side so I would
choose<00:06:45.220> the<00:06:45.370> BFC<00:06:45.760> the<00:06:45.880> final<00:06:46.150> choice<00:06:46.300> is<00:06:46.330> going

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:46.660 
choose the BFC the final choice is going

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.120 
choose the BFC the final choice is going
to<00:06:46.720> be<00:06:46.840> up<00:06:46.960> to<00:06:47.110> you<00:06:47.260> though<00:06:47.470> hopefully<00:06:47.890> you
