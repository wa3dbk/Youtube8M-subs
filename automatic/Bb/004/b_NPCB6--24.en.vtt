must make sure to put it on guide
partition<00:02:46.300> table<00:02:46.930> then<00:02:47.830> you<00:02:48.010> hit<00:02:48.190> ok<00:02:48.670> and<00:02:49.110> you

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.070 
course it's a mac OSX journal petition
and<00:02:59.140> then<00:02:59.680> we<00:03:00.040> just<00:03:00.280> hit<00:03:00.430> apply<00:03:00.850> this<00:03:01.690> will<00:03:01.930> go

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
and then we just hit apply this will go

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.920 
and then we just hit apply this will go
pretty<00:03:02.350> fast<00:03:02.710> and<00:03:03.070> then<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:05.080> stick<00:03:05.380> will<00:03:06.010> be

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
pretty fast and then the stick will be

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.040 
pretty fast and then the stick will be
partition<00:03:07.930> field<00:03:08.940> could<00:03:09.940> not<00:03:10.180> unmount<00:03:10.750> the

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
partition field could not unmount the

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:20.240 
partition field could not unmount the
disk

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.430 

okay<00:03:21.030> then<00:03:21.870> just<00:03:22.860> pull<00:03:23.100> it<00:03:23.250> out<00:03:23.460> and<00:03:24.290> put<00:03:25.290> it

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
okay then just pull it out and put it

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.090 
okay then just pull it out and put it
into<00:03:25.820> another<00:03:27.200> USB<00:03:28.200> ports<00:03:28.770> whatever<00:03:30.680> here<00:03:31.680> you

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
into another USB ports whatever here you

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:43.230 
into another USB ports whatever here you
have<00:03:32.190> another<00:03:32.490> one<00:03:32.700> so<00:03:33.420> cool

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.760 

so<00:03:44.230> there<00:03:44.440> it<00:03:44.560> is<00:03:44.590> again<00:03:45.300> so<00:03:46.300> this<00:03:46.660> is<00:03:46.810> a<00:03:46.840> the

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
so there it is again so this is a the

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.590 
so there it is again so this is a the
lexer<00:03:48.310> so<00:03:49.000> let's<00:03:49.570> partition<00:03:50.170> her<00:03:50.380> again<00:03:51.600> we're

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
lexer so let's partition her again we're

00:03:52.600 --> 00:04:00.530 
lexer so let's partition her again we're
going<00:03:52.720> to<00:03:52.840> create<00:03:53.050> one<00:03:53.380> partition<00:03:55.320> installer

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.320 

options<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:02.050> guide<00:04:02.680> to<00:04:02.950> show<00:04:03.250> so<00:04:04.350> apply

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
options a guide to show so apply

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:14.910 
options a guide to show so apply
partition

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.729 

so<00:04:15.550> you<00:04:16.359> can<00:04:16.540> see<00:04:16.720> that<00:04:16.750> my<00:04:17.019> temperature<00:04:17.530> here

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
so you can see that my temperature here

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.390 
so you can see that my temperature here
is<00:04:17.769> going<00:04:18.280> up<00:04:18.459> to<00:04:18.489> 72<00:04:19.359> degrees<00:04:20.100> so<00:04:21.100> this<00:04:21.370> is

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
is going up to 72 degrees so this is

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.490 
is going up to 72 degrees so this is
also<00:04:21.730> getting<00:04:22.090> pretty<00:04:22.419> warm<00:04:22.660> I<00:04:22.900> never<00:04:23.169> saw<00:04:23.470> it

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
also getting pretty warm I never saw it

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.620 
also getting pretty warm I never saw it
because<00:04:24.040> I<00:04:24.070> never<00:04:24.280> installed<00:04:25.000> this<00:04:25.210> little

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
because I never installed this little

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.040 
because I never installed this little
smc<00:04:26.230> program<00:04:26.710> until<00:04:27.070> yesterday<00:04:27.630> okay<00:04:28.630> so<00:04:28.690> now

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
smc program until yesterday okay so now

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.080 
smc program until yesterday okay so now
we<00:04:29.110> created<00:04:29.919> the<00:04:30.010> Installer<00:04:30.520> here<00:04:30.820> you<00:04:30.910> can

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090

we created the Installer here you can
see<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.389> installer<00:04:31.870> so<00:04:32.800> what<00:04:33.610> will<00:04:33.760> we<00:04:33.880> do<00:04:34.030> now

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
see the installer so what will we do now

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.750 
see the installer so what will we do now
well<00:04:34.510> it's<00:04:34.780> really<00:04:35.560> easy<00:04:35.889> we<00:04:36.370> will<00:04:36.520> select

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
well it's really easy we will select

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.710 
well it's really easy we will select
restore<00:04:37.710> here<00:04:38.710> on<00:04:38.919> top<00:04:39.130> so<00:04:39.940> what<00:04:40.270> is<00:04:40.450> the

installer<00:04:56.729> here<00:04:58.380> you<00:04:59.380> see<00:04:59.530> that<00:04:59.710> peeps<00:04:59.950> and

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
installer here you see that peeps and

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.930 
installer here you see that peeps and
then<00:05:01.240> we<00:05:01.419> just<00:05:01.630> hit<00:05:01.780> restore<00:05:02.320> and<00:05:02.650> if<00:05:03.639> you<00:05:03.790> do

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
then we just hit restore and if you do

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:10.830 
then we just hit restore and if you do
this<00:05:04.090> with<00:05:04.300> adjustment<00:05:04.979> with<00:05:05.979> adjustment<00:05:09.840> dmg

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
this with adjustment with adjustment dmg

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.560 
this with adjustment with adjustment dmg
then<00:05:11.500> first<00:05:11.860> it<00:05:12.070> will<00:05:12.280> start<00:05:12.729> scanning<00:05:13.180> it

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
then first it will start scanning it

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.090 
then first it will start scanning it
will<00:05:13.870> start<00:05:14.139> scanning<00:05:14.500> the<00:05:14.889> whole<00:05:15.070> the<00:05:15.760> whole

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
will start scanning the whole the whole

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.330 
will start scanning the whole the whole
yeah<00:05:18.100> a<00:05:18.310> file<00:05:18.970> for<00:05:19.960> errors<00:05:20.320> and<00:05:20.590> then<00:05:20.830> it<00:05:21.070> will

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
yeah a file for errors and then it will

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.790 
yeah a file for errors and then it will
start<00:05:21.669> copying<00:05:22.150> after<00:05:22.690> that<00:05:22.870> it<00:05:23.320> might<00:05:23.590> go

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
start copying after that it might go

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.529 
start copying after that it might go
wrong<00:05:23.830> the<00:05:24.280> first<00:05:24.490> time<00:05:24.669> just<00:05:24.820> try<00:05:25.300> it<00:05:25.360> again

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
wrong the first time just try it again

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:29.310 
wrong the first time just try it again
and<00:05:25.990> you<00:05:26.530> know<00:05:26.680> it<00:05:26.919> will<00:05:27.130> then<00:05:27.400> go<00:05:27.640> right<00:05:27.970> so<00:05:28.960> or

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
and you know it will then go right so or

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.740 
and you know it will then go right so or
just<00:05:29.740> change<00:05:30.070> USB<00:05:30.610> ports<00:05:31.000> sometimes<00:05:31.419> you<00:05:31.570> must

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
just change USB ports sometimes you must

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.469 
just change USB ports sometimes you must
change<00:05:31.930> the<00:05:32.229> USB<00:05:32.650> port<00:05:32.950> because<00:05:33.760> one<00:05:34.030> port<00:05:34.330> is

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 
change the USB port because one port is

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:36.659 
change the USB port because one port is
faster<00:05:35.110> than<00:05:35.289> the<00:05:35.410> other<00:05:35.560> you<00:05:35.860> know<00:05:35.890> just<00:05:36.520> do

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669 
faster than the other you know just do

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.670 
faster than the other you know just do
that<00:05:36.820> and<00:05:37.060> try<00:05:37.300> again<00:05:37.450> you<00:05:38.229> know<00:05:38.350> you<00:05:38.410> will
