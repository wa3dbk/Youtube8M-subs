00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.429 
simple we have a sterile text which
tells<00:00:18.840> if<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:20.270> server<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.449> observing<00:00:22.350> your

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
tells if the server is observing your

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.939 
tells if the server is observing your
gestures<00:00:22.920> not<00:00:23.330> then<00:00:24.330> we<00:00:24.570> can<00:00:24.750> have<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.470> button

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
gestures not then we can have a button

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.429 
gestures not then we can have a button
that<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.369> can<00:00:26.640> stop<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.119> start<00:00:27.660> observation

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
that you can stop and start observation

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.160 
that you can stop and start observation
and<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:29.310> button<00:00:29.640> called<00:00:29.670> my<00:00:30.119> moves<00:00:30.359> which<00:00:30.900> shows

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
and a button called my moves which shows

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.100 
and a button called my moves which shows
the<00:00:31.199> list<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.769> available<00:00:32.009> gestures<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.110> which

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
the list of available gestures and which

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.430 
the list of available gestures and which
application<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:34.950> run<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.370> its<00:00:35.579> gesture<00:00:36.230> so<00:00:37.230> for

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
application is run on its gesture so for

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.990 
application is run on its gesture so for
example<00:00:37.530> if<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.040> want<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.280> change<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.790> calendar

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
example if I want to change the calendar

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.369 
example if I want to change the calendar
here<00:00:40.190> so<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.340> would<00:00:41.550> open<00:00:41.930> something<00:00:42.930> else

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
here so it would open something else

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.380 
here so it would open something else
instead<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:44.100> don't<00:00:44.700> change<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.180> for<00:00:45.329> example

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
instead I don't change it to for example

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.619 
instead I don't change it to for example
which<00:00:46.079> it's<00:00:46.260> gallery<00:00:46.590> now<00:00:47.399> when<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.610> swipe<00:00:48.390> up

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
which it's gallery now when I swipe up

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.569 
which it's gallery now when I swipe up
with<00:00:48.840> two<00:00:49.020> fingers<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.860> should<00:00:50.100> open<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
with two fingers it should open the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.299 
with two fingers it should open the
widgets<00:00:51.180> gallery<00:00:51.559> so<00:00:52.559> let's<00:00:52.800> see<00:00:53.010> how<00:00:53.160> this

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
widgets gallery so let's see how this

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.920 
widgets gallery so let's see how this
thing<00:00:53.670> works<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:54.210> practice<00:00:56.270> swiping<00:00:57.270> up<00:00:57.390> with

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
thing works in practice swiping up with

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.170 
thing works in practice swiping up with
two<00:00:58.140> fingers<00:00:58.370> gives<00:00:59.370> me<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.850> eats<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.480> gallery

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
two fingers gives me the eats it gallery

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.039 
two fingers gives me the eats it gallery
then<00:01:03.180> swiping<00:01:03.979> down<00:01:04.979> with<00:01:05.580> two<00:01:05.760> fingers<00:01:06.049> gives

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
then swiping down with two fingers gives

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.890 
then swiping down with two fingers gives
me<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.439> clock<00:01:08.330> and<00:01:10.310> swiping<00:01:11.310> left<00:01:11.630> gives<00:01:12.630> me

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
me the clock and swiping left gives me

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.210 
me the clock and swiping left gives me
the<00:01:13.049> contacts<00:01:15.830> starting<00:01:16.830> right<00:01:17.119> gives<00:01:18.119> me

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
the contacts starting right gives me

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.710 
the contacts starting right gives me
conversations<00:01:22.130> making<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.280> Z<00:01:23.580> gives<00:01:24.390> me<00:01:24.659> the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
conversations making a Z gives me the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.740 
conversations making a Z gives me the
feeds

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.660 

making<00:01:29.750> an<00:01:29.900> inn<00:01:30.170> gives<00:01:30.770> me<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:31.280> gallery<00:01:31.909> and

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670
