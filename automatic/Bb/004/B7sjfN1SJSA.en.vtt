00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.940
 nelson rockefeller 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.190
 here our 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.410
 mysterious and the metropolis 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:17.719
 a loving man 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.719
 designers on the river 400,000 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.369
 he is very interested in knowing 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:28.300
 in 1938 date 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.990
 because it was the first 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.000
 the attic with an airplane or approaching 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.550
 pretty to the arctic and cross it with 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.290
 also if it came to the area to the area 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.370
 totally polar of 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.370
 then I can not 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.020
 38 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:51.700
 it's called germany for a series of 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.070
 Antarctic explorers 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:58.620
 I had planned to make a 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.620
 expedition to Norway of which they spoke 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.309
 these 84 people gathered 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.980
 and there was less of what we wanted 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.990
 it's true 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:17.189
 the state aircraft made 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.189
 all this data 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.690
 but a leak about anything in 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.570
 that of the author 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.830
 the Germans said when what they had 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.830
 done the exploration methods 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.610
 the logos said good that we've 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.150
 wrong to autograph the activity 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.150
 do not 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.120
 actually because they come to fake 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.440
 maps of antarctica for messi 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.080
 the Germans 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.600
 Y 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.460
 the controls of the new ones showed with 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.799
 we appeared 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.250
 simply because of the question of 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.920
 connection to annexing that 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.890
 kind of 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.159
 of issues 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:09.729
 it was high rating with everything they found 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:12.740
 and the vast areas free prospections 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.330
 of ice as vegetation 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.520
 and please 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.110
 in an area where high temperatures 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.110
 with 50 66 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.860
 those little oases 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.040
 where they had arrived with wide 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.270
 building 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.460
 later to be informed 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.460
 and you all know how he has done it before 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.060
 I would like in the series of statements 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:47.510
 richard among other things also sons 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.040
 I would like to see before dying 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.849
 again that land that extends 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.849
 beyond 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.290
 land 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:06.109
 and also the speech of that land that 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.109
 reflected in the heavens 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.330
 here he was referring 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.330
 the look is made maybe 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.060
 it's an age 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.880
 of the Antarctic 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.500
 when the artificial satellites 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.470
 who make photographs of the 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.670
 surface of the earth and on them 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.540
 for example 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.540
 5 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.160
 do not think that all the tables 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.840
 consecutive 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.360
 these are nice 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.880
 to find 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.360
 and within those few bands that we 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.430
 show 2 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:53.920
 you can see those two signs 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:57.099
 those two societies and in one 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.360
 totally artificial mechanism not 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:02.750
 it seems too natural 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.370
 It's all I have 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.100
 but let a little back to 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:11.530
 maybe there is a subject of the click 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:14.990
 I have not spoken about this land 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.840
 it is a land that shows us the 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:20.109
 gravitational anomalies that are being 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.900
 producing on earth 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.419
 measures in my life 2 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.400
 because some sites for the truth is 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:30.720
 denser than in others 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.720
 and even within zones 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:37.780
 and that detachable gravity is variable 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:40.639
 there are important operations 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.560
 you have the gravity does not weigh what 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.870
 same because 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.080
 Australia 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:50.220
 does not weigh the same to the east of South America 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.220
 that at the same time 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.980
 and the differences are very harassed 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:05:00.750
 they are well beyond what they eat 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.920
 and that can influence the 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.169
 per day 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:11.419
 this is Mr. William or 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:13.720
 he wrote a book entitled The 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:17.190
 ghosts of the bulls 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.970
 and then comment 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.970
 until then 

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:26.059
 on the foundations constructions 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.059
 polar of the inverses 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.729
 of the primer is people who 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.700
 venture after 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:33.290
 and among those issues 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.280
 control many anomalies I made a 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:38.440
 small compilation 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.389
 and a series of questions many of them 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.080
 with all those questions that I am going to 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:45.699
 counted 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:49.030
 to you for example if the earth is not 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:51.310
 hollow because the north wind in the 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:55.830
 Arctic gets warmer as you 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.830
 one navigates beyond latitude 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:01.219
 and so that really the temperature of 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.330
 been and yet is not the 

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:07.830
 temperature increases 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:10.620
 to 500 of nortec goodbye and open sea to what 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:13.760
 long hundreds of kilometers 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.760
 82 unemployed 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.490
 there is rather the outer belt than the 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:21.180
 crown 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:23.550
 is to be the contrary 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.860
 because those customers transport dust 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.539
 where they allegedly lied to dust 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.500
 of land if you want to tell me day 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:30.500
 because there is dust 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:37.240
 after reaching the 32 82 degrees 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:43.860
 because the muscle will be the one that heats 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:43.860
 where is the ground 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:52.110
 continue counting 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:58.080
 because they carry branches, trunks and cabbages 

00:06:55.509 --> 00:06:58.080
 some food 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.320
 because millions of micro panda birds 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.360
 because week we are 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.930
 because the vision and the earth unleashed 

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.930
 by 

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:21.930
 the pilgrim responses 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:24.820
 but they do not tell you why 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:27.790
 we have everything good you identifiable 

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:32.130
 because the warmer weather about the 

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:32.130
 Poles that friend to 1,600 kilos 

00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:36.549
 we have more current questions 

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:41.969
 I think before the last day 

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:45.110
 possibly the story 

00:07:41.969 --> 00:07:47.750
 in the last his also sumatra 

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:50.090
 when this is the same effect and the 

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:52.529
 great devastation on them 

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:55.049
 Australian scientists detect 

00:07:52.529 --> 00:07:56.969
 for weeks the earth vibrated 

00:07:55.049 --> 00:07:59.340
 like a bell 

00:07:56.969 --> 00:08:02.190
 If you solidify why 

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:06.050
 you can only verify as a campaign if 

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:06.050
 the earth is webcam 

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.640
 how
