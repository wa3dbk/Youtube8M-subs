the network side owned and maintained by
the<00:01:45.360> operators<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.649> hence<00:01:47.310> we<00:01:47.490> will<00:01:47.640> get<00:01:47.820> the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
the operators and hence we will get the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.510 
the operators and hence we will get the
interoperability<00:01:48.869> across<00:01:49.590> services<00:01:49.979> and

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
interoperability across services and

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.170 
interoperability across services and
also<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.590> possibility<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.799> drive<00:01:53.700> volumes

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
also the possibility to drive volumes

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.569 
also the possibility to drive volumes
and<00:01:54.360> thereby<00:01:54.689> drive<00:01:54.990> lower<00:01:55.590> cost<00:01:57.439> yeah<00:01:58.579> this

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
and thereby drive lower cost yeah this

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.730 
and thereby drive lower cost yeah this
is<00:01:59.759> a<00:02:00.030> part<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.810> changing<00:02:01.229> media<00:02:01.380> landscape

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
is a part of a changing media landscape

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.730 
is a part of a changing media landscape
what<00:02:02.700> we<00:02:02.820> see<00:02:03.000> now<00:02:03.210> are<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.780> first<00:02:04.020> steps<00:02:04.350> in

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
what we see now are the first steps in

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.649 
what we see now are the first steps in
terms<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.399> further<00:02:05.939> blending<00:02:06.540> of

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
terms of further blending of

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.430 
terms of further blending of

communication and TV services and with a
standard<00:02:11.250> in<00:02:11.700> place<00:02:12.000> we<00:02:12.750> expect<00:02:13.170> this

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
standard in place we expect this

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.750 
standard in place we expect this
to<00:02:13.799> be<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.250> completely<00:02:15.209> new<00:02:15.360> industry<00:02:16.019> where

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
to be a completely new industry where

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.569 
to be a completely new industry where
users<00:02:17.760> can<00:02:17.970> select<00:02:18.150> where<00:02:19.079> to<00:02:19.439> watch<00:02:20.129> the<00:02:20.340> TV
