this<00:00:31.170> part<00:00:31.560> over<00:00:31.679> here<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.340> been<00:00:32.820> getting

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
this part over here is been getting

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.670 
this part over here is been getting
swollen<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.200> keep<00:00:34.380> trying<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.770> tape<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.219> um

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
swollen so I keep trying to tape it um

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.139 
swollen so I keep trying to tape it um
but<00:00:37.680> then<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:37.980> gets<00:00:38.129> really<00:00:38.370> itchy<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.969> guess

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
but then it gets really itchy I guess

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.650 
but then it gets really itchy I guess
because<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.510> adhesive<00:00:40.350> from<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.649> tape

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
because of the adhesive from the tape

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.619 
because of the adhesive from the tape
but<00:00:42.660> right<00:00:42.870> now<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.020> could<00:00:43.260> see<00:00:43.469> this<00:00:44.629> this

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
but right now you could see this this

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.020 
but right now you could see this this
side<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.379> swollen<00:00:46.649> some<00:00:47.399> reason<00:00:48.140> um<00:00:49.850> and<00:00:50.850> it's

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
side is swollen some reason um and it's

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.130 
side is swollen some reason um and it's
kind<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.390> red<00:00:51.660> around<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.199> edges<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:53.129> notice

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
kind of red around the edges you notice

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.720 
kind of red around the edges you notice
so<00:00:55.140> I'm<00:00:55.469> not<00:00:55.680> really<00:00:55.829> sure<00:00:56.100> what<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.309> do<00:00:56.550> with

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
so I'm not really sure what to do with

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.470 
so I'm not really sure what to do with
it

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
it

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.020 
it
cuz<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.230> try<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.500> ice<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:59.070> but<00:00:59.489> when<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.670> put<00:00:59.940> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
cuz I try to ice it but when I put the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.720 
cuz I try to ice it but when I put the
ice<00:01:00.210> right<00:01:00.510> on<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.230> can't<00:01:02.039> really<00:01:02.190> tolerate

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
ice right on it I can't really tolerate

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.850 
ice right on it I can't really tolerate
it<00:01:03.830> and<00:01:04.850> I<00:01:05.850> really<00:01:06.119> wish<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.450> would<00:01:06.570> look

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
it and I really wish it would look

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.149 
it and I really wish it would look
thinner<00:01:07.860> over<00:01:08.280> here<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.060> think<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.869> will<00:01:10.049> but<00:01:11.040> it

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
thinner over here I think it will but it

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.810 
thinner over here I think it will but it
just<00:01:11.369> doesn't<00:01:11.670> look<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:12.119> right<00:01:12.270> now<00:01:13.820> so

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
just doesn't look like it right now so

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.679 
just doesn't look like it right now so
um<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:16.049> don't<00:01:16.409> like<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.210> swells<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.540> then

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
um I don't like that it swells and then

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.230 
um I don't like that it swells and then
doesn't<00:01:19.110> swallow<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.590> then<00:01:19.680> swells

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
doesn't swallow and then swells

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.399 
doesn't swallow and then swells
sometimes<00:01:21.240> I'll<00:01:21.390> wake<00:01:21.540> up<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:21.990> morning

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
and it looks really really good and then

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.440

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.080 

see<00:02:40.350> probably<00:02:41.350> put<00:02:41.650> this<00:02:42.430> one<00:02:42.640> looks<00:02:42.820> the<00:02:42.940> most

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
see probably put this one looks the most

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.960 
see probably put this one looks the most
crooked<00:02:43.600> though<00:02:43.720> you<00:02:43.780> could<00:02:44.170> see<00:02:44.200> where<00:02:44.500> it's

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
crooked though you could see where it's

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.040 
crooked though you could see where it's
broken<00:02:46.470> my<00:02:47.470> nose<00:02:47.620> is<00:02:47.800> definitely<00:02:48.010> broken<00:02:49.050> this

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
broken my nose is definitely broken this

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.210 
broken my nose is definitely broken this
is<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.260> way<00:02:50.380> it<00:02:50.440> is<00:02:50.560> now<00:02:52.920> it's<00:02:53.920> really<00:02:54.100> really

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
is the way it is now it's really really

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.510 
is the way it is now it's really really
straight<00:02:55.050> really<00:02:56.050> straight<00:02:57.150> so<00:02:58.150> there<00:02:58.330> it<00:02:58.420> is

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
straight really straight so there it is

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.300 
straight really straight so there it is
I<00:03:00.520> think<00:03:01.270> this<00:03:02.230> one<00:03:02.560> shows<00:03:02.890> off<00:03:03.100> the

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
I think this one shows off the

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.140 
I think this one shows off the
brokenness<00:03:04.240> the<00:03:04.450> most<00:03:04.690> and<00:03:05.730> this<00:03:06.730> one<00:03:06.970> you<00:03:07.090> can

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
brokenness the most and this one you can

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.230 
brokenness the most and this one you can
see<00:03:07.390> how<00:03:07.510> wide<00:03:07.780> it<00:03:08.020> is<00:03:08.760> but<00:03:09.760> right<00:03:09.910> now<00:03:10.060> it's

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
see how wide it is but right now it's

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.980 
see how wide it is but right now it's
swollen<00:03:10.660> so<00:03:11.700> but<00:03:12.700> anyway<00:03:13.060> I<00:03:13.330> will<00:03:13.810> make
