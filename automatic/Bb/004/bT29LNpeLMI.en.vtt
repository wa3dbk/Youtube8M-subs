00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:25.699
 Balsam and conditioner are all basic tools for 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:27.420
 hair care. 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.410
 Often they are included in the shampoo. 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.470
 However, it is better to avoid means of 2-in-1. 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.720
 It's not just about the solid plaque that leaves 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.060
 such shampoo. 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.410
 Even the best shampoo is aggressive. 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.640
 on the hair, so the tool is better not to keep on the hair 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.640
 too long. 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.610
 But the care agent is just better able to withstand 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.730
 at least a couple of minutes. 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.070
 In addition, the system when the hair is simultaneously cleaned 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.670
 from fat and enveloped by conditioning substances, 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.420
 not too effective. 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.500
 It is better to first clean the hair, wash off the dirt, 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.750
 and only then apply a balm or conditioner. 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.360
 a bit of history for centuries natural oils 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.729
 used by people for hair styling. 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.189
 Products such as essential oils, such as tea oil 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.280
 wood and vegetable oils like jojoba oil are used 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.280
 still. 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.950
 In the Victorian era, macassar was popular. 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.369
 oil that was so fat that to protect furniture 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.950
 from him they put on it a special matter, an anti-Makassar. 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.219
 Modern air conditioners were created at the dawn of the 20th 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:34.200
 century: in 1900, the famous perfumer Edward Pinod introduced 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.979
 at the world exhibition in paris your diamond product 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.880
 to soften hair and beards in men. 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.439
 Since then, the industry has advanced significantly. 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.899
 in the design of air conditioners and uses silicones in them, 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.139
 fatty acids and quaternary ammonium compounds, giving 

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:53.189
 all the benefits of air conditioning without excess fat and weight. 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.420
 Hair conditioner is not the same as balsam conditioner 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.520
 The latter is a means of tangle of hair and therefore 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.619
 less thick than air conditioning. 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.729
 Air conditioners, in turn, consist of a thick substance, 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.039
 which should cover including cuticle hair. 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.080
 pH Mostly conditioners 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.010
 have an acidic environment that helps to strengthen 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.970
 hydrogen bonds between keratin scales 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.319
 by protonating amino acids and creating 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.930
 they have a positive charge. 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.220
 To maintain acidity, organic 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.410
 acid like citric acid. 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.060
 Air conditioning is a tool in the task. 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.820
 which is to minimize the harmful effects 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.840
 on the hair, provided by washing, combing and 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.840
 drying. 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.560
 He covers his hair with a thin invisible layer, 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.141
 protects them from excessive loss of moisture associated 

00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:43.909
 both with drying by the hair dryer, and with usual drying. 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:48.400
 This substance "sticks together" keratin scales, revealed 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.650
 while washing. 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.620
 Due to this, hair gets shine, becomes 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.069
 less susceptible to environmental influences 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.360
 environment. 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.160
 The conditioner serves as an antistatic so that hair does not 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.360
 "Stand on end", easy to comb. 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.819
 A thin film gives the hair a larger volume. 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.099
 The conditioner is spread on wet washed hair, 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.060
 avoiding roots, if a conditioner is applied to the roots, 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.060
 hair will quickly become dirty. 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.280
 Balm cares for your hair, nourishes them with useful 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.819
 substances. 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.519
 Shampooing uncovers hair scales and deep into 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.329
 its structure is easily imbued with nutrients balm 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.049
 - essential oils, proteins, minerals. 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.969
 Balm, as well as the conditioner "closes" keratin 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:31.810
 scales, thanks to what hair get shine. 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.209
 Balsam is applied along the entire length of the hair, including the roots, 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:36.849
 but not rubbed into the skin. 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:37.860
 However, there are exceptions. 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.810
 In this case, the instructions indicate that the means 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.489
 should be rubbed into the skin. 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.060
 Balms can be tonic, and can fight with some 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.569
 a particular problem. 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.140
 As we can see, the action of these tools are quite similar. 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.490
 Today, manufacturers often offer 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:54.700
 us balms-conditioners. 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.280
 Many stylists are advised to purchase these tools. 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.819
 separately, because not every time you need 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.520
 protective effect of the air conditioner, so why once again "envelop" 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.090
 hair wrap? 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.879
 However, it is quite long and not too economical. 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:11.330
 - apply shampoo on hair, then balm, then “seal” 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:12.930
 all air conditioned. 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.999
 In addition, the manufacturers themselves are confusing. 

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:19.400
 Balms offered today also have conditioning. 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.660
 properties, shampoos and conditioners are enriched with nutrients ... 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.460
 As a result, balm and conditioner still find refuge 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.919
 in one bottle. 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.521
 Is it really necessary to use balm and / or conditioner 

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:33.310
 every time after washing your hair? 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.690
 Many believe that modern man needs it. 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.770
 First, shampooing makes hair very vulnerable. 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.069
 to any impact. 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:41.580
 And you still have to comb and dry them. 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.319
 Secondly, the same combing. 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:46.190
 It severely injure wet hair. 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.330
 Air conditioning can significantly reduce harmful 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.330
 impact. 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.770
 Third, a thin film protects the hair during 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.130
 styling a hair dryer. 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.461
 Finally, balm and conditioner reduce harmful effects. 

00:04:57.461 --> 00:04:59.050
 tap water. 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.150
 Chlorine, heavy metals, microorganisms are all very serious. 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.150
 test. 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.720
 Hair, especially after washing, very well absorbed. 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.930
 in all of these substances. 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.680
 In general, balsams and conditioners are needed not only for those who 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.320
 damaged hair. 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.139
 If you want to keep your hair healthy, 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:17.780
 Be sure to use these tools. 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:29.550
 These are basic hair care products,
