 red gold is often called saffron 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.530
 a saffron meal costs up to 20 euros 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.990
 consists of the flower threads of a coconut 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.340
 Art If the cocos blossoms he has to 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.900
 be harvested immediately 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.910
 the farmers where the plant 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.240
 lovingly rose for centuries 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.160
 the production in family hand 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.869
 It is a very delicate flower and 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.240
 you have to treat her very lovingly 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.980
 The harvest takes place in the last of October 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.630
 or in the first week of november city 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.760
 but it depends on the weather 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.860
 when there are alternately rain and sun 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.020
 is it good but when it is cold or 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.710
 a lot of rain can be that the tubers 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.710
 spoil 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.260
 until today there is no machine which 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.469
 can replace the laborious manual labor 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.230
 that is one reason for the high price 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.340
 One kilogram of saffron consists of 250 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.380
 Sweep 1000 flowers 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:05.400
 For the farmers, the saffron production is 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:06.550
 An additional income of the saffron is none 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.500
 main source of income 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.810
 because to live but not enough of 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.220
 This allows us to have the household cash 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.680
 significantly improve 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.119
 the crop is in times of crisis 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.119
 an important pillar 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.840
 just after the harvest, women separate the 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.970
 threads carefully but quickly from the 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.460
 flowering the flowers have to be whole 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.970
 be fresh and there must be no pollen 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.970
 stick to it 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:41.689
 Finally, the threads are prepared so 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.880
 come the 150 different flavors 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.070
 the air france is the best 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:52.220
 it is one for the villagers 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:54.950
 special season by this 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.960
 activity, the family unites us 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.509
 not only do we set the saffron for this 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.610
 together at the table in those days 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.549
 the families also eat together and it 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:08.110
 the saffron harvest is harvested together 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.110
 is celebrated here right 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.269
 around 90 of the precious spice come from 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.489
 from Iran 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.480
 the saffron from spain is considered one 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.220
 the best in the world 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.019
 He is now a trademark 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.920
 protected and will be in the whole world 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.920
 exported 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.560
 fundamental for the fake of the origin 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.760
 is a fundamental problem for the 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.829
 Spanish production 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.750
 It often happens that saffron 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.579
 other countries with Iran 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.980
 packed as a spanish product 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:45.930
 is sold in the baroque and we fight 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:48.379
 against this injustice the saffron 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.940
 comes from the region of Castile la mancha 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:52.799
 against the famous centuries old 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.620
 windmills has the novel character don 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.120

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.150
 windmills is the restaurant 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.400
 as provincial in the traditional 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:07.260
 Spanish cuisine is paella with saffron 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.609
 colored yellow I polarize him like this and 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.950
 not with a mortar with it 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:13.500
 taste is preserved on the 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.450
 menu of the chef mak minero stand 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.239

 and she's right in safransauce 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.319

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.199
 spice but also as a textile dye 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:30.269

 Prizes will be the spice today, especially 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:39.299
 very used in restaurants of flavor 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:41.129
 intense and also the coloring of the own 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.290
 Only very simple dishes are good for 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:45.030
 saffron with simple ingredients like 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.040
 hare a white fish 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.750
 For example, you would never get salmon 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.450
 season saffron 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.940
