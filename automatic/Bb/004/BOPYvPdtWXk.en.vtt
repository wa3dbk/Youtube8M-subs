00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.569

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:10.050
 nations from clothes only one day true 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:13.019
 Cinnamon I already spoke about it and somewhere 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.530
 stretching told the Koreans did not 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.880
 stroking 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.220
 they wear clothes one day and on the second 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.830
 day she deducted you dirty and vilified 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.029
 she is dirty to everyone therefore they are hers 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.820
 send for washing 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.830
 despite the fact that they don't sweat too much 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.390
 so by the way a lot of electricity 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.320
 go to wash what about the style 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.739
 clothing style 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.090
 most often these are two styles or this 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.809
 such a thing 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.899
 all winter sia 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.120
 different is something feminine in guys 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.940
 it 's something like that 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.730
 this has already been said or is it something 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.699
 sports I do not say there are such 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:01.050
 costumes and conservative yes she doesn't 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.110
 usually for work specifically for work 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.260
 certain learners from them there and 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.080
 a uniform 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.170
 by the way about the costume Koreans still 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.549
 love such colorful shiny costumes 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.159
 men up to love and shiny costumes 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.229
 Olya, I do not even know of these years we have here 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.060
 on stage came out in such costumes korea 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.520
 by the way too 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.729
 artists take to the stage in such 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.750
 shinier costumes more senior 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:34.409
 generation and sports especially further 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.479
 from the city further away from the seoul from 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.390
 Gyeonggi-do province there in general 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.770
 dominates mostly sportiness i 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.470
 remember me sister when first time 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.490
 came she lived in the southern province 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.530
 I saw this one this whole selection of clothes 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.920
 then she was still cheap and she herself 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.200
 bought a lot buying bought 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.710
 I wanted it too 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.350
 clothes are worn and no one is wearing it 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.409
 I do not pay then I have a disease 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.190
 she has already stopped buying and became 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:09.140
 wear more comfortable clothes 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.630
 sports me too here mostly 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.380
 switched to a sporty style 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:19.850
 but because it is comfortable and especially there 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:24.470
 the heat is too open, I also can not and I 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.860
 walked a lot walked so yes here u 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.630
 I mostly dominated by sportiness 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:34.190
 by the way my girlfriend is selling for the first time 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:37.850
 I was driving here in 2105 then 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.380
 said that in Russia fashion is late for 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.019
 here after korea 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.450
 then when I arrived I saw that 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:48.170
 what shoes then were set foot on the slope 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.570
 what is there with ryushechki too like this 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.820
 generally wear olyat 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.630
 sixties seventies more then 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.540
 lived 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.780
 less than a year in Korea then came to 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.630
 Russia and six months later it all came 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.030
 already in Russia today can no longer but 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.810
 that difference but then she was up 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:11.630
 roughly the delay was on here what else 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.910
 sneakers of course not to mention this 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.280
 can not many people go to 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.310
 sneakers yes there girls in dresses in 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.329
 all and in sneakers and what I like about 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.590
 korea by the way 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:26.090
 despite the fact that they are so 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.170
 say that obsessed yes here is just 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.730
 very large selection on clothes they can 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.790
 afford it the way here 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:38.030
 relatively expensive compared to Europe 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.700
 I mean Europe and the European Union 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.329
 compared with america expensive compared 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.310
 with Russia 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:48.410
 no, so they let him to you 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.870
 branded good clothes practically 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:54.290
 all it is but you can buy 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.870
 something cheap there for 10 for 5-10 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.260
 dollars and calm wear that is here 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.550
 I will not worry at all about 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.610
 clothes you can wear all that 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:08.430
 1 and this is normal husband can be 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.140
 absolutely killed and it's ok nobody 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.090
 not paying attention to it 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.750
 that is, this is freedom here it is for me 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:18.989
 like here as you please 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:21.810
 dress within reason of course 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:25.290
 but in terms of there no one will judge that 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.440
 you old dirty shoes 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:32.370
 all just do not care for the way 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.800
 about the availability of my friend she herself 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.990
 chose a bag of louis vuitton in Russia on 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.790
 that moment there were two or three stores in 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.920
 Peter here he only appeared one in 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.200
 Moscow is still somewhere in St. Petersburg 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.330
 we decided to look at the site 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.100
 official from louis vuitton bag 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.030
 which she wants because she was not 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.520
 In St. Petersburg 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.560
 there could be a city to score 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.800
 official find official stores 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.200
 we had to score a city by the way there we 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.260
 We learned that in Russia only at that moment 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.250
 there were three stores and I decided to look 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.890
 In Korea 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.230
 how many shops in Korea just 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.820
 rather not only that there was very 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.340
 a lot of cities 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:14.520
 gives official stores opening 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.919
 city ​​and this is not a seul opening the city 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.250
 just a lot of shops only in 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:22.950
 one city and I realized that the Koreans 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.200
 can afford such bags judging by 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.630
 how many official stores in 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.440
 such a small country and even only 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.140
 one city 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.820
 this little country now I don't know 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.390
 like me especially 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:39.780
 well yes in every department store I almost 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:42.419
 there is a date store louis vuitton there i'm not 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:46.230
 I know you get anna or so and so 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:49.110
 expensive of course here but the koreans can 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:51.840
 afford and they apparently love it 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:56.430
 while not knowing your own not 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:59.190
 I 'm worried about another contrast in Korea 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.300
 one side is obsession with clothes 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.800
 on fashion 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.919
 but on the other hand 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:07.889
 everybody cares what you wear it just 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:10.139
 piggy bank of contrasts but rather well and 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:13.710
 I don't remember anything more 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:15.360
 Further I just about the companies separately 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.860
 about and just find 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:21.740
 video if it is still relevant then 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:24.300
 I will edit and set it up somehow and yes 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.520
 I still wanted to say the last about 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:29.340
 clothes now remembered very often 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.289
 Korean wands dress the same 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.970
 have the same t-shirts on we somehow 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:37.110
 went with someone 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:39.509
 I went to the mountains I do not remember with whom it was going and 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.550
 just a little lousy and every couple 

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:44.610
 was dressed the same 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:48.349

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:51.870

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:54.599

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.430
 Especially sports I saw in 

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:08.460

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:12.000

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:26.490
