mounted the ESC s the motors are mounted

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.849 
mounted the ESC s the motors are mounted
in<00:00:23.070> permanently<00:00:23.550> I've<00:00:23.670> used<00:00:23.850> Loctite<00:00:24.859> put

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
in permanently I've used Loctite put

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.710 
in permanently I've used Loctite put
them<00:00:26.039> on<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.250> haven't<00:00:26.730> put<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.000> prop<00:00:27.240> adapters

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
them on I haven't put the prop adapters

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.800 
them on I haven't put the prop adapters
on<00:00:27.900> yet<00:00:28.140> because<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.769> want<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:29.480> balance<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
on yet because I want to balance the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.840 
on yet because I want to balance the
motors<00:00:31.140> yet<00:00:31.380> or<00:00:31.920> check<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.340> balance<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.759> the

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
motors yet or check the balance of the

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.750 
motors yet or check the balance of the
motors<00:00:33.590> there's<00:00:34.590> procedure<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.399> found

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
motors there's procedure that I found

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.799 
motors there's procedure that I found
using<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.600> size<00:00:37.040> seismograph<00:00:38.570> vibration<00:00:39.570> type

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
using a size seismograph vibration type

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.479 
using a size seismograph vibration type
app<00:00:40.050> for<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.379> iPhone<00:00:40.800> it'll<00:00:41.160> tell<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.430> the

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
app for the iPhone it'll tell you the

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.700 
app for the iPhone it'll tell you the
vibration<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.480> can<00:00:42.629> find<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.050> vibration<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.649> a

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
vibration you can find a vibration and a

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.920 
vibration you can find a vibration and a
motor<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.100> balance<00:00:44.640> them<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.600> want<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.809> do

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
motor and balance them so I want to do

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.130 
motor and balance them so I want to do
that<00:00:46.079> before<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.440> get<00:00:46.620> much<00:00:46.829> further<00:00:48.140> there

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
that before I get much further there

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.330 
that before I get much further there
we're<00:00:49.649> looking<00:00:49.890> at<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.070> front<00:00:52.100> here<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
we're looking at the front here in the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.200 
we're looking at the front here in the
back<00:00:53.579> I've<00:00:54.329> got<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.320> APM<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.129> RG<00:00:56.789> pilot

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
back I've got the the APM the RG pilot

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.010 
back I've got the the APM the RG pilot
mega<00:00:57.980> power<00:00:58.980> module<00:00:59.550> hooked<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.600> battery

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
mega power module hooked to the battery

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.420 
mega power module hooked to the battery
I've<00:01:01.800> got<00:01:02.609> an<00:01:02.820> XT<00:01:03.530> 62<00:01:04.530> Deans<00:01:05.129> connector

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
I've got an XT 62 Deans connector

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.840 
I've got an XT 62 Deans connector
because<00:01:06.210> all<00:01:06.540> my<00:01:06.750> batteries<00:01:07.130> that<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.250> use<00:01:08.520> are

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
because all my batteries that I use are

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.880 
because all my batteries that I use are
from<00:01:08.880> my<00:01:09.210> previous<00:01:09.630> helicopters<00:01:10.530> they<00:01:10.740> have

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
from my previous helicopters they have

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.340 
from my previous helicopters they have
beens<00:01:11.159> connectors<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.060> them<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.990> I've<00:01:13.140> got

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
beens connectors on them so I've got

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.969 
beens connectors on them so I've got
that<00:01:13.590> there<00:01:15.020> that's<00:01:16.020> pretty<00:01:16.229> much<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.740> I've

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
that there that's pretty much it I've

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.219 
that there that's pretty much it I've
got<00:01:17.220> some<00:01:17.580> anti<00:01:18.150> vibration<00:01:18.360> material<00:01:19.140> there

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
got some anti vibration material there

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.340 
got some anti vibration material there
on<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.439> top<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.979> my<00:01:20.070> roommate<00:01:20.460> gave<00:01:20.700> me<00:01:21.350> hope

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
on the top that my roommate gave me hope

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.570 
on the top that my roommate gave me hope
you<00:01:22.470> that'll<00:01:22.680> work<00:01:22.799> out<00:01:22.979> pretty<00:01:23.189> good<00:01:23.430> if<00:01:23.549> not

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
you that'll work out pretty good if not

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.899 
you that'll work out pretty good if not
I<00:01:23.820> do<00:01:24.030> have<00:01:24.360> some<00:01:24.600> moon<00:01:25.380> gel<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.549> can<00:01:26.759> use

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
I do have some moon gel that I can use

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.630 
I do have some moon gel that I can use
but<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.150> think<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.479> ought<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.780> do<00:01:27.869> pretty<00:01:28.110> good

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
but I think this ought to do pretty good

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.130 
but I think this ought to do pretty good
because<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.850> power<00:01:30.060> distribution<00:01:30.540> board

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
because the power distribution board

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.289 
because the power distribution board
that<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.799> got<00:01:32.040> from<00:01:32.220> Hobby<00:01:32.400> King<00:01:32.790> has<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.000> very

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
that I got from Hobby King has a very

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.109 
that I got from Hobby King has a very
similar<00:01:33.630> material<00:01:34.520> you<00:01:35.520> should<00:01:35.790> be<00:01:35.939> able<00:01:36.000> to

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
similar material you should be able to

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.330 
similar material you should be able to
see<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.540> distribution<00:01:37.200> board<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.650> under

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
see the distribution board it under

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.219 
see the distribution board it under
there<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.820> hope<00:01:42.950> but<00:01:43.950> anyway<00:01:44.310> yeah<00:01:44.579> it's<00:01:44.610> got

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
there I hope but anyway yeah it's got

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.440 
there I hope but anyway yeah it's got
its<00:01:46.229> got<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.470> very<00:01:46.560> similar<00:01:47.240> material<00:01:48.240> there

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
its got a very similar material there

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.230 
its got a very similar material there
you<00:01:48.630> can<00:01:48.780> see<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.729> probably<00:01:50.729> better<00:01:50.850> than<00:01:51.060> that

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
you can see it probably better than that

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.940 
you can see it probably better than that
shot<00:01:53.509> but<00:01:54.509> anyway<00:01:54.869> that's<00:01:55.200> where<00:01:55.470> I'm<00:01:55.560> at<00:01:55.710> with

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
shot but anyway that's where I'm at with

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.580 
shot but anyway that's where I'm at with
it<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.460> hope<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.909> in<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.119> next<00:01:57.420> week<00:01:57.659> we<00:01:57.869> get<00:01:58.320> the

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
it I hope to in the next week we get the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.319 
it I hope to in the next week we get the
get<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.189> ardupilot<00:01:59.610> mounted<00:02:02.119> want<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.180> do

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
get the ardupilot mounted want to do

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.170 
get the ardupilot mounted want to do
some<00:02:03.600> testing<00:02:04.140> with<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.560> AR<00:02:04.860> 6,200<00:02:05.790> receiver

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
some testing with the AR 6,200 receiver

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.540 
some testing with the AR 6,200 receiver
that<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.450> want<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.659> be<00:02:06.750> using<00:02:07.229> it's<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.520> they<00:02:08.520> are

that I want to be using it's a they are

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.140 
that I want to be using it's a they are
62<00:02:09.209> with<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.599> satellite<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.500> have<00:02:10.860> to

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
62 with the satellite I have to

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.030 
62 with the satellite I have to
that<00:02:11.420> amount<00:02:11.900> that<00:02:12.140> I'll<00:02:12.349> do<00:02:12.500> that<00:02:12.650> once<00:02:12.860> they

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040

out hopefully they'll be some more I'll
go<00:02:19.519> through<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.819> setup<00:02:20.150> I<00:02:20.390> know<00:02:20.450> it's<00:02:20.720> been

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
go through the setup I know it's been

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.720

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
there's a lot of it but it's hard to

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.050 
there's a lot of it but it's hard to
