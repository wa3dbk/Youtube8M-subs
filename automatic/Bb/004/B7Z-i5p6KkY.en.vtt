00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.960
 talk about the news that is 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.849
 live in what is plants against zombies 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.710
 garden guard but maybe in general in 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.450
 what is the xbox live service but 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.820
 I'm going to focus on what is going to 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.619
 what concerns me is not about what 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.850
 that I lived with respect to what is the 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.460
 game of plants against zombies and 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.750
 garden warfare and now I'll explain 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.490
 specifically why in this game 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.439
 Well, well, guys, this video 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.240
 it really is not that it has much to do 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.920
 go with a gameplay but in the most 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.250
 simple I'm just going to talk a 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.059
 little bit my experience and try to not know 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.040
 share this for those people 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.379
 that maybe they did not even know what 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.750
 was what was happening during the 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.309
 past days regarding xbox live and for 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.379
 those who may know it and are 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.050
 entered 100% of what is happening 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.160
 Well then I discuss their experience 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.110
 how is it that you are living it 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.780
 how are you affected? 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.699
 with such problems not so we're going to 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.710
 start and how I repeat this video does not 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.180
 try a lot about that if we're going to 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.920
 open out there a couple of sachets to 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.170
 final of the video but mainly 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.360
 I want to share this throughout the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.220
 next seconds so guys 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.990

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.910
 of plants against zombies and as I said 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.770
 let's talk about today 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.440
 that is lived in this game currently not 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.840
 have here we have the transitions of 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.460
 what are the updates there are and 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.050
 nothing here right now have it from 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.090
 joy for the holidays which already 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.010
 we talked about the sachets of 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.170
 these from the promotion from 1 to 25 of 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.910
 December and others and well let's go here in 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.280
 what has it of stickers is valid and not 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.260
 you nothing more with what I have found 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.930
 I found what is the envelope 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.720
 of 21 after there I do not have the 20's 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.420
 neither the 19 or the 18 and I have until 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.210
 the 17th well I missed more than 5 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.530
 envelopes 4 or 5 envelopes exactly and what is 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.690
 what happened and this is where the 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.090
 main topic and about good of what 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.490
 I want to comment you will remember that what 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.290
 was live xbox suffered suffered problems or 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.570
 obviously stability problems 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.000
 of connection and so on and all this was in 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.280
 case that good one apparently 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.890
 violation of what was his security in 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.320
 the servers is a kind of hacking 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.729
 to what was xbox live so that 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.380
 began to block access to 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.910
 users unable to connect you can not live 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.950
 I could not do it, you could not even 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.599
 I could load well 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.790
 interface of what the console was 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.349
 connected to the internet in games or 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.090
 tell the bolística era iván could not 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.280
 focus that the multiplayer did not load 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.349
 your profile and so on and so forth and so on 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.720
 well that's what I lived guys 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.280
 I lost like three days of packets I lost 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.470
 this I say is not that it's like that the great 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.120
 thing but if we can not play we could not 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.920
 play was too bad what was the 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.290
 connection and I had been affected 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.060
 specifically in this way, not from there 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.560
 on the outside the demos that I play that 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.860
 usually go up to the channel for example call of 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.660
 duty halo and other games xbox one is 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.519
 the only thing I play in 360 currently already 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.080
 just make plants against zombies and 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.569
 it was this way in which I was that 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.790
 it had affected me so guys I hope 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.500
 that at the end of what the season 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.420
 it's December take out sachets that 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.459
 have to buy obviously so that 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.500
 you can recover all the accessories 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.540
 those Christmas would not be a little bad 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.069
 that we were not and everything like that 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.989
 I really hope to take sachets 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.459
 so that at least you can buy them 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.319
 at the end of all this and that we can 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.120
 recover then go the lost days 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.290
 not so this was what happened to me 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.730
 me guys I would like you to tell me 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.980

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.200

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.330
 The Xbox live went bad 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.459

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.590
 experience in a different way because 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.790
 Like I said, I'm going to see it 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.739
 draw conclusions from what it was that 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.750
 it happened thanks thanks to the excellent 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.180
 xbox live security work 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.760
 go that gives us go to a service 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.709
 for I know it is not very good so good 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.330

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:52.040
 aware of that if that no longer 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.690
