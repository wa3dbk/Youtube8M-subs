00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:54.990 
this little case right here just looks

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.570 
this little case right here just looks
like<00:06:55.199> this<00:06:55.470> you<00:06:55.710> know<00:06:55.830> one<00:06:56.009> of<00:06:56.039> these<00:06:56.280> bills

and I don't really use this too much I I
kind<00:07:03.419> of<00:07:03.509> alternate<00:07:03.960> because<00:07:04.229> i<00:07:04.259> like<00:07:04.590> the

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860 
kind of alternate because i like the

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 
on it this it gets really thick if I

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.689 
on it this it gets really thick if I
fold<00:07:09.720> it<00:07:09.930> and<00:07:10.020> stuff<00:07:10.289> like<00:07:10.440> that<00:07:10.500> which<00:07:11.009> just<00:07:11.280> I
