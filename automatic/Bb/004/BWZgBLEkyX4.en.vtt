00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.570 
and in this case we'll show you how to
build<00:01:23.479> a<00:01:23.860> remote-control<00:01:24.860> train<00:01:27.280> just<00:01:28.280> like

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
build a remote-control train just like

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.260 
build a remote-control train just like
the<00:01:28.850> other<00:01:29.000> trains<00:01:29.420> and<00:01:30.250> very<00:01:31.250> simple<00:01:31.820> to<00:01:31.880> do

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
the other trains and very simple to do

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.840 
the other trains and very simple to do
and<00:01:32.450> as<00:01:32.600> you<00:01:32.780> can<00:01:32.990> see<00:01:33.320> it<00:01:33.560> looks<00:01:33.890> just<00:01:34.460> like<00:01:34.670> it

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
and as you can see it looks just like it

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.460 
and as you can see it looks just like it
would've<00:01:35.570> if<00:01:36.470> it<00:01:36.770> had<00:01:37.010> been<00:01:37.340> the<00:01:37.549> original

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
would've if it had been the original

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.160 
would've if it had been the original
which<00:01:39.470> is<00:01:39.710> what<00:01:40.010> this<00:01:40.400> is<00:01:40.760> right<00:01:41.150> here<00:01:41.720> what

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
which is what this is right here what

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.890 
which is what this is right here what
you're<00:01:42.409> seeing<00:01:42.740> right<00:01:43.010> here<00:01:43.299> this<00:01:44.299> is<00:01:44.540> what

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
you're seeing right here this is what

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.179 
you're seeing right here this is what
you<00:01:44.930> get<00:01:45.350> for<00:01:45.590> $100<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:47.799> what<00:01:48.799> we<00:01:49.009> have<00:01:49.159> done

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
you get for $100 and what we have done

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.359 
you get for $100 and what we have done
is<00:01:49.939> we've<00:01:50.240> taken<00:01:50.509> the<00:01:50.780> coal<00:01:51.020> tender<00:01:51.290> out<00:01:51.680> made

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
is we've taken the coal tender out made

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.210 
is we've taken the coal tender out made
it<00:01:52.549> even<00:01:52.909> better<00:01:53.150> added<00:01:54.140> the<00:01:54.320> remote-control

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
it even better added the remote-control

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.390 
it even better added the remote-control
motor<00:01:55.610> and<00:01:56.030> that<00:01:56.840> is<00:01:57.080> what<00:01:57.470> you<00:01:57.740> get<00:01:57.920> to<00:01:58.189> learn

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
motor and that is what you get to learn

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.810 
motor and that is what you get to learn
how<00:01:58.759> to<00:01:58.790> do<00:01:59.270> and<00:01:59.570> we<00:02:00.200> think<00:02:00.590> we've<00:02:01.070> taken<00:02:01.400> the

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
how to do and we think we've taken the

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.120 
how to do and we think we've taken the
best<00:02:01.850> Lego<00:02:02.479> train<00:02:02.900> that<00:02:03.170> at<00:02:03.470> least<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:03.920> best

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
best Lego train that at least the best

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.929 
best Lego train that at least the best
western<00:02:04.790> themed<00:02:05.740> Lego<00:02:06.740> train<00:02:07.159> there<00:02:07.430> is<00:02:07.610> and

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
western themed Lego train there is and

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.290 
western themed Lego train there is and
made<00:02:08.899> it<00:02:09.049> even<00:02:09.200> better<00:02:09.530> by<00:02:10.369> adding<00:02:10.759> a<00:02:10.880> remote

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
made it even better by adding a remote

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.839 
made it even better by adding a remote
control<00:02:11.810> function<00:02:12.080> so<00:02:12.920> if<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.220> like<00:02:13.430> what<00:02:13.700> you

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
control function so if you like what you

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.610 
control function so if you like what you
saw<00:02:14.120> right<00:02:14.300> here<00:02:14.870> don't

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
saw right here don't

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.729 
saw right here don't
