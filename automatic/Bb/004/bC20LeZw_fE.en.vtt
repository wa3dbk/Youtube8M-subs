think they rub off way more easily um

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.300 
think they rub off way more easily um
obviously<00:01:13.320> it's<00:01:13.619> going<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.799> rub<00:01:13.950> off<00:01:14.040> on<00:01:14.220> the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
obviously it's going to rub off on the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.679 
obviously it's going to rub off on the
inside<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.580> your<00:01:14.700> eye<00:01:14.790> but<00:01:14.970> i<00:01:15.030> feel<00:01:15.210> like<00:01:15.330> these

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 
like gold

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.650 
like gold
like<00:03:31.750> that<00:03:31.930> so<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:32.890> way<00:03:32.980> that<00:03:33.010> i<00:03:33.280> use<00:03:34.270> it<00:03:34.450> i'll

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
like that so the way that i use it i'll

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.570
