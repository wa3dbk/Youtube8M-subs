00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
attachment on this visor like we talked

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.260 
attachment on this visor like we talked
about<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.409> different<00:01:22.710> system<00:01:23.070> now<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.610> really

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
about is a different system now I really

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.760 
about is a different system now I really
like<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.630> system<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.080> seems<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.439> be<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> little

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
like this system it seems to be a little

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.170 
like this system it seems to be a little
easier<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.250> manipulate<00:01:26.460> there's<00:01:27.119> a

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
easier to manipulate there's a

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.140 
easier to manipulate there's a
spring-loaded<00:01:27.750> tab<00:01:28.500> here<00:01:28.860> inside<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.490> it

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
spring-loaded tab here inside and it

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.179 
spring-loaded tab here inside and it
pops<00:01:30.390> straight<00:01:30.659> off<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.590> can<00:01:31.740> see<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.070> as

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
pops straight off you can see that as

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.640 
pops straight off you can see that as
you<00:01:32.310> move<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.729> very<00:01:33.479> simple<00:01:33.900> small<00:01:34.320> amount

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
you move that very simple small amount

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.530 
you move that very simple small amount
of<00:01:34.740> movement<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.880> clicks<00:01:36.119> right<00:01:36.360> back

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
of movement and it clicks right back

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.590 
of movement and it clicks right back
into<00:01:36.780> place<00:01:36.960> very<00:01:37.770> quick<00:01:38.130> very<00:01:38.400> simple<00:01:38.909> so

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
into place very quick very simple so

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.390 
into place very quick very simple so
it's<00:01:39.750> going<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.990> be<00:01:40.079> easy<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.619> swap<00:01:40.890> out<00:01:41.130> from

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
it's going to be easy to swap out from

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.149 
it's going to be easy to swap out from
clears<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:42.030> tint<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.390> as<00:01:42.509> necessary<00:01:43.140> give<00:01:44.070> you

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
clears to tint it as necessary give you

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.230 
clears to tint it as necessary give you
a<00:01:44.189> look<00:01:44.340> at<00:01:44.430> some<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.759> vents<00:01:45.000> on<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.149> back

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
a look at some of the vents on the back
