00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.360
 last week I taught you how to make a 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.730
 fringed shirt I have it here 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.320
 that I'm going to take advantage of to teach it and 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.540
 I will leave the link in case you feel like it 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.740
 try to do it over here so much 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.450
 You liked this day just like today I am going to 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.430
 repeat and I'm going to make a shirt but 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.320
 with another trend this season the 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.449
 top crop are those shirts your blouses 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.310
 shorter than normal left to the air 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.779
 the belly that happens that we 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.220
 we have the navel like to leave it to 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.290
 the view so what I'm going to do today 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.150
 is a crop top adapted to me that is 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.830
 I'm going to make a crop top that does not 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.610
 teaches more than the account and put in the 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.610
 as much as I want 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.190
 Step 1 first fold the shirt 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.190
 in half 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.810
 i 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.820
 step 2 I'm going to leave it with short sleeves 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.950
 to make it funnier to cut the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.229
 vertical sleeve in this way so 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.580
 marked one of the sleeves in this case 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.920
 like the neck is from the boat and I like it 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.060
 so I'm going to leave it as it is brand 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.060
 of the neck of the desired shape 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.899
 step 3 with the help of a meter or a ruler 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.430
 mark that way the shape t-shirt 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.880
 that both a front peak and 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.880
 rear 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.719
 step 4 once you have all this marked 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.310
 proceed to cut with scissors 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:50.869
 large and have a clean cut 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.869
 to avoid jagged on the shirt 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.630
 yes 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.250
 is that it is very easy to make a top I think 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.560
 in this case I used a shirt 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.570
 of cotton if you use chiffon or silk 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.040
 that are fraying I advise you that 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.170
 low you pass by the sewing machine 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.450
 well I also advise you that the bis the 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.100
 T-shirt before putting it on because they are going 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.690
 to adapt the lows much better and that 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.740
 cutting blood washing once is 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.240
 better 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.240
 this is the look I created with this I think 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.300
 I will leave a comment with the entry 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.950

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.870
