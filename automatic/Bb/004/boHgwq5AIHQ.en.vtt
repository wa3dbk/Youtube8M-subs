00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
have a look at the pig Tronics

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.420 
have a look at the pig Tronics
Philosopher's<00:00:16.289> Stone<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.890> see<00:00:17.130> how<00:00:17.279> I'm

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
Philosopher's Stone and see how I'm

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.820 
Philosopher's Stone and see how I'm
using<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:17.910> in<00:00:18.060> my<00:00:18.240> guitar<00:00:19.170> setup

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
using it in my guitar setup

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.830 
using it in my guitar setup
alright<00:00:20.340> so<00:00:20.520> let's<00:00:20.730> have<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:20.970> quick<00:00:21.270> look<00:00:21.390> at

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
alright so let's have a quick look at

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.840 
alright so let's have a quick look at
some<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.500> knobs<00:00:22.740> on<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.250> Philosopher's

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
some of the knobs on the Philosopher's

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.640 
some of the knobs on the Philosopher's
Stone<00:00:23.880> see<00:00:24.539> how<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.720> have<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.080> set<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.619> then

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
Stone see how I have it set and then

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.460 
Stone see how I have it set and then
we'll<00:00:25.920> also<00:00:26.130> see<00:00:26.460> how<00:00:26.939> much<00:00:27.330> further<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:28.260> can

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
we'll also see how much further it can

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.780 
we'll also see how much further it can
go<00:00:28.650> from<00:00:28.980> where<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:30.240> here<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.790> engage

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
go from where it is so here it is engage

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.880 
go from where it is so here it is engage
it<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.120> we<00:00:33.239> hear<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:36.170> without<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.440> sounds<00:00:37.800> like

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
it so we hear it without it sounds like

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:45.529 
it so we hear it without it sounds like
this<00:00:40.250> with<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:43.070> all<00:00:44.070> right<00:00:44.219> so<00:00:44.489> let's<00:00:45.270> add<00:00:45.510> more

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
this with it all right so let's add more

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.300 
this with it all right so let's add more
sustain

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.310 
sustain

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.319 
sustain
Oh

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:01:08.300 

you

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.680 

so<00:01:09.310> you<00:01:09.400> get<00:01:09.550> a<00:01:09.580> lot<00:01:09.760> of<00:01:09.850> sustain<00:01:10.210> but<00:01:10.450> it<00:01:10.540> also

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
so you get a lot of sustain but it also

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:27.319 
so you get a lot of sustain but it also
makes<00:01:11.080> it<00:01:11.230> really<00:01:11.530> pillowy<00:01:12.190> on<00:01:12.610> the<00:01:12.820> attack

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:29.690 

now<00:01:28.170> let's<00:01:28.320> add<00:01:28.469> some<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.829> grit<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.399> see

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
now let's add some of the grit and see

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:43.910 
now let's add some of the grit and see
what

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.790 

Oh

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
Oh

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:58.050 
Oh
No

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.420 

that's<00:01:58.960> got<00:01:59.200> that<00:01:59.380> interesting<00:01:59.890> bit<00:02:00.070> of<00:02:00.160> grit

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
that's got that interesting bit of grit

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.520 
that's got that interesting bit of grit
now<00:02:00.700> what<00:02:00.940> if<00:02:01.030> I<00:02:01.150> had<00:02:01.360> even<00:02:01.540> more<00:02:01.810> gain<00:02:02.170> from

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
now what if I had even more gain from

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:15.210 
now what if I had even more gain from
the<00:02:02.650> fat

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.640 

No

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
No

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:29.720 
No
ah

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:45.190 

you

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.410 

Oh

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.490 

Oh

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.589 

that's<00:02:53.500> a<00:02:53.620> bit<00:02:53.740> of<00:02:53.830> a<00:02:53.890> strange<00:02:54.250> sound<00:02:55.030> you<00:02:55.209> turn

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
that's a bit of a strange sound you turn

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:06.059 
that's a bit of a strange sound you turn
the<00:02:55.750> grit<00:02:56.110> back<00:02:56.349> up<00:02:56.709> and<00:02:57.130> now<00:02:57.310> it's

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.619 

the<00:03:07.000> blend<00:03:07.360> gives<00:03:08.290> you<00:03:08.500> more<00:03:09.489> or<00:03:09.909> less<00:03:09.970> of<00:03:10.599> the

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 
the blend gives you more or less of the

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.070 
the blend gives you more or less of the
compression

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:29.960 

you

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.830 

Wow

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.380 

it's<00:03:33.440> adding<00:03:33.709> a<00:03:33.770> lot<00:03:33.950> of<00:03:33.980> sustain<00:03:34.489> this<00:03:35.090> is<00:03:35.239> how

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
it's adding a lot of sustain this is how

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.500 
it's adding a lot of sustain this is how
I<00:03:35.420> run<00:03:35.780> it<00:03:35.930> where<00:03:36.170> I<00:03:37.000> can<00:03:38.000> use<00:03:38.239> it<00:03:38.390> in

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
I run it where I can use it in

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.880 
I run it where I can use it in
conjunction<00:03:38.540> with<00:03:39.020> a<00:03:39.140> lot<00:03:39.380> of<00:03:39.410> other<00:03:39.650> high

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
conjunction with a lot of other high

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.699 
conjunction with a lot of other high
gain<00:03:40.160> things<00:03:40.569> and<00:03:41.569> it'll<00:03:41.810> just<00:03:42.050> give<00:03:42.290> it<00:03:42.440> some

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
gain things and it'll just give it some

00:03:42.709 --> 00:04:22.440 
gain things and it'll just give it some
character

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.260 

so<00:04:23.450> the<00:04:23.570> combination<00:04:24.320> of<00:04:24.640> the<00:04:25.640> two<00:04:25.880> the<00:04:26.090> fat

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
so the combination of the two the fat

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.150 
so the combination of the two the fat
drive<00:04:26.540> and<00:04:26.810> the<00:04:26.870> philosopher's<00:04:27.530> stone<00:04:27.560> I

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
drive and the philosopher's stone I

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.370 
drive and the philosopher's stone I
think<00:04:28.670> he's<00:04:28.760> a<00:04:28.790> really<00:04:29.120> strong<00:04:29.180> combo<00:04:30.170> where

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
think he's a really strong combo where

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.680 
think he's a really strong combo where
you<00:04:30.530> can<00:04:30.710> get<00:04:31.460> a<00:04:31.490> lot<00:04:31.640> of<00:04:31.670> interesting<00:04:32.090> sounds

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
you can get a lot of interesting sounds

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.400 
you can get a lot of interesting sounds
but<00:04:33.190> you<00:04:34.190> can<00:04:34.400> really<00:04:34.910> dial<00:04:35.630> in<00:04:35.930> the<00:04:35.960> gain

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
but you can really dial in the gain

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.170 
but you can really dial in the gain
stage<00:04:36.770> that<00:04:37.010> you<00:04:37.100> want<00:04:37.310> that<00:04:37.490> works<00:04:37.700> best<00:04:37.970> with

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
stage that you want that works best with

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.010 
stage that you want that works best with
your<00:04:38.330> guitar<00:04:38.660> and<00:04:39.020> and<00:04:39.230> it<00:04:40.220> makes<00:04:40.460> it<00:04:40.610> really

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
your guitar and and it makes it really

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.810 
your guitar and and it makes it really
fun<00:04:42.020> to<00:04:42.080> play<00:04:42.350> because<00:04:42.590> you<00:04:42.920> have<00:04:43.310> a<00:04:43.580> lot<00:04:43.790> of

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
fun to play because you have a lot of

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.250 
fun to play because you have a lot of
different<00:04:44.180> options<00:04:44.600> when<00:04:44.720> you<00:04:44.840> roll<00:04:45.080> your

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
different options when you roll your

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.860 
different options when you roll your
guitar<00:04:45.590> volume<00:04:46.040> down<00:04:46.490> and<00:04:47.000> and<00:04:47.210> just<00:04:47.420> the<00:04:47.600> the

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
guitar volume down and and just the the

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.530 
guitar volume down and and just the the
pick<00:04:48.080> attack<00:04:48.440> changes<00:04:49.130> based<00:04:50.000> on<00:04:50.210> how<00:04:50.480> you

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
pick attack changes based on how you

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.920 
pick attack changes based on how you
have<00:04:50.840> the<00:04:51.110> the<00:04:51.470> compression<00:04:52.040> set<00:04:52.310> and<00:04:52.930> you

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
have the the compression set and you

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.560 
have the the compression set and you
know<00:04:54.020> I<00:04:54.200> think<00:04:54.560> it's<00:04:54.890> well<00:04:55.400> worth<00:04:55.570> discovering

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
know I think it's well worth discovering

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.110 
know I think it's well worth discovering
for<00:04:56.690> yourself
