would be the right the right phrase I

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.449 
would be the right the right phrase I
don't<00:02:12.810> think<00:02:12.930> there's<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.080> word<00:02:13.260> for<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.739> but

don't think there's a word for it but

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.479 
don't think there's a word for it but
the<00:02:14.640> right<00:02:14.819> phrase<00:02:15.209> is<00:02:15.780> expand<00:02:16.709> my<00:02:16.890> horizons

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
this area this is still cough and shire

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.830 
this area this is still cough and shire
but<00:03:17.579> it's<00:03:17.730> not<00:03:18.290> really<00:03:19.290> much<00:03:19.890> of<00:03:19.950> coffin<00:03:20.579> shire

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
but it's not really much of coffin shire

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.479 
but it's not really much of coffin shire
it's<00:03:21.840> basically<00:03:22.260> this<00:03:22.530> is<00:03:22.590> as<00:03:22.829> far<00:03:23.070> as<00:03:23.250> coffee

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
it's basically this is as far as coffee

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.120 
it's basically this is as far as coffee
jar<00:03:23.790> could<00:03:23.970> possibly<00:03:24.420> go<00:03:24.630> in<00:03:24.840> this<00:03:24.930> direction

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
jar could possibly go in this direction

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:33.229 
jar could possibly go in this direction
because<00:03:28.489> if<00:03:29.489> you<00:03:30.060> can<00:03:30.090> if<00:03:30.780> it<00:03:31.200> will<00:03:32.239> obviously

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
because if you can if it will obviously

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.390 
because if you can if it will obviously
the<00:03:33.870> frame<00:03:34.109> rate<00:03:34.319> dipped<00:03:34.560> quite<00:03:34.829> a<00:03:34.859> bit<00:03:35.100> here

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
the frame rate dipped quite a bit here

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:43.120

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
obviously I can't go any further than

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:52.910 
obviously I can't go any further than
