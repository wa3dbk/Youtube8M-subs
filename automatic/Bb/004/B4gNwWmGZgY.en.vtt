like a teepee looking thing tint connect

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.010 
like a teepee looking thing tint connect
those<00:01:37.750> here<00:01:39.630> okay

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
those here okay

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.080 
those here okay

the<00:01:43.119> other<00:01:43.420> side<00:01:45.840> here<00:01:48.180> do<00:01:49.180> the<00:01:49.330> same<00:01:49.509> thing

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.020 

okay

and<00:01:55.960> once<00:01:56.110> those<00:01:56.320> are<00:01:56.380> in<00:01:56.890> there<00:01:57.250> together

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
and once those are in there together

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.960 
and once those are in there together
you'll<00:01:58.509> have<00:01:58.660> to<00:01:58.750> do<00:01:58.869> a<00:01:58.900> little<00:01:59.080> bit<00:01:59.290> twisting

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
you'll have to do a little bit twisting

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:08.670 
you'll have to do a little bit twisting
with<00:02:01.710> your<00:02:02.710> keys

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:08.680 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:20.110 

and<00:02:09.680> connect<00:02:10.190> right<00:02:10.400> in<00:02:10.580> there<00:02:18.790> okay<00:02:19.790> once<00:02:20.000> you

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
and connect right in there okay once you

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.360 
and connect right in there okay once you
get<00:02:20.240> everything<00:02:20.360> together<00:02:20.920> might<00:02:21.920> be<00:02:22.070> good<00:02:22.250> to

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
get everything together might be good to

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.770 
get everything together might be good to
throw<00:02:22.490> a<00:02:22.580> little<00:02:22.700> glue<00:02:23.000> on<00:02:23.240> it<00:02:23.270> just<00:02:23.540> to<00:02:23.660> be

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
throw a little glue on it just to be

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.440 
throw a little glue on it just to be
safe<00:02:23.960> make<00:02:24.200> sure<00:02:24.230> stays<00:02:24.590> together<00:02:24.800> but<00:02:25.730> the

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
safe make sure stays together but the

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.710 
safe make sure stays together but the
great<00:02:26.660> thing<00:02:26.690> there<00:02:27.470> is<00:02:27.620> reasonably<00:02:28.040> any<00:02:28.190> glue

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
great thing there is reasonably any glue

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.050 
great thing there is reasonably any glue
the<00:02:29.720> great<00:02:29.900> thing<00:02:30.080> about<00:02:30.200> this<00:02:30.590> soccer<00:02:31.580> goal

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
the great thing about this soccer goal

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.500 
the great thing about this soccer goal
is<00:02:32.270> that<00:02:33.190> being<00:02:34.190> symmetrical<00:02:34.940> you<00:02:35.060> can<00:02:35.240> use<00:02:35.360> it

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
is that being symmetrical you can use it

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.050 
is that being symmetrical you can use it
from<00:02:35.600> this<00:02:35.780> side<00:02:36.190> or<00:02:37.190> flip<00:02:37.580> it<00:02:37.700> over<00:02:37.820> and<00:02:38.000> you

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
from this side or flip it over and you

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.540 
from this side or flip it over and you
can<00:02:38.120> use<00:02:38.360> it<00:02:38.510> from<00:02:38.600> this<00:02:38.840> side<00:02:39.080> so<00:02:39.400> now<00:02:40.400> it's

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
can use it from this side so now it's

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.400 
can use it from this side so now it's
