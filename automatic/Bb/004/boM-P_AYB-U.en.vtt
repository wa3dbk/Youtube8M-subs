00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.879

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.509
 state the game 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.160
 I wanted to play logically 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.119
 seems a mistake from the depths of 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.529
 hell 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:29.490
 I knew mistake you can is fixing 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:31.439
 easily downloading the 2005 c ++ visual 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.770
 GTA 4 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.320
 I mean the visual c ++ 2005 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.110
 available on microsoft's website 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.480
 it works the game has to be gta 4 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.960
 return there leaving the link to download 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.719
 in the video description someone even 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:54.500
 so your game does not open the board 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.500
 you download a pacs 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.460
 and it is this pac that goes live all 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:07.250
 patios for gta 4 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:11.870
 and more the ace and the fixed of the games 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:14.750
 ok you will copy this content comes 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:21.530
 Here the pact so with all 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:24.290
 games 11.11 up to 1,700 here on crack 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:29.240
 that goes on here is that our 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:31.670
 file here you will copy the 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:37.899
 passes the root of your game where there is even 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.899
 four in the case my stock 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.140
 You 're not saying this in here. 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:55.030
 replacing also done done that if 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:59.980
 your game persists in not opening you 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:03.580
 will simply remove or delete this 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.290
 dll inside this folder ok its not hers at 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.470
 direct x 9 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.509
 but you having directx 9 installed on 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:15.250
 your computer will give a kind of 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:19.180
 conflict with it and so the game is 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:22.000
 finding you alone by excluding this 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.250
 danielle or by removing from the 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.740
 You'll only be able to play the happy gta of 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:32.770
 life and the demon of going will not go any more 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:35.320
 torments is a somewhat weird solution 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.530
 but it works I did it worked 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:41.400
 Ok, in case I was suspicious, I just came 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.870
 here I removed put in another folder 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.060
 you are going to be clicking here at the top of 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.060
 game running as administrator 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:56.140
 it still does not work 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.640
 leave in the comments of the video is not only 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.070
