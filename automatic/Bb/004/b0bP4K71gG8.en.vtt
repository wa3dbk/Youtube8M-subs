00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.810
 I will tell you a bit about the plot of this 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.330
 first episode and then I will give my opinion 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.489
 well the chapter is called homero land 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.380
 since it really has nothing to do 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:32.210
 with the plot this episode name 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.160
 but then I will tell you why the beginning 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.170
 with the same intro always in the 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.630
 blackboard but with one of his sentences that 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.910
 this time he said 25 years and they have not been 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.770
 another Luisa punishment happened instead of 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.809
 play the saxophone play the harp and the 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.850
 normal rest good already in the episode 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.649
 homero goes with carl and with glenn already a 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.809
 plant workers convention 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.550
 nuclear where homero goes drunk to 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.710
 willem come to springfield again 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.659
 and they see the family of homero but homero 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.519
 did not come with nick meat and good 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:00.679
 after the nothing appears homero with 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.719
 a changed attitude does not drink beer 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:05.000
 eat pork among other things liza 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.010
 begins to suspect that he is a terrorist and 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.020
 his affirmations take more force when 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.940
 see homero praying on a rug and 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.159
 marking the nuclear plant as a 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.170
 objective and good other things happen 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.210
 minor and homer comes to the 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.159
 plant with a weird artifact and it's going to 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.799
 install at the bottom of the plant 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:24.079
 Lisa tries to stop him but later or 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.759
 less explains everything that I will not tell you 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:27.859
 because I hope you see it and I do not 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.810
 I would like to beat them the episode later 

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:31.850
 they install the artifact that he had brought 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.770
 homero that is really only for 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.750
 cause an odor that will never be removed from 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.369
 the plant and it would spread throughout the 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.530
 nuclear plant but the air 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.569
 conditioning that was where they were going to 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.310
 sending this bad smell was damaged as well 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:45.289
 that closed the nuclear plant and the 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.420
 end of the episode you can notice that 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:49.609
 reopen again or something like that and 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.509
 Homer be the same as before, now 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:52.509
 I will tell you my opinion 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.350
 This is the ugliest chapter I have seen 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.420
 in my life the simpsons did not cause me 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.190
 grace in none of the moments the 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.560
 sofa joke outstanding as 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.330
 always but the rest I did not like the 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.370
 name of the chapter is called 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.270
 homero land already but has nothing to 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.310
 see with this 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.380
 I did not really understand the plot with 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.600
 who calls himself simpson nation good 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.640
 I would have to wait for the next chapters to 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.800
 see what if they improve the plot or you 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.110
 they placed the nation season without are 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.940
 for flirting a little good every week 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.739
 I will upload a video with a review of each 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.260
 chapter of simpson nation that I think that 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:39.030
 started with the left foot well this 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.030
 everything has been until the next venues
