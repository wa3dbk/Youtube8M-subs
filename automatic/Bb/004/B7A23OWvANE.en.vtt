00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
stairway now example of this your tread

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.920 
stairway now example of this your tread
and<00:00:36.960> your<00:00:37.920> riser<00:00:38.280> should<00:00:39.090> add<00:00:39.390> up<00:00:39.719> to

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
and your riser should add up to

be<00:00:42.180> close<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:44.250> let's<00:00:44.280> say<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.700> design<00:00:45.149> a

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
be close to it so let's say you design a

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.270 
be close to it so let's say you design a
stairway<00:00:45.899> where<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.200> have<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.350> ten<00:00:46.710> inch<00:00:46.950> wide

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
stairway where you have a ten inch wide

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.479 
stairway where you have a ten inch wide
stair<00:00:47.789> step<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:49.170> have<00:00:49.350> an<00:00:49.530> eight<00:00:49.739> inch

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
stair step and you have an eight inch

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.740 
stair step and you have an eight inch
stair<00:00:51.360> riser<00:00:51.719> that's<00:00:52.649> 18<00:00:53.340> inches<00:00:53.789> you're<00:00:54.420> not

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
stair riser that's 18 inches you're not

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.260 
stair riser that's 18 inches you're not
too<00:00:55.050> far<00:00:55.379> off<00:00:55.590> from<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.920> 17<00:00:56.579> inches<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.090> this

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
too far off from the 17 inches so this

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.639 
too far off from the 17 inches so this
probably<00:00:57.629> isn't<00:00:57.899> going<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.410> be<00:00:58.530> an

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
probably isn't going to be an

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.039 
probably isn't going to be an
uncomfortable<00:00:59.390> stair<00:01:00.390> step<00:01:00.780> but<00:01:02.300> if<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.750> have

we add the 10 inches to the 4 inches we

to stair trip believe it or not this
will<00:01:35.310> still<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:35.850> something<00:01:36.409> that<00:01:37.409> won't<00:01:37.710> be<00:01:37.979> as

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
will still be something that won't be as

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.190 
will still be something that won't be as
uncomfortable<00:01:38.700> as<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.150> think<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.600> walk<00:01:39.930> up

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
uncomfortable as you think to walk up

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.969 
uncomfortable as you think to walk up
and<00:01:40.409> down<00:01:40.590> now<00:01:41.340> if<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.520> have<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.700> 15<00:01:42.390> inch<00:01:42.979> stair

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
and down now if you have a 15 inch stair

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.789 
and down now if you have a 15 inch stair
tread<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.850> six-inch<00:01:45.360> stair<00:01:45.720> riser<00:01:45.990> it's

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
tread and a six-inch stair riser it's

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.510 
tread and a six-inch stair riser it's
going<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.549> be<00:01:48.439> harder<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.619> walk<00:01:49.829> up<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.310> down

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
going to be harder to walk up and down

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.179 
going to be harder to walk up and down
this<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.180> might<00:01:52.020> not<00:01:52.229> make<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.500> lot<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.799> sense

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
this so might not make a lot of sense

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.429 
this so might not make a lot of sense
but<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.790> can<00:01:54.000> try<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.299> out<00:01:54.540> if<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.110> want<00:01:55.320> to

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
but you can try it out if you want to

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.840 
but you can try it out if you want to
cut<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.649> whole<00:01:55.829> bunch<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.159> different<00:01:56.520> sets<00:01:56.729> of

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
cut a whole bunch of different sets of

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.359 
cut a whole bunch of different sets of
stairs<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.479> see<00:01:57.659> what<00:01:57.840> I'm<00:01:57.960> talking<00:01:58.409> about<00:01:58.740> if

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
stairs and see what I'm talking about if

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.920 
stairs and see what I'm talking about if
you<00:01:59.610> don't<00:01:59.729> want<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.030> do<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.420> pay<00:02:00.899> attention

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
you don't want to do that pay attention

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.969 
you don't want to do that pay attention
to<00:02:01.920> when<00:02:02.100> you're<00:02:02.130> walking<00:02:02.549> around<00:02:03.979> different
