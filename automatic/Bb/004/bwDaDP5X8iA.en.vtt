00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
actually so easy I mean I thought I've

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.940 
actually so easy I mean I thought I've
never<00:01:15.180> done<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.509> before<00:01:15.689> but<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.380> thought<00:01:16.830> it

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
never done it before but I thought it

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.190 
never done it before but I thought it
was<00:01:17.040> gonna<00:01:17.159> be<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.580> difficult<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.600> actually

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
was gonna be so difficult it is actually

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.440 
was gonna be so difficult it is actually
super<00:01:19.619> easy<00:01:19.650> if<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.310> have<00:01:20.340> an<00:01:20.670> extruder<00:01:21.180> gun

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
super easy if you have an extruder gun

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.330 
super easy if you have an extruder gun
and<00:01:21.750> just<00:01:22.340> a<00:01:23.340> can<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.820> Crisco<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.540> mean<00:01:24.930> it's

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
and just a can of Crisco I mean it's

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.179 
and just a can of Crisco I mean it's
totally<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:27.150> easy<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.630> do<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.229> think<00:01:28.860> it

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
totally so easy to do and I think it

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.870 
totally so easy to do and I think it
came<00:01:29.400> out<00:01:29.720> really<00:01:30.720> pretty<00:01:31.280> now<00:01:32.280> I'm<00:01:32.579> not<00:01:32.850> sure

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
you can really tell but I added some

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.399 
you can really tell but I added some
little<00:01:36.659> crystals<00:01:37.439> over<00:01:38.030> here<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.630> these<00:01:40.259> are

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
little crystals over here and these are

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.440 
little crystals over here and these are
edible

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
edible

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.050 
edible
sorry<00:01:42.450> about<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.720> these<00:01:43.140> are<00:01:43.170> edible<00:01:44.060> but

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
sorry about that these are edible but

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.170 
sorry about that these are edible but
these<00:01:45.270> little<00:01:45.479> rhinestones<00:01:46.439> are<00:01:46.710> not<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.610> you

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
these little rhinestones are not so you

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.660 
these little rhinestones are not so you
know<00:01:48.649> kind<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:49.710> nobody's<00:01:50.250> really<00:01:50.399> gonna<00:01:50.549> eat

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
know kind of nobody's really gonna eat

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.389 
know kind of nobody's really gonna eat
that<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.960> figured<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.740> just<00:01:52.950> add<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.280> little

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
that so I figured I just add the little

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.609 
that so I figured I just add the little
rhinestones<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.540> bring<00:01:54.930> out<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.380> little

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
rhinestones to bring out the little

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.569 
rhinestones to bring out the little
crown<00:01:57.079> I<00:01:58.369> made<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.610> ruffles<00:02:00.119> on<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.600> cake<00:02:00.930> out

crown I made the ruffles on the cake out

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.780 
crown I made the ruffles on the cake out
of<00:02:03.020> gum<00:02:04.020> paste<00:02:04.100> even<00:02:05.100> though<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.430> cake<00:02:05.610> is

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
of gum paste even though the cake is

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.660 
of gum paste even though the cake is
covered<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.240> fondant<00:02:07.220> you<00:02:08.220> know<00:02:08.310> there<00:02:08.459> was<00:02:08.550> no

covered in fondant you know there was no

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.420 
covered in fondant you know there was no
way<00:02:08.879> for<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.209> ruffles<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.959> dry<00:02:10.250> with<00:02:11.250> that

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
way for the ruffles to dry with that

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.640 
way for the ruffles to dry with that
look<00:02:11.700> if<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:12.060> use<00:02:12.330> just<00:02:12.540> plain<00:02:12.780> fondant

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650
