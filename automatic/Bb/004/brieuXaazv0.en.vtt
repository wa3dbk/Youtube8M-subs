into that blind very early on as we

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.950 
into that blind very early on as we
mentioned<00:02:11.220> earlier<00:02:11.310> but

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
mentioned earlier but

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.530 
mentioned earlier but

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
able to resell put into that deep freeze

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.810 
able to resell put into that deep freeze
and<00:02:16.760> that<00:02:17.600> was<00:02:17.750> detrimental<00:02:17.930> to<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:19.520> demise

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
and that was detrimental to the demise

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.850 
and that was detrimental to the demise
of<00:02:20.210> inner<00:02:20.510> fire<00:02:20.720> and<00:02:21.020> now<00:02:21.170> we<00:02:21.230> have<00:02:21.350> AAA

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
of inner fire and now we have AAA

Matthew go up on three points to one

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.530 
Matthew go up on three points to one
which<00:02:25.430> means<00:02:25.460> they<00:02:25.850> are<00:02:26.000> now<00:02:26.150> at<00:02:26.300> match<00:02:26.510> point

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
which means they are now at match point

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.620 
which means they are now at match point
