00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:01.519
 A person 

00:00:01.519 --> 00:00:06.049
 Upgraded version of operation agency complete assembly 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.429
 I was doing a full denial-being true 2.02 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:12.489
 Yeah what 

00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:15.489
 The feature this time is less 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.059
 ma 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.800
 Sashimi s high buying habit 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.369
 When saying Nagano, there is a thing that made one work name of the hello 2004 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:29.180
 I made it 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.020
 Released in 2005 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.250
 The arch made to know the release made in 39 in five years 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.890
 5 years to 5 years 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.649
 Five years later, in the meantime I would have seven works 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:42.980
 High cropped treasure 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.930
 Naturally, the level has risen considerably 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.000
 Shot 7 because 7 consecutive wins are on 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:51.630
 After the large integrated shooting 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.920
 Or that one at the editing stage 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.580
 Otomo 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.960
 I'm also doing a video adjustment for myself but I'm better than 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.620
 When shooting when shooting 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.120
 It was an entry 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.399
 After that how to take that sound 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:10.250
 Won 50 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.759
 Speaking of who was improved by 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:13.970
 I did not confess 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.490
 It became white and it got better 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.040
 So what does it mean to do other things? 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.760
 For example, even that recording of you Izumo-cho with some wings 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.160
 Mikawa 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.780
 With emphasis on the south 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.100
 Because there is little, it tries doing that djamena bgm this time for the first time 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.100
 It seems that I was talking about 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.100
 Describe the decoration light and dark 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.840
 I'm eliminating that 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.300
 Now that's a problem 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.530
 4th 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.760
 Mano is not doing anything 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.770
 Of these 10 points have not been taken 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.120
 I'm not doing anything about that special shooting 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.570
 I used a macro to have that lens as a standard 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.490
 Fair 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.200
 I use macros for only a few 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.829
 If you can play already, there is nothing else in the plan 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:07.490
 Because it is good 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.920
 It's sashimi if you cook it, it's like that french food 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:14.499
 It was sent 

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:16.419
 I would like to use beer individually 

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:17.629
 Not the government 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:18.949
 Charcoal 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:22.119
 Five years have passed since that previous work 

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:26.919
 After that, I of a private residence of 05 years ago that more than a dozen people went down was natural 

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:30.009
 It is different that the version is up now 

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:33.809
 It is said that this is written 

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:36.809
 Maybe a little 

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:41.619
 About the visitor who comes for the first time in years 

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:45.150
 I went to the opening ceremony and I couldn't squeeze my tongue out 

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:46.019
 That's why 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.069
 I have been offering it to me a few years ago 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:56.969
 I wish I was bad five years ago 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:06.299
 I got a little different again 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:07.090
 Eight degrees 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.959
 2.0. 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.959
 I wanted to see the position I made 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:13.930
 please look
