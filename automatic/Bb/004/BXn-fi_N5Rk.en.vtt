00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.389
 hi to all his rioux sheets so 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.719
 today I will offer you a 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.890
 small adjustment on the nissan fairlady z 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.990
 2003 so a little drift adjustment 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.910
 as usual then on the last 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.080
 video of the scion you have been I you 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.510
 had asked precisely what you 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.560
 wanted as a car and everything so there I 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.449
 have not done so yet 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.330
 you had apparently asked for the chevy 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.520
 camaro the new so that I'm going to see 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.309
 if I hang or not and the rx-8 so I 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.690
 have not tested them personally 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.239
 I had a big crush again in 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.309
 done on this fairlady z 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.620
 so a few months ago I had you 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.239
 proposed the 370z who really had a 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.399
 good behavior he advised to 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.350
 beginners well i was really 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.790
 also surprised by this fairlady z which has 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.070
 a behavior absolutely 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.690
 nickel what there is she does all that 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.400
 you ask him there is no problem 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.960
 she is really hanging on the ground 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.690
 we can really have fun without 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.460
 to take the lead with this one and 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.839
 Then I had a second shot of 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.220
 heart last night it's by doing the 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:10.100
 small 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.460
 challenge two rivals with the 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.990
 at mijanÃ¨s 14 so there I really was 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.280
 pleasantly surprised by this car 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.380
 so what I'm going to do is you 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.740
 propose it in the in the second 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.830
 video 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.270
 I'm already going to slap that one here and 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.189
 then after that I will propose you the 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.560
 nissan s 14 and then as said for 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.090
 the ones you asked chevy 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.350
 harry camaro away I'll see must 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.149
 that tests if I hang so 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.310
 I do not hang on apparently good rx-8 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.729
 is not bad a friend told me that it 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.170
 was worth it so I'll see all this 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.460
 my about making the couches state 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.800
 with friends last night so on 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.210
 indiana police so small turns 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.560
 Missing it was a little conquered 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.970
 but it is to show you already the 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.979
 behavior of the car she takes from 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.659
 very very good angles there is no 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.039
 problem 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.140
 you find a good grip in 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:57.210
 the turn is really no problem there we 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.490
 has a rx 7 that steals a little bit 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.900
 Here bah about this car it 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.299
 nothing more to say except it's a 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.740
 real little treat what so what 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.110
 will do is we will attack the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.110
 part settings so we'll already left 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:14.959
 the idle we will already see the parts 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:17.550
 than to improve what we installed on it 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.580
 and here we wait for his charge a 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.590
 little bit so do not hesitate I 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.020
 you say it every time but it takes 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.000
 it takes two seconds is 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.440
 not to subscribe to like the videos that 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.440
 encourage me to do others too 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.769
 so that's it said and now I 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.700
 so let's show you at the level of 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.439
 installed parts 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.379
 so at the motor level we will start 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:43.590
 by that the air filter he is in the race 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:46.120
 the intake manifold is in the race 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.500
 running food candle 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.530
 ignition in race 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.409
 the silencer running the camshaft 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.239
 it's en route the valves are in 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:58.299
 road too 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.170
 the engine block is original pistons 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.719
 are in the race 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.750
 the radiator is running and the thief 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:06.189
 liar in the race too here is here on 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.319
 to all the parts in the race then and 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:10.480
 sparte and here the same everything going on 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.239
 the web door at tire level like 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.340
 of hab one puts of the rubber road and the 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.500
 level of tire width to 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.609
 the front I have not touched and the width 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.500
 tires on the back I put the 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:24.579
 second dimension and therefore first 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.139
 second so that's 255 1 the rims 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.819
 the same you put what you want this 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:30.280
 who's going to paint what and people 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.109
 jamie 19 for me so 19 in the front 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.889
 and 19 at the back 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:38.260
 ok then at the level of the aero goes no 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:40.000
 force to a forza ring and you put 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.310
 at the right bumper level crate all 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.720
 as said what you like but just 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.939
 no strength it is not support 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.590
 in fact then motor level I have not 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:50.019
 changed I left the original one 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.299
 rwd transmission of origin so we 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:55.629
 leave and change of aspiration I 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:58.629
 left of origin to his family therefore 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:59.769
 concerning the settings part then at 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:03.159
 tire pressure level 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:05.319
 I am 2.1 in the front and 2.1 in the back 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:08.139
 at the report level of the box 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:11.650
 speed so the total ratio is at 3.40 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:16.329
 the first is at 2.89 the second 1 99 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:19.989
 the third to 1 51 the fourth invents the 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.310
 fifth to 1 and the sixth to 0.85 so 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.990
 as said compared to the circuits 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.250
 do not hesitate to change to the limit you 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.990
 start already with their total intake 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.669
 you put more in acceleration if 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.130
 they lack potatoes or more 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:32.050
 speed if you want more than she 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.669
 go up in the turns are your turn 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.849
 if you have wide turns or not 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.529
 what are you already trying like that so at 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:39.689
 level of alignment the camber to 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:42.989
 the front I am at least 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:46.049
 2.1 and at the back I'm at minus 1.5 

00:04:42.989 --> 00:04:49.679
 the parallelism in the front I am at 0 and 

00:04:46.049 --> 00:04:53.519
 in the back I'm at -0 5 and the hunt 

00:04:49.679 --> 00:04:56.569
 of the vehicle and at 4.9 anti-roll bars 

00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:59.159
 I am 19 at the front and 16 at the back 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:03.779
 at the level of the hardness of the springs so 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:05.729
 I am at 116.9 in front and 98.5 in 

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:08.789
 the back and the ground clearance and the 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:11.639
 minimum the stiffness damper of the 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:14.279
 relax so in the front I'm at 7.3 and 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:17.969
 at the rear seated rigidity of 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:20.579
 depreciation at 6.5 in the front and 5.2 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:22.110
 in the back so aerodynamics does not have 

00:05:20.579 --> 00:05:24.329
 put in touch not braking it's according to 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.449
 what you do so it does not play and 

00:05:24.329 --> 00:05:30.119
 accelerations 83% for the differential 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:32.219
 and 71% deceleration 

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:33.989
 this is the end of our little setting on 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:36.899
 the fairlady z 2003 i'm going right now 

00:05:33.989 --> 00:05:39.389
 chained the video with the nissan s 14 

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:40.829
 hoping that these two videos there you 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:43.499
 please do not hesitate to subscribe to 

00:05:40.829 --> 00:05:45.269
 love too and then I'll make you 

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:48.019
 others also that a hazard soon 

00:05:45.269 --> 00:05:48.019
 everyone ciao
