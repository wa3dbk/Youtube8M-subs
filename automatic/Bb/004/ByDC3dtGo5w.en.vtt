 Have you ever tasted a typical Italian coffee? 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.310
 that of superior aroma and taste 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.890
 You do not have to go to Italy to 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:30.019
 try cadence stainless steel coffee maker 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:34.020
 this prepares the true Italian coffee 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:37.739
 How much refinement is it not? 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.640

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.070

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.610
 The coffee maker itself solves you have a 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.840
 set water level for example 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:01.039
 for 6 coffee I put it there later 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.460

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:06.810

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.380
 according to your taste what goes 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.730
 happens here when people 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.140

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:50.460
