Apple<00:01:59.850> but<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.540> very<00:02:00.659> fact<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:01.140> they've<00:02:01.290> got

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
Apple but the very fact that they've got

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.859 
Apple but the very fact that they've got
basically<00:02:02.399> no<00:02:02.670> growth<00:02:02.939> in<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.240> first<00:02:03.450> half<00:02:03.689> of

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
basically no growth in the first half of

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.510 
basically no growth in the first half of
the<00:02:03.960> year<00:02:03.990> means<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:04.439> they<00:02:04.560> really<00:02:05.040> do<00:02:05.250> need

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
the year means that they really do need

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.089 
the year means that they really do need
some<00:02:05.969> kind<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.390> kick<00:02:06.659> in<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.439> second<00:02:07.770> half<00:02:07.950> of

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
some kind of kick in the second half of

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.440 
some kind of kick in the second half of
the<00:02:08.190> year<00:02:08.220> for<00:02:08.459> them<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.700> get<00:02:08.789> any<00:02:09.030> kind<00:02:09.300> of

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
the year for them to get any kind of

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.050 
the year for them to get any kind of
revenue<00:02:09.750> growth<00:02:09.989> for<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.770> full<00:02:11.009> year<00:02:11.039> so<00:02:11.879> they

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
revenue growth for the full year so they

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.370 
revenue growth for the full year so they
really<00:02:12.330> do<00:02:12.629> need<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.959> see<00:02:13.140> some

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
really do need to see some

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.740 
really do need to see some

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
these new products come online they need

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.690 
these new products come online they need
to<00:02:15.870> push<00:02:16.080> them<00:02:16.290> out<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.680> market<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.220> they

to push them out to the market and they

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.310 
to push them out to the market and they
need<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:18.090> get<00:02:18.210> some<00:02:18.420> growth<00:02:18.660> out<00:02:18.870> of<00:02:19.020> them<00:02:19.140> so

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
need to get some growth out of them so

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.960 
need to get some growth out of them so
that<00:02:19.350> they<00:02:19.590> themselves<00:02:19.830> can<00:02:20.370> get<00:02:20.520> some<00:02:20.700> sales

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
that they themselves can get some sales

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.490 
that they themselves can get some sales
through<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.870> end<00:02:22.020> of<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.200> year<00:02:22.350> and<00:02:22.410> of

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
through the end of the year and of

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.140 
through the end of the year and of
course<00:02:22.710> sales<00:02:23.010> are<00:02:23.340> hopefully<00:02:23.850> would<00:02:23.970> lead

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
course sales are hopefully would lead

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.530 
course sales are hopefully would lead
through<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.570> profit<00:02:24.990> at<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.170> end<00:02:25.260> of<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.500> year
