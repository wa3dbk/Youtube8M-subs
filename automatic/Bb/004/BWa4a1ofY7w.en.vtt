00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:15.109
 Hello dear team show how they run is good and evil stand in a live cd 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:16.619
 can transform 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.460
 This can be very useful for several things, among other things we have to 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.189
 someone else with his system 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.699
 whose system but IT should no longer correctly evaluate optimally one 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.899
 Of course he does not have live cd so now we can 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:33.769
 the whole of course, as always Live CD but often it is so 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:37.110
 that even those reckless are not necessarily the programs out of them 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.980
 which we need 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.270
 Of course we have the current one on our own system 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.130
 Virus scanner on the weekend I have it after the install or similar 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.020
 Programs that are potentially useful leaders 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.860
 Therefore, it can make sense to your own system to a live cd 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.670
 Bremen 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.060
 own site next to it around in the area 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.920
 and what is very important is what we need on our computer 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.260
 at least 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.530
 50 percent 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.550
 free hard drive 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.330
 in other words, our plate of it will be six in the field 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.840
 We start by clicking System 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.410
 System administration 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.540
 and too often very practical to select sources 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.780
 Give postulants shortly 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.690
 Carpenter Dr Carter continues to need other software or kick and then 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.570
 then click on add 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.130
 the intention will be 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.990
 there we discover one 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.410
 had DB double colon / 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.900
 www point 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.820
 Peek 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.720
 Cognac seemed 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.830
 Point Borg 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.520
 great Stuhr 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.770
 so is 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.120
 / 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.570
 Red thousand euros lie 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.810
 Courses should 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.520
 Question mark cartoon 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.170
 / 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.369
 The APK landmark has the DB colon double between the 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.069
 Highlight like Beeck 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:07.340
 collective and Bayer 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.599
 / great master is like that 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.310
 That's how the break Tory came about 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.359
 Dial tone comic / 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:16.639
 to schools 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:18.679
 shut down 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:21.679
 Neugraben 

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:30.529
 After that it is possible to use applications 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:31.339
 hearing 

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:34.689
 Open appointments window 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:38.180
 that should now go into the race by itself is something like that 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.239
 Out 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.239
 Weekly title Bilstein Solo Abt 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.459
 - honored 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.359
 Vienna's goals 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:50.359
 Primar bothered so is 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:53.619
 groundskeeper 

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:57.189
 What is currently there 30 megawatts have to be reloaded 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:00.759
 give twice yuan 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.560
 after everything is installed we should be more entertained by the system 

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:14.989
 System administration will have a new entry name as well as Mosters US Bancorp 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.819
 so now also get here even unnecessary garbage and our live CD 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:23.409
 Maybe we should burn in and everything unimportant 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:28.069
 remove such as the complete meltdown from around the firefox 4 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:29.019
 such things 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.700
 we still had the possibility to exclude individual directories completely 

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:37.139
 At the end, the whole percent DVD should not get bigger than here at five 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:41.120
 The software is currently not able to be more gigawatt than that 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.509
 somehow try 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:47.229
 KNA burn ten gigabytes of partition on it and for that he gets double the 

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:48.240
 Woman who needs 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.869
 that will not work yet they need to be normal 

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:52.779
 stay d4 d5 

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:55.479
 to that extent can be clearly useful individual directories 

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:58.629
 I've definitely cleaned up my trash 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:03.029
 and some and important files or thrown 

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:07.069
 so instead of just the program so simple family several ways that 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.239
 Program is very good 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.429
 And of course, we're not all about what I do first, clean 

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:16.799
 Remus the driller of Israel 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.919
 without even throwing more files out we do not necessarily 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.400
 need 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.750
 so that would be nothing unnecessary packing so and then targeted for 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.400
 our purpose is the point and downhill necessary it is simply chosen on 

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:32.300
 glued 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.759
 are unsure 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:35.620
 we are sure 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.570
 now the whole Luxor is optimally but always natural 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.400
 not anymore with this calculator 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.970
 We have to do that now for half an hour of 40 minutes depending on 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.309
 how fast her system is left alone during her whole wrapping 

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:50.670
 should approach during this processor 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.909
 come to the slightest error message 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:55.800
 in the form of a Pop Art so here we do not need to worry 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.280
 How is it all going on? 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.150
 but it may be time if they do not have enough space the tre the robe 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.960
 and reported 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.140
 all at once there is too little space on the system they only have 300 megabytes more free 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:07.050
 or similar 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.070
 if you say I have a small position 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.770
 it is for us 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.099
 5 50% is documented, he said in the beginning 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:18.559
 we should optimally have at least 50 percent free so if they say so 

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:23.210
 Church 5 would have 5% or 5 1% 2 then it may be that their system brings 

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:25.180
 and when such error messages occur 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.300
 then the whole thing probably did not work 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.720
 or they do not want to take any chances there 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.870
 That's why we now have to pay attention that it goes through without errors 

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:47.039
 so the Wars for get the message that in the directory Holmgren Rimas 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:50.050
 Course and the corresponding the solid 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.379
 already briefly at the break 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:55.379
 Komatsu 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:09.559
 should be what that is 

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:12.129
 and her DRK Steinbeck Therapy like that 

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:14.729
 in this case, one thing in common is the violence 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:17.740
 the whole thing is of course synonymous for the DVD burned 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.190
 The PIN is a Windows system, which is why I already here 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.139
 the food gets done by Windows XP Calculator 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:28.400
 the CD is lying and yesterday just restart 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.900
 Select accessories 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:50.510
 Moritz KÃ¼hlmeyer found very briefly what we need the standard 

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:53.659
 Life System is started live in simple words 

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:56.659
 So there is a valent 

00:06:57.399 --> 00:07:00.019
 We are glad that all this now we have to see that it is not 

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:03.639
 the usual blue screen of saxony-anhalt of a normal want 

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:06.639
 to Live CD 

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:12.259
 that is quite different from theirs 

00:07:22.059 --> 00:07:24.270
 that's how it is and ours 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.369
 own computers have been transformed into a control system 

00:07:27.369 --> 00:07:30.369
 works wonderfully 

00:07:36.069 --> 00:07:38.349
