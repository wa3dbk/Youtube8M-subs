high<00:01:32.159> school<00:01:33.150> man<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.540> was

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
high school man it was

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.359 
high school man it was
like<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.840> straight<00:01:34.229> destruction<00:01:34.890> game<00:01:35.130> and

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
like a straight destruction game and

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.120 
like a straight destruction game and
like<00:01:35.549> philly<00:01:36.150> Jesus<00:01:36.540> wasn't<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.979> know

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
like philly Jesus wasn't in it you know

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.830 
like philly Jesus wasn't in it you know
I'm<00:01:38.250> saying<00:01:38.610> if<00:01:38.729> they<00:01:38.880> continue<00:01:39.600> if<00:01:39.689> they

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
I'm saying if they continue if they

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.620 
I'm saying if they continue if they
bring<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.290> back<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.220> Philadelphia<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.240> think

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630

Miami should sweep these guys I think

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.050 
Miami should sweep these guys I think
Miami<00:01:45.630> should<00:01:45.810> sue<00:01:45.990> these<00:01:46.170> guys<00:01:47.060> Philadelphia

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
down to the wire even though I didn't

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.890 
down to the wire even though I didn't
like<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:43.890> way<00:02:43.920> that<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:45.060> patient's<00:02:45.569> finished

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
like the way that the patient's finished

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.860

the<00:02:46.530> game<00:02:47.370> by<00:02:47.849> shooting<00:02:48.239> that<00:02:48.300> three-point<00:02:48.780> I

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
the game by shooting that three-point I

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.910 
the game by shooting that three-point I
think<00:02:49.050> they<00:02:49.140> put<00:02:49.290> a<00:02:49.349> stretch<00:02:49.680> that<00:02:49.890> I

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
think they put a stretch that I

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.670 
think they put a stretch that I
definitely<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:50.940> you<00:02:51.420> know<00:02:51.569> get<00:02:52.440> an<00:02:52.530> easy

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
definitely and you know get an easy

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.130 
definitely and you know get an easy
basket<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.430> refile<00:02:53.940> because<00:02:54.450> if<00:02:54.750> they<00:02:54.959> hit

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
basket and refile because if they hit

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.229 
basket and refile because if they hit
the<00:02:55.319> three<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:55.980> was<00:02:56.250> like<00:02:56.430> Chicago<00:02:57.030> would<00:02:57.150> have

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
the three it was like Chicago would have

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.699 
the three it was like Chicago would have
still<00:02:57.420> had<00:02:57.659> to<00:02:57.870> go<00:02:58.080> back<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.409> the<00:02:58.440> free-throw

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
still had to go back to the free-throw

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.740 
still had to go back to the free-throw
line<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:59.220> know<00:02:59.340> i'm<00:02:59.400> saying<00:02:59.640> so<00:02:59.730> they<00:03:00.540> could

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
line you know i'm saying so they could

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.270 
line you know i'm saying so they could
have<00:03:00.840> stretched<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.319> out<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.800> then<00:03:01.830> trying

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
have stretched that out and then trying

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.009 
have stretched that out and then trying
to<00:03:02.340> hit<00:03:02.459> a<00:03:02.489> three<00:03:02.819> and<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.300> know<00:03:03.420> let<00:03:03.750> it<00:03:03.810> be

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
to hit a three and you know let it be

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.990 
to hit a three and you know let it be
like<00:03:04.200> that<00:03:04.260> one<00:03:04.680> they<00:03:05.099> didn't<00:03:05.430> do<00:03:05.550> that<00:03:05.760> and

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
like that one they didn't do that and

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.300 
like that one they didn't do that and
also<00:03:06.180> that<00:03:06.599> file<00:03:06.870> that<00:03:07.409> he<00:03:07.500> called<00:03:07.739> Roy

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
also that file that he called Roy

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.130 
also that file that he called Roy
Hibbert<00:03:08.730> doesn't<00:03:09.239> know<00:03:09.360> thought<00:03:09.690> I<00:03:09.720> was<00:03:09.989> no

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140
