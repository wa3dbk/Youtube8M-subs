00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
even with a felt lining so it becomes a

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.960 
even with a felt lining so it becomes a

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
the bottom layer does wear out they're

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.290 
the bottom layer does wear out they're

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
horses do not get nearly as sore and

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.469 
horses do not get nearly as sore and
generally<00:04:54.400> when<00:04:54.550> I'm<00:04:54.699> working<00:04:55.060> on<00:04:55.120> them<00:04:55.270> I'm

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
generally when I'm working on them I'm

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:57.689 
generally when I'm working on them I'm
only<00:04:55.810> dealing<00:04:56.199> with<00:04:56.410> temporary<00:04:57.040> soreness

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699 
only dealing with temporary soreness

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:01.020 
only dealing with temporary soreness
that<00:04:58.540> occurred<00:04:58.930> because<00:04:59.380> of<00:04:59.919> the<00:05:00.340> travel<00:05:00.639> and

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
that occurred because of the travel and

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.290 
that occurred because of the travel and
the<00:05:01.840> extremes<00:05:02.800> and<00:05:03.040> their<00:05:03.190> performance<00:05:03.820> but<00:05:04.270> I

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
the extremes and their performance but I

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.080 
the extremes and their performance but I
recommend<00:05:04.720> this<00:05:05.050> it<00:05:05.229> works<00:05:05.470> great<00:05:05.889> for<00:05:06.190> horses

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
recommend this it works great for horses

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.030 
recommend this it works great for horses
that<00:05:07.210> have<00:05:07.419> a<00:05:07.450> problem<00:05:07.750> but<00:05:08.740> it's<00:05:08.919> a

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
that have a problem but it's a

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.100 
that have a problem but it's a
preventative<00:05:09.400> measure<00:05:09.639> as<00:05:10.210> well<00:05:10.450> and<00:05:10.780> I

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
preventative measure as well and I

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.750 
preventative measure as well and I
recommend<00:05:11.470> them<00:05:11.710> to<00:05:11.770> all<00:05:11.919> our<00:05:12.040> customers<00:05:12.550> we
