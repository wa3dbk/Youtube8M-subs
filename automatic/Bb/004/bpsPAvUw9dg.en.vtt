00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.660
 called 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:41.150
 it is a test one of the basics 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.760
 know the chrome ox from freezing or walking 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.890

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.309
 your talent will succeed what 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.309
 template 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.690
 we start first with the attitude of 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.470
 a how exactly you should stand for the 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.950
 next up is very important with the 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.860
 wrong posture makes it even more difficult 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.300
 to stole the neck 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.360
 ok we we go first we go and 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.180
 legs slightly set apart and we 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.430
 lay the ball and for us between ours 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.140
 opinion 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.140
 can we go and pick up the ball 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.320
 body all the way forward and balls too 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:35.869
 we pick up and we stay with our backs 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.229
 to the front and so you grab the ball 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:41.420
 so you have idea is you pick up that you lay 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.899
 in your neck 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.160
 and then you go with your chin you go up and 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.960
 up 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.110
 then you feel that it is coming to a pit 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.170
 sit and in your neck 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.420
 meanwhile shoulders in one then you feel already 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.789
 that more certainty 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.380
 the neighbor grab song shoulder up and 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:01.990
 In the beginning you would actually have one 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.939
 can do little than type of wings 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.250
 up 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.799
 that actually ensures that it still 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.079
 firmly in place 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:14.959
 we can finally have the ball 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:17.630
 nick laid but then you also need him 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.329
 of course, can go during the high 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.709
 well before we start doing it right away 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:24.170
 keep an eye on it 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.260
 let's first throw it up 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.739
 straight up you go exactly that 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.400
 position grab one point down 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.620
 with your back straight and your chin up 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.250
 in shoulders 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:42.190
 possibly to help you have a bag 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.780
 put your knees through so that you hit the ball 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.420
 accommodates 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.790
 as soon as you stand still with your knee 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.989
 can not be so four neck or back can that again 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.900
 flap back 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.849
 ensure sir the fall drops you 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.519
 the hiding place 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.920
 and then sweet knees our ball sinks well 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.470
 to catch 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.700
 ok if that goes well you can from a 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:09.599
 Get a squeeze on your foot on wrapping 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:12.129
 and then that's how I get comfortable here 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:15.459
 exactly the same again that you have that 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:18.310

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:21.340

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:31.269

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.690
