00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:18.300
 Lexus introduced the updated SUV 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.430
 gx460 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.470
 appearance of the model has changed so much 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.409
 significant that involuntarily want to call 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.119
 her new same proportions the same body but 

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:29.220
 On the whole, in my opinion, just a car 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.239
 transformed global change 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.820
 in front 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:35.190
 there is no old detail left 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.920
 lean and bored and the face of the previous one 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.920
 models changed to spectacular and 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.920
 aggressive 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:48.440
 new optics huge x-shaped grill 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.410
 new integrated bumper radiator 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.410
 fog new geometry and new 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.660
 the sensations behind the change are not so 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.850
 globally new form of bumper and 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.710
 sidelight in which now placed 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.320
 horizontally they are vertical like on 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.600
 old model a little externally changed 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.180
 taillights although their shape remained 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.700
 the same but due to these not so 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.350
 sweeping as front changes from behind 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.570
 the car also looks where 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.520
 more interesting 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.410
 so jakes bring in full 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.570
 compliance with new corporate 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.700
 lexus style and in my opinion this is one of 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.250
 the most successful restyling in the last 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.259
 time in the cabin external changes 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.240
 virtually no say for the better 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.570
 side exchanged finishing materials 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.580
 there is a new multimedia system 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.200
 But if the salon had changed so much 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.630
 noticeable as a car exterior 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.140
 would definitely have called new 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.130
 by model 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.409
 give away and the appearance of the updated gx460 in 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.390
 sale is not reported to all appearances 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.390
 it will happen this year
