00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.300
 Paulo together back on the stand of Yamaha at the music fair in 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.149
 Frankfurt 2010 

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:14.479
 Percent as it is easy to recognize, we are again with the plain names and 

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:18.050
 next to me stands Wolfgang Schirp series practice is better 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.460
 the product manager for trams 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.099
 Wolfgang the 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.969
 Vogt Tour 2 on set is right next to us so what a nice thing 

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:28.929
 you can say to that 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:29.770
 her skirt 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.539
 Rock-tour Yamaha's image of last year maybe with many people 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:36.540
 a rooted as jazz animal Contini 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.020
 being our roots 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.130
 especially in the tower area also very very violent in the rock area warehouse advertise 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.620
 unfortunately there, Breuer got to know your mom very well 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.460
 Now I'm going to burn artists at Garbsen without the TS and Rivers 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.520
 still want to step indieock corner to cart 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.390
 around slowly and so made his worthy a class job around 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.580
 Starting from small badges in the Amis Doyle of Mattea, Paula Zanzibar got it 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.390
 just so much more space Cologne 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.170
 from m 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.480
 Matter Harper 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.950
 but also possible chromed so there are many options that is Finnish 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.160
 simple as well as very rocking, it is a very big step 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.680
 So better Gloger changes to withdrawal was not it is it falls on 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.800
 that makes the set recognizable from afar as an importer set 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.800
 to many small details 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.990
 like for example now if I need a bit of screws their moment 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.190
 but it is the most striking and his 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.730
 I hope so 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.220
 and at some point she will also be rubber-based based on Crime Man 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.220
 could imagine normal way to the chalet and that attracts thinking 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.530
 that eventually scratched the tire 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.660
 but many little details which now protect with rubber inferior percent 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.880
 the blast of the whole itself is over 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.990
 m the drummers who will be able to see this year 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.320
 Net our video 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.660
 Aladdin may give a lan- Anton himself, according to the old law 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.980
 the search is the elaborate for this bridge construction and Balch Grätsche itself 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.940
 Target a competitor of Sabina or old Ludwig himself it Margot one more 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.489
 not from Dirk Enke 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.590
 they were quite often made of mahogany and this mahogany heritage was something we did 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.829
 So far Mahogany boysen Béglés Margon have not been sitting 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:19.869
 around 

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:23.609
 very very rocking crack first room and I just want to go now I hope 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.279
 that Mick Hucknall is not going now 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:28.279
 Solves problems 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:33.960
 the microphone it pisses but no matter how much time you pay 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.010
 Percent all around successful box set and I am extremely satisfied maybe can 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.480
 to talk to the percentages of Fraport Sloan, that's all he says 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.480
 He gave many different questions to Markus Miller 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.180
 so the topic is addressed in the mat Finnish also with MabThera 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.649
 work out 

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:03.809
 to fit in with the MATHEON MAZ 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:05.049
 but then too 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.790
 now it will be for the sixth overall Finnish so not just smooth 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.820
 Surfaces was already structured 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.330
 I remember the outermost layer of this law is no longer Marconi 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.839
 but ash and percent 

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:19.949
 that almost seems to become a bit three dimensional 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:24.009
 So I think it is both for the rock area as well as for the 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:28.309
 maybe classic range a lot of fantastic finnish doing it and me 

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:31.369
 I was very pleased with what I have already said 

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:33.480
 they present and it really looks 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.690
 Höhenhaus especially the mask wearers who like me personally very well 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.320
 The lure of people on set is already available on the market 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.030
 yes and the blast it also percent you do not like poor but it is 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.540
 not even extremely expensive but the sunset middle class area 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.819
 do not know settled 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.979
 Where sound worldwide will be the power consumer Maddie Bernd Sören 

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:55.529
 Brandy Lepanto 

00:03:55.529 --> 00:03:58.859
 but there is also a messenger himself the sound light it is absolutely r-class 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:05.019
 2 A racy box set of good cue so if you're wrong every opportunity 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.389
 has come to the Frankfurt Music Fair to come here 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:09.099
 visit 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:10.589
 on the former stand 

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:15.049
 then the live performance at Bonn but otherwise our website all 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.249
 possible features specification the whole finnish and so on for 

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:19.779
 mediales on the website 

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:22.039
 Wolfgang thousands of act of admission lies
