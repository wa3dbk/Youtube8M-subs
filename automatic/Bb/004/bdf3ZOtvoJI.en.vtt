00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
but while there's objective it's pretty

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.020

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
out then run back definitely that's

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.760 
out then run back definitely that's
basically<00:01:21.119> why<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.420> always<00:01:21.720> push<00:01:22.110> its<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.530> every

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
basically why I always push its it every

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.310 
basically why I always push its it every
time<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.070> push<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.700> make<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> enemy<00:01:24.930> spawn

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
time you push you make a enemy spawn

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.230 
time you push you make a enemy spawn
where<00:01:25.830> they're<00:01:25.920> supposed<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.759> if<00:01:27.150> you

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
where they're supposed to and if you

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.999 
where they're supposed to and if you
push<00:01:27.509> hard<00:01:27.780> enough<00:01:27.930> when<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.380> kill<00:01:28.619> them<00:01:28.770> no

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
push hard enough when you kill them no

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.640 
push hard enough when you kill them no

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
one else respawn so that's basically why

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.289 
one else respawn so that's basically why
I've<00:01:31.829> always<00:01:31.979> played<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:32.520> way<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:33.060> be<00:01:33.180> your

going<00:01:59.780> to<00:01:59.810> come<00:01:59.960> out<00:02:03.280> or<00:02:04.280> couldn't<00:02:04.940> be<00:02:05.120> going

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
going to come out or couldn't be going

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.700 
going to come out or couldn't be going
into<00:02:05.510> this<00:02:05.600> next<00:02:05.660> room<00:02:06.110> and<00:02:06.230> these<00:02:06.470> will<00:02:06.620> be

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
into this next room and these will be

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.950 
into this next room and these will be
coming<00:02:06.890> out<00:02:07.130> and<00:02:07.370> so<00:02:07.430> rich<00:02:07.640> those<00:02:07.850> down<00:02:08.179> oh<00:02:08.539> it

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
coming out and so rich those down oh it

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.180 
coming out and so rich those down oh it
was<00:02:09.080> all<00:02:09.200> expecting<00:02:09.590> that<00:02:09.679> if<00:02:09.830> someone<00:02:10.009> goes

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
was all expecting that if someone goes

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.620 
was all expecting that if someone goes
down<00:02:10.399> like<00:02:10.580> that<00:02:10.790> and<00:02:10.850> there<00:02:11.210> is<00:02:11.330> someone

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
down like that and there is someone

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.060 
down like that and there is someone
around<00:02:11.870> since<00:02:12.290> you<00:02:12.410> can't<00:02:12.560> hurt<00:02:12.740> them<00:02:12.770> when

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
around since you can't hurt them when

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.100 
around since you can't hurt them when
they're<00:02:13.220> down<00:02:13.340> I<00:02:13.670> just<00:02:14.000> tend<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.630> just<00:02:14.840> run

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
they're down I just tend to just run

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.130 
they're down I just tend to just run
around<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.440> corner<00:02:15.740> hip<00:02:15.920> firing<00:02:16.600> that<00:02:17.600> it's

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
around the corner hip firing that it's

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.140 
around the corner hip firing that it's
pretty<00:02:18.380> funny<00:02:18.650> since<00:02:18.980> if<00:02:19.520> you<00:02:19.700> shoot<00:02:19.910> your

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
pretty funny since if you shoot your

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.550 
pretty funny since if you shoot your
partner<00:02:20.209> or<00:02:20.510> any<00:02:20.600> other<00:02:20.750> time<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.290> missions

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
partner or any other time the missions

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.870 
partner or any other time the missions
failed<00:02:21.740> but<00:02:22.040> if<00:02:22.160> he's<00:02:22.250> down<00:02:22.400> you<00:02:22.640> can<00:02:22.760> just

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
failed but if he's down you can just

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.060 
failed but if he's down you can just
obliterate<00:02:23.300> him<00:02:23.420> yeah<00:02:23.720> but<00:02:24.410> yeah<00:02:24.560> definitely

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
obliterate him yeah but yeah definitely

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.980 
obliterate him yeah but yeah definitely
take<00:02:25.580> advantage<00:02:25.610> of<00:02:25.970> that<00:02:26.120> so<00:02:26.660> this<00:02:26.810> little

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
take advantage of that so this little

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.590 
take advantage of that so this little
slot<00:02:27.350> is<00:02:27.820> really<00:02:28.820> really<00:02:28.940> nice<00:02:29.180> for<00:02:29.450> this

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
slot is really really nice for this

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.570 
slot is really really nice for this
section<00:02:29.870> you<00:02:30.380> can<00:02:30.410> see<00:02:30.920> pretty<00:02:31.100> much<00:02:31.310> all<00:02:31.459> the

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
section you can see pretty much all the

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.190 
section you can see pretty much all the
enemies<00:02:31.670> coming<00:02:32.030> by<00:02:32.300> if<00:02:32.600> you<00:02:32.720> just<00:02:32.900> chill

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200

behind in stairs I mean they can still
hit<00:02:34.760> you<00:02:35.000> but<00:02:35.690> it's<00:02:35.840> much<00:02:36.290> less<00:02:36.500> likely

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
hit you but it's much less likely

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.040 
hit you but it's much less likely
they'll<00:02:37.160> kill<00:02:37.400> you<00:02:37.580> just<00:02:38.570> be<00:02:38.660> covering<00:02:38.900> for
