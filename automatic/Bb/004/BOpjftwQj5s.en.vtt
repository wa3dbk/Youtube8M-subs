feel<00:03:16.600> to<00:03:16.959> grind<00:03:17.320> the<00:03:17.470> actual<00:03:17.829> in<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.100> game<00:03:18.280> to

grind up more characters I think it's

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.110 
buy for you at some point
I<00:04:08.080> think<00:04:08.620> there<00:04:08.800> was<00:04:08.830> also<00:04:09.160> boosts<00:04:09.760> you<00:04:09.910> can

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
I think there was also boosts you can

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.540 
I think there was also boosts you can
get<00:04:10.390> like<00:04:10.600> experience<00:04:11.200> boost<00:04:11.560> or<00:04:11.950> loot<00:04:12.190> drop

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
get like experience boost or loot drop

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.900 
get like experience boost or loot drop
boosts<00:04:13.120> I<00:04:13.330> haven't<00:04:14.170> taken<00:04:15.010> too<00:04:15.370> much<00:04:15.520> look<00:04:15.760> in

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
boosts I haven't taken too much look in

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.210 
boosts I haven't taken too much look in
the<00:04:16.000> dose<00:04:16.180> yet<00:04:16.510> but<00:04:16.930> there's<00:04:17.200> many<00:04:17.680> multiple

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
the dose yet but there's many multiple

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.910 
the dose yet but there's many multiple
ways<00:04:18.520> you<00:04:18.820> can<00:04:19.000> use<00:04:19.030> your<00:04:19.480> real<00:04:19.720> money<00:04:20.020> and<00:04:20.320> of

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
ways you can use your real money and of

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.160 
ways you can use your real money and of
course<00:04:20.950> you<00:04:21.459> have<00:04:21.700> things<00:04:22.480> you<00:04:22.630> can<00:04:22.990> unlock

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.170 
course you have things you can unlock

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.230 
course you have things you can unlock
though<00:04:23.590> without<00:04:23.980> using<00:04:24.550> real<00:04:24.820> money<00:04:24.850> but<00:04:25.210> I

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
though without using real money but I

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.910 
though without using real money but I
don't<00:04:25.480> think<00:04:25.600> you<00:04:25.720> can<00:04:25.900> get<00:04:26.050> costumes<00:04:26.560> without

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
don't think you can get costumes without

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.040 
don't think you can get costumes without
using<00:04:27.100> real<00:04:27.370> money<00:04:27.400> so<00:04:27.910> if<00:04:28.570> you<00:04:28.780> want<00:04:28.960> the

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
using real money so if you want the

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.440 
using real money so if you want the
cosmetics<00:04:29.620> you<00:04:30.010> have<00:04:30.190> to<00:04:30.310> put<00:04:30.460> some<00:04:30.670> mind<00:04:30.910> and

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
cosmetics you have to put some mind and

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.330 
cosmetics you have to put some mind and
that's<00:04:31.660> very<00:04:32.050> reasonable<00:04:32.410> for<00:04:33.040> free<00:04:33.160> to<00:04:33.220> play

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
that's very reasonable for free to play

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.610 
that's very reasonable for free to play
game<00:04:33.570> let's<00:04:34.570> talk<00:04:34.780> about<00:04:34.900> bit<00:04:35.200> of<00:04:35.290> the<00:04:35.410> game

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
game let's talk about bit of the game

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.050 
game let's talk about bit of the game
itself<00:04:36.040> like<00:04:36.340> from<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:36.670> gameplay

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
itself like from the gameplay

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.840 
itself like from the gameplay
perspective<00:04:37.240> so<00:04:37.950> you<00:04:38.950> have<00:04:39.130> I<00:04:39.160> think<00:04:39.430> you<00:04:39.700> have

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
perspective so you have I think you have

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.610 
perspective so you have I think you have
7<00:04:40.210> abilities<00:04:40.630> and<00:04:40.840> you're<00:04:40.990> right<00:04:41.200> click<00:04:41.470> and

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
7 abilities and you're right click and

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.600 
7 abilities and you're right click and
left<00:04:41.830> click<00:04:42.100> then<00:04:42.940> you<00:04:43.090> have<00:04:43.330> actually<00:04:44.610> very

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
left click then you have actually very

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.910 
left click then you have actually very
fluid<00:04:46.090> controls<00:04:46.600> like<00:04:46.870> the<00:04:47.350> game<00:04:47.590> feels

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
fluid controls like the game feels

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.910 
fluid controls like the game feels
really<00:04:48.280> smooth<00:04:48.930> there's<00:04:49.930> a<00:04:50.020> highly<00:04:50.470> optimized

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
really smooth there's a highly optimized

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.280 
really smooth there's a highly optimized
a<00:04:50.950> ball<00:04:51.190> game<00:04:51.400> as<00:04:51.670> in<00:04:52.030> you<00:04:52.630> can<00:04:52.660> lower<00:04:53.050> the

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
a ball game as in you can lower the

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.950 
a ball game as in you can lower the
classics<00:04:53.710> to<00:04:53.770> very<00:04:54.070> low<00:04:54.340> and<00:04:54.580> this<00:04:55.510> will<00:04:55.750> run

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
classics to very low and this will run

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.710 
classics to very low and this will run
in<00:04:56.140> the<00:04:56.380> very<00:04:56.410> low-end<00:04:57.040> computers<00:04:57.580> or<00:04:57.880> you<00:04:58.480> can

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
in the very low-end computers or you can

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.720 
in the very low-end computers or you can
put<00:04:59.080> graphics<00:04:59.380> to<00:04:59.710> max<00:04:59.950> and<00:05:00.160> it<00:05:00.520> looks

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
put graphics to max and it looks

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.260 
put graphics to max and it looks
actually<00:05:01.030> really<00:05:01.660> good<00:05:01.870> for<00:05:02.530> a<00:05:02.590> game<00:05:02.890> of<00:05:03.280> like

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
actually really good for a game of like

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.540 
actually really good for a game of like
a<00:05:04.300> free-to-play<00:05:05.110> game<00:05:05.350> because<00:05:06.040> usually<00:05:06.220> free

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550
