to the left side and then she'll begin
to<00:02:42.250> come<00:02:42.400> up<00:02:42.549> and<00:02:42.730> she'll<00:02:43.000> repeat<00:02:43.269> repetitions

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
to come up and she'll repeat repetitions

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.839 
to come up and she'll repeat repetitions
here<00:02:44.139> about<00:02:44.620> eight<00:02:44.829> to<00:02:45.010> twelve<00:02:45.159> on<00:02:45.430> each<00:02:45.549> side

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
here about eight to twelve on each side

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.330 
here about eight to twelve on each side
now<00:02:46.180> what<00:02:46.959> you'll<00:02:47.109> notice<00:02:47.139> here<00:02:47.769> is<00:02:47.799> with<00:02:48.099> this

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
now what you'll notice here is with this

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.429 
now what you'll notice here is with this
movement<00:02:48.879> with<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.120> arms<00:02:49.540> driving<00:02:50.169> to<00:02:50.319> the

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:50.439 
movement with the arms driving to the

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:53.039 
movement with the arms driving to the
left<00:02:50.650> it<00:02:51.069> actually<00:02:51.549> effectively<00:02:52.209> loads<00:02:52.719> the

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
left it actually effectively loads the

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.750 
left it actually effectively loads the
glutes<00:02:53.409> even<00:02:53.980> more<00:02:54.159> so<00:02:54.340> than<00:02:54.459> a<00:02:54.519> traditional

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
glutes even more so than a traditional

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.000 
glutes even more so than a traditional
lunge<00:02:55.359> what's<00:02:56.260> really<00:02:56.560> important<00:02:56.949> about

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
lunge what's really important about

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.979 
lunge what's really important about
making<00:02:57.489> sure<00:02:57.639> we<00:02:57.760> activate<00:02:58.329> the<00:02:58.480> glutes<00:02:58.719> is

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
making sure we activate the glutes is

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.750 
making sure we activate the glutes is
that's<00:02:59.319> what<00:02:59.560> helps<00:02:59.829> to<00:02:59.949> protect<00:03:00.129> our<00:03:00.519> knees

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
that's what helps to protect our knees

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.240 
that's what helps to protect our knees
when<00:03:01.209> we<00:03:01.389> do<00:03:01.510> things<00:03:01.780> like<00:03:01.870> running<00:03:02.349> jumping

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
when we do things like running jumping

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.939 
when we do things like running jumping
or<00:03:03.489> walking<00:03:04.030> so<00:03:04.449> great<00:03:04.750> challenging<00:03:05.469> exercise

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:05.949 
or walking so great challenging exercise

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:08.250 
or walking so great challenging exercise
a<00:03:06.189> new<00:03:06.579> twist<00:03:06.909> to<00:03:07.000> an<00:03:07.090> old<00:03:07.359> favorite<00:03:07.599> the<00:03:07.870> lunge

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
a new twist to an old favorite the lunge

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.089 
a new twist to an old favorite the lunge
and<00:03:08.500> effectively<00:03:09.459> challenges<00:03:10.299> the<00:03:10.629> back<00:03:10.780> side

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
and effectively challenges the back side

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.409 
and effectively challenges the back side
now<00:03:12.099> that<00:03:12.280> we've<00:03:12.370> done<00:03:12.549> three<00:03:12.909> great<00:03:13.180> butt
