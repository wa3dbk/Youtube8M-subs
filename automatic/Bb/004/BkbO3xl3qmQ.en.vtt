was<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.340> same<00:04:05.549> angle<00:04:06.470> maybe<00:04:07.470> it<00:04:07.709> means<00:04:08.069> to<00:04:08.400> be

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
was the same angle maybe it means to be

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.930 
was the same angle maybe it means to be
lift<00:04:08.819> and<00:04:09.049> then<00:04:10.049> we<00:04:10.200> repeat<00:04:10.650> it<00:04:10.680> on<00:04:11.579> the<00:04:11.790> right

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
lift and then we repeat it on the right

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.050 
lift and then we repeat it on the right

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
water but made the big sound that time

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.700 
water but made the big sound that time
and<00:04:42.960> I<00:04:43.289> nearly<00:04:43.590> lost<00:04:44.099> the<00:04:44.340> boat<00:04:45.289> but<00:04:46.289> I<00:04:46.320> had<00:04:46.560> the

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
and I nearly lost the boat but I had the

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.219 
and I nearly lost the boat but I had the
rescue<00:04:47.039> boat<00:04:47.220> with<00:04:47.400> me<00:04:48.470> to<00:04:49.470> recover<00:04:49.889> it<00:04:51.020> so<00:04:52.020> now

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
rescue boat with me to recover it so now

00:04:52.229 --> 00:05:02.540 
rescue boat with me to recover it so now
I'm<00:04:52.410> gonna<00:04:52.770> change<00:04:53.039> this

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.960 

because<00:05:03.550> the<00:05:04.509> screw<00:05:04.960> here<00:05:05.410> look<00:05:05.889> is<00:05:06.099> it's<00:05:06.669> big

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
because the screw here look is it's big

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.580 
because the screw here look is it's big
one<00:05:07.240> so<00:05:07.599> I'm<00:05:08.500> gonna<00:05:08.770> use<00:05:09.990> the<00:05:10.990> one<00:05:11.169> the<00:05:11.349> short

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
one so I'm gonna use the one the short

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.610 
one so I'm gonna use the one the short
one<00:05:11.800> and<00:05:12.400> that<00:05:13.150> is<00:05:13.330> what<00:05:13.509> will<00:05:13.690> hold<00:05:13.960> the

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
one and that is what will hold the

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:21.330 
one and that is what will hold the
rudder<00:05:15.479> tongue<00:05:19.530> let's<00:05:20.530> see<00:05:20.710> didn't<00:05:21.099> work

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
rudder tongue let's see didn't work

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.659 
rudder tongue let's see didn't work
because<00:05:22.530> the<00:05:23.530> schoolroom<00:05:23.800> gonna<00:05:24.130> use<00:05:24.400> is

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
because the schoolroom gonna use is

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:29.159 
because the schoolroom gonna use is
thinner<00:05:25.599> than<00:05:25.840> the<00:05:26.400> original<00:05:27.400> one<00:05:27.840> so<00:05:28.840> I<00:05:28.900> need

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
thinner than the original one so I need

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:35.059 
thinner than the original one so I need
to<00:05:29.380> find<00:05:29.740> another<00:05:30.039> screw<00:05:32.759> which<00:05:33.759> is<00:05:33.940> not<00:05:34.150> high

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:35.069 
to find another screw which is not high

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:42.950 
to find another screw which is not high
as<00:05:36.069> I<00:05:36.280> was<00:05:36.430> fine<00:05:37.270> the<00:05:37.750> thickness<00:05:39.090> but<00:05:40.090> it's<00:05:40.240> not

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.260 

just<00:05:43.960> not<00:05:44.080> right

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
just not right

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.689 
just not right
anyway<00:05:46.270> hopefully<00:05:46.569> this<00:05:46.990> video<00:05:47.639> will<00:05:48.639> help

anyway hopefully this video will help

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:54.080 
anyway hopefully this video will help
