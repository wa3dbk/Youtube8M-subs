00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.709

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.999

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.859
 louis ii in two weeks it's 

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:13.749
 unbelievable I am what I am very 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:16.329
 motivated otherwise today we get 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:18.489
 found for the fair fire skin 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.469
 jumper his youtuber who can judge that 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.510
 it was not long ago that he was going to 

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:24.639
 can and suddenly I say I'm going to stop a 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.609
 little what does it say to see the 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:29.859
 tran seignior and suddenly I decided 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:33.159
 to do because I appreciate and that not 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:34.510
 human what makes purpose here so I 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:37.510
 not sure if he will see this video but his 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.969
 skin we will say that I have a little lei 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.750
 because as the front of the club dipped 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:45.010
 to get ahead of the field because that's it 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.769
 there is a little to mix everything 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.139
 besides it's still easy so everything goes 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.780
 yes it exists and what do I know after that 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:54.310
 what he does is funny and 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.260
 kuba I often have fun massaging that 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.860
 jaurÃ¨s video I solve puzzle is a 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.410
 little left to confuse and not 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.180
 many like that me and I saw at 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.520
 cavic beyond better from the outside then 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.930
 he even appreciates as a human being 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.630
 because it's a little bit of all of this being 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.010
 human first of all love that rhythm 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.020
 agricultural speakers but I still like 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.670
 better and suddenly I say to myself 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.400
 the outcome will you do what is 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.200
 funny I did not think I was going 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.440
 also there was this 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.590
 part there because 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.360
 Here it was drying terms of 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.630
 wood everywhere and of many by 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:34.340
 the outside on skins a little kind 50 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.510
 shade of gray degrees in English short 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:40.440
 everything makes me laugh too her hair 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.760
 like that, that's it it's normal but 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.170
 the 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:48.450
 we explain david air france added 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.770
 I'll put hair here that 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.510
 it's not at all coherent but 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.400
 talk 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.620
 this is a lot of these little things 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.200
 that i did not make for these clio stuff 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.900
 slope 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.430
 apart from his logo and 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.630
 note i did not find out i do not know 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.550
 if they stay video but if you in winter 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.870
 this video I tend fear was to 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.670
 few steps the time of this video 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.400
 first of all, you take yourself after 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:14.760
 I did not even notice them 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.760
 have lost suddenly ben voila I have not good 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.840
 to come to others far I have a lot 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.530
 but I am very amused by the 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.820
 skins because apart from that which is what 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.080
 is no longer complicated which is a lot 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.280
 of shades of gray of blacks of whites 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.300
 so I'm amused too 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.650
 I put a lot of time but the most 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:36.300
 amused suddenly the enemies on this one will 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.760
 to leave there I have nothing else to say 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.510
 of the covers to leave there in front of the 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.060
 Lord 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:44.310

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.520

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.520
 the world
