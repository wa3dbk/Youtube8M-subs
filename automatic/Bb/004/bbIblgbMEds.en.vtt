00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
this video I will be giving an overview

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.669 
this video I will be giving an overview
of<00:00:09.870> all<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.130> roles<00:00:11.849> or<00:00:12.120> positions<00:00:12.960> 1

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
of all of the roles or positions 1

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.090 
of all of the roles or positions 1
through<00:00:14.040> 5<00:00:14.429> that<00:00:15.179> most<00:00:15.870> of<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.260> pro<00:00:16.740> players

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
through 5 that most of the pro players

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.670 
through 5 that most of the pro players
use<00:00:17.640> when<00:00:18.449> drafting<00:00:19.170> their<00:00:19.770> team<00:00:20.119> now<00:00:21.320> this<00:00:22.320> is

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
use when drafting their team now this is

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.220 
use when drafting their team now this is
always<00:00:23.189> subject<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.730> change<00:00:23.820> because<00:00:24.420> dota<00:00:24.960> 2

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
always subject to change because dota 2

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.550 
always subject to change because dota 2
is<00:00:25.470> constantly<00:00:26.250> evolving<00:00:26.990> but<00:00:27.990> hopefully

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
is constantly evolving but hopefully

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.560 
is constantly evolving but hopefully
this<00:00:28.769> will<00:00:28.920> stay<00:00:29.189> relevant<00:00:29.580> for<00:00:30.029> quite<00:00:30.300> some

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
this will stay relevant for quite some

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.319 
this will stay relevant for quite some
time<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:31.470> basically<00:00:32.070> when<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.309> number<00:00:33.300> your

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
time so basically when you number your

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.560 
time so basically when you number your
team<00:00:33.960> 1<00:00:34.410> through<00:00:34.680> 5<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:36.180> way<00:00:36.540> of

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
team 1 through 5 this is a way of

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.010 
team 1 through 5 this is a way of
determining<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:38.210> order<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.420> highest

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
determining the order of highest

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.819 
determining the order of highest
priority<00:00:40.800> for<00:00:41.520> farm<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:43.260> if<00:00:43.410> there's<00:00:43.590> more

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
priority for farm so if there's more

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.430 
priority for farm so if there's more
than<00:00:43.980> one<00:00:44.100> person<00:00:44.129> in<00:00:44.670> lane<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.629> person<00:00:46.320> with

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
than one person in lane the person with

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.970 
than one person in lane the person with
the<00:00:46.469> higher<00:00:46.980> number<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:48.289> supposed<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.590> yield

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
the higher number is supposed to yield

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.540 
the higher number is supposed to yield
farm<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.090> experience<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.530> person<00:00:53.370> with

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
farm and experience to the person with

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.240 
farm and experience to the person with
the<00:00:53.579> lower<00:00:54.000> number<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:56.010> why

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
the lower number so that is why

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.090 
the lower number so that is why
typically<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.660> number<00:00:58.050> one<00:00:58.320> position<00:00:58.559> would

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
typically the number one position would

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.549 
typically the number one position would
be<00:00:59.129> assigned<00:00:59.730> to<00:01:00.149> your<00:01:00.359> carry<00:01:00.780> if<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.350> have

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
be assigned to your carry if you have

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.789 
be assigned to your carry if you have
one<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.850> something<00:01:03.629> like<00:01:03.660> an<00:01:03.960> anti<00:01:04.320> major<00:01:04.559> of

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
one so something like an anti major of

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.359 
one so something like an anti major of
faceless<00:01:05.220> void<00:01:05.360> would<00:01:06.360> need<00:01:06.930> all<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.650> XP

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
faceless void would need all of the XP

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.929 
faceless void would need all of the XP
and<00:01:08.640> gold<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.720> he<00:01:09.930> can<00:01:10.200> possibly<00:01:10.470> get<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.880> you

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
and gold that he can possibly get so you

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.080 
and gold that he can possibly get so you
assign<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.080> number<00:01:13.380> one<00:01:13.590> position<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:14.159> him<00:01:14.490> to

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
assign the number one position to him to

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.480 
assign the number one position to him to
let<00:01:15.299> everyone<00:01:15.869> else<00:01:16.200> know<00:01:16.409> on<00:01:16.830> your<00:01:16.860> team<00:01:17.250> that

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
let everyone else know on your team that

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.510 
let everyone else know on your team that
if<00:01:18.180> they<00:01:18.420> are<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:18.869> Lane<00:01:19.380> with<00:01:19.680> him<00:01:19.950> they

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
if they are in that Lane with him they

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.179 
if they are in that Lane with him they
need<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.909> let<00:01:21.119> him<00:01:21.420> do<00:01:22.200> most<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.920> last

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
need to let him do most of the last

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.760 
need to let him do most of the last
hitting<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.850> then<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.780> number<00:01:25.170> two<00:01:25.530> position

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
hitting and then the number two position

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.609 
hitting and then the number two position
will<00:01:26.610> usually<00:01:26.850> be<00:01:27.119> assigned<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.960> your<00:01:28.259> solo

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
will usually be assigned to your solo

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.190 
will usually be assigned to your solo
mid<00:01:29.009> role<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:30.329> will<00:01:30.540> be<00:01:30.750> extremely

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
mid role and this will be extremely

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.980 
mid role and this will be extremely
important<00:01:32.040> typically<00:01:33.030> for<00:01:33.180> getting<00:01:33.780> your

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
important typically for getting your

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.800 
important typically for getting your
team<00:01:34.290> off<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.829> very<00:01:34.950> good<00:01:35.250> start<00:01:35.700> since<00:01:36.420> this

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
team off to a very good start since this

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.830 
team off to a very good start since this
role<00:01:37.229> will<00:01:37.829> be<00:01:37.860> getting<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.880> most<00:01:39.360> amount<00:01:39.689> of

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
role will be getting the most amount of

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.310 
role will be getting the most amount of
XP<00:01:40.439> usually<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.549> then<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.570> most<00:01:42.750> amount<00:01:43.110> of

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
XP usually and then the most amount of

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.120 
XP usually and then the most amount of
farm<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.040> early<00:01:44.670> stages<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.899> game<00:01:46.130> so

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
farm in the early stages of the game so

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.800 
farm in the early stages of the game so
then<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.490> number<00:01:47.759> three<00:01:48.090> position<00:01:48.119> is

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
then the number three position is

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.920 
then the number three position is
usually<00:01:49.619> assigned<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.759> solo<00:01:51.270> offliner

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
usually assigned to the solo offliner

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.010 
usually assigned to the solo offliner
role<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:53.840> typically<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:55.640> person<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:57.020> going

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
role and typically this person is going

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.429 
role and typically this person is going
to<00:01:58.290> be<00:01:59.130> hopefully<00:01:59.850> getting<00:02:00.149> some<00:02:00.290> level<00:02:01.290> of

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
to be hopefully getting some level of

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.950 
to be hopefully getting some level of
experience<00:02:02.100> however<00:02:02.579> maybe<00:02:03.060> not<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:03.719> much

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
experience however maybe not so much

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.130 
experience however maybe not so much
farm<00:02:05.000> depending<00:02:06.000> on<00:02:06.000> what<00:02:06.329> laying<00:02:06.689> there<00:02:06.930> in

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
farm depending on what laying there in

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.559 
farm depending on what laying there in
and<00:02:07.500> what<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.129> laning<00:02:08.700> composition<00:02:09.420> is

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
and what the laning composition is

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.050 
and what the laning composition is
looking<00:02:10.050> like<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.860> number<00:02:11.160> four<00:02:11.400> position<00:02:11.430> is

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
looking like the number four position is

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.620 
looking like the number four position is
then

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
then

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.550 
then
