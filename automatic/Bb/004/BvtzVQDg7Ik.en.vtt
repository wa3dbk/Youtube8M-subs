is go to conquest large and you can do
this<00:00:25.019> on<00:00:25.199> any<00:00:25.350> map<00:00:25.619> because<00:00:26.490> you're<00:00:26.730> gonna<00:00:26.820> be

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
this on any map because you're gonna be

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.179 
this on any map because you're gonna be
destroying<00:00:27.449> vehicles<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.619> can<00:00:28.650> do<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:28.890> on<00:00:28.980> any

map<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.609> has<00:00:30.080> enemy<00:00:31.080> vehicles<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.980> can

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
map that has enemy vehicles that you can

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.700 
map that has enemy vehicles that you can
destroy<00:00:33.290> so<00:00:34.670> conquest<00:00:35.670> large<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.450> any<00:00:37.440> map

destroy so conquest large and any map

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.110 
destroy so conquest large and any map
and<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.160> should<00:00:39.120> be<00:00:39.300> good<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:40.760> the<00:00:41.760> reason

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
and that should be good and the reason

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.860 
and that should be good and the reason
you're<00:00:42.210> doing<00:00:42.390> conquest<00:00:43.020> large<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.800> because

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
you're doing conquest large is because

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.029 
you're doing conquest large is because
there's<00:00:45.870> more<00:00:46.430> vehicles<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:48.110> spawn<00:00:49.110> at<00:00:49.469> your

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
there's more vehicles that spawn at your

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.750 
there's more vehicles that spawn at your
vase<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.149> enemy<00:00:51.480> base<00:00:51.710> so<00:00:52.710> say<00:00:53.550> you're

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
vase and the enemy base so say you're

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.720 
vase and the enemy base so say you're
doing<00:00:54.149> Golmud<00:00:55.050> railway<00:00:55.280> that's<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.430> really

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
doing Golmud railway that's a really

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.520 
doing Golmud railway that's a really
good<00:00:56.879> one<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.120> level<00:00:57.570> up<00:00:57.629> your<00:00:57.690> engineer<00:00:58.320> class

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
good one to level up your engineer class

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.439 
good one to level up your engineer class
by<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.859> way<00:00:59.420> then<00:01:00.530> you<00:01:01.530> would<00:01:01.710> have<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.640> think

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
by the way then you would have I think

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.440 
by the way then you would have I think
there's<00:01:03.930> like<00:01:04.140> four<00:01:04.530> tanks<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.369> spawn<00:01:05.790> at

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
there's like four tanks that spawn at

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.640 
there's like four tanks that spawn at
the<00:01:07.170> bases<00:01:08.299> so<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.390> just<00:01:09.750> get<00:01:09.960> your<00:01:10.140> engineer

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
the bases so you just get your engineer

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.140 
the bases so you just get your engineer
class<00:01:11.030> getting<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.270> fast<00:01:12.900> vehicle<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.150> you

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
class getting a fast vehicle and you

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.480 
class getting a fast vehicle and you
would<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:15.439> go<00:01:16.439> over<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.920> enemy<00:01:17.189> spawn

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
would just go over to the enemy spawn

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.679 
would just go over to the enemy spawn
and<00:01:18.680> just<00:01:19.680> rape<00:01:20.250> them<00:01:20.490> with<00:01:20.759> like<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.060> javelin

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
and just rape them with like a javelin

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.560 
and just rape them with like a javelin
or<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.380> straw<00:01:22.950> right<00:01:23.610> there<00:01:23.850> if<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.270> have<00:01:24.420> it

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
or a straw right there if you have it

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.940 
or a straw right there if you have it
unlocked<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:27.240> class<00:01:27.540> setup<00:01:27.840> it's<00:01:28.619> pretty

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
unlocked the class setup it's pretty

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.880 
unlocked the class setup it's pretty
simple<00:01:29.780> you<00:01:30.780> can<00:01:31.439> have<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.890> RPG<00:01:32.720> anything<00:01:33.890> had

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
simple you can have the RPG anything had

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.200 
simple you can have the RPG anything had
just<00:01:35.189> be<00:01:35.490> sure<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.759> have<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:37.939> launcher<00:01:38.939> if

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
just be sure to have a launcher if

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.590 
just be sure to have a launcher if
you're<00:01:39.509> going<00:01:39.659> for<00:01:39.960> air<00:01:40.380> vehicles<00:01:41.310> then<00:01:42.270> have

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
you're going for air vehicles then have

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.569 
you're going for air vehicles then have
a<00:01:43.670> Strela<00:01:45.380> I<00:01:46.380> think<00:01:46.979> that's<00:01:47.220> what<00:01:47.369> it's<00:01:47.520> called

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
a Strela I think that's what it's called

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.740 
a Strela I think that's what it's called
I'm<00:01:48.270> not<00:01:48.780> sure<00:01:49.399> the<00:01:50.399> one<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.820> locks<00:01:51.329> on<00:01:51.600> to

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
I'm not sure the one that locks on to

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.590 
I'm not sure the one that locks on to
the<00:01:51.810> enemy<00:01:52.200> air<00:01:52.350> vehicles<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.939> you'll<00:01:54.210> have

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
the enemy air vehicles so you'll have

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.060 
the enemy air vehicles so you'll have
that<00:01:54.810> one<00:01:55.020> on<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:56.299> for<00:01:57.299> like<00:01:57.479> extra<00:01:58.229> for<00:01:58.950> the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
that one on and for like extra for the

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.580 
that one on and for like extra for the
second<00:01:59.460> one<00:01:59.780> have<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.049> m2<00:02:01.530> slam<00:02:01.890> or<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.520> MT

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
second one have the m2 slam or the MT

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.789 
second one have the m2 slam or the MT
a<00:02:05.119> team<00:02:06.119> on<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.899> think<00:02:07.259> that's<00:02:07.500> what<00:02:07.649> it's

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
a team on I think that's what it's

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.339 
a team on I think that's what it's
called<00:02:08.119> I<00:02:09.119> think<00:02:09.420> that's<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.750> first<00:02:09.989> one<00:02:10.200> you

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
called I think that's the first one you

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.890 
called I think that's the first one you
get<00:02:10.500> before<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:11.190> m2<00:02:11.550> slam

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
get before the m2 slam

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.369 
get before the m2 slam
and<00:02:13.260> just<00:02:13.769> set<00:02:14.069> those<00:02:14.360> right<00:02:15.360> you'll<00:02:15.959> see<00:02:16.230> me

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
and just set those right you'll see me

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.280 
and just set those right you'll see me
set<00:02:16.620> them<00:02:16.709> down<00:02:16.769> here<00:02:17.129> in<00:02:17.159> a<00:02:17.250> second<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:18.019> think<00:02:19.019> I

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
set them down here in a second I think I

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.470 
set them down here in a second I think I
get<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.500> tank<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:21.260> that's<00:02:22.260> basically<00:02:22.799> it

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
get a tank and that's basically it

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.369 
get a tank and that's basically it
carbines<00:02:24.480> are<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.200> best<00:02:25.530> if<00:02:26.190> you<00:02:26.250> want<00:02:26.790> to

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
carbines are the best if you want to

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.819 
carbines are the best if you want to
level<00:02:28.379> up<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:29.810> level<00:02:30.810> up<00:02:30.870> engineer<00:02:31.349> class<00:02:31.590> by

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
level up the level up engineer class by

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:36.800 
level up the level up engineer class by
getting<00:02:32.129> kills<00:02:32.540> because<00:02:33.540> they<00:02:34.470> have<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:35.810> higher

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
getting kills because they have a higher

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.170 
getting kills because they have a higher
range<00:02:37.290> than<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.250> PDW<00:02:39.000> use<00:02:39.209> and<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:41.430> PDW<00:02:42.090> use

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
range than the PDW use and the PDW use
