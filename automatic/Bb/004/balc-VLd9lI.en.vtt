day on march 7th he did undergo surgery
to<00:01:45.030> have<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.509> screw<00:01:45.979> sorry<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.040> screw<00:01:47.460> inserted

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
to have a screw sorry a screw inserted

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.620 
to have a screw sorry a screw inserted
into<00:01:48.090> his<00:01:48.270> foot<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:48.780> with<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:49.590> all<00:01:49.770> said<00:01:50.630> he

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
into his foot so with that all said he

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.889 
into his foot so with that all said he
only<00:01:51.899> missed<00:01:52.259> one<00:01:52.439> game<00:01:52.619> at<00:01:53.009> NIU<00:01:53.280> in<00:01:53.869> 55<00:01:54.869> games

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
only missed one game at NIU in 55 games

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.649 
only missed one game at NIU in 55 games
and<00:01:55.409> 39<00:01:55.920> starts<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.790> I'd<00:01:56.880> say<00:01:57.090> his<00:01:57.240> injury

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
and 39 starts so I'd say his injury

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.859 
and 39 starts so I'd say his injury
history<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:58.700> you<00:01:59.700> know<00:01:59.820> not<00:01:59.850> a<00:02:00.090> concern<00:02:00.630> and

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
history is you know not a concern and

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.219 
history is you know not a concern and
also<00:02:01.320> his<00:02:01.890> production<00:02:02.460> again<00:02:03.210> four<00:02:03.840> seasons

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
also his production again four seasons

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.880 
also his production again four seasons
at<00:02:04.590> NIU<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:05.369> was<00:02:06.000> able<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.570> play<00:02:06.750> in<00:02:06.869> 55<00:02:07.409> games<00:02:07.439> he

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
at NIU I was able to play in 55 games he

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.190 
at NIU I was able to play in 55 games he
started<00:02:08.310> 39<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:09.000> those<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.869> saw<00:02:10.080> his

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
started 39 of those and you saw his

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.520 
started 39 of those and you saw his
collegiate<00:02:10.500> stats<00:02:10.950> earlier<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.420> video<00:02:12.540> so

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
collegiate stats earlier in the video so

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.590 
collegiate stats earlier in the video so
I believe<00:02:13.920> his<00:02:14.190> production<00:02:15.060> his<00:02:15.209> injury

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
I believe his production his injury

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.480 
I believe his production his injury

history as you know he's a solid tackler

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.210 
history as you know he's a solid tackler

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
he can help in run support one thing

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.020 
he can help in run support one thing
when<00:02:20.780> watching<00:02:21.780> tape<00:02:22.220> especially<00:02:23.220> on<00:02:23.250> YouTube

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
when watching tape especially on YouTube

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.150 
when watching tape especially on YouTube
you<00:02:24.360> can't<00:02:24.660> necessarily<00:02:25.550> tell<00:02:28.010> some<00:02:29.010> of<00:02:29.040> the

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
you can't necessarily tell some of the

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.040 
you can't necessarily tell some of the
stuff<00:02:29.400> that<00:02:29.430> goes<00:02:29.760> on<00:02:30.060> in<00:02:30.120> coverage<00:02:30.630> because

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
stuff that goes on in coverage because

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.290 
stuff that goes on in coverage because
you<00:02:31.709> know<00:02:31.800> it<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.340> need<00:02:32.520> to<00:02:32.670> do<00:02:32.850> you<00:02:33.120> know<00:02:33.239> you

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
you know it you need to do you know you

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.640 
you know it you need to do you know you
need<00:02:33.630> different<00:02:33.840> tape<00:02:34.110> for<00:02:34.290> that<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:34.530> need

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
need different tape for that you need

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.190 
need different tape for that you need
sometimes<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.850> endzone<00:02:36.239> tape<00:02:36.540> sometimes<00:02:37.020> you

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
sometimes the endzone tape sometimes you

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.430 
sometimes the endzone tape sometimes you
need<00:02:37.319> you<00:02:37.830> know<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.069> 22<00:02:38.580> they<00:02:39.569> call<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:39.959> 22

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
need you know the 22 they call it the 22

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.400 
need you know the 22 they call it the 22
where<00:02:40.770> they<00:02:41.190> have<00:02:41.370> all<00:02:41.580> 22<00:02:41.970> players<00:02:42.270> on<00:02:43.170> the

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
where they have all 22 players on the

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.930 
where they have all 22 players on the
tape<00:02:43.650> at<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.860> same<00:02:44.130> time<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:44.550> you<00:02:44.640> can<00:02:44.790> see

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
tape at the same time so you can see

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.280 
tape at the same time so you can see
everything<00:02:45.330> that's<00:02:45.450> going<00:02:45.720> on<00:02:45.810> in<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.019> field

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
everything that's going on in the field

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.720 
everything that's going on in the field
so<00:02:47.300> when<00:02:48.300> evaluating<00:02:48.930> secondary<00:02:49.410> players

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
so when evaluating secondary players

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.280 
so when evaluating secondary players
it's<00:02:50.730> kind<00:02:50.940> of<00:02:51.000> hard<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:51.269> do<00:02:51.420> because<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:52.080> tape

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
it's kind of hard to do because the tape

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.240 
it's kind of hard to do because the tape
isn't<00:02:52.700> available<00:02:53.700> at<00:02:54.060> all<00:02:54.090> times<00:02:54.620> but<00:02:55.620> there

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
isn't available at all times but there

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.040 
isn't available at all times but there
were<00:02:56.430> times<00:02:56.700> I<00:02:56.940> did<00:02:57.120> notice<00:02:57.300> that<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:57.930> know

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
were times I did notice that you know

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.190 
were times I did notice that you know
his<00:02:58.500> coverage<00:02:58.920> was<00:02:59.100> also<00:02:59.459> solid<00:02:59.790> he'd<00:03:00.090> be<00:03:01.019> able

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200
