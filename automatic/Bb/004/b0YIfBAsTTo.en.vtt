00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.420
 Hello my life, welcome to 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.520
 a new video of me 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.050
 Today I want a chocolate cherry 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.230
 Make cheesecake 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.830
 yes I am very excited but he 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.940
 has looked so delicious in the recipe 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.000
 I thought I have to go now 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.400
 just try it out so we start 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.280
 with the dough because we need it 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.300
 first have 100 grams of butter in pieces 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:45.359
 I already prepared a bit 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:48.030
 big then 180 km 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:53.519
 Here you can find all the ingredients for the dough 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:01:00.679
 now turn in the left and then 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:01:00.679
 the still comes the filling 180 grams 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:22.399
 then 75 g of sugar 1 packet of baking powder 1 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.399
 heaped tablespoon of cacau 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:54.860
 40 that was only 30 now 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:55.960
 seconds on the study 40 to a dough 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.130
 stir 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:18.850
 next a glass of shadow morels 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:18.850
 added dropwise and 20 seconds 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:28.130
 left running stage 2 with the help of sport 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:35.830
 mix in 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:38.510
 So lowered the small deck 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.080
 we can take a springform 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:45.250
 and grease well and then it out 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.959
 fill the dough already in the springform 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.670
 and I do that now and then 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.160
 we should do with the choral leader 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.799
 your oven to 180 degrees above 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.880
 preheat the bottom heat 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:03:00.170
 and now we'll do the filling 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:05.500
 First we need for the first 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.500
 filling 250 g soft butter in pieces 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.150
 then feel 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.380
 300 grams 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:54.430
 two packets of custard powder 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.430
 checkmark 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:20.519
 3000 grams of lean quark all for the 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:23.520
 filling just as dagmar up and out 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:31.139
 squeeze just know down now 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:37.979
 we should open the whole 40 seconds 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:42.060
 level five earlier so it looks now 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:44.910
 Look at me I have my mix pot 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.849
 not cleaned after the dough only 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:51.150
 well scratched out and what else on 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:56.280
 stuck knife is there from the dough 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:59.550
 I briefly open my head with a lid 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.800
 Tours put that just all the time 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.020
 were hurled hard out 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:10.099
 and then the mix was as good as 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:10.099
 laura I already saved the rinse 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:20.090
 I now give the basic dimensions Leadership 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:20.090
 it also nice to scratch again 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:37.060
 looks already longer made delicious 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.780
 I can just show it 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.040
 very close 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:47.350
 so now I add the cake 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:49.860
 180 degrees upper bottom heat for 5 60 to 70 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.810
 minutes in the oven 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:56.920
 yes hello my love that is now so 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:59.290
 the cherry cheese chocolate cake is it 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.150
 already in the evening but I could 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.890
 and I did not want you now 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.740
 I have to deny that to you now 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.630
 still filming off quickly so I am 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.810
 totally thrilled that looks so from 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:12.970
 super delicious I'll be right now 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.020
 Cut out a bit again and 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.090
 my husband is already the whole time 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.680
 amrum now he would like another one now 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.350
 eat cake though not really 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.260
 but more time for this is well making 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.610
 you do not like everything until then is like that 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.600
 Here I have you a little bit 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.420
 cut out 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.430
 My husband is already on the spatula of it 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.620
 So much of it all enthuses 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.510
 tastes heavenly delicious too 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.480
 mamas here not the cherries directly 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:39.780
 looks because they are a dough in there but 

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:43.270
 Taste what you do in any case 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:45.760

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:48.220
