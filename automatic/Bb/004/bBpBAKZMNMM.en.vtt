 this excellent device have in 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.759
 note that custom roll does not work 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.980
 one hundred percent what always marked 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.510
 We recommend that you make the backup of 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.100
 your fs folder and as well in the 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.140
 android cow if you do not like the break 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.640
 and they return to the previous bag the only thing 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.440
 what we have to have in our 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.780
 device is root access and as 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.250

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.390
 install the rom I will leave you in the 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.190
 description of the video files 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.050
 necessary to install the sele a 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.340
 it is only a file only what 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.250
 download in memory cooperation 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.480
 microsd and proceed to the installation well 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.570
 this time we are going to turn off the 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.570
 device 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.780
 let's hope the game is turned off 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.180
 we start in recovery mode for extreme 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.690
 record of samsung galaxy s3 is 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.580
 only volume up power and home 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:13.310
 simultaneously in about 3 seconds and 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.079
 we just let go and enter at least 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.520
 We can not be barack and we have what 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:18.799
 is the record of advanced I 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.570
 I always recommend that you search 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.000
 I'll leave the link for you to download 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.060
 this recovery that is 6.0 points 4.4 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.470
 which is the recovery that I use and the 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.689
 true, he has never had any problems 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.310
 the time install no roma let's go to 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.530
 do the 3 white let's do wide 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.909
 data invoice rs then we are going to 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.920
 do the remove cache partition 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.829
 and then we go where it says 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.499
 breakthroughs and we give that of alvin quite 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.210
 cache once we have the 

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:48.100
 fully formatted device 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.020
 we're just going to proceed what the 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.850
 installation we are going to install we direct to 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.159
 our microsd memory 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.590
 and we look at mycology where 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:01.420
 let's have in our car 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.420
 here we have it let's talk 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.229
 and as we can see, it has already been 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.619
 what is being installed ROM 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.970
 now let's wait for it to load as of 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.770
 custom the first time you load the 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.959
 rom then load a bit later 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.910
 we configure the rom and we will continue with the 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.170
 video as you can see we have already 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.269
 finalized what has been the 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.980
 configuration of the rom how can we 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.530
 observe we have the care and some 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.720
 customizations of the four not as 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.400
 also from the s5 well how can we 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.890
 observe here as the launcher works 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.349
 correctly we do not have problems to the 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.750
 time to move around the launcher can 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.380
 observe that they come with what they are 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.930
 some of the applications 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.019
 pre-installed the rom comes with stan and a 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.750
 backup as also netapp is fixed 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.060
 there are also some other applications 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.310
 but the truth may be very good 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.600
 compiled what the rom and optimize the 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.970
 only problem that the 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.220
 gathered so far is that the camera 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.470
 Well, on my device, it's not there 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.480
 working can not be observed that of 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.890
 January those are the drivers too 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.110
 It depends 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.940
 also it depends on the device to 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.430
 some of them work correctly 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.780
 rom also the camera but in my 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.300
 device because I do not work 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.860
 camera I have already seen some comments 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.100
 who have spoken Lump they 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.510
 it works very well and the truth is that I 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.850
 I'm trying and it works well 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.130
 The only drawback I have is that the 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.040
 camera because it's not working for me 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.709
 you can observe here we have the the 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.069
 adjustments are not going to wrong is based on the 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:35.709
 latest contribution of android 4.4 for 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:38.320
 samsung galaxy s3 and 9.300 the rice comes 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.209
 with the meat as you can see in 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.860
 the round the number of compilations and 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:47.019
 9,300 n475 for this device the 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.820
 true, the round is very good and 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.830
 as I was telling you the only problem that 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.660
 I've found is what is being 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.489
 the camera but not all 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.140
 will have that same problem because I have 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.690
 seen some comments that have made 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.060
 on our facebook page about this 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.000
 error and that works very well we go 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.920
 to see here where 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.840
 this call as you can see then 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.210
 how customary we have been seeing 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.800
 with samsung in the section called yes 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.410
 we enter the settings quickly as they can 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.940
 observe this rom comes in Chinese like 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.920
 we can be more have already put what 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.910
 is still the Spanish language and they 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.650
 some letters will appear like 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.960
 you can observe here in Chinese that 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.520
 is not yet is not has been put in 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.550
 Spanish but the truth is nothing 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.960
 annoying since it comes with translation 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.820
 comes with energy saving the ultra 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.950
 energy saving in some other 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.050
 features comes with lexmark roll the 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.090
 smart pause I was testing and 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.040
 works correctly this is what 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.640
 it's been this rom for the samsung 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:48.720
 galaxy s3 9.300 let's enter here the 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:50.190
 we make the clamp gesture can not 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.410
 observe here let's see what are the 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.560
 wallpapers of the rom 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.060
 look how you can observe here here we 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.460
 asks what we want is screen 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.200
 lock home screen 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.180
 that as we want to operate what 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.639
 what is being 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.340
 the rock itself 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.629
 that the truth then works very well and 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.680
 if we enter what is the section of 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:12.960
 wii after not finding footprint 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.990
 transparent is very telecinco and 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.240
 94 and the other widget that are commonly 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.210
 presences present in the majority of 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.400
 the rolas this is what has been 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:26.189
 This is the truth because I recommend it to you 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.840
 try it if you have the same 

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:29.249
 problem of the camera then in the 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.469
 next versions I imagine that you 

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:33.029
 will update the drivers and the truth then 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:35.270
 the break works very well the only 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:37.199
 problem that I have because it is the camera 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.520
 questions doubts suggestions you can 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:39.960
