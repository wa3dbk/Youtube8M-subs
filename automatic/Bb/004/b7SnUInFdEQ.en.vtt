00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.850
 and it's something that I realized thank you god already a year ago 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.290
 or two we'll say but I continue to be surprised would be times of 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.599
 to see the excitement of the release of a new album by 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:13.279
 legendary even though now I know that this hit series 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:16.859
 it's always nice to have to move that you have to rent 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.149
 know that people towards spa a project of help g i yet presented to 

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:21.419
 different publishing houses 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:24.529
 e simply because they did not know what else to present 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.019
 it was not the kind of comic that is there for which I had an affection 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.359
 particular departure 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.910
 % and it's just that I had to propose is that thing and for me 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.000
 it was originally a comic book that may have used me to put a 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.330
 foot in the middle of the cartoon 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.700
 and as we miss that I made these albums I decided to 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.270
 discovered a true affinity percent this kind of narrative I think 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.060
 sincerely be done now to do this kind of youth recidivism 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.060
 it's true the task of charging makes it the best grade 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.840
 in euros of legendary time would be my door a great satisfaction of a point 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.000
 of public view hscp of great success she puts I touch mainly the the 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.480
 readership youth with so it's true that with the beauty and the beast I wanted 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.720
 try to touch the lectura more adult an audience that does not soften place 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.030
 usually 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.799
 I think that kind of experience that I renew myself that 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.470
 I will renew from time to time 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.470
 e we will say that you are both three albums of the legendary I 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.690
 do not know yet 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.570
 to touch another audience the direction she's everything here for 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.960
 hundred and make it known that the ninth volume that has just come out 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.290
 and the first volume of a big saga in four parts 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.880
 which will not be a turning point in the series 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.180
 when I speak turning if I had to do a 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.230
 by coming closer to another turn of the series office 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.060
 this is the change that occurred when the bolat dragon happened 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.190
 dragone boz help 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.530
 so bdd 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.920
 - humor 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.790
 d more dramatic stories then sting 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.730
 these new directions if it's accurate by the data amassed to make it 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.530
 evolve 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.650
 already because my audience has been following me for a few years the big 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.100
 cities 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.659
 so I'm going a little bit in this direction and propose some 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.280
 stories a little more complex 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.000
 and for that I would say a little less good kid
