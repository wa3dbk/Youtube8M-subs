00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.470
 on the other hand 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.740
 good first of all I want to wish you very happy new pipe I hope you've 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.149
 passed very well 

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:15.140
 that we were going to start this 2009 with tite as they do decorative text in splash 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.960
 and for example 2009 is not used that the first thing that nothing of the tool here 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.050
 the text we are going to write such a good example 2009 ken thomas resale 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.180
 transformer of objects let's make this a little bigger to work 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.560
 in a better size 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.750
 that since you have something more or less like that we are going to go to select the text go to 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:35.650
 Modify 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.930
 and project part this is going to separate us each number is how are you seeing that 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.519
 We were going to select all the text and modify from Qatar once more 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:48.899
 who urged us to convert our text to vectors the next step is again 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.260
 take the tool to transform objects we give the text 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.970
 a little different kelly first with him two we're going to be a little bigger 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.180
 and turn a little to make it a little more fun 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.870
 Kelly more or less around here 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.420
 i'm going to aa 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.930
 the zero is to be a little bigger because it does not join with the other 0 if it wins 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.870
 a little 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.240
 let's fight the 12th also a little 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.800
 and finally the '9' here 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.600
 and turn a little 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.289
 pinilla that you have the texas and we are going to select everything 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:28.789
 will go modify convert to symbols we are going to give it a name 2009 this expo 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:29.369
 waths up 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.309
 Now show two clicks give birth to the symbol and be able to avoid it 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.110
 that first of all, to modify the color a bit because it had 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.310
 happened to have it in the racing let's do a little more slowly and fifth 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.940
 that will go our 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.450
 small window in color first of all the whole ekin text was made 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.460
 i end we are going to select a gradient line that exists that is here he 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.859
 estimate the left 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:58.859
 let's make it go from 1 I assume that 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.060
 let's see who is the one around here to another blue 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.820
 what will happen two clicks in this small quality select it 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.560
 nor this one that is fifth and it is true two clicks this small town and with 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.420
 the drip we can select any color we will select that this one that 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.050
 is in this little box that is the same color but what we are going to do is 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.779
 select the box and in this little little triangle move it a little down 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:27.049
 that will change the color 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.840
 perfectible that we have it so we can go in the tool of transformed from 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:32.539
 gradients that is here 

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:35.539
 and start playing with it in the act 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.699
 and there we can turn a little crush a color will be removed from here to get closer 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:44.449
 our 2009 text 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:56.019
 Since you have it as you want let's do the following select all the 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.769
 weight of the new blessed copy and then we will insert a stage 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.950
 new dragged down 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.759
 will go edition 

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:10.329
 kelly since we have it there bear the colors zions change that second text 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.329
 that we beat down to black and as you can see 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.670
 we have that little shadow or that little duplicate of our 2009 text 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:20.389
 down and be very good 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:24.899
 but to do it from here a better we can block the cappe above us 

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:25.789
 leave with 

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:29.859
 only the fifth black text and we can take the Ã©pila tool 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.360
 contours that are being quest and selecting here 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.679
 we start a click 

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:37.909
 we can see what comes out of an outline and the figure becomes more interesting 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:42.339
 lion effect something three-dimensional we can select the inclusive be a little more 

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:46.719
 thick outline something like that and with narrow keyboard start moving what 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:49.719
 to put it 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.679
 more or less for kyle to that effect some three-dimensional volume kelly after 

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:58.829
 to withstand two clicks to get out of the cynthia symbol that we have it like this 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.580
 we can do many things like aerate filters 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.780
 ponce kia filters without we can add a headdress because not a small shadow 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:07.499
 here 

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:10.869
 lower the intensity a little 

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:14.869
 and well this you can use it on your website print it or even 

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:19.459
 use it in some animation of the description for what to download the 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:20.970
 web and table patch 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.970
 and good that's all for this team I hope it has served you 

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:27.240
 Thank you 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.440
 good here finally I leave you direct links to one of the tips that I most 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.030
 liked the most successful 2008 the first is animation of 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.199
 characters the second is character animation 2 and the third is the 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:45.970
 creation of monti with estimates that are here directly from youtube you can 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.330
 explain to each of these boxes to go directly to see those monies 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:52.120
 this thanks
