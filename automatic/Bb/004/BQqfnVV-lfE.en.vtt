it everywhere because I need part of it

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.580 
it everywhere because I need part of it
on<00:02:22.320> this<00:02:22.620> side<00:02:22.890> of<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.130> eye<00:02:23.450> of<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.660> -<00:02:24.900> eyebrow

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
on this side of the eye of the - eyebrow

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.130 
on this side of the eye of the - eyebrow
starting<00:02:26.370> at<00:02:26.640> just<00:02:27.150> a<00:02:27.239> little<00:02:27.269> passing<00:02:27.900> middle

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
starting at just a little passing middle

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.430 
starting at just a little passing middle
of<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.470> eye<00:02:28.500> I'm<00:02:29.090> mixing<00:02:30.090> these<00:02:30.540> two<00:02:30.959> colors

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
of the eye I'm mixing these two colors

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.270 
of the eye I'm mixing these two colors
together<00:02:33.200> trying<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.290> match<00:02:34.500> it<00:02:34.739> as<00:02:34.860> close<00:02:35.100> as

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
together trying to match it as close as

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.990 
together trying to match it as close as
I<00:02:35.459> can<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.910> picture<00:02:36.330> and<00:02:36.480> I<00:02:37.700> think<00:02:38.700> it<00:02:38.850> is<00:02:38.970> a

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
I can to the picture and I think it is a

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.720 
I can to the picture and I think it is a
mixture<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.540> these<00:02:39.780> two<00:02:40.049> colors

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.600 

bring<00:02:45.730> it<00:02:45.850> all<00:02:46.120> over<00:02:46.600> the<00:02:46.720> eyelid<00:02:46.870> and<00:02:47.610> then

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
bring it all over the eyelid and then

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.230 
bring it all over the eyelid and then
all<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.120> way<00:02:49.270> out<00:02:50.730> going<00:02:51.730> to<00:02:51.820> draw<00:02:52.060> it<00:02:52.120> out

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
all the way out going to draw it out

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.920 
all the way out going to draw it out
just<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.660> little<00:02:52.690> bit<00:02:52.930> right<00:02:54.630> down<00:02:55.630> to<00:02:55.810> the

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
just a little bit right down to the

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.460 
just a little bit right down to the
eyelashes<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:57.990> then<00:02:58.990> I'm<00:02:59.110> just<00:02:59.170> going<00:02:59.440> to

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
eyelashes and then I'm just going to

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.630 
eyelashes and then I'm just going to
bring<00:02:59.950> that<00:03:00.330> light<00:03:01.330> color<00:03:02.190> with<00:03:03.190> a<00:03:03.220> blending

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
bring that light color with a blending

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.390
