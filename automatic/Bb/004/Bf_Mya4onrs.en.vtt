00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 I know that many and even curiosity 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.620
 to know how the organ cut is made 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.080
 pump management 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.080
 so I 'll try to show here to 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.020
 to see more or less improvised for 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.439
 It 's just a little tricky alone to try. 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.680
 show is primarily how we and 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.539
 we became the point of this police brand 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.449
 here and here we have a point in five 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.630
 degrees that pm s than 5 degrees 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.610
 when that mark of the pulley vote 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.570
 reach 5 degree point he has that is 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.899
 between 95 and up to 65 on that average 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:44.550
 on this average 1 point of ideal intake 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:46.170
 then returning the pulley and at the rear 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.410
 of the injection pump that we installed 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.410
 clock 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.539
 now I'm going to turn a motor in the direction of 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:05.040
 which it knows and follows the 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:07.549
 some time out there they fled in the 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.549
 motor 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:22.799
 the buyer begins to die removed 10 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:34.770
 hundredths ute ready 40 surprise nor 60 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:37.020
 on being made 8096 in thesis the equivalent 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.759
 one millimeter one full revolution in the 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.160
 comparator watch where that mark 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:49.310
 napoli went there is exactly here 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.310
 is practically over the 5 degree point 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:58.830
 if the value is not found 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.679
 it is at the ideal point without a millimeter 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:05.310
 We make sunshine. 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:10.160
 these two doors here it has a door 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.160
 each check 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.300
 we made 12 others and the ball will have a 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.580
 course 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.050
 She will move ahead not late. 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.880
 as needed 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.740
 installed a watch here the motor too 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.060
 synchronizes with this perfect plan and 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:33.160
 this is the ideal engine body 4 of 56 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.160
 and that mitsubishi engines of the years
