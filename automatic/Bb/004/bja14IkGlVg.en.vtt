 I really like it a lot 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.020
 Look what a cute thing and I 'm not going 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.239
 You will not even feel the hat. 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.790

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.119
 she did kindly to walk in the 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.920
 structure also working people then 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.810
 when she withdrew with coffee filter 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:18.630
 down here and comes with help making a 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.700
 review and you can make the 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.070
 also with a strainer I already did 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.920
 one pound of pet bottle with jassa frame 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.259
 I've had so much I get on the wing when the 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.150
 frame can also make how beautiful 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.640
 room cover can access the site it 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.630
 You can do it today the way you 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.700
 you want 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.299
 here for example which materials 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.670
 I used I used the leather paper 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.130
 to form the cone I have no paper 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.140
 chronic or leather that I do 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.210
 know that line icon that you do 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:54.000
 crochet before what if that of a 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.729
 triangle a well bottled pet bottle 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.380
 and here I decided to do and fine tuned then 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.649
 I told him the paper he gives you. 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.270
 malleability for you to make the size 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.460
 that you can do of a meter 2 like 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.369
 if you wanted to amend the paper by pleasing 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.929
 old or the world you can by another 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.830
 from the heart can put an instrument 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.140
 musical a score in the hand of 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.310
 a sax to this invention until today the way 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.430
 whatever 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.950
 here I used great white help 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:26.390
 that it is 100% returnable 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.710
 nature flowers dried a ribbon the wire 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.650
 from sisal 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.710
 or can be of the wire itself joins 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.560
 thick jute looks that beauty is also 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:39.830
 It is interesting to 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.860
 River value helps bring the two options 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.470
 I have not caught the twine thick 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.530
 gross rascal they are very close to 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:53.390
 this even more matches the tone of our 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:56.030
 of our angel and velvet I used is 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.800
 My mother has very angry and tanks and 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.570
 remember the carnival mask that I 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.459
 I have done here also in the divine has a user 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.560
 take advantage of 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.200
 and then I also used a little bit of 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.370
 send to give some form of my 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.830
 wing 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.330
 the hot glue and Styrofoam ball and 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.420
 could also make a ball of 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:17.420
 crumpled paper to stay 100% recycled 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:21.250
 but I use it by eliton cheap and it gives 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.390
 a perfect way to use 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.540
 So what do we do? 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:29.600
 I made you my ways 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.239
 super always you'll see what I look 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.320
 I made a little baby that would be the cover of our 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.019
 angel 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.140
 Look at his clothes is a triangle only. 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:41.480
 it will give the outline of my piece and 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.550
 the sleeves and I already left the size that 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.050
 I did I sewed the machine to stay 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.010
 cutie I do not have a machine 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.070
 seam 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.130
 I can pass glue or hot glue or 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:56.090
 the cola April and close the Colombian already 15 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:58.190
 only doubling the fold is and then you do the 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.550
 size of the angel you want 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:05.060
 so here is the body of his clothes 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:07.550
 so simple neighbor that nobody gives 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.130
 Do not do not have a disk, right? 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.890
 Let's go to the wing and increase that 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.950
 I did to give a certain stability. 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:18.590
 I could have used the paper itself 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.930
 leather but I got the ipva that gives it 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:24.680
 until a double and recalled the format 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.080
 the wing and there I passed white glue and 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.650
 I just fixed it. 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.659
 white white glue joint fixing rush 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.610
 cool in my help I have to 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:36.969
 do before it dries 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.069
 I get a hot wine iron 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:41.469
 the one sent to one of rett dinho and he 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:42.159
 sticking no more but she stays at 6 

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:45.280
 soft 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:46.960
 she does not glue well she said it's after 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.740
 much experience 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.810
 el perro oeste and then you get the iron 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.469
 it was not very hot it will not melt 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:59.050
 the heat will be fixing the glue of the 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:05:01.030
 and see the fabric because it helps 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.099
 take off too late and if we do not 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.020
 pass glue and fix on the iron 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:07.479
 she will stick with this whole border 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:11.020
 discipline and will be ugly finishing 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:14.139
 so I passed the glue I cut with a 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:17.050
 scissors and it already looks different 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:19.210
 Then the other side will appear from my wing. 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.370
 What I did and beige can make a kiss. 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.759
 white that will not appear and I go 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:27.099
 back the white glue fixed 'to the 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:28.240
 my help and iron it again 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:30.669
 dry 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:34.029
 I go with the scissors and cut my 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:37.300
 Asa wants to give a grace to this wing that I 

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:40.750
 I did a catch and I would 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.509
 I worked the whole contour with the glue 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:47.409
 hot then we get the hot glue 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:50.740
 we work on the back of the wing and we 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:53.949
 let's put this all going send 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.990
 around my wing to give this 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:58.210
 more sophisticated finish 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:01.750
 I do not want to be so many 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:03.610
 leave it so you do not see if you see 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.949
 ugly looks this finish gets ugly 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:09.520
 Even I'm going to get my hot glue and 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:13.150
 vote by sticking all that thread of sisal 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:16.449
 on the back of my wing tone is pick up 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:18.699
 hot glue and goes and fixes all 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:21.550
 so then that's it here it's work 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:22.449
 She is but she is going to give grace in my 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.360
 angel 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:27.520
 a show that is different, right? 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.159
 ear let's take a break you line 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.259
 that sends tour on the interval in 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:34.569
 sequence people back to back hockey 

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:36.370
 taught the whole selection and we bring 

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:38.139
 step by step assembly of the 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.129
 body and the details of the 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:41.800
 little face of the head 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:44.739
 without doubt the next block we do 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:47.099
 tintim for tintim there we go back to 

00:06:44.739 --> 00:06:47.099
 stay
