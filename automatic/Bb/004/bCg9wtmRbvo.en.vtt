00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
officially confirmed it which was just a

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.750 
officially confirmed it which was just a
couple<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.350> days<00:01:07.530> ago<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:08.040> these<00:01:08.400> things<00:01:08.610> are

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
couple of days ago so these things are

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.060 
couple of days ago so these things are
too<00:01:09.330> believed<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.930> most<00:01:10.200> cases<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.770> normally

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
too believed in most cases and normally

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.280 
too believed in most cases and normally
they<00:01:11.189> are<00:01:11.369> right<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:12.119> if<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.479> retailer<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.140> to

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
they are right so if this retailer is to

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.840 
they are right so if this retailer is to
be<00:01:13.350> believed<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.070> think<00:01:14.220> it's<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.490> Spanish

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
be believed and I think it's a Spanish

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.390 
be believed and I think it's a Spanish
retailer<00:01:15.060> actual<00:01:15.570> easy<00:01:15.840> mark<00:01:16.080> games<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.710> it's

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
retailer actual easy mark games and it's

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.160 
retailer actual easy mark games and it's
fairly<00:01:17.640> big<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.180> country<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.869> think<00:01:18.900> it's

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
fairly big in that country I think it's

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.320 
fairly big in that country I think it's
got<00:01:19.290> 9,000<00:01:20.130> likes<00:01:20.280> on<00:01:20.490> Facebook<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.090> it's<00:01:21.210> not

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
got 9,000 likes on Facebook so it's not

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.120 
got 9,000 likes on Facebook so it's not
a<00:01:21.390> small<00:01:21.689> backstreet<00:01:22.200> company<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:23.009> have

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
a small backstreet company that have

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.320 
a small backstreet company that have
done<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.369> for<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.549> bit<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.759> attention<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.299> think

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
done it for a bit of attention I think

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.560 
done it for a bit of attention I think

well<00:01:47.970> but<00:01:48.119> although<00:01:48.329> sounded<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.960> little<00:01:49.079> bit

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
well but although sounded a little bit

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.440 
well but although sounded a little bit
near<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:50.490> know<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.640> mean<00:01:50.850> like<00:01:51.180> they<00:01:51.299> just

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
near you know I mean like they just

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.850 
near you know I mean like they just
didn't<00:01:51.930> really<00:01:52.110> sound<00:01:52.409> like<00:01:52.560> they've<00:01:52.770> got

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
didn't really sound like they've got

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.980 
didn't really sound like they've got
anything<00:01:53.040> behind<00:01:53.490> them<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.030> know<00:01:54.149> space

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
anything behind them you know space

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.620 
anything behind them you know space
warfare<00:01:55.380> really<00:01:55.909> no<00:01:56.909> can't<00:01:57.420> see<00:01:57.509> that

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
warfare really no can't see that

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.969 
warfare really no can't see that
happening<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:58.200> think<00:01:58.380> each<00:01:58.500> covering<00:01:58.860> the

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
happening I think each covering the

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.230 
happening I think each covering the
backs<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.280> case<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.549> did<00:01:59.700> this<00:01:59.820> I<00:01:59.939> like<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.119> do<00:02:00.210> a

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
backs in case it did this I like to do a

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.120 
backs in case it did this I like to do a
game<00:02:00.479> like<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.780> but<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.350> think<00:02:01.530> with<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.890> time

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
game like that but I think with the time

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.139 
game like that but I think with the time
being<00:02:02.369> there<00:02:02.460> going<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.610> be<00:02:02.670> sticking<00:02:03.060> with

being there going to be sticking with

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
modern warfare 4 is the next game in my

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.320 
modern warfare 4 is the next game in my
mind<00:02:22.740> it's<00:02:23.040> never<00:02:23.400> really<00:02:23.550> been<00:02:23.670> in<00:02:23.910> any<00:02:24.030> doubt

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
mind it's never really been in any doubt

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.570 
mind it's never really been in any doubt
because<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:24.959> just<00:02:25.590> don't<00:02:25.890> think<00:02:26.069> they<00:02:26.160> drop<00:02:26.430> the

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
because I just don't think they drop the

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.190 
because I just don't think they drop the
modern<00:02:26.819> warfare<00:02:26.970> title<00:02:27.569> and<00:02:27.930> whether<00:02:28.080> they

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
modern warfare title and whether they

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.949 
modern warfare title and whether they
drop<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.069> old<00:02:29.640> plot<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.209> old<00:02:30.360> story<00:02:30.720> line

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.260 
drop the the old plot the old story line
and<00:02:31.230> try<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.040> start<00:02:32.340> fresh<00:02:32.670> with<00:02:32.940> it<00:02:33.060> but<00:02:33.239> I

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
and try and start fresh with it but I

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.550 
and try and start fresh with it but I
always<00:02:33.510> thought<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:33.810> would<00:02:34.080> be<00:02:34.110> using<00:02:34.470> the

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
always thought that would be using the

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.340 
always thought that would be using the
same<00:02:34.770> types<00:02:35.640> but<00:02:35.790> going<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.209> more<00:02:36.390> details<00:02:37.170> in
