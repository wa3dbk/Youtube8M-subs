point tracing down a strange problem I

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.380 
point tracing down a strange problem I
was<00:00:19.080> flying<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:20.070> helicopter<00:00:20.340> hand<00:00:21.000> randomly

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
was flying the helicopter hand randomly

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.080 
was flying the helicopter hand randomly
I<00:00:21.570> don't<00:00:21.779> know<00:00:21.840> where<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.140> started<00:00:23.000> you<00:00:24.000> know

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
I don't know where it started you know

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.689 
I don't know where it started you know
young<00:00:24.539> left<00:00:25.050> right<00:00:25.410> rudder<00:00:26.010> all<00:00:26.369> over<00:00:26.609> the

young left right rudder all over the

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.580 
young left right rudder all over the
place<00:00:26.910> didn't<00:00:27.390> seem<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.260> have<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.410> direction

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
place didn't seem to have a direction

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.859 
place didn't seem to have a direction
couldn't<00:00:29.220> hold<00:00:29.340> its<00:00:29.550> head<00:00:29.670> didn't<00:00:30.660> know<00:00:30.720> where

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
couldn't hold its head didn't know where

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.549 
couldn't hold its head didn't know where
it<00:00:30.900> was<00:00:30.960> going<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.640> know<00:00:33.440> didn't<00:00:34.440> like

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
it was going so you know didn't like

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.290 
it was going so you know didn't like
that<00:00:34.739> almost<00:00:35.130> crashed<00:00:35.430> was<00:00:35.880> able<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.180> bring

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
that almost crashed was able to bring

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.700 
that almost crashed was able to bring
her<00:00:36.420> down<00:00:36.600> safely<00:00:39.320> figure<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.469> there<00:00:40.590> was

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
her down safely figure that there was

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.139 
her down safely figure that there was
definitely<00:00:41.190> some<00:00:41.430> kind<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.640> vibration

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
definitely some kind of vibration

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.090 
definitely some kind of vibration
problem<00:00:42.570> well<00:00:42.840> upon<00:00:43.140> looking<00:00:43.410> when<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:43.860> was

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
problem well upon looking when I was

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.760 
problem well upon looking when I was
spinning<00:00:44.309> up<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.910> blades<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.750> servo<00:00:46.350> was

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
spinning up the blades the servo was

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.490 
spinning up the blades the servo was
going<00:00:47.100> nuts<00:00:47.399> for<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.920> rudder<00:00:49.920> control<00:00:50.610> and

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
going nuts for the rudder control and

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.290 
going nuts for the rudder control and
had<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.590> figure<00:00:52.770> out<00:00:52.890> why<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.730> was<00:00:53.850> going<00:00:54.120> back

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
had to figure out why it was going back

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.209 
had to figure out why it was going back
and<00:00:54.449> forth<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.320> went<00:00:55.590> searching<00:00:56.010> for<00:00:56.190> a

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
and forth so I went searching for a

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.740 
and forth so I went searching for a
vibration<00:00:56.760> obviously<00:00:57.210> started<00:00:57.539> with<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
vibration obviously started with the

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.090 
vibration obviously started with the
easy<00:00:58.020> things<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.620> know<00:00:58.770> had<00:01:00.829> tail<00:01:01.829> blades

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
easy things you know had tail blades

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.200 
easy things you know had tail blades
everything<00:01:02.760> blades<00:01:03.059> all<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.290> nonsense<00:01:05.210> even

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
everything blades all that nonsense even

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.420 
everything blades all that nonsense even
went<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.600> far<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.380> take<00:01:07.560> apart<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.040> tail

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
went so far is to take apart the tail

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.460 
went so far is to take apart the tail
servo<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.030> make<00:01:09.299> sure<00:01:09.330> nothing<00:01:09.960> was<00:01:10.080> bad<00:01:10.290> in

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
servo and make sure nothing was bad in

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.340 
servo and make sure nothing was bad in
there<00:01:10.880> everything<00:01:11.880> appeared<00:01:12.270> normal<00:01:12.350> changed

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
there everything appeared normal changed

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.690 
there everything appeared normal changed
main<00:01:13.590> gear<00:01:13.799> change<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.220> main<00:01:14.400> shaft

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
main gear change the main shaft

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.760 
main gear change the main shaft
feathering<00:01:15.360> shaft<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.049> head<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
feathering shaft in the head of the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.670 
feathering shaft in the head of the
helicopter<00:01:17.280> which<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.580> over<00:01:17.790> here<00:01:18.470> even<00:01:19.470> went

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
helicopter which is over here even went

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.539 
helicopter which is over here even went
to<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.890> completely<00:01:20.640> balanced<00:01:21.240> understood

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
to a completely balanced understood

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.580 
to a completely balanced understood
completely<00:01:23.549> balanced<00:01:24.180> head<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.049> knew<00:01:25.320> was

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
completely balanced head that I knew was

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.429 
completely balanced head that I knew was
in<00:01:25.890> good<00:01:26.220> shape<00:01:26.689> good<00:01:27.689> blades<00:01:27.960> brand<00:01:28.350> new

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
in good shape good blades brand new

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.140 
in good shape good blades brand new
carbon<00:01:28.799> fibers<00:01:29.130> went<00:01:29.340> through<00:01:29.520> two<00:01:29.790> or<00:01:29.880> three

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
carbon fibers went through two or three

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.700 
carbon fibers went through two or three
sets<00:01:30.420> balanced<00:01:30.960> um<00:01:31.079> made<00:01:31.290> sure<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.560> they

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
sets balanced um made sure that they

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.969 
sets balanced um made sure that they
were<00:01:31.740> CG<00:01:32.700> dokay<00:01:33.090> everything<00:01:33.630> was<00:01:33.780> great

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
were CG dokay everything was great

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.520 
were CG dokay everything was great
didn't<00:01:34.979> understand<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.810> so<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.229> know<00:01:37.350> with

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
didn't understand it so you know with

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.749 
didn't understand it so you know with
everything<00:01:37.799> off<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.250> know<00:01:38.340> what<00:01:38.490> i<00:01:38.520> would<00:01:38.640> do

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
everything off you know what i would do

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.789 
everything off you know what i would do
is<00:01:39.030> simply<00:01:39.479> spit<00:01:39.869> up<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.079> helicopter<00:01:40.619> let's

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
is simply spit up the helicopter let's

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.230 
is simply spit up the helicopter let's
see<00:01:40.890> if<00:01:40.979> i<00:01:41.040> could<00:01:41.100> do<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:41.430> without<00:01:41.579> losing<00:01:42.119> it

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
see if i could do this without losing it

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.840 
see if i could do this without losing it
here<00:01:42.270> yeah<00:01:43.259> she's<00:01:43.500> moving<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.860> little<00:01:43.979> bit<00:01:44.070> okay

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
here yeah she's moving a little bit okay

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.880 
here yeah she's moving a little bit okay
just<00:01:45.689> spinning<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.079> up<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.259> little<00:01:46.409> bit<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.770> is

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
just spinning it up a little bit this is

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.240 
just spinning it up a little bit this is
only<00:01:47.070> what<00:01:47.549> about<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.649> 25-percent<00:01:49.649> throttle

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
only what about the 25-percent throttle

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.819 
only what about the 25-percent throttle
okay<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.810> would<00:01:51.840> be<00:01:52.020> about<00:01:52.350> twenty<00:01:52.649> five

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
okay and that would be about twenty five

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.270 
okay and that would be about twenty five
percent<00:01:52.860> with<00:01:53.250> my<00:01:53.399> curve

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
percent with my curve

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.880 
percent with my curve
go<00:01:54.520> right<00:01:54.700> to<00:01:54.850> 100<00:01:55.180> at<00:01:55.299> half<00:01:55.540> throttle<00:01:55.840> so<00:01:56.260> but

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
go right to 100 at half throttle so but

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.359 
go right to 100 at half throttle so but
as<00:01:57.010> you<00:01:57.100> can<00:01:57.250> see<00:01:58.229> tail<00:01:59.229> servo<00:01:59.530> twitching<00:02:00.340> like

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
as you can see tail servo twitching like

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.499 
as you can see tail servo twitching like
man<00:02:01.560> had<00:02:02.560> no<00:02:02.740> idea<00:02:03.009> what<00:02:03.159> this<00:02:03.280> was<00:02:03.549> definitely

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
man had no idea what this was definitely

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.140 
man had no idea what this was definitely
you<00:02:05.049> know<00:02:05.170> not<00:02:05.560> a<00:02:05.619> vibration<00:02:06.400> I<00:02:06.580> can't<00:02:06.940> really

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
you know not a vibration I can't really

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.760 
you know not a vibration I can't really
feel<00:02:07.270> vibration<00:02:07.869> holding<00:02:08.140> on<00:02:08.229> to<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:08.440> heli<00:02:08.590> it

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
feel vibration holding on to the heli it

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.109 
feel vibration holding on to the heli it
does<00:02:08.950> vibrate<00:02:09.369> a<00:02:09.399> little<00:02:09.759> bit<00:02:09.880> but<00:02:10.000> the

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
does vibrate a little bit but the

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.550 
does vibrate a little bit but the
natural<00:02:10.450> tendencies<00:02:10.899> look<00:02:11.080> at<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.260> habit

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
natural tendencies look at the habit

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.949 
natural tendencies look at the habit
what's<00:02:11.739> almost<00:02:12.040> perfectly<00:02:12.610> straight<00:02:12.940> I<00:02:13.180> mean

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
what's almost perfectly straight I mean

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.240 
what's almost perfectly straight I mean
you<00:02:14.200> could<00:02:14.319> master<00:02:14.530> anything<00:02:14.890> better<00:02:15.190> than

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
you could master anything better than

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.940 
you could master anything better than
that<00:02:15.630> did<00:02:16.630> check<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.900> tailshaft<00:02:17.260> all<00:02:17.770> that

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
that did check the tailshaft all that

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.979 
that did check the tailshaft all that
nonsense<00:02:18.100> there<00:02:18.610> like<00:02:19.330> I<00:02:19.360> said<00:02:19.510> pick<00:02:19.780> about

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
nonsense there like I said pick about

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.949 
nonsense there like I said pick about
the<00:02:20.140> servo<00:02:20.470> but<00:02:20.650> it's<00:02:20.770> still<00:02:20.920> kept<00:02:21.130> doing<00:02:21.280> that

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
the servo but it's still kept doing that

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.520 
the servo but it's still kept doing that
notice<00:02:22.959> my<00:02:23.080> receiver<00:02:23.470> does<00:02:24.100> not<00:02:24.280> have<00:02:24.520> any<00:02:25.530> you

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
notice my receiver does not have any you

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.420 
notice my receiver does not have any you
know<00:02:26.650> that<00:02:26.950> we're<00:02:27.300> covering<00:02:28.300> over<00:02:28.480> it<00:02:29.310> hand<00:02:30.310> it

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
know that we're covering over it hand it

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.800 
know that we're covering over it hand it
over<00:02:30.519> there<00:02:30.670> before<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:31.180> it<00:02:31.269> was<00:02:31.300> still<00:02:31.540> doing

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
over there before and it was still doing

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.420 
over there before and it was still doing
it<00:02:31.930> obviously<00:02:32.350> so<00:02:32.650> I<00:02:32.680> took<00:02:32.800> it<00:02:32.950> apart<00:02:33.250> because

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
it obviously so I took it apart because

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.830 
it obviously so I took it apart because
I<00:02:33.550> wanted<00:02:33.730> to<00:02:33.820> inspect<00:02:34.120> it<00:02:34.330> to<00:02:34.360> see<00:02:34.600> what<00:02:34.720> was

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
I wanted to inspect it to see what was

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.040 
I wanted to inspect it to see what was
going<00:02:35.080> on<00:02:36.180> now<00:02:37.180> this<00:02:37.540> is<00:02:37.690> where<00:02:37.780> I<00:02:37.870> had

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
going on now this is where I had

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.809 
going on now this is where I had
something<00:02:38.320> weird<00:02:38.800> when<00:02:39.310> i<00:02:39.340> run<00:02:39.670> the

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
something weird when i run the

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.080 
something weird when i run the
helicopter<00:02:40.480> with<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.230> receiver<00:02:42.090> completely

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
helicopter with the receiver completely

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.550 
helicopter with the receiver completely
off<00:02:43.269> of<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.480> double-sided<00:02:43.930> tape<00:02:44.260> and

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
off of the double-sided tape and

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.590 
off of the double-sided tape and
everything<00:02:45.330> look<00:02:46.330> who<00:02:46.480> quiet<00:02:46.780> it<00:02:46.930> down<00:02:48.600> touch

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
everything look who quiet it down touch

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.590 
everything look who quiet it down touch
the<00:02:49.840> helicopter<00:02:50.350> with<00:02:50.470> a<00:02:50.500> receiver<00:02:51.450> servo<00:02:52.450> go

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
the helicopter with a receiver servo go

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.600 
the helicopter with a receiver servo go
crazy<00:02:52.900> let<00:02:53.590> go<00:02:53.739> of<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:53.920> helicopter<00:02:54.400> with<00:02:54.519> the

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
crazy let go of the helicopter with the

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.479 
crazy let go of the helicopter with the
receiver<00:02:54.970> sermo<00:02:55.300> stops<00:02:56.040> touch<00:02:57.040> it<00:02:57.250> so

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
receiver sermo stops touch it so

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.120 
receiver sermo stops touch it so
vibration<00:02:58.120> right<00:02:58.360> yep<00:02:58.690> definitely<00:02:59.019> well<00:02:59.950> I

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
vibration right yep definitely well I

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.650 
vibration right yep definitely well I
don't<00:03:00.370> really<00:03:00.489> have<00:03:00.610> a<00:03:00.820> vibration<00:03:01.450> that<00:03:01.540> I

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
don't really have a vibration that I

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.229 
don't really have a vibration that I
could<00:03:01.810> feel<00:03:02.019> everything<00:03:02.560> seems<00:03:02.980> okay<00:03:03.370> there

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
could feel everything seems okay there

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.750 
could feel everything seems okay there
is<00:03:04.360> a<00:03:04.390> slight<00:03:04.840> vibration<00:03:05.049> from<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:05.739> motor<00:03:05.950> but

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
is a slight vibration from the motor but

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.370 
is a slight vibration from the motor but
as<00:03:06.880> you<00:03:06.970> can<00:03:07.090> see<00:03:07.299> everything<00:03:07.660> looks<00:03:07.840> perfect

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
as you can see everything looks perfect

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.990 
as you can see everything looks perfect
it<00:03:08.829> looks<00:03:08.980> pretty<00:03:09.100> good<00:03:09.400> by<00:03:09.670> hand<00:03:09.880> a<00:03:09.940> little

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
it looks pretty good by hand a little

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.190 
it looks pretty good by hand a little
shaky<00:03:10.510> but<00:03:10.540> you<00:03:10.870> know<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:12.600> planting<00:03:13.600> the

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
shaky but you know so planting the

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.949 
shaky but you know so planting the
receiver<00:03:14.590> back<00:03:14.890> on<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:15.160> helicopter<00:03:15.959> we're

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
receiver back on the helicopter we're

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.000 
receiver back on the helicopter we're
going<00:03:17.110> to<00:03:17.170> take<00:03:17.290> a<00:03:17.350> better<00:03:17.560> look<00:03:17.620> at<00:03:17.890> the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
going to take a better look at the

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.620 
going to take a better look at the
receiver<00:03:18.400> and<00:03:18.730> namely<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:19.870> gyro<00:03:20.230> inside<00:03:21.630> what

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
receiver and namely the gyro inside what

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.570 
receiver and namely the gyro inside what
is<00:03:22.930> that<00:03:23.489> see<00:03:24.489> it<00:03:24.579> bubbling<00:03:24.910> around<00:03:25.209> in<00:03:25.540> there

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
is that see it bubbling around in there

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.640 
is that see it bubbling around in there
look<00:03:28.580> at<00:03:28.730> that<00:03:28.940> this<00:03:29.810> is<00:03:29.960> only<00:03:30.140> twenty<00:03:30.500> five

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
look at that this is only twenty five

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.040 
look at that this is only twenty five
percent<00:03:30.680> throttle<00:03:31.370> no<00:03:31.610> blades<00:03:31.970> no<00:03:32.210> nothing<00:03:32.930> on

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
percent throttle no blades no nothing on

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.560 
percent throttle no blades no nothing on
it<00:03:33.080> because<00:03:33.440> of<00:03:33.620> vibration<00:03:34.360> obviously<00:03:35.360> what

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
it because of vibration obviously what

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.120 
it because of vibration obviously what
I've<00:03:35.660> noticed<00:03:35.870> was<00:03:36.290> you<00:03:36.320> know<00:03:36.620> when<00:03:36.830> you<00:03:36.920> pick

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
I've noticed was you know when you pick

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.840 
I've noticed was you know when you pick
it<00:03:37.160> up<00:03:37.430> off<00:03:37.640> the<00:03:37.790> helicopter<00:03:39.700> notice<00:03:40.700> it

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
it up off the helicopter notice it

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.420 
it up off the helicopter notice it
doesn't<00:03:40.880> bobble<00:03:41.450> anymore<00:03:42.100> touch<00:03:43.100> it<00:03:43.250> to<00:03:43.370> the

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
doesn't bobble anymore touch it to the

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.790 
doesn't bobble anymore touch it to the
helicopter<00:03:47.050> yeah<00:03:48.050> you<00:03:48.110> can't<00:03:48.440> really<00:03:48.530> see<00:03:48.770> it

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
helicopter yeah you can't really see it

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.140 
helicopter yeah you can't really see it
that<00:03:48.890> much<00:03:49.220> I'm<00:03:49.400> not<00:03:49.550> really<00:03:49.670> touching<00:03:50.090> a

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
that much I'm not really touching a

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.110 
that much I'm not really touching a
perfect<00:03:50.540> but<00:03:50.750> bobble<00:03:51.160> so<00:03:52.160> basically<00:03:52.850> my

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
perfect but bobble so basically my

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.400 
perfect but bobble so basically my
receiver<00:03:53.660> is<00:03:53.900> shot<00:03:54.200> because<00:03:54.530> I<00:03:55.010> haven't<00:03:55.520> yet

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
receiver is shot because I haven't yet

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.440 
receiver is shot because I haven't yet
figured<00:03:57.410> out<00:03:57.620> a<00:03:57.680> way<00:03:58.720> to<00:03:59.720> get<00:03:59.870> in<00:04:00.050> there<00:04:00.260> and

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
figured out a way to get in there and

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.870 
figured out a way to get in there and
tight<00:04:02.450> it<00:04:02.630> sucker<00:04:03.200> down<00:04:03.500> I<00:04:03.770> don't<00:04:04.670> know<00:04:04.730> if<00:04:04.850> a

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
tight it sucker down I don't know if a

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.370 
tight it sucker down I don't know if a
God<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.180> solder<00:04:05.390> is<00:04:05.570> going<00:04:05.720> to<00:04:05.780> do<00:04:05.930> it<00:04:06.110> if<00:04:06.290> I

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
God the solder is going to do it if I

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.660 
God the solder is going to do it if I
could<00:04:06.530> just<00:04:06.560> goop<00:04:06.920> a<00:04:07.040> little<00:04:07.250> bit<00:04:07.370> in<00:04:07.490> there

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
could just goop a little bit in there

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.280 
could just goop a little bit in there
make<00:04:07.880> sure<00:04:07.910> it's<00:04:08.180> careful<00:04:08.600> or<00:04:08.750> some<00:04:08.930> epoxy

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
make sure it's careful or some epoxy

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.199 
make sure it's careful or some epoxy
maybe<00:04:09.709> I<00:04:09.800> could<00:04:10.010> just<00:04:10.100> jump<00:04:10.340> some<00:04:10.610> epoxy<00:04:10.940> in

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
maybe I could just jump some epoxy in

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.360 
maybe I could just jump some epoxy in
there<00:04:11.420> haven't<00:04:12.320> quite<00:04:12.380> figured<00:04:12.680> it<00:04:12.860> out<00:04:12.950> yet<00:04:13.010> I

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.430 
there haven't quite figured it out yet I
am<00:04:13.640> going<00:04:13.910> to<00:04:14.000> do<00:04:14.120> some<00:04:14.150> testing<00:04:14.750> and<00:04:14.990> I<00:04:15.260> will

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
am going to do some testing and I will

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:22.209
