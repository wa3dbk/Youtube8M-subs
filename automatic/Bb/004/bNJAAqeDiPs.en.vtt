00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 welcome to another video friends i am the 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.339
 louse this pokemon and good in this 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.649
 occasion was here to the channel another video 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.030
 of competitive analysis on this occasion 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.830
 of some analysis for a pokémon the 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.049
 which a lot of people were 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.490
 asking throughout the week as 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.080
 a couple of days ago I brought him in a 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.910
 fight here in the attempt three times in 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.010
 the channel and I think this pokemon 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.350
 they just loved it had commented 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.090
 one thing to which he made a small 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.740
 controversy in the comments saying 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.050
 that this pokemon could be a good 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.609
 trader inside omer just a lot of 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.289
 people told me that it was not very 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.600
 fragile that was a movement that had 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.880
 faster things but I really think 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.350
 that this can give quite a few surprises and 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.120
 in this analysis I will try to 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.520
 explain them but good friends before 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.899
 start with this video you know I hope 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.520
 so can you please support here to 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.649
 channel and can destroy the button me 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.020
 like and aversion support we come to the 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.700
 200 likes let's see how it goes with them 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.320
 that but good as they are 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.600
 directly with competitive analysis 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.000
 for this pokemon will start by analyzing 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.520
 the statistics that the pokemon has in 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.050
 question is very fragile that's true that 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.070
 nobody doubts that this pokemon 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.840
 it's a glass cup a glass of 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.799
 crystal since it has nothing else 3 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.570
 5 hp 50 for physical defense and 70 for 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.490
 special defense a pretty Pokémon 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.990
 fragile which is true but this 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.670
 Pokemon is obviously not made to 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.740
 resist is made to be fast and 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.929
 hit powerful which is what in itself this 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.179
 pokemon does you can also see that by 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:27.899
 the offensive side we have 80 attack 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:30.149
 physical 50 of special attack and 120 of 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:33.090
 speed are a little bit that truly 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.799
 it's not so slow friends really not me 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.560
 André, there are only two things that we 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.610
 exceed in net basis which would be 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.890
 tan or train 'for its 126 and for the 122 of 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.750
 base that has but from then on we are 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.110
 faster than everything else obviously 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.429
 if the opponent brought some pokemones cars or 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.679
 something like that that's already 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:54.299
 completely different but nothing 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:56.399
 more than two things faster than 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.229
 us inside over now continues 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.149
 analyzing the pokemon the object that is going to 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.069
 bring this pokemon is going to make almost a 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.649
 100 in the focus band because this 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.929
 pokemon can see they could see that by 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.149
 the statistics is very fragile so 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:13.110
 they can not resist more than an attack since 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:16.950
 has 40 physics 35 h 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.630
 and 50 defense of physical defense 35 of hp and 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.880
 70 special defense making it 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.070
 too fragile so the focus band 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.020
 is more than necessary for in any case 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.210
 that we will need it in some 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.760
 moment of combat which he wants 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.680
 is going to get yes or yes the movement that you 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.060
 let's put or skill forgiveness that 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.580
 we are going to put it is going to be a great 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.260
 very good which is a sand trap that 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.880
 what it does is that any pokemon that 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.459
 is not flying type or failing 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.200
 do not have the invitation or be immune to 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.650
 the severe earth type movements 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:50.010
 forcefully mopped inside this 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.080
 pokemon so in itself if this pokemon 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.690
 You can go when you want to attack 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.000
 for example soul images that is another 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.100
 because eses cartos that looks a lot 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.320
 inside the over you strip is this 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.959
 Pokemon mops it and makes it can not 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.810
 escape forcing magnesium to stay 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.450
 in combat which will allow us 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.150
 destroy it from an earthquake friends like that 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.250
 that if this pokemon is made to 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.350
 destroy him better trapper by the 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.540
 moment which is magnitude not like 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.740
 commented sand trap what it does is almost 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.630
 the same as magnet 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.550
 but nevertheless it covers more things because 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.350
 this movement does not cover anything else 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.180
 steel types that cover badly but that 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.860
 cover all the other pokemon while 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.290
 are not flying type or failing 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.270
 be immune to type movements 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.710
 good land it 's time to continue with 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.930
 the movements that are very important 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.240
 this pokemon I learned a lot of 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.040
 super interesting movements 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.480
 which then comment on the first 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.150
 movement can be completely 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.040
 optional can put you back to the one that 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.380
 what this movement does is that between 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.090
 less life we ​​have and creating that this 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.290
 Pokemon is going to have very little life of 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.720
 done I think after the first 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.300
 movement we are going to require the band 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.130
 focus so imagine being a ps and 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.680
 reverse what it does is that the less 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.200
 ps we have more power will acquire the 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.150
 movement itself so imagine that 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.670
 this movement in this very moment 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.580
 when we have nothing more a weight comes to 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.100
 have 200 power is a power 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.079
 bestial we are also going to 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.509
 check that it is 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.609
 because I can learn the traps 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:22.620
 rocks so if we need some 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.360
 pokemon I need to put trap rocks 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.610
 if our team can none 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.590
 we could lose perfectly adult 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.719
 that apart from being a pretty ragpicker 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.819
 good makes a very fast pokémon can 

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:35.460
 put the rocks to the rival field which 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:37.469
 it's always more than unnecessary friend is 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.270
 more than necessary next movement 

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:41.939
 that is not so seen but can work 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.500
 too well it's going to be memento what 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:45.750
 we can do with an event well 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.639
 What he does is sacrifice the 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.030
 pokemon no matter if we have all the 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.590
 life if we have 10 % if we have 1 % 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.680
 thanks the focus band what it does 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.750
 moment is to sacrifice the pokemon and 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.789
 lower the physical attack as much as 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.590
 special of the rival in two levels this 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:03.360
 so that it can serve us in case 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.879
 that we have another pokemon in our 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.620
 combat and is rival and nothing else have one 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:09.419
 but we know that the opponent can 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.699
 destroy both pokemon what we can 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.560
 to do is to put the memento down 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:15.689
 physical attack or special attack good 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.520
 lower both attacks and after 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:19.830
 enter with the other pokemon entered the 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.080
 more comfortable way and starting to 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.889
 look for us if we need it that way 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.749
 is 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:27.090
 will start to distress us in its absence 

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:29.520
 attack him and destroy him friends since 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.229
 as you will know now the opponent has less 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.819
 two physical attack and attack 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:34.889
 special which will give us an advantage 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:36.800
 quite broad in question with the 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.909
 next pokemon that we want to enter 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.889
 following movements are completely 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:43.439
 offensive which will be earthquake 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:46.139
 and sharp rock this movement make a 

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:47.849
 really good offensive core are in fact one 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.129
 of the best offensives there is the 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:52.289
 earthquake and sharp rock but as 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:54.419
 commented earthquake is completely for 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.550
 mop and completely destroy everyone 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:58.529
 the steels of over views and obviously 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.509
 also to destroy magness though 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:02.279
 he is the ragpicker par excellence but against 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:03.240
 this pokemon has absolutely nothing 

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:05.099
 what to do 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.620
 rocca at the end for fliers as per 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:09.240
 example heel flame among others 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.819
 another good thing about this pokemon is that 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.740
 he also learns low blow so if 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:17.039
 we avoid a priority movement the 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.719
 pokemon can learn it ok go to the 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:21.569
 distribution of points of effort that goes 

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:24.089
 to be very simple 252 in speed being 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:26.400
 happy to have a maximum though 

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:29.210
 images show sea escarp the maximum 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.280
 it might be 252 also in speed 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.380
 we will be faster than the pokemon 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.720
 by 12 points so you can see that 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.880
 this pokemon is very fast the truth as 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.889
 I told them nothing else there are two things in 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.080
 net base that can beat us in 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:44.030
 speed that are gremin is already what 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.210
 set yesterday more we will be the fastest 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:49.069
 we are going to put 252 to attack 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.440
 physical to have the maximum possible that 

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:54.440
 however, it is not too much 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.930
 we are close to the 260 and finally 4 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.819
 in the special defense and not in the hp 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.680
 to have an odd number and receive the 

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:02.120
 less damage by trap rocks though if 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.060
 this pokemon comes before the traps 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.650
 rocks loses too much because it would lose 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.780
 the focus band and this one because I do not 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:11.570
 you need yes or yes to at least perform 

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:13.610
 two attacks or put rocks attack put 

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:15.919
 rocks and then use memento in die 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.930
 case that we do not need so this 

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:19.849
 pokemon if you need too much 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:22.280
 traps rocks is a very fast ragpicker 

00:07:19.849 --> 00:07:25.310
 rape too many things in fact mop 

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:27.650
 the tupper par excellence and above is
