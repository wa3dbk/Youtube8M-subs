00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:08.970
 It's from life that life struggles 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.690
 life should be the priority or not 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.820
 there is a kind of life watching 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.210
 moment of our society 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.279
 we can say that we are in a position 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:24.000
 we have not become what we need 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.930
 to be and we are no longer that cruel 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.699
 we descend from the pedestal at the top of the chain 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.669
 where they were destroying the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.100
 ecosystems and now we are headed towards a 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.059
 new planetary consciousness where 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.040
 we assume our true vocation that the 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:44.340
 responsibility to serve a planet 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.660
 It is a fact that this past posture is 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.629
 getting to the end 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.570
 the models and cities we have today are 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.610
 similar to a black hole where the 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.090
 concentration is so large that it consumes 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.160
 everything even the light itself but we can 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.969
 create our cities as a port in 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.199
 revitalization centers expansion 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.100
 involving natural resources and 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.770
 rebuilding the biodiversity cycle 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:14.040
 innovation and creativity as we can 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.979
 inverting this signal passes the destruction 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.860
 the nourishment and flourishing of cities 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.040
 how to turn cities into spaces 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.230
 of revitalization 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.930
 We can start our walk. 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.140
 putting into practice for example the 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.380
 values proposed by the Earth Charter 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.570
 in the social environmental spheres, but this 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.420
 important change is through change 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:43.800
 the attitudes of the students of each 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.870
 It 's strange to think that only now. 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.630
 we are realizing how much the 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.670
 our economic system than the man who 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.620
 appropriates the life of the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.070
 natural resources and human labor 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.470
 completely affected as it would be 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.280
 our life if we lacked light for what 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.979
 probes and not by the one in which the 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.119
 role of politics but to reinvent ourselves 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:12.930
 as a society and nurture relations 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:16.650
 between people in the communities 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.320
 countries and on the planet can do 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.500
 believes in new forms of 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.520
 make policy a policy that consider the 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.520
 life first
