00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
really a wonderful shell the first thing

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.020 
really a wonderful shell the first thing
I<00:00:56.460> noticed<00:00:56.850> about<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.210> how<00:00:57.360> dry<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:59.640> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
I noticed about is how dry it is the the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.479 
I noticed about is how dry it is the the
shell<00:01:00.270> itself<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.320> weight<00:01:01.770> it's<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.250> lower

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
shell itself it the weight it's a lower

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.210 
shell itself it the weight it's a lower
weight<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.539> appears<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.680> moisture

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
weight and it appears that the moisture

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.969 
weight and it appears that the moisture
that<00:01:05.489> was<00:01:05.700> inside<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.540> pores<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.080> shell

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
that was inside the pores of the shell

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.550 
that was inside the pores of the shell
seems<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.580> have<00:01:08.700> dried<00:01:09.540> out<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.170> seems<00:01:10.439> a

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
seems to have dried out so it seems a

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.649 
seems to have dried out so it seems a
lot<00:01:10.710> older<00:01:10.920> than<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.430> may<00:01:11.820> be<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.060> actually<00:01:12.479> is

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
lot older than it may be it actually is

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.260 
lot older than it may be it actually is
but<00:01:13.350> as<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.650> result<00:01:14.100> has<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> really<00:01:14.820> great

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
but as a result has a really great

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.550 
but as a result has a really great
crispy<00:01:16.200> tone<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.990> it's<00:01:18.990> almost<00:01:19.320> as<00:01:19.530> if

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
crispy tone to it it's almost as if

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.429 
crispy tone to it it's almost as if
there's<00:01:20.159> nothing<00:01:20.640> inhibiting<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:22.020> tone<00:01:22.229> of

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
there's nothing inhibiting the tone of

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.710 
there's nothing inhibiting the tone of
