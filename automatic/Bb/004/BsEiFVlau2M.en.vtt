00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:33.860

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.590

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.700
 to which she even dedicated a whole 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:50.059
 advertising video separate 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:52.040
 Presentation is a preview with an interesting 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.250
 general format you can by the way 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.900
 look it up on the essence ssylochku 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.960
 is that will introduce 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.010
 smartphone company called lg 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.070
 g2 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.230
 Well, now and rumored august 7 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.250
 there will be a presentation waiting for a novelty from 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.920
 lg company 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.650
 now more news from south korea 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:17.240
 Samsung launches first long 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.320
 Polish conference, it will be held 27 and 29 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.650
 July 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.110
 Of course she not in South Korea will pass so 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.430
 the bottom line is that samsung 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.530
 wants to share certain 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.070
 Developer Toolkit 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.430
 applications as well as wild and generally well 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.680
 I think that samsung is serious 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.270
 not only to 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.630
 base your applications and generally your 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.240
 your android operating system for sure 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.759
 Something will show from their developments 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.469
 and as for the rumored 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.210
 as well as on some devices in the south 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:52.310
 korea 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.189
 operating system tizen or tayzen i 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.619
 I do not know how it is called correctly but 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:00.680
 the bottom line is that this is the first 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.630
 affairs first conference something well all 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.880
 It reminds of course of development 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.390
 conferences from the same google and 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.660
 apple 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.150
 Well, let's see that samsung will be ready 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.580
 present generally show on these then 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.920
 release developer conferences 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.440
 Samsung also introduced its 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.860
 new exynos 5 octa processor 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.520
 which will be 20 percent more powerful 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.370
 and also for sure it will be installed in the new 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.510
 samsung galaxy laptop 3 which 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.060
 expected to be presented in September 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.290
 so 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.470
 find out how powerful the processor is and 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.599
 In general, how cool is this? 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.910
 new processor on smartphones we can 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.530
 learn not soon if on and what is the previous one 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.019
 generation of processors proved not 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.080
 very good and good and again about samsung 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:53.920
 during the servant that samsung wants to release 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.380
 some 12-inch tablet in which 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.870
 will be very interesting and resolution well 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:02.530
 generally the quality is exactly the same as 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.569
 at nexus 10 2560 by 1600 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:09.459
 but the feature is that it is 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:12.340
 1 or more precisely 2 android tablet which 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.000
 will have this super crisp high 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.160
 resolution 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.709
 Well, tablets on windows gloves 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.260
 By resolution, we have already seen tablets on a 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.930
 with clear permission we have already seen 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.980
 it remains only on android and 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:29.349
 Yes, everything is in principle, so we are waiting for samsung 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.530
 amaze gave the network information appeared 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:36.310
 that nokia wants to present some 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:39.609
 some big i don't even know what 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.430
 smartphone tablet or large device 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:44.920
 well here's something big they want 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.530
 I do not know what they have there big 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.750
 lying around somewhere but the bottom line is 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.980
 that literally a few hours 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:57.340
 later appeared information about nokia 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:01.269
 lumia 625 white very soon go to 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:05.340
 sale and it has a 4 and 7 inch display 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:10.510
 which is more than nokia 1020 and 925 and and 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:12.970
 928 and 920, but those of 4 5 inches 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.950
 the display here is 47 the only thing that 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.829
 specifications are very meagerly wools and 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.970
 2-core processor 12 512 each 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:25.060
 RAM and a memory 8 gigov 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:27.310
 Well, in my opinion the 8-megapixel camera is not 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.500
 I know this little wanted to show 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.139
 nokia companies but really it's not 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.900
 very interesting maybe all the same 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:37.780
 something big they have lying around like 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:41.530
 think ubuntu decided to surprise the world guys 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.810
 decided to release a smartphone for release 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.330
 a smartphone is required really 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.880
 high amount of money that they have 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.060
 absolutely no 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:54.550
 approximately 32 million dollars and 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:57.190
 Plus, they say that this 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:00.430
 smartphone can even change 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.950
 representation not only about mobile 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:06.550
 electronics and computers 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:08.350
 Well, firstly it is because the technical 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.730
 the characteristics of this smartphone will be 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.730
 very impressive 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.980
 well about 4 and in this operative 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:18.240
 memory, that is, there will be a hundred and twenty 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:21.010
 eight gigabytes of internal memory will be 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.970
 very large powerful graphic 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.800
 CPU 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:28.750
 the only screen resolution will be not 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:31.030
 the most top 1280 to 720 but generally on 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.090
 in fact, the smartphone will be released only in 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.280
 next year and if they collect money if 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.470
