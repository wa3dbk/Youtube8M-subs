00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.790
 first of all family athlon as the name 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.550
 the indicated is the manifestation for the 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.200
 family so him the idea is that the

 some go who sponsor 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.640
 universes so the principle of this 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.330
 manifestation is to have four 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.940
 different universes 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.320

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.810
 little else the rest 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.759
 beautiful operation first it's 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.110
 wonderful to be having some sport and 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.560
 tea of ​​the states especially under the 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.300
 Eiffel Tower 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.830
 so that's the first thing I see 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.690
 in addition that there are many people 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.580
 since this morning for not having the 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.440
 animators and then more for us 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.850
 it's a very good opportunity 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.959
 in a few months we will have the 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.239
 world championships we will have a 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.319
 caravan of table tennis and I 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.180
 continues very good repetition 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.120
 the world champion our goal 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.380
 it's to present the ping together 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.660
 practitioners not only 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.370
 obviously for 200 me fire your 5 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.570
 millions of practitioners and I believe that 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.430
 developing table tennis 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.540
 actually if we are able to integrate 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.560
 the practice room 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.600
 so that's an opportunity 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.489
 extraordinary to show that at any age 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.180
 in a different way we can play 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.400
 Table tennis 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.959
 so this is the promotion for tennis 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.640
 of table generally and for the 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.200
 federation especially for the league 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.870
 because I think it's okay 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.310
 bring in more ping jeans and 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.019
 when we see that again the 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.060
 world championships that will create a 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.760
 true craze 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.440
 it's been 25 years since we had 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.450
 objective of increasing in the essentials of 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.310
 100000 we can not do it we 're fine 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.079
 with traditional practice we do not 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.329
 will not happen we know that the number of 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.670
 tables sold to the hands increasing 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:17.579
 permanent so with tassels oise ago 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.260
 a ping everyone is playing and people 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.640
 who are going back and the pigment recreation 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.500
 of tomorrow they compete 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.640
 for some and not others but 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.430
 it's still the same activity 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.030
 a racket ball a table what 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.030
 whatever the form 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.970
 it's okay but there 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.900
 here we go 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.930
 here 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.720
 very well we continue continuously then 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.110
 here we are in the universe of 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:57.890
 vikings so we target kids from 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.060
 roughly 4 to 7 years old also counts 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.040

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.580
 workshops small playful workshops 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.200
 so for example we have the market where 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.510
 the kids are not going to buy bananas 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.170
 strawberries or salads we have the 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.140

 we juggle we have the waiter 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.810
 where you have to be careful not to 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.180
 drop the racket ball 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.489
 here are different workshops with small 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.930

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.480
 playful to see whether it's on the tab 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.460

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.470
 framed or if brought in anyway 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.569
 we are far from the image of tennis 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.220
 table 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:52.250
 competition that pedagogically very 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:55.569
 interesting me I do not speak much 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.569
 but all my balls are on the table 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.459

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:12.459

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.529
 hop there 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.700
 we will see 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.700
 go a little effort 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:38.809
 you've already targeted this one this workshop 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:41.359
 which is called the tonic fitting 

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:43.459
 we are going to give priority to women 

00:05:41.359 --> 00:05:45.559
 of any age whatsoever 

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:47.209

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:48.979
 years with workshops we go a lot 

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:51.439
 work proprioception the 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:54.109
 bodybuilding and the use of sound 

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:55.489
 body we do not close to men so we 

00:05:54.109 --> 00:05:56.869
 has a lot of boys who finally they 

00:05:55.489 --> 00:05:58.669
 also come to realize that 

00:05:56.869 --> 00:06:01.099
 work with the medicine ball with 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:04.610
 physiotherapy balloons or cushions 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:05.989
 proprioception is fun and so the 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.269
 we try to make a whole journey 

00:06:05.989 --> 00:06:10.459
 by making work 

00:06:07.269 --> 00:06:14.209
 alas the proprioception to start 

00:06:10.459 --> 00:06:16.369
 bodybuilding the sensation of 

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:18.589
 to balance the displacement we are going 

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:21.559
 especially working with juggling 

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:23.299
 we will change foot every moment 

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:26.049
 where we go forward so we're going to have some 

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:27.829
 hoops gait we can facilitate 

00:06:26.049 --> 00:06:29.089
 the workshop taking one or two 

00:06:27.829 --> 00:06:31.009
 rackets by bouncing the ball 

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:33.319
 by bouncing the ball is actually this 

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:34.789
 course takes us on a table we go 

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:36.860
 we have big airbags so 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:38.509
 Physiotherapy cushions that are going to muscle 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.329
 the back and the abdominals but we're going 

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:44.389
 play on the roof with around the table 

00:06:40.329 --> 00:06:46.009
 with this balloon and subconsciously actually 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:47.869
 we often go to muscle and 

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:49.759
 the lumbar and abdominal 

00:06:47.869 --> 00:06:51.589
 playing without realizing it and in 

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:52.579
 laughing and finally even 

00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:53.749
 people who know how to play go 

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:55.039
 account and it's not necessarily obvious 

00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:56.449
 to play on a balloon we discover a 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:58.639
 practice different table tennis 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:59.929
 and that allows people who are 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:02.499
 not necessarily strong enough to be able to save 

00:06:59.929 --> 00:07:02.499
 see very well 

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.940
 sarah lane 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.389

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.210
 dgo 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.690
 Okay
