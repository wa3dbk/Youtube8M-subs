00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:22.449 
device I'm never sure what it is but

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.859 
device I'm never sure what it is but
anyway<00:00:23.160> looks<00:00:24.160> absolutely<00:00:24.730> gorgeous

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
anyway looks absolutely gorgeous

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.269 
anyway looks absolutely gorgeous
when<00:00:26.380> sailfish<00:00:26.949> is<00:00:27.099> running<00:00:27.429> on<00:00:27.579> it

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
when sailfish is running on it

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.799 
when sailfish is running on it
transitions<00:00:30.279> are<00:00:30.460> a<00:00:30.849> little<00:00:31.179> bit<00:00:31.329> different

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:31.809 
transitions are a little bit different

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:39.389 
transitions are a little bit different
it<00:00:32.680> looks<00:00:33.300> slower<00:00:34.300> but<00:00:35.399> actually<00:00:36.399> isn't<00:00:38.399> let

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
it looks slower but actually isn't let

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:40.490 
it looks slower but actually isn't let
me<00:00:39.670> see

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
me see

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.719 
me see
yeah<00:00:41.500> and<00:00:41.649> I<00:00:41.710> have<00:00:41.860> asked<00:00:42.190> they're<00:00:42.339> actually

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:42.729 
yeah and I have asked they're actually

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:46.170 
yeah and I have asked they're actually
no<00:00:42.879> no<00:00:43.180> modifications<00:00:43.989> done<00:00:44.399> other<00:00:45.399> than<00:00:45.519> for

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
no no modifications done other than for

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.719 
no no modifications done other than for
the<00:00:46.469> background<00:00:47.469> so<00:00:48.040> it<00:00:48.129> should<00:00:48.309> you<00:00:49.030> match

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:50.729 
the background so it should you match

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:52.140 
the background so it should you match
pretty<00:00:51.729> much

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
pretty much

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.210 
pretty much
many<00:00:52.809> of<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.080> stock<00:00:53.290> works<00:00:53.530> but<00:00:53.710> this<00:00:53.860> is<00:00:54.009> this

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
many of the stock works but this is this

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.130 
many of the stock works but this is this
is<00:00:54.369> only<00:00:54.540> work<00:00:55.540> of<00:00:55.689> one<00:00:56.140> day<00:00:56.350> so<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:58.750> can<00:00:58.930> you

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
is only work of one day so you can you

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.569 
is only work of one day so you can you
can<00:00:59.290> expect<00:00:59.710> some<00:00:59.920> parts<00:01:02.489> anyway<00:01:04.170> have<00:01:05.170> this

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:05.579 
can expect some parts anyway have this

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:09.870 
can expect some parts anyway have this
Nexus<00:01:06.579> 4<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:08.590> is<00:01:08.710> actually<00:01:09.250> running

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
Nexus 4 that is actually running

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.580 
Nexus 4 that is actually running
sailfish<00:01:10.869> and<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:13.030> have<00:01:13.270> I<00:01:13.570> have<00:01:14.110> actually

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
sailfish and I have I have actually

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.499 
sailfish and I have I have actually
heard<00:01:14.770> that<00:01:14.920> the<00:01:15.070> modem<00:01:15.399> is<00:01:15.490> working<00:01:16.210> on<00:01:16.360> this

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
heard that the modem is working on this

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.930 
heard that the modem is working on this
one<00:01:16.750> but<00:01:16.930> there's<00:01:17.229> no<00:01:17.320> SIM<00:01:17.560> card<00:01:17.799> in<00:01:17.920> it<00:01:18.040> so

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.250 

everything<00:01:21.940> basically<00:01:22.120> works<00:01:22.600> but<00:01:22.900> the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
everything basically works but the

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.910 
everything basically works but the
camera<00:01:23.650> I<00:01:23.680> guess<00:01:23.830> is<00:01:24.340> not<00:01:24.700> our<00:01:24.970> work

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
we have the tablet Nexus 7 running

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.880 
we have the tablet Nexus 7 running
sailfish<00:02:05.600> which<00:02:06.310> is<00:02:07.810> not<00:02:08.810> optimized<00:02:09.410> for<00:02:09.770> the

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
sailfish which is not optimized for the

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.020 
sailfish which is not optimized for the
tablet<00:02:10.369> but<00:02:10.670> just<00:02:11.709> showing<00:02:12.709> that<00:02:13.190> yeah<00:02:13.580> we<00:02:14.000> can

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
tablet but just showing that yeah we can

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:21.310 
tablet but just showing that yeah we can
do<00:02:14.360> it

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.020 

yeah<00:02:22.320> I<00:02:22.620> was<00:02:22.860> just<00:02:23.130> saying<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:23.730> it's<00:02:23.850> not<00:02:24.000> a

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
yeah I was just saying that it's not a

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.690 
yeah I was just saying that it's not a
tablet<00:02:24.450> UI<00:02:24.600> so<00:02:25.050> people<00:02:26.010> should<00:02:26.160> bear<00:02:26.370> that<00:02:26.400> in

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
tablet UI so people should bear that in

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.530 
tablet UI so people should bear that in
mind<00:02:26.730> but<00:02:27.120> when<00:02:27.720> everything<00:02:27.930> works

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.260 

there<00:02:34.319> was<00:02:34.439> a<00:02:34.469> sound<00:02:34.739> but

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.530 

well<00:02:37.810> anyway

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
well anyway

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.920 
well anyway
this<00:02:41.049> is<00:02:41.170> how<00:02:41.319> it<00:02:41.469> looks<00:02:42.390> but<00:02:43.390> it<00:02:43.569> actually

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
this is how it looks but it actually

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.929 
this is how it looks but it actually
runs<00:02:44.110> I<00:02:44.349> mean<00:02:44.500> it's<00:02:45.370> an<00:02:45.430> Android<00:02:45.670> hardware

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:45.939 
runs I mean it's an Android hardware

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:48.330 
runs I mean it's an Android hardware
hardware<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:46.780> it's<00:02:47.230> a<00:02:47.319> software<00:02:48.040> I<00:02:48.159> mean

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
hardware and it's a software I mean

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:55.500 
hardware and it's a software I mean
sailfish<00:02:48.790> OS<00:02:48.909> and<00:02:49.719> runs<00:02:50.519> pretty<00:02:51.519> smooth<00:02:51.819> on<00:02:52.030> it

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.369 

then

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:57.379 
then

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:02.830 
then
we<00:02:57.739> have<00:03:00.249> have<00:03:01.249> the<00:03:01.400> Kuiti<00:03:01.790> keyboard<00:03:02.209> other

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
we have have the Kuiti keyboard other

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.720 
we have have the Kuiti keyboard other
half

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
half

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.680 
half
that<00:03:05.330> actually<00:03:06.250> is<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.909> very<00:03:08.300> basic

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
that actually is the very basic

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:17.130 
that actually is the very basic
prototype<00:03:09.200> of<00:03:09.379> it<00:03:09.530> but<00:03:10.959> what<00:03:11.959> is<00:03:12.049> there

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.370 

I<00:03:17.170> can<00:03:17.620> just<00:03:17.830> adjust<00:03:18.070> anyways<00:03:19.830> just<00:03:20.830> like<00:03:21.340> that

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
I can just adjust anyways just like that

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.180 
I can just adjust anyways just like that
the<00:03:23.380> battery<00:03:23.680> of<00:03:23.860> my<00:03:23.890> camera<00:03:24.070> is<00:03:24.970> running<00:03:25.150> out

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
the battery of my camera is running out
