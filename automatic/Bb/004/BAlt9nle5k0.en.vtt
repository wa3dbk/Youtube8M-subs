this<00:03:43.930> album<00:03:44.440> another<00:03:45.430> thing<00:03:45.579> I<00:03:45.670> want<00:03:45.850> to<00:03:45.910> say

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
this album another thing I want to say

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.809 
this album another thing I want to say
is<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:46.959> production<00:03:47.769> although<00:03:47.980> it<00:03:48.250> was<00:03:48.400> good

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
is the production although it was good

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.420 
is the production although it was good
it<00:03:49.030> still<00:03:49.540> wasn't<00:03:49.750> standout<00:03:50.380> production<00:03:50.920> that

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
it still wasn't standout production that

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.610 
it still wasn't standout production that
Dom<00:03:51.700> Kennedy<00:03:52.019> usually<00:03:53.019> picks<00:03:53.350> there's

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
Dom Kennedy usually picks there's

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.890 
Dom Kennedy usually picks there's
nothing<00:03:53.950> that<00:03:54.100> really<00:03:54.250> let<00:03:54.549> me<00:03:54.700> down<00:03:54.870> what<00:03:55.870> I

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
nothing that really let me down what I

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.379 
nothing that really let me down what I
do<00:03:56.019> like<00:03:56.200> about<00:03:56.410> this<00:03:56.920> album<00:03:57.790> was<00:03:57.940> that<00:03:58.150> he

just<00:04:04.239> ride<00:04:04.450> around<00:04:04.480> in<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:04.900> car<00:04:05.109> to<00:04:05.350> on<00:04:05.470> a

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
just ride around in the car to on a

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.860 
just ride around in the car to on a
summer's<00:04:05.889> day<00:04:05.920> so<00:04:06.639> he<00:04:06.819> stuck<00:04:07.209> with<00:04:07.420> that<00:04:07.450> and

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
summer's day so he stuck with that and

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.750 
summer's day so he stuck with that and
that's<00:04:08.230> what<00:04:08.410> I<00:04:08.440> liked<00:04:08.739> about<00:04:08.889> this<00:04:09.280> album

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
that's what I liked about this album

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.240 
that's what I liked about this album
he's<00:04:10.389> found<00:04:10.720> his<00:04:11.019> sound<00:04:11.350> and<00:04:11.650> he<00:04:11.829> has<00:04:11.950> stuck<00:04:12.220> to

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
he's found his sound and he has stuck to

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.309 
he's found his sound and he has stuck to
his<00:04:12.579> sound<00:04:12.850> but<00:04:13.389> I<00:04:13.420> felt<00:04:13.720> that<00:04:13.810> he<00:04:13.900> was<00:04:13.930> getting

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
his sound but I felt that he was getting

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.810 
his sound but I felt that he was getting
a<00:04:14.440> bit<00:04:14.799> lazy<00:04:15.609> on<00:04:16.120> this<00:04:16.930> album<00:04:17.229> so<00:04:17.889> that's

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
a bit lazy on this album so that's

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.759 
a bit lazy on this album so that's
basically<00:04:18.940> what<00:04:19.450> I<00:04:19.479> had<00:04:19.720> to<00:04:19.750> say<00:04:19.959> about<00:04:20.410> this

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
basically what I had to say about this

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.649 
basically what I had to say about this
whole<00:04:20.950> album<00:04:21.250> I<00:04:21.340> wasn't<00:04:21.519> very<00:04:21.669> impressed<00:04:22.450> I

00:04:22.649 --> 00:04:22.659 
whole album I wasn't very impressed I

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:24.690 
whole album I wasn't very impressed I
was<00:04:23.080> a<00:04:23.110> little<00:04:23.380> disappointed<00:04:23.500> but<00:04:24.070> I<00:04:24.340> still

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.880 
decent because I feel he could have come
a<00:04:43.830> lot<00:04:44.130> harder<00:04:44.550> than<00:04:45.000> he<00:04:45.930> did<00:04:46.200> on<00:04:46.380> this<00:04:46.680> album

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890

a lot harder than he did on this album

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.160 
and nothing I think he should have given
us<00:04:49.080> so<00:04:49.320> many<00:04:49.560> tracks<00:04:50.040> 18<00:04:50.700> tracks<00:04:51.090> I<00:04:51.480> mean<00:04:52.020> he

review for get home safely Dom Kennedy I

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:17.600 
review for get home safely Dom Kennedy I
thought<00:05:16.800> he<00:05:16.890> could<00:05:17.010> have<00:05:17.100> had<00:05:17.220> some<00:05:17.430> better

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
thought he could have had some better

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.310 
thought he could have had some better
features<00:05:17.820> as<00:05:18.150> well<00:05:18.180> and<00:05:18.630> some<00:05:18.750> more<00:05:18.900> female

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
features as well and some more female

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.830 
features as well and some more female
vocals<00:05:19.770> to<00:05:19.950> make<00:05:20.070> it<00:05:20.160> a<00:05:20.220> bit<00:05:20.340> more<00:05:20.400> interesting

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
vocals to make it a bit more interesting

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.990 
vocals to make it a bit more interesting
but<00:05:21.840> yeah<00:05:22.830> people<00:05:23.220> are<00:05:23.280> spoken<00:05:23.610> to<00:05:23.880> a<00:05:23.910> few

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000
