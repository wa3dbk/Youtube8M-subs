00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Well, Johnny Ive calls me and says: "Hey, take a prototype of the new MacBook"! 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.008
 Hurry up! Tim Cook is almost here and wants to look at what we have done " 

00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:09.010
 Tim enters and looks furious 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.040
 I will never forget this ... his dirty hair and expensive suit. 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.460
 Joni gives Tim a laptop and realizes he forgot the USB port. 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.465
 No USB port .. 

00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:27.009
 Imbecile 

00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:30.003
 For sure! 

00:00:31.008 --> 00:00:37.015
 You should have seen how Joni's face turned red like a tomato !!! 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Red like a tomato ?! 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.008
 All the engineers in the room were nervous and scattered around. 

00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:52.010
 Then Tim Cook took the laptop and began to examine it. 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.005
 He looked at Joni and asked: "Where are all the USB and ThunderBolt ports?" 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.080
 ..present ... without USB ports ... 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.080
 ... with a mobile processor ... 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.200
 $ 1,299! 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.200
 This is all that our customers need! 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.200
 Dear netbook! 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.525
 But it turned out... 

00:01:16.525 --> 00:01:18.515
 He liked the idea! 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 And Tim said: "Start production tomorrow!" 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 Oh wait, that's not all! The battery did not fit inside, because the laptop was too thin 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.160
 Steve Jobs would fire us all ... 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.160
 ... the same second I took the laptop 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.305
 But seriously, it’s all Joni’s merit. 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.400
 In the end, the idea of ​​the multilayer battery design belongs to him. 

00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:52.010
 He even had tears in his eyes. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 And even the laptop is even available in the gold color of the case! 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Tim shaval it 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 We were all stunned by how he took it. 

00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:06.010
 After that I didn’t see Tim all day and went home. 

00:02:09.005 --> 00:02:10.010
 WITHOUT PORTS! 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.680
 They raised ... 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.020
 They promoted me! 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.020
 That evening I got a call from the personnel department 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 And they said that I was promoted to a senior designer and will receive an awesome salary! 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.200
 Oh, no, that's not all! In the morning, I suggested that Joni install a 480p camera on a new MacBook 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.200
 480p resolution camera? 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.205
 Yes, 480p camera in 2015 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.241
 Even the iPod has a 720p front camera 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.160
 We are just trying to make more profit for our investors. 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.980
 I remember saying to Joni that we would earn a bunch of attendants 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.005
 What have you saved money on? 

00:02:59.005 --> 00:03:03.005
 We also saved money by removing the glowing Apple logo from the cover 

00:03:03.005 --> 00:03:10.005
 The cutting technology was too expensive, and now we save about $ 20 on every laptop ... 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.483
 Oh, buddy, Apple has good times now 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.525
 To connect USB ports users will have to use dongle! 

00:03:26.525 --> 00:03:29.525
 This accessory costs an extra $ 79 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:37.900
 Man, I haven’t told you yet how Apple Watch and I got out!
