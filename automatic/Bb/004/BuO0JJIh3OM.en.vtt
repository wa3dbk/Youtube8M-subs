00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.500
 in my opinion this is the time of shooting this 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.150
 one of the best selling edge 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.320
 has a very characteristic 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.160
 direction wide range right 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.130
 focal pits therefore regarding him 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.580
 very convenient to compare everything 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.500
 other models I want to introduce to you 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.529
 newly-made 2013 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:19.550
 about letting go has a very high 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.999
 the bar and not the length of rosar spoke long ago 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:23.829
 this was especially pronounced on adamchuka 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:25.009
 skype sizes 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.850
 so 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.340
 in 2013, the cabin designers decided 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.369
 work on this issue 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:31.230
 have created 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.070
 in my opinion a new card 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.730
 well fixed front edge 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.030
 to protect the project transverse cylinders and 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.700
 edge replacement is used more 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.360
 tight stage which has 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.650
 now twice as high as in black 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.000
 paints refused 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.260
 all busy several teams 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.940
 still has speed control 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.340
 reversal due to change of place 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.840
 fixing side 100 tons to the end of the crib 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.780
 took yes chrome 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.290
 he uses so many seen narrow strip in 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.580
 the very bottom the rest is made of 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.760
 registry pic 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.950
 more dense which allows you to lose weight 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:03.720
 to his advice 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.270
 does not reduce the strength of the whole 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.880
 wide stripe designs 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.930
 along the entire trailing edge is also more 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.360
 dense forests because skype does not make heavier 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.240
 but increases wear resistance 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.240
 fabrics 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.670
 next design and 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.140
 cross cylinders 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.000
 when or use a new valve to you 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.800
 no more adapter needed 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.010
 mount what's going on 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.619
 directly valve itself 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:23.990
 newly completed 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.329
 updated strap changes of course 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:28.340
 no longer touched the plank design 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.579
 got a new coloring and instead 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:32.560
 red whole country used to do 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.459
 changed the design slightly and we gradually 

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:36.649
 made of carbon fiber and does not have less weight 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:37.429
 system 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.560
 last champions remain the same 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.950
 everything is activated by moving away from you 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.649
 in case of all walking alone 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:45.880
 see themselves edges in the office 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.680
 safety bet which passes 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.560
 inside Nepal yesterday 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.549
 while it all disconnects hiccups 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:53.650
 fly completely 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.160
 spring limiting course 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.080
 then painted in black looking with 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.210
 much more elegant interesting 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.820
 finally earned for fat 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.650
 is regulated 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.300
 they became much more convenient brothers nii 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.550
 hand hold also updated demand 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.550
 which have become tougher and more luxurious 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.079
 black white colors 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:14.549
 at the ends of the country protective tents 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.059
 which can now be regulated not 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:18.089
 only on the side lines but also on 

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:20.010
 central it makes it easier 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.960
 adjustment 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.940
 long lines 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.380
 in case they stood out 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.909
 uneven after your ride 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:27.529
 the rise of this later savage immediately 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:28.989
 will feel the changes in the new 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:29.659
 models 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:31.319
 strap very light ghost patrick 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.999
 practically no effort required 

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:35.919
 also increased return rate to 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:38.769
 the character plot was destiny threesome 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.629
 flies unfolds and 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:42.599
 managed much faster than 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.859
 previous model sacred place of speed 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.949
 reversal and and reaction rates for 

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:48.959
 our teams are not inferior to the regional 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.149
 demolition decreased for gas oil 

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:52.759
 so to ride confidently but 

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:54.359
 Katia you will need to maintain 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.289
 constant smooth speed 

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:58.699
 ride a gentle breeze for beginners will 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:00.869
 low is more difficult than on older models 

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:02.449
 will have to transfer katan 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:05.239
 On the new season conveniently has five 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.259
 quick turnaround and easy 

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:09.439
 bar that facilitates management 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.099
 you will need to accelerate more 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.669
 because it is new gardening directly 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:15.199
 depends on your speed 

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:16.929
 just kick the bar on yourself already 

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:18.869
 will not be enough to create spots 

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:21.699
 on candles in these 2013 year 

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:23.939
 so good for jumping in plans 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:25.999
 30 jump at high speed on the news 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:28.259
 led by a light bar is enough 

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:30.469
 comfortable katia remains stable and 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:32.829
 understandable at the time of the jump 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.049
 no problem i stutter him 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.519
 lift enough hotin for delivery 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:38.790
 he is easy to turn around and 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:39.789
 China 

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:41.679
 while it is not a fast stable turn 

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:44.339
 with a slight hint of it 

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:46.619
 what is it good for skating 

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:47.639
 fuller 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:50.189
 new 2013 this of course 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:51.989
 joke for advanced rider 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.439
 for modern freestyle if earlier
