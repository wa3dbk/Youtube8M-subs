the Bravo one is that if you look at the

the Bravo one is that if you look at the
gso<00:01:59.200> 4.1<00:01:59.860> this<00:02:00.490> is<00:02:00.670> less<00:02:01.300> than<00:02:01.540> three

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
gso 4.1 this is less than three

sixteenth of an inch thick it's about

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.900 
sixteenth of an inch thick it's about
point<00:02:03.700> one<00:02:03.970> six<00:02:04.300> inches<00:02:04.780> this<00:02:05.710> is<00:02:06.070> nearly<00:02:06.760> a

difference there would this one have a

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.820 
difference there would this one have a
lot<00:02:13.690> more<00:02:13.870> strength<00:02:14.260> if<00:02:14.440> you're<00:02:14.560> going<00:02:14.650> to<00:02:14.709> do

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
lot more strength if you're going to do

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.520 
lot more strength if you're going to do
prying<00:02:15.160> absolutely<00:02:16.000> it<00:02:16.090> would<00:02:16.300> steel<00:02:16.750> frying

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
prying absolutely it would steel frying

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.460 
prying absolutely it would steel frying
having<00:02:18.459> a<00:02:18.670> thicker<00:02:19.570> cross-section<00:02:20.200> like<00:02:20.320> that

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
having a thicker cross-section like that

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.110 
having a thicker cross-section like that
will<00:02:20.560> always<00:02:20.800> give<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:20.950> more<00:02:21.160> strength<00:02:21.430> is<00:02:21.550> it

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
will always give you more strength is it
