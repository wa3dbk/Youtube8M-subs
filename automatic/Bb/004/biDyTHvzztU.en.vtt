fruit on it so I wanted to show this one

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.960 
fruit on it so I wanted to show this one
off<00:00:13.920> the

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.680 

member<00:00:17.750> of<00:00:17.780> the<00:00:17.869> annonaceae<00:00:18.640> which<00:00:19.640> has<00:00:20.390> a<00:00:20.420> lot

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:20.690 
member of the annonaceae which has a lot

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.620 
member of the annonaceae which has a lot
of<00:00:20.720> sugar<00:00:21.170> apples<00:00:22.029> and<00:00:23.029> I<00:00:23.180> don't<00:00:23.270> know<00:00:23.420> if<00:00:23.510> the

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
of sugar apples and I don't know if the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.839 
of sugar apples and I don't know if the
dimples<00:00:24.590> are<00:00:24.710> showing<00:00:25.040> up<00:00:25.160> on<00:00:25.310> that<00:00:25.490> fruit

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849 
dimples are showing up on that fruit

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:27.700 
dimples are showing up on that fruit
over<00:00:26.000> there<00:00:26.360> but<00:00:26.660> it<00:00:26.869> does<00:00:27.140> look<00:00:27.349> a<00:00:27.470> lot<00:00:27.650> like

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
over there but it does look a lot like

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.160 
over there but it does look a lot like
its<00:00:28.070> cousins<00:00:30.250> no<00:00:31.480> that's<00:00:32.480> reaching<00:00:32.900> over

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
its cousins no that's reaching over

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.330 
its cousins no that's reaching over
there<00:00:33.290> that's<00:00:33.470> a<00:00:33.590> good<00:00:33.739> example<00:00:34.220> in<00:00:34.309> the

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
there that's a good example in the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.890 
there that's a good example in the
sunlight<00:00:34.820> there<00:00:35.590> I<00:00:37.000> believe<00:00:38.000> it's<00:00:38.210> a<00:00:38.480> Florida

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
sunlight there I believe it's a Florida

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.049 
sunlight there I believe it's a Florida
native<00:00:39.050> I<00:00:39.530> believe<00:00:40.010> it's<00:00:40.160> endemic<00:00:40.489> more<00:00:40.940> to

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
native I believe it's endemic more to

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.320 
native I believe it's endemic more to
the<00:00:41.180> south<00:00:41.510> of<00:00:41.720> here<00:00:42.460> this<00:00:43.460> is<00:00:43.670> basically<00:00:43.850> the

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.330 
the south of here this is basically the

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.560 
the south of here this is basically the
Brevard<00:00:44.720> County<00:00:44.809> line<00:00:45.379> that's<00:00:46.120> Rivard<00:00:47.120> County

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
Brevard County line that's Rivard County

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.319 
Brevard County line that's Rivard County
across<00:00:47.839> the<00:00:48.800> Sebastian<00:00:49.160> River<00:00:49.610> right<00:00:49.940> here<00:00:49.969> so

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
across the Sebastian River right here so

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:51.850 
across the Sebastian River right here so
I'm<00:00:50.420> on<00:00:50.540> the<00:00:50.629> northern<00:00:51.020> tip<00:00:51.140> of<00:00:51.290> Indian<00:00:51.680> River

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
I'm on the northern tip of Indian River

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.069 
I'm on the northern tip of Indian River
County<00:00:52.129> which<00:00:53.030> is<00:00:53.210> kind<00:00:53.629> of<00:00:53.719> why<00:00:53.840> this<00:00:53.899> is

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
County which is kind of why this is

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.600 
County which is kind of why this is
interesting<00:00:54.680> to<00:00:54.800> have<00:00:54.950> this<00:00:55.129> here<00:00:55.460> because

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
interesting to have this here because

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.330 
interesting to have this here because
this<00:00:55.879> is<00:00:56.110> OSA<00:00:57.110> it's<00:00:57.230> out<00:00:57.350> of<00:00:57.379> its<00:00:57.530> range<00:00:57.860> but

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
this is OSA it's out of its range but

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.110 
this is OSA it's out of its range but
it's<00:00:59.230> on<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:00.410> northern<00:01:00.800> limits<00:01:01.640> of<00:01:01.760> its<00:01:01.850> range

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
it's on the northern limits of its range

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.020 
it's on the northern limits of its range
and<00:01:02.270> it's<00:01:02.390> actually<00:01:02.690> a<00:01:02.719> nice<00:01:02.930> sized<00:01:04.030> pineapple

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
and it's actually a nice sized pineapple

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.300 
and it's actually a nice sized pineapple
too<00:01:06.310> so<00:01:07.930> one<00:01:08.930> of<00:01:09.020> the<00:01:09.110> uses<00:01:09.440> I<00:01:09.740> know<00:01:09.800> for<00:01:10.160> this

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
too so one of the uses I know for this

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.029 
too so one of the uses I know for this
thing<00:01:10.729> because<00:01:11.119> the<00:01:12.050> fruit<00:01:12.350> is<00:01:12.500> not<00:01:12.710> it's

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:13.039 
thing because the fruit is not it's

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:15.490 
thing because the fruit is not it's
edible<00:01:13.640> but<00:01:13.820> it's<00:01:13.970> by<00:01:14.149> no<00:01:14.180> means<00:01:14.500> something

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
edible but it's by no means something

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.380 
edible but it's by no means something
desirable<00:01:15.860> but<00:01:16.759> one<00:01:16.880> of<00:01:16.910> the<00:01:17.060> things<00:01:17.240> I'm

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
desirable but one of the things I'm

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.810 
desirable but one of the things I'm
pretty<00:01:17.750> sure<00:01:18.020> they<00:01:18.200> use<00:01:18.470> this<00:01:18.649> for<00:01:18.710> is

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
pretty sure they use this for is

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.279 
pretty sure they use this for is
rootstock<00:01:20.660> for<00:01:22.660> what<00:01:23.660> he<00:01:23.720> call<00:01:23.899> it<00:01:23.959> the<00:01:24.050> atom

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
rootstock for what he call it the atom

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:27.699 
rootstock for what he call it the atom
Moya's<00:01:24.649> the<00:01:25.250> the<00:01:25.899> cultivar<00:01:26.899> of<00:01:26.929> sugar<00:01:27.319> apple

Moya's the the cultivar of sugar apple

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:31.180 
Moya's the the cultivar of sugar apple
that's<00:01:27.830> a<00:01:27.979> hybrid<00:01:28.959> between<00:01:29.959> annona<00:01:30.619> squamosa

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
that's a hybrid between annona squamosa

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.850 
that's a hybrid between annona squamosa
and<00:01:32.149> cherimoya<00:01:32.690> and<00:01:33.229> I<00:01:33.380> may<00:01:33.619> have<00:01:33.649> that

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
and cherimoya and I may have that

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.120 
and cherimoya and I may have that
backwards<00:01:34.509> but<00:01:35.509> anyway<00:01:35.750> it's<00:01:35.899> a<00:01:36.020> two<00:01:36.619> cultivar

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
backwards but anyway it's a two cultivar

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
and the Zion of that is attached to the

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.490 
and the Zion of that is attached to the
rootstock<00:01:40.160> of<00:01:40.490> these<00:01:40.640> things<00:01:41.200> by<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.259> guys
