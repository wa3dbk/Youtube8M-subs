type<00:02:04.030> that<00:02:04.210> in<00:02:04.450> I<00:02:04.659> trimmed<00:02:05.500> off<00:02:05.649> a<00:02:05.710> little<00:02:06.039> bit

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
type that in I trimmed off a little bit

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.850 
type that in I trimmed off a little bit
at<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.429> end<00:02:06.550> of<00:02:06.759> it<00:02:06.909> so<00:02:07.149> it's<00:02:07.500> getting<00:02:08.500> to<00:02:08.619> the

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
at the end of it so it's getting to the

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.259 
at the end of it so it's getting to the
area<00:02:09.130> where<00:02:09.280> it's<00:02:09.399> starting<00:02:09.670> to<00:02:09.789> widen<00:02:10.000> a

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
area where it's starting to widen a

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:14.699 
area where it's starting to widen a
little<00:02:10.539> bit<00:02:10.660> here<00:02:12.150> go<00:02:13.150> back<00:02:13.390> and<00:02:13.660> I<00:02:13.930> should

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
little bit here go back and I should

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.520 
little bit here go back and I should
have<00:02:14.800> showed<00:02:14.980> you<00:02:15.160> that<00:02:15.280> first<00:02:15.640> but<00:02:15.910> there's

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
have showed you that first but there's

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.660 
have showed you that first but there's
really<00:02:17.530> skinny<00:02:17.860> end<00:02:18.069> and<00:02:18.569> trim<00:02:19.569> that<00:02:19.720> off<00:02:20.640> so<00:02:21.640> I

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
really skinny end and trim that off so I

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.920 
really skinny end and trim that off so I
get<00:02:22.500> some<00:02:23.500> wider<00:02:24.120> wider<00:02:25.120> part<00:02:25.480> of<00:02:25.569> the<00:02:25.690> quill

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
get some wider wider part of the quill

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.960 
get some wider wider part of the quill
so<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:26.200> get<00:02:26.380> a<00:02:26.410> little<00:02:26.799> better<00:02:26.970> segmentation

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
so I get a little better segmentation

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.960 
so I get a little better segmentation
starting<00:02:28.360> at<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.569> back<00:02:28.750> of<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:28.989> fly<00:02:29.970> about

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
to wrap the quill nice tight wraps these

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.039 
to wrap the quill nice tight wraps these
quills<00:02:42.430> are<00:02:42.610> neat<00:02:43.030> because<00:02:43.209> they<00:02:43.390> come<00:02:43.600> in<00:02:43.750> so

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
quills are neat because they come in so

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.520 
quills are neat because they come in so
many<00:02:44.109> different<00:02:45.150> shades

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
the mood of the fish I guess I'm

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.170 
the mood of the fish I guess I'm
starting<00:03:10.000> to<00:03:10.239> split<00:03:10.540> a<00:03:10.660> little<00:03:10.900> bit<00:03:11.170> but<00:03:12.180> what

starting to split a little bit but what
I<00:03:13.209> will<00:03:13.540> do<00:03:15.480> now<00:03:16.480> that<00:03:16.510> I've<00:03:16.780> got<00:03:16.930> that<00:03:17.140> wrap

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
I will do now that I've got that wrap

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.920 
I will do now that I've got that wrap
for<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.709> body<00:03:17.920> take<00:03:18.700> a<00:03:18.730> little<00:03:20.519> UV<00:03:21.519> resin

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
for the body take a little UV resin

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.000 
for the body take a little UV resin
either<00:03:22.930> use<00:03:23.109> hydro<00:03:23.709> or<00:03:23.980> any<00:03:24.130> other<00:03:24.310> thin<00:03:26.010> UV

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
either use hydro or any other thin UV

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.820 
either use hydro or any other thin UV
resin

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:41.830 

just<00:03:33.830> coat<00:03:34.099> those<00:03:34.370> quills<00:03:39.760> it's<00:03:40.760> a<00:03:40.849> nice<00:03:41.060> thin

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
just coat those quills it's a nice thin

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.630 
just coat those quills it's a nice thin
layer<00:03:42.140> of<00:03:42.440> it<00:03:42.590> and<00:03:42.680> that<00:03:42.769> really<00:03:42.799> makes<00:03:43.459> that

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
layer of it and that really makes that

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:53.729 
layer of it and that really makes that
segmentation<00:03:44.269> jump<00:03:44.810> out<00:03:52.060> once<00:03:53.060> that's<00:03:53.330> on

little triangle there trim off some of
those<00:05:16.950> fibers<00:05:17.430> on<00:05:17.580> that<00:05:17.730> triangle<00:05:18.120> and<00:05:18.330> tie

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
those fibers on that triangle and tie

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.700 
those fibers on that triangle and tie
that<00:05:18.720> in<00:05:20.210> and<00:05:21.210> then<00:05:21.330> just<00:05:21.540> fold<00:05:21.960> those<00:05:22.200> fibers

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
that in and then just fold those fibers

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.270 
that in and then just fold those fibers
back<00:05:23.480> so<00:05:24.480> they<00:05:24.570> want<00:05:24.750> to<00:05:24.840> sweep<00:05:25.140> back<00:05:25.380> instead

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
back so they want to sweep back instead
