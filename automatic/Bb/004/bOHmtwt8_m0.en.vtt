in january we've reviewed the fantex
mini<00:00:16.730> XL<00:00:17.359> that<00:00:17.630> allowed<00:00:17.929> users<00:00:18.230> to<00:00:18.410> build<00:00:18.679> two

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949 
mini XL that allowed users to build two

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.519 
mini XL that allowed users to build two
systems<00:00:19.460> inside<00:00:19.910> the<00:00:20.119> single<00:00:20.449> case<00:00:20.630> but<00:00:21.349> the

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
systems inside the single case but the

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:23.470 
systems inside the single case but the
main<00:00:21.679> challenge<00:00:22.189> then<00:00:22.460> was<00:00:22.789> how<00:00:23.329> do<00:00:23.390> you

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
main challenge then was how do you

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.239 
main challenge then was how do you
actually<00:00:23.570> power<00:00:24.140> the<00:00:24.439> two<00:00:24.589> systems<00:00:25.009> with<00:00:25.220> a

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:25.249 
actually power the two systems with a

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:27.669 
actually power the two systems with a
single<00:00:25.730> power<00:00:25.970> supply<00:00:26.060> and<00:00:26.599> so<00:00:26.990> fantex<00:00:27.380> has

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:27.679 
single power supply and so fantex has

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:29.620 
single power supply and so fantex has
solved<00:00:28.099> that<00:00:28.159> issue<00:00:28.400> with<00:00:29.060> the<00:00:29.150> release<00:00:29.419> of

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
solved that issue with the release of

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.179 
solved that issue with the release of
this<00:00:29.839> power<00:00:30.199> supplies<00:00:30.589> splitter

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
this power supplies splitter

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.610 
this power supplies splitter
so<00:00:31.519> it's<00:00:31.699> this<00:00:31.849> module<00:00:32.360> made<00:00:32.600> for<00:00:32.810> the<00:00:32.900> mini<00:00:33.140> XL

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
so it's this module made for the mini XL

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.680 
so it's this module made for the mini XL
case<00:00:34.190> but<00:00:34.550> can<00:00:34.760> be<00:00:34.880> used<00:00:35.030> with<00:00:35.240> other<00:00:35.390> dual

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
case but can be used with other dual

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.720 
case but can be used with other dual
system<00:00:36.140> configurations<00:00:36.890> thanks<00:00:37.280> to<00:00:37.400> its<00:00:37.520> low

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
system configurations thanks to its low

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.940 
system configurations thanks to its low
profile<00:00:38.240> nature<00:00:38.450> as<00:00:38.990> long<00:00:39.230> as<00:00:39.380> you<00:00:39.470> find<00:00:39.800> a

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
profile nature as long as you find a

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.920 
profile nature as long as you find a
spot<00:00:40.280> to<00:00:40.460> fit<00:00:40.700> it<00:00:40.820> and<00:00:41.000> so<00:00:41.390> the<00:00:41.510> way<00:00:41.600> it<00:00:41.690> works

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
spot to fit it and so the way it works

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.350 
spot to fit it and so the way it works
is<00:00:42.230> you<00:00:42.260> get<00:00:42.530> your<00:00:42.740> source<00:00:43.130> input<00:00:43.460> of<00:00:43.910> a<00:00:44.000> single

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
is you get your source input of a single

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.870 
is you get your source input of a single

directly to the power supply
they<00:01:37.729> shut<00:01:37.939> off<00:01:37.969> this<00:01:38.240> dual<00:01:38.479> system<00:01:38.929> setup<00:01:39.139> and

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
they shut off this dual system setup and

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.230 
they shut off this dual system setup and

the power supply splitter in action and
I<00:01:41.600> think<00:01:41.630> this<00:01:42.020> is<00:01:42.170> absolutely<00:01:42.319> needed<00:01:43.280> to

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
I think this is absolutely needed to

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.789 
I think this is absolutely needed to
allow<00:01:44.119> us<00:01:44.329> to<00:01:44.539> get<00:01:44.659> outside<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.319> box<00:01:45.560> of
