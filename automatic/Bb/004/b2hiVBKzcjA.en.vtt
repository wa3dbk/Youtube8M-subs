this<00:03:35.780> before<00:03:36.280> I<00:03:37.780> really<00:03:38.780> don't<00:03:38.930> remember<00:03:38.989> but

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
this before I really don't remember but

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.020 
this before I really don't remember but
I<00:03:39.500> think<00:03:39.890> he<00:03:39.980> just<00:03:40.010> gave<00:03:40.400> up<00:03:40.610> and<00:03:40.700> he<00:03:40.790> got<00:03:40.910> in

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
I think he just gave up and he got in

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.319 
I think he just gave up and he got in
the<00:03:41.090> car<00:03:41.590> because<00:03:42.590> he<00:03:42.920> was<00:03:43.250> just<00:03:43.519> so<00:03:43.850> messed<00:03:44.150> up

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
the car because he was just so messed up

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.569 
the car because he was just so messed up
and<00:03:44.989> I<00:03:45.109> guess<00:03:45.260> he<00:03:45.410> I<00:03:45.590> don't<00:03:46.010> have<00:03:46.190> her<00:03:46.310> he<00:03:46.459> was

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
and I guess he I don't have her he was

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.819 
and I guess he I don't have her he was
seeing<00:03:46.790> creatures<00:03:47.329> that<00:03:47.570> I<00:03:47.780> do<00:03:47.840> but<00:03:48.260> I<00:03:48.470> guess

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
seeing creatures that I do but I guess

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.090 
seeing creatures that I do but I guess
that's<00:03:48.859> how<00:03:49.220> my<00:03:49.430> dad<00:03:49.609> not<00:03:49.820> to<00:03:49.880> use<00:03:50.209> drunk<00:03:50.480> cuz

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.590 
haven't taken picture of us and a long
time<00:06:43.630> because<00:06:44.700> we're<00:06:45.700> not<00:06:45.730> really<00:06:46.090> rounded<00:06:46.450> to

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:46.600 
time because we're not really rounded to

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.530 
time because we're not really rounded to
it<00:06:46.660> that<00:06:46.870> much<00:06:47.050> he<00:06:47.200> works<00:06:47.380> a<00:06:47.530> lot<00:06:48.390> we<00:06:49.390> had<00:06:49.510> a

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.540 
it that much he works a lot we had a

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.990 
it that much he works a lot we had a
really<00:06:49.690> rough<00:06:49.930> time<00:06:49.990> the<00:06:50.530> last<00:06:51.280> couple<00:06:51.610> months

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 
really rough time the last couple months

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.950 
really rough time the last couple months
but<00:06:52.420> I<00:06:53.850> actually<00:06:54.850> think<00:06:55.120> things<00:06:55.600> are<00:06:55.780> turning

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:55.960

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.580 
but I actually think things are turning
around<00:06:56.170> which<00:06:56.740> is<00:06:56.920> really<00:06:57.160> good<00:06:57.430> because<00:06:58.590> we

00:06:59.580 --> 00:06:59.590 
around which is really good because we

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:03.030 
around which is really good because we
have<00:06:59.710> a<00:06:59.740> new<00:06:59.920> baby<00:07:00.070> on<00:07:00.250> the<00:07:00.400> way<00:07:00.550> and<00:07:01.770> I<00:07:02.770> really
