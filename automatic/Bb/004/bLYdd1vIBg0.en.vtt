00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:34.169 
to try one of their lighter I think they

00:07:34.169 --> 00:07:35.420 
to try one of their lighter I think they
have<00:07:34.290> one<00:07:34.410> that's<00:07:34.500> even<00:07:34.770> smaller<00:07:34.950> more

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:35.430 
have one that's even smaller more

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:38.540

compact<00:07:35.610> than<00:07:36.180> this<00:07:36.630> one<00:07:37.010> because<00:07:38.010> it<00:07:38.190> takes<00:07:38.430> a

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:38.550 
compact than this one because it takes a

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:40.430 
compact than this one because it takes a
long<00:07:38.669> time<00:07:38.729> to<00:07:38.910> blow<00:07:39.120> dry<00:07:39.300> my<00:07:39.330> hair<00:07:39.479> and<00:07:39.930> so<00:07:40.139> I
