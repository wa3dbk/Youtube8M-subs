had no luck so I'm just going to ask
this<00:02:31.500> question<00:02:32.390> were<00:02:33.390> codemasters

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
this question were codemasters

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.550 
this question were codemasters
concentrating<00:02:35.130> too<00:02:35.430> much<00:02:35.459> on<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:37.080> quant<00:02:37.319> on

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
concentrating too much on the quant on

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.270 
concentrating too much on the quant on
the<00:02:37.739> controller<00:02:38.190> uses<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:39.980> they<00:02:40.980> just<00:02:41.160> forgot

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
the controller uses and they just forgot

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.940 
the controller uses and they just forgot
about<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.730> wheel<00:02:41.880> users<00:02:42.300> are<00:02:42.450> there<00:02:42.950> because

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
about the wheel users are there because

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.520 
about the wheel users are there because
I<00:02:44.520> understand<00:02:45.300> that<00:02:45.510> their<00:02:45.630> market<00:02:46.080> at<00:02:46.320> the

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
I understand that their market at the

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.080 
I understand that their market at the
moment<00:02:46.590> is<00:02:47.130> going<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.340> be<00:02:47.430> for<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.670> Americans

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
moment is going to be for the Americans

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.830 
moment is going to be for the Americans
they're<00:02:48.239> going<00:02:48.360> to<00:02:48.420> be<00:02:48.480> trained<00:02:48.750> to

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
they're going to be trained to

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.870 
they're going to be trained to
concentrate<00:02:49.320> so<00:02:49.650> much<00:02:49.680> on<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.160> Americans<00:02:50.670> I

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.280 
the comments from expert drivers out
there<00:03:20.299> they're<00:03:21.299> complaining<00:03:21.720> about<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.110> game

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
enough for them there's not like the

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.210 
enough for them there's not like the
demo<00:03:29.549> at<00:03:29.730> all<00:03:29.880> I<00:03:30.090> mean<00:03:30.840> it<00:03:31.260> is<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.739> demo<00:03:31.950> of

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
demo at all I mean it is the demo of

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.130 
demo at all I mean it is the demo of
course<00:03:32.489> there<00:03:33.150> will<00:03:33.299> be<00:03:33.420> improvements<00:03:33.959> in<00:03:34.049> the

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
course there will be improvements in the

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.120 
course there will be improvements in the
actual<00:03:34.470> game<00:03:34.880> but<00:03:35.880> for<00:03:36.060> certain<00:03:36.920> the<00:03:37.920> will

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
actual game but for certain the will

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.300 
actual game but for certain the will
uses<00:03:38.700> will<00:03:39.540> be<00:03:39.780> forgetting<00:03:40.709> about<00:03:40.799> this<00:03:41.100> game

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
uses will be forgetting about this game

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.610 
uses will be forgetting about this game
and<00:03:41.610> the<00:03:41.760> controller<00:03:42.209> uses<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.900> new<00:03:43.079> guys<00:03:43.320> out

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
and the controller uses the new guys out

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.259 
and the controller uses the new guys out
there<00:03:43.829> are<00:03:44.310> then<00:03:44.609> going<00:03:44.850> to<00:03:44.910> be<00:03:45.000> buying<00:03:45.150> this

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
there are then going to be buying this

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.259 
there are then going to be buying this
game<00:03:45.540> for<00:03:45.750> certain<00:03:46.109> so<00:03:46.980> I<00:03:47.459> don't<00:03:47.970> know<00:03:48.060> if<00:03:48.150> this

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
game for certain so I don't know if this

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.270 
game for certain so I don't know if this
is<00:03:48.329> a<00:03:48.450> bad<00:03:48.660> thing<00:03:48.720> or<00:03:49.109> not<00:03:49.230> you<00:03:49.709> guys<00:03:49.859> tell<00:03:50.160> in

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
is a bad thing or not you guys tell in

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.580 
is a bad thing or not you guys tell in
the<00:03:50.340> comments<00:03:50.820> because<00:03:51.570> there<00:03:52.049> was<00:03:52.170> one<00:03:52.380> guy

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
the comments because there was one guy

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.640 
the comments because there was one guy
who<00:03:52.760> had<00:03:53.760> a<00:03:53.790> counter<00:03:54.209> argument<00:03:54.390> that<00:03:54.930> this

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
who had a counter argument that this

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.890 
who had a counter argument that this
game<00:03:55.980> should<00:03:56.430> be<00:03:56.489> equal<00:03:57.060> for<00:03:57.090> everyone<00:03:57.269> there

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
game should be equal for everyone there

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.860 
game should be equal for everyone there
for<00:03:57.930> it<00:03:58.880> should<00:03:59.880> be<00:04:00.030> more<00:04:00.209> easier<00:04:00.660> for<00:04:00.810> the

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
for it should be more easier for the

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.069 
for it should be more easier for the
controller<00:04:01.260> users<00:04:01.739> to<00:04:01.920> use<00:04:02.250> and<00:04:02.720> there<00:04:03.720> aren't

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079
