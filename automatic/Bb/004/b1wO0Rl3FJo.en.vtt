during your seventh probe you're gonna
want<00:00:33.770> to<00:00:33.860> make<00:00:33.980> your<00:00:34.070> first<00:00:34.129> pylon<00:00:34.760> six<00:00:35.149> cells

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:35.449 
want to make your first pylon six cells

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:39.369 
want to make your first pylon six cells
away<00:00:35.960> from<00:00:36.949> the<00:00:37.390> entrance<00:00:38.390> ramp<00:00:38.660> and<00:00:38.899> there<00:00:39.290> he

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
away from the entrance ramp and there he

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.819 
away from the entrance ramp and there he
goes<00:00:39.559> he's<00:00:40.309> gonna<00:00:40.430> make<00:00:40.670> our<00:00:40.879> first<00:00:41.149> pylon

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
yes so we have two probes on gas as soon

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.830 
yes so we have two probes on gas as soon
as<00:01:36.140> our<00:01:36.850> cybernetics<00:01:37.850> is<00:01:37.940> up<00:01:38.150> and<00:01:38.270> running<00:01:38.390> we

as our cybernetics is up and running we
will<00:01:39.020> have<00:01:39.200> three<00:01:39.500> on<00:01:39.710> gas<00:01:39.950> so<00:01:44.590> a<00:01:45.590> building's

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
will have three on gas so a building's

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.719 
will have three on gas so a building's
gonna<00:01:46.310> be<00:01:46.520> pylon<00:01:47.300> and<00:01:47.600> brain<00:01:47.900> simulator

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729
