been<00:00:09.800> fighting<00:00:10.220> with<00:00:10.340> recently<00:00:10.820> on<00:00:11.030> the

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:11.180 
been fighting with recently on the

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.770 
been fighting with recently on the
Saturn<00:00:11.660> project

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780

urban<00:00:12.990> on<00:00:13.139> these<00:00:13.320> pistons<00:00:13.860> I've<00:00:14.730> been<00:00:14.879> trying

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
urban on these pistons I've been trying

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.929 
urban on these pistons I've been trying
to<00:00:15.240> clean<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.750> carbon<00:00:16.139> off<00:00:16.369> I've<00:00:17.369> tried<00:00:17.700> using

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:17.939 
to clean the carbon off I've tried using

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.300 
to clean the carbon off I've tried using
old<00:00:18.510> piston<00:00:18.990> rings<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.560> scrape<00:00:19.890> out<00:00:20.070> the

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
old piston rings to scrape out the

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.920 
old piston rings to scrape out the
grooves<00:00:21.050> tried<00:00:22.050> using<00:00:23.390> brake<00:00:24.390> cleaner

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
grooves tried using brake cleaner

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.510 
grooves tried using brake cleaner
carburetor<00:00:25.770> cleaner

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:26.520 
carburetor cleaner

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.339 
carburetor cleaner
I<00:00:27.800> bought<00:00:28.800> this<00:00:29.099> Berryman's<00:00:29.910> b12<00:00:30.570> because<00:00:30.960> it

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
I bought this Berryman's b12 because it

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.620 
I bought this Berryman's b12 because it
says<00:00:31.619> on<00:00:31.860> it<00:00:31.890> removes<00:00:32.489> carbon<00:00:32.790> so<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.360> thought

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
says on it removes carbon so I thought

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.240 
says on it removes carbon so I thought
maybe<00:00:33.809> if<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.170> soaked<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.800> there<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.160> would

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
maybe if I soaked it in there it would

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.229 
maybe if I soaked it in there it would
soften<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:36.050> it<00:00:37.050> didn't<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:37.920> soaked<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.820> piston

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
soften it it didn't I so soaked a piston

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.319 
soften it it didn't I so soaked a piston
in<00:00:39.390> there<00:00:39.570> for<00:00:39.780> upwards<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.379> week<00:00:40.410> and

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
in there for upwards of a week and

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.670 
in there for upwards of a week and
didn't<00:00:42.329> seem<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.600> make<00:00:42.719> any<00:00:42.780> difference<00:00:43.050> the

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
didn't seem to make any difference the

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.470 
didn't seem to make any difference the
carbon<00:00:44.070> was<00:00:44.219> still<00:00:44.460> hard<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.059> couldn't<00:00:45.329> get

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
carbon was still hard and I couldn't get

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.810 
carbon was still hard and I couldn't get
it<00:00:45.629> off<00:00:46.160> so<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:48.019> got<00:00:49.019> this<00:00:49.320> this<00:00:50.190> cost<00:00:50.519> about

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
it off so I got this this cost about

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.649 
it off so I got this this cost about
thirty<00:00:51.149> bucks<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:54.920> it<00:00:55.920> says<00:00:56.339> the<00:00:57.089> good<00:00:57.329> stuff

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:57.659 
thirty bucks and it says the good stuff

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:00.770 
thirty bucks and it says the good stuff
so<00:00:58.640> maybe<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.909> means<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.329> it's<00:01:00.569> going<00:01:00.719> to

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
so maybe that means that it's going to

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.240 
so maybe that means that it's going to
do<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.109> job<00:01:02.600> on<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.989> box<00:01:04.229> here<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.860> says<00:01:07.250> that

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
do the job on the box here it says that

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.370 
do the job on the box here it says that
it<00:01:10.640> carbon<00:01:11.640> residue<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.240> valves<00:01:12.690> Pistons<00:01:13.200> and

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
it carbon residue on valves Pistons and

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.140 
it carbon residue on valves Pistons and
other<00:01:13.530> engine<00:01:13.950> parts<00:01:14.250> may<00:01:14.460> require<00:01:14.820> longer

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
other engine parts may require longer

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.959 
other engine parts may require longer
cleaning<00:01:15.690> times<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.829> to<00:01:16.890> me<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.490> means<00:01:17.670> it's

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969 
cleaning times so to me that means it's

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:21.170 
cleaning times so to me that means it's
made<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.360> do<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.630> job<00:01:19.640> even<00:01:20.640> got<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.909> picture

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
made to do this job even got a picture

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.139 
made to do this job even got a picture
of<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.479> piston<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.229> valve<00:01:22.469> and<00:01:22.829> all<00:01:23.820> that

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
of a piston and a valve and all that

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.899 
of a piston and a valve and all that
good<00:01:24.360> stuff<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:25.229> I'm<00:01:26.159> going<00:01:26.399> to<00:01:26.460> give<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:26.850> a

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
good stuff so I'm going to give this a

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.330 
good stuff so I'm going to give this a
shot<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.450> hopefully<00:01:27.930> it'll<00:01:28.560> work<00:01:28.829> out<00:01:29.039> and<00:01:29.280> I

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
shot and hopefully it'll work out and I

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.359 
shot and hopefully it'll work out and I
can<00:01:29.549> move<00:01:29.670> on<00:01:29.880> with<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.210> project

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.190 

everything<00:01:36.180> I've<00:01:36.299> read<00:01:36.540> seems<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.049> indicate

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
everything I've read seems to indicate

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.550 
everything I've read seems to indicate
this<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.860> some<00:01:38.070> pretty<00:01:38.220> nasty<00:01:38.549> stuff<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:39.560> friend

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
this is some pretty nasty stuff a friend

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.740 
this is some pretty nasty stuff a friend
of<00:01:40.680> mine<00:01:40.829> who<00:01:41.040> used<00:01:41.070> some<00:01:41.670> said<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.570> do<00:01:42.720> it

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
of mine who used some said to do it

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:50.889 
of mine who used some said to do it
outside<00:01:43.259> for<00:01:43.649> sure<00:01:47.689> I've<00:01:48.689> got<00:01:48.750> my<00:01:48.990> goggles<00:01:49.350> on

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
outside for sure I've got my goggles on

00:01:50.899 --> 00:02:00.169 
outside for sure I've got my goggles on
well<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.200> has<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.610> basket<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:58.939> for<00:01:59.939> dipping

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
well it has a basket in it for dipping

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:05.450 
well it has a basket in it for dipping
small<00:02:00.630> parts<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:03.710> guess<00:02:04.710> what<00:02:04.890> I'm<00:02:05.009> going<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.250> do

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
small parts I guess what I'm going to do

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.320 
small parts I guess what I'm going to do
is<00:02:05.670> I'm<00:02:05.820> going<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.030> take<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:07.910> piston<00:02:08.910> which<00:02:09.119> I

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
is I'm going to take this piston which I

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.669 
is I'm going to take this piston which I
already<00:02:09.479> did<00:02:09.630> quite<00:02:10.049> a<00:02:10.110> bit<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.410> manual

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
already did quite a bit of manual

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.240 
already did quite a bit of manual
cleaning<00:02:11.220> on<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:13.230> see<00:02:13.500> if<00:02:13.620> I<00:02:13.739> can<00:02:13.920> get<00:02:14.100> the

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
cleaning on and see if I can get the

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.360 
cleaning on and see if I can get the
residual<00:02:14.760> carbon<00:02:15.269> out<00:02:15.420> of<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:16.040> ring<00:02:17.040> grooves

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
residual carbon out of the ring grooves

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:26.500 
residual carbon out of the ring grooves
that<00:02:17.640> I<00:02:17.730> wasn't<00:02:17.940> able<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.330> get

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.089 

okay<00:02:27.510> it's<00:02:27.720> been<00:02:27.900> in<00:02:28.049> here<00:02:28.260> for<00:02:28.560> roughly<00:02:28.980> half

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
okay it's been in here for roughly half

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:44.309 
okay it's been in here for roughly half
an<00:02:29.549> hour<00:02:29.670> right<00:02:30.360> now

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.070 

so<00:02:45.319> I<00:02:45.650> can<00:02:45.920> see<00:02:46.190> it<00:02:46.700> did<00:02:47.060> remove<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.629> carbon

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
so I can see it did remove the carbon

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.920 
so I can see it did remove the carbon
that<00:02:48.200> was<00:02:48.290> around<00:02:48.590> there<00:02:48.890> I<00:02:49.540> can<00:02:50.540> see<00:02:50.780> inside

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
that was around there I can see inside

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.300 
that was around there I can see inside
the<00:02:51.620> ring<00:02:51.860> grooves<00:02:52.190> they<00:02:52.730> do<00:02:52.790> look<00:02:53.180> cleaner<00:02:53.660> I

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
the ring grooves they do look cleaner I

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.580 
the ring grooves they do look cleaner I
still<00:02:55.310> see<00:02:55.550> some<00:02:55.580> carbon<00:02:56.360> deposits<00:02:56.540> but<00:02:57.319> let's

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
still see some carbon deposits but let's

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:04.150 
still see some carbon deposits but let's
dip<00:02:57.890> Lemann<00:02:58.190> dip<00:02:58.519> it<00:02:58.700> and<00:02:58.910> see<00:02:59.120> what<00:02:59.300> we<00:03:03.160> this

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
dip Lemann dip it and see what we this

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:18.070 
dip Lemann dip it and see what we this
is<00:03:04.220> just<00:03:04.610> water

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.060 

well<00:03:18.740> the<00:03:19.510> middle<00:03:20.510> groove<00:03:21.230> which<00:03:21.590> is<00:03:21.770> the<00:03:21.920> one

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
well the middle groove which is the one

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.860 
well the middle groove which is the one
I<00:03:22.100> was<00:03:22.340> having<00:03:22.610> trouble<00:03:22.760> with<00:03:23.120> is<00:03:23.450> looking

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
I was having trouble with is looking

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.380 
I was having trouble with is looking
better<00:03:24.460> it<00:03:25.460> still<00:03:25.880> gotten<00:03:26.420> some<00:03:26.630> junk<00:03:26.990> in<00:03:27.200> it

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
better it still gotten some junk in it

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.980 
better it still gotten some junk in it
let<00:03:29.390> me<00:03:29.420> see<00:03:29.780> if<00:03:30.220> it's<00:03:31.220> softer<00:03:31.850> now<00:03:32.030> I'm<00:03:32.750> going

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
let me see if it's softer now I'm going

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.800 
let me see if it's softer now I'm going
to<00:03:33.050> get<00:03:33.200> a<00:03:33.520> piece<00:03:34.520> of<00:03:34.550> a<00:03:34.820> piston<00:03:35.240> ring<00:03:35.450> and<00:03:35.630> see

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
to get a piece of a piston ring and see

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.720 
to get a piece of a piston ring and see
if<00:03:35.900> I<00:03:36.020> can<00:03:36.230> scrape<00:03:36.560> that<00:03:36.830> any<00:03:37.100> easier<00:03:37.550> than

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
if I can scrape that any easier than

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.620 
if I can scrape that any easier than
before<00:03:39.520> so<00:03:40.520> now<00:03:40.910> I've<00:03:41.150> rinsed<00:03:41.390> this

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
before so now I've rinsed this

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.620 
before so now I've rinsed this
thoroughly<00:03:42.110> with<00:03:42.290> water<00:03:42.820> so<00:03:43.820> now<00:03:44.030> I'm<00:03:44.180> taking

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
thoroughly with water so now I'm taking

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.960 
thoroughly with water so now I'm taking
a<00:03:44.870> piece<00:03:45.410> of<00:03:45.620> a<00:03:45.680> piston<00:03:46.100> ring<00:03:46.310> I'm<00:03:46.730> going<00:03:46.910> to

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
a piece of a piston ring I'm going to

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:58.540 
a piece of a piston ring I'm going to
try<00:03:47.150> to<00:03:47.530> scrape<00:03:48.530> in<00:03:48.740> this<00:03:48.890> groove<00:03:57.130> you<00:03:58.130> can<00:03:58.340> see

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
try to scrape in this groove you can see

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.340 
try to scrape in this groove you can see
the<00:03:58.700> carbon<00:03:59.000> has<00:03:59.240> turned<00:03:59.510> soft<00:03:59.840> and<00:04:00.230> it's

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
the carbon has turned soft and it's

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.300 
the carbon has turned soft and it's
peeling<00:04:00.710> up<00:04:01.010> out<00:04:01.610> of<00:04:01.790> there<00:04:03.010> so<00:04:04.010> it's<00:04:04.130> actually

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
peeling up out of there so it's actually

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.780 
peeling up out of there so it's actually
coming<00:04:04.790> out<00:04:05.500> if<00:04:06.500> I<00:04:06.620> soak<00:04:06.920> it<00:04:07.100> longer<00:04:07.460> I<00:04:07.490> bet

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
coming out if I soak it longer I bet

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.640 
coming out if I soak it longer I bet
it'll<00:04:08.030> I<00:04:09.340> bet<00:04:10.340> it<00:04:10.430> would<00:04:10.520> all<00:04:10.700> dissolve<00:04:11.620> so<00:04:12.620> I

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
it'll I bet it would all dissolve so I

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.740 
it'll I bet it would all dissolve so I
just<00:04:12.860> did<00:04:13.070> some<00:04:13.100> more<00:04:13.430> scraping<00:04:14.030> and<00:04:14.240> the<00:04:14.300> I

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
just did some more scraping and the I

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.580 
just did some more scraping and the I
got<00:04:15.590> some<00:04:15.830> more<00:04:15.950> of<00:04:16.010> it<00:04:16.130> to<00:04:16.310> peel<00:04:16.519> out<00:04:16.730> of<00:04:16.880> there

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
got some more of it to peel out of there

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.540 
got some more of it to peel out of there
I'm<00:04:18.590> almost<00:04:18.830> down<00:04:19.190> to<00:04:19.250> the<00:04:19.519> bottom<00:04:21.460> so<00:04:22.460> it

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
I'm almost down to the bottom so it

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.170 
I'm almost down to the bottom so it
seems<00:04:22.820> like<00:04:23.000> this<00:04:23.180> stuff<00:04:23.480> is<00:04:23.720> working<00:04:25.180> softens

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
seems like this stuff is working softens

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.320 
seems like this stuff is working softens
up<00:04:26.330> the<00:04:26.540> top<00:04:26.780> layer<00:04:26.810> to<00:04:27.730> where<00:04:28.730> I<00:04:28.760> can<00:04:29.000> scrape

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
up the top layer to where I can scrape

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.580 
up the top layer to where I can scrape
it<00:04:29.510> off<00:04:29.690> down<00:04:30.470> to<00:04:30.530> hardness<00:04:31.160> again<00:04:32.169> and<00:04:33.169> put<00:04:33.500> it

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
it off down to hardness again and put it

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.620 
it off down to hardness again and put it
back<00:04:33.740> in<00:04:33.950> to<00:04:34.070> soak<00:04:34.310> a<00:04:34.340> while<00:04:34.669> longer<00:04:35.000> and<00:04:35.360> it'll

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
back in to soak a while longer and it'll

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.690 
back in to soak a while longer and it'll
soften<00:04:36.620> the<00:04:36.919> next<00:04:37.220> layer<00:04:39.100> I'm<00:04:40.100> going<00:04:40.310> to<00:04:40.370> put

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
soften the next layer I'm going to put

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.480 
soften the next layer I'm going to put
it<00:04:40.790> back<00:04:40.910> in<00:04:41.180> probably<00:04:42.110> if<00:04:42.560> I<00:04:42.770> let<00:04:43.190> it<00:04:43.310> just

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
it back in probably if I let it just

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.460 
it back in probably if I let it just
soak<00:04:43.790> for<00:04:44.030> hours<00:04:44.419> it<00:04:44.660> would<00:04:44.750> quite<00:04:45.020> clean<00:04:45.320> the

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
soak for hours it would quite clean the

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.470 
soak for hours it would quite clean the
whole<00:04:45.620> thing<00:04:45.860> off<00:04:46.070> without<00:04:46.250> any<00:04:46.669> scraping

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.360 

well<00:04:50.480> I<00:04:50.660> put<00:04:51.140> it<00:04:51.169> back<00:04:51.350> in<00:04:51.560> here<00:04:51.800> and<00:04:51.860> I<00:04:52.010> forgot

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
well I put it back in here and I forgot

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:58.570 
well I put it back in here and I forgot
about<00:04:52.430> it<00:04:52.700> for<00:04:53.000> about<00:04:53.090> an<00:04:53.330> hour<00:04:53.390> and<00:04:53.720> a<00:04:53.810> half<00:04:57.580> it

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
about it for about an hour and a half it

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.880 
about it for about an hour and a half it
looks<00:04:58.790> pretty<00:04:59.090> good<00:04:59.300> I<00:04:59.630> can<00:05:00.050> see<00:05:00.230> a<00:05:00.260> few<00:05:00.560> small

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
looks pretty good I can see a few small

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.030 
looks pretty good I can see a few small
spots<00:05:01.730> in<00:05:02.030> the<00:05:02.240> some<00:05:03.050> of<00:05:03.080> the<00:05:03.260> grooves<00:05:03.530> that<00:05:03.950> I

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
spots in the some of the grooves that I

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.580 
spots in the some of the grooves that I
need<00:05:04.220> to<00:05:04.400> scrape<00:05:05.360> out<00:05:05.600> but<00:05:05.930> I'm<00:05:06.110> willing<00:05:06.560> to

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
need to scrape out but I'm willing to

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.290 
need to scrape out but I'm willing to
bet<00:05:06.770> they're<00:05:07.010> pretty<00:05:07.040> darn<00:05:07.550> soft<00:05:07.850> and<00:05:08.180> they'll

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
bet they're pretty darn soft and they'll

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.530 
bet they're pretty darn soft and they'll
probably<00:05:08.450> come<00:05:08.750> out<00:05:08.870> really<00:05:09.230> easy<00:05:10.030> so<00:05:11.030> all<00:05:11.330> in

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
probably come out really easy so all in

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.390 
probably come out really easy so all in
all<00:05:11.660> I'd<00:05:11.930> say<00:05:11.960> this<00:05:12.350> product<00:05:12.710> seems<00:05:13.070> to<00:05:13.250> work

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
all I'd say this product seems to work

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.970 
all I'd say this product seems to work
pretty<00:05:13.669> good<00:05:13.790> I<00:05:13.970> tried<00:05:14.830> quite<00:05:15.830> a<00:05:15.890> few

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
pretty good I tried quite a few

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.250 
pretty good I tried quite a few
different<00:05:16.460> products<00:05:16.669> before<00:05:17.240> it<00:05:17.390> didn't<00:05:18.140> get

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
different products before it didn't get

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.740 
different products before it didn't get
any<00:05:18.410> results<00:05:18.680> at<00:05:19.070> all<00:05:19.190> this<00:05:19.910> one<00:05:20.240> it<00:05:20.570> obviously

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
any results at all this one it obviously

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.470 
any results at all this one it obviously
dissolves<00:05:21.620> carbon<00:05:22.100> and<00:05:22.850> it<00:05:23.030> does<00:05:23.210> a<00:05:23.240> pretty

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
dissolves carbon and it does a pretty

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:33.839 
dissolves carbon and it does a pretty
good<00:05:23.570> job<00:05:23.720> at<00:05:24.140> it

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:33.849 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:44.750 

you

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.820 

you
