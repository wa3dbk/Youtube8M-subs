00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.059
 the truth that I am very happy with 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.660
 to be here again to be 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:17.160
 with my classmates vince and good and I 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:20.840
 I think the style we play is a 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.150
 little too in the style that I play 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.789
 When I was with Lucas in Salamanca, 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.289
 true that we did 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:32.210
 basketball good years I think it was 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.329
 magnificent in all aspects and now 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.920
 Well, good to meet again with 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.079
 people what you shared that then 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.760
 Well yes, it's nice, it's not 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.010
 I also believe in positive things 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.809
 that you know more I do not know with cesc 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.629
 to your coaches the coach and that 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.640
 it also helps to say that things are 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.469
 make it easier not now to finish 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.430
 of joining the team and combining the 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.949
 game I think a positive thing and 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.350
 good me and I wish I could have a final 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.039
 as good as how it was for everything to me 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.229
 has grown 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.909
 I believe that both within the 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.970
 court as well as outside do not go outside 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.289
 in a great team like the galatasaray of 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.270
 play with the best players of the 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:14.310
 world because it makes you take a step 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.399
 forward no and then good to pass a 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.740
 injury like the one that happens and go back to 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.509
 recover and start playing with 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.130
 annoyances that do not just catch the 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.710
 rhythm and now and now again have 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.720
 good feelings not that it reminds you 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.399
 how were you before the injury 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.799
 well the truth that this is a joy 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.630
 and now you no longer think about the knees and 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.009
 you only have in say I play in 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.280
 basketball and and on keep improving not me 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.460
 I think my mind 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.979
 if it has been shown and I think so 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.310
 demonstrating in all the teams ponderÃ³ 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.290
 I knew the Spanish block this day 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.360
 this proves 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.430
 at the level that there are both the two 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.720
 teams that competed in Euroleague 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.880
 Spanish teams good at the end not 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.590
 I can be but we have also given a 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.960
 good level as I said I think all 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.970
 we know what they all mean I think 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.660
 which is that we know the responsibility 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.120
 what does this mean and with so many 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.200
 really wanted to prove again 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.750
 Well, where has this team been? 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.390
 these years that is the draw does not go well 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.260
 but it is already forgotten today and above all 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.930
 wanting to fight every ball until the 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.459
 final and will reach the championship already at one hundred 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.690
 Per hundred do not and this is what we are 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.690
 doing working and butt
