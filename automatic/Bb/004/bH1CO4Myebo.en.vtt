00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:45.749 
though and then this video makings taken

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:47.239 
though and then this video makings taken
a<00:00:45.809> lot<00:00:45.929> of<00:00:45.989> time<00:00:46.230> away<00:00:46.350> from<00:00:46.440> my<00:00:46.620> machine<00:00:46.829> time

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:47.249 
a lot of time away from my machine time

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:51.919 
a lot of time away from my machine time
but<00:00:47.489> I'm<00:00:47.640> having<00:00:47.909> fun<00:00:49.190> so<00:00:50.300> are<00:00:51.300> those<00:00:51.449> excuses

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:51.929 
but I'm having fun so are those excuses

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:56.419 
but I'm having fun so are those excuses
or<00:00:52.440> sent<00:00:53.190> an<00:00:53.249> alibi<00:00:54.739> well<00:00:55.739> we'll<00:00:55.949> get<00:00:56.069> back<00:00:56.249> to

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:56.429 
or sent an alibi well we'll get back to

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:01.069 
or sent an alibi well we'll get back to
that<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.819> wanted<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.870> follow<00:00:58.079> up<00:00:58.789> back<00:00:59.929> from<00:01:00.929> our

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
that I wanted to follow up back from our

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.110 
that I wanted to follow up back from our
first<00:01:01.649> tool<00:01:01.920> time<00:01:02.100> episode<00:01:02.399> there<00:01:02.789> where<00:01:03.089> I

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
first tool time episode there where I

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.479 
first tool time episode there where I
was<00:01:03.510> talking<00:01:03.899> about<00:01:03.989> these<00:01:04.710> guys<00:01:04.890> over<00:01:05.159> here

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
was talking about these guys over here

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.969 
was talking about these guys over here
we<00:01:06.300> grab<00:01:06.510> them<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:08.690> was<00:01:09.690> talking<00:01:09.960> about<00:01:10.020> these

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
we grab them I was talking about these

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.940 
we grab them I was talking about these
blocks<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:11.820> really<00:01:12.540> didn't<00:01:12.869> probably<00:01:13.829> do<00:01:13.920> a

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
blocks and I really didn't probably do a

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.670 
blocks and I really didn't probably do a
good<00:01:14.130> explanation<00:01:15.020> they're<00:01:16.020> called<00:01:16.229> spacer

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
good explanation they're called spacer

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.999 
good explanation they're called spacer
blocks<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.850> again<00:01:18.540> just<00:01:18.719> a<00:01:18.930> quick<00:01:19.200> quick

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
blocks and again just a quick quick

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.469 
blocks and again just a quick quick
thing<00:01:20.219> as<00:01:20.399> where<00:01:20.579> you<00:01:20.700> can<00:01:20.880> put<00:01:21.240> them<00:01:21.360> together

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
thing as where you can put them together

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.810 
thing as where you can put them together
with<00:01:21.869> quartering<00:01:22.409> set<00:01:22.649> screws<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.310> their

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
with quartering set screws and their

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.760 
with quartering set screws and their
precision<00:01:24.240> but<00:01:24.869> they're<00:01:25.049> not<00:01:25.170> ultra

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
precision but they're not ultra

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.520 
precision but they're not ultra
precision<00:01:26.130> but<00:01:27.000> they<00:01:27.180> work<00:01:27.659> real<00:01:27.899> good<00:01:27.930> for

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
precision but they work real good for

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.060 
precision but they work real good for
support<00:01:29.039> or<00:01:29.280> for<00:01:29.640> setting<00:01:30.240> up<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.719> vise

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
support or for setting up in the vise

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.980 
support or for setting up in the vise
when<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.159> need<00:01:32.390> support<00:01:33.390> on<00:01:33.539> the<00:01:33.630> other<00:01:33.750> side

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
when you need support on the other side

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.980 
when you need support on the other side
of<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.170> Vice<00:01:34.350> lots<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.070> buzz<00:01:35.250> he<00:01:35.399> uses<00:01:35.789> but<00:01:36.630> but

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
of the Vice lots of buzz he uses but but

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.219 
of the Vice lots of buzz he uses but but
they're<00:01:37.109> not<00:01:37.200> gauge<00:01:37.560> blocks<00:01:38.689> for<00:01:39.689> setting<00:01:40.109> up

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
they're not gauge blocks for setting up

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.190 
they're not gauge blocks for setting up
like<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> sign<00:01:40.770> bar<00:01:41.390> assuming<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.840> this

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
like a sign bar assuming this is in this

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.380 
like a sign bar assuming this is in this
is<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.439> set<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.189> gauge<00:01:44.340> blocks<00:01:44.700> for<00:01:44.969> setting<00:01:45.270> up

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
is a set of gauge blocks for setting up

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.380 
is a set of gauge blocks for setting up
in<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.539> sign<00:01:45.810> bar<00:01:46.109> and<00:01:46.880> of<00:01:47.880> course<00:01:48.149> these<00:01:48.329> are

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
in a sign bar and of course these are

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.620 
in a sign bar and of course these are
very<00:01:49.200> high<00:01:49.409> precision<00:01:49.679> in<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:51.179> lot<00:01:51.390> being

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
very high precision in a lot being

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.789 
very high precision in a lot being
already<00:01:51.840> down<00:01:52.109> to<00:01:52.380> tenth<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.189> thousandth

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
already down to tenth of a thousandth

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.380 
already down to tenth of a thousandth
ten-thousandth<00:01:55.799> excuse<00:01:56.340> me<00:01:56.520> for<00:01:56.820> for

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
ten-thousandth excuse me for for

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.690 
ten-thousandth excuse me for for
measuring<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.079> that's<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.100> difference<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.609> I

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
measuring so that's the difference and I

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.349 
measuring so that's the difference and I
just<00:01:59.850> wanted<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.179> quickly<00:02:00.539> point<00:02:00.929> that<00:02:01.200> out

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:02.359 
just wanted to quickly point that out

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:05.719 
just wanted to quickly point that out
regarding<00:02:03.359> gauge<00:02:03.990> blocks<00:02:04.350> if<00:02:05.249> you<00:02:05.399> want<00:02:05.609> to

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
regarding gauge blocks if you want to

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.310 
regarding gauge blocks if you want to

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
watch a great video about how to use

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.469 
watch a great video about how to use

on a gauge blocks is and a lot of other
things<00:02:16.460> I<00:02:17.740> more<00:02:18.740> than<00:02:18.860> often<00:02:19.010> have<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.340> go<00:02:19.430> back

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
things I more than often have to go back

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.180 
things I more than often have to go back
and<00:02:19.820> review<00:02:20.720> something<00:02:21.020> that<00:02:21.470> he's<00:02:21.650> done<00:02:21.860> so<00:02:22.160> I

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
and review something that he's done so I

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.820 
and review something that he's done so I
know<00:02:22.310> what<00:02:22.430> I'm<00:02:22.580> doing<00:02:25.690> so<00:02:26.690> I<00:02:27.020> kind<00:02:27.590> of<00:02:27.620> want<00:02:27.770> to

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
that guy is something else and I think

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.880

if he wanted to cure cancer you could

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.550

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.620 
probably go do that too he's a
professional<00:03:28.360> he's<00:03:29.360> uh<00:03:30.519> he's<00:03:31.519> a<00:03:31.630> partner
