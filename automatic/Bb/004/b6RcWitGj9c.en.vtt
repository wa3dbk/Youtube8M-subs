gonna start this off in its transformed

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.689 
gonna start this off in its transformed
mode<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:18.869> have<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.140> say<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.010> like<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.520> I

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
mode and I have to say that I like it I

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.700 
mode and I have to say that I like it I
like<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.420> without<00:00:21.600> an<00:00:21.779> action<00:00:22.109> base<00:00:22.320> when<00:00:22.590> it's

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
like it without an action base when it's

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.349 
like it without an action base when it's
in<00:00:22.830> Jeep<00:00:23.039> fortress<00:00:23.430> mode<00:00:23.609> mostly<00:00:24.060> because<00:00:24.210> of

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
in Jeep fortress mode mostly because of

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.820 
in Jeep fortress mode mostly because of
the<00:00:24.480> fact<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.900> has<00:00:25.080> this<00:00:25.260> base<00:00:25.560> that

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
the fact that it has this base that

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.220 
the fact that it has this base that
holds<00:00:26.099> everything<00:00:26.220> nicely<00:00:26.730> in<00:00:27.060> place<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.660> it

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
holds everything nicely in place and it

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.929 
holds everything nicely in place and it
also<00:00:28.260> looks<00:00:28.680> really<00:00:28.830> good<00:00:29.189> in<00:00:29.340> Jeep<00:00:29.519> fortress

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
also looks really good in Jeep fortress

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.999 
also looks really good in Jeep fortress
mode<00:00:30.119> when<00:00:30.359> it's<00:00:30.510> on<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.779> action<00:00:31.140> base<00:00:31.320> but

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
mode when it's on the action base but

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.440 
mode when it's on the action base but
the<00:00:32.160> thing<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.430> like<00:00:32.610> even<00:00:32.759> more<00:00:33.000> than<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.300> is

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
the thing I like even more than that is

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.299 
the thing I like even more than that is
just<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.200> way<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.739> core<00:00:35.010> base

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
just the the way that the core base

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.760 
just the the way that the core base
looks<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.059> especially<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.660> has<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.870> no<00:00:37.350> small

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
looks and especially that has a no small

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.700 
looks and especially that has a no small
that's<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.520> no<00:00:38.670> small<00:00:39.000> part<00:00:39.450> thanks<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.559> way

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
that's a no small part thanks to the way

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.290 
that's a no small part thanks to the way
that<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.010> core<00:00:41.190> fighter<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.700> well<00:00:41.940> designed

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
that the core fighter is well designed

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.090 
that the core fighter is well designed
and<00:00:42.420> well<00:00:42.629> put<00:00:42.840> together<00:00:42.960> although<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> little

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
and well put together although a little

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.279 
and well put together although a little
bit<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.430> yellow<00:00:44.550> paint<00:00:44.940> trim<00:00:45.390> etc<00:00:45.899> or<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.079> better

bit of yellow paint trim etc or a better

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.529 
bit of yellow paint trim etc or a better
sticker<00:00:46.710> from<00:00:46.980> Bandai<00:00:47.340> could<00:00:48.030> have<00:00:48.180> improved

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
sticker from Bandai could have improved

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.569 
sticker from Bandai could have improved
its<00:00:48.690> looks<00:00:48.989> just<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.829> details<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.489> the

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
slim line of the legs when you pull in

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.689 
slim line of the legs when you pull in
the<00:00:54.870> sides<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.710> just<00:00:56.010> make<00:00:56.160> everything<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.610> a

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
the sides and just make everything in a

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.369 
the sides and just make everything in a
straight<00:00:56.940> line<00:00:56.969> was<00:00:57.690> actually<00:00:58.109> really

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
straight line was actually really

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.680 
straight line was actually really
impressive<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.609> core<00:00:59.789> top<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.149> wasn't<00:01:00.510> as

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
impressive so the core top I wasn't as

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.090 
impressive so the core top I wasn't as
impressed<00:01:01.170> with<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.590> that's<00:01:01.710> mostly<00:01:02.039> because

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
impressed with and that's mostly because

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.439 
impressed with and that's mostly because
you<00:01:02.460> can<00:01:02.579> see<00:01:02.730> here<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.000> we've<00:01:03.149> got<00:01:03.180> these

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
you can see here that we've got these

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.450 
you can see here that we've got these
big<00:01:03.690> weapons<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.439> we've<00:01:04.589> got<00:01:04.799> this<00:01:04.949> landing

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
big weapons and we've got this landing

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.039 
big weapons and we've got this landing
gear<00:01:05.580> that's<00:01:05.760> holding<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.150> up<00:01:06.299> but<00:01:06.840> otherwise

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
gear that's holding it up but otherwise

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.380 
gear that's holding it up but otherwise
it's<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:07.590> going<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.950> flop<00:01:08.520> down<00:01:08.939> because

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
it's just going to flop down because

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.910 
it's just going to flop down because
it's<00:01:09.570> not<00:01:09.750> really<00:01:10.049> made<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.320> sit<00:01:10.740> on<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
it's not really made to sit on the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.550 
it's not really made to sit on the
ground<00:01:11.130> by<00:01:11.280> itself<00:01:11.610> but<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.780> can<00:01:12.960> fix<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.380> by

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
ground by itself but you can fix that by

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.969 
ground by itself but you can fix that by
putting<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.010> up<00:01:14.100> on<00:01:14.250> an<00:01:14.369> action<00:01:14.670> base<00:01:15.799> so<00:01:16.799> what

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
putting it up on an action base so what

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.100 
putting it up on an action base so what
about<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.280> downsides<00:01:17.880> well<00:01:18.270> let<00:01:18.540> me<00:01:18.570> gather

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
about the downsides well let me gather

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.780 
about the downsides well let me gather
up<00:01:19.560> all<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:19.979> these<00:01:20.549> parts<00:01:21.450> here<00:01:22.049> because<00:01:22.790> there

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
up all of these parts here because there

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.460 
up all of these parts here because there
are<00:01:24.259> quite<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.500> few<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:26.400> them<00:01:27.170> anyway<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.200> get

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
are quite a few of them anyway you get

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.260 
are quite a few of them anyway you get
the<00:01:28.530> idea<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.280> these<00:01:29.549> are<00:01:29.759> parts<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.090> have

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
the idea and these are parts that have

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.210 
the idea and these are parts that have
come<00:01:30.509> off<00:01:30.540> from<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.140> gundam<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.770> would<00:01:32.009> be

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
come off from this gundam that would be

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.429 
come off from this gundam that would be
hidden<00:01:32.549> much<00:01:33.329> better<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.780> master<00:01:34.229> great

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
hidden much better on the master great

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.380 
hidden much better on the master great
especially<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.979> feet<00:01:35.310> but<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.150> case

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
especially the feet but in this case

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.450 
especially the feet but in this case
again<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:37.140> have<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.590> forgive<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.950> because<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.340> is

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
again I have to forgive it because it is

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.789 
again I have to forgive it because it is
a<00:01:38.490> 144th<00:01:39.329> model<00:01:39.720> if<00:01:39.990> they<00:01:40.409> made<00:01:40.650> this

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
a 144th model if they made this

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.950 
a 144th model if they made this
transform<00:01:41.400> ridiculously<00:01:42.119> complex<00:01:42.630> and

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
transform ridiculously complex and

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.660 
transform ridiculously complex and
that's<00:01:43.560> something<00:01:43.770> we<00:01:43.979> might<00:01:44.159> be<00:01:44.340> getting<00:01:44.579> in

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
that's something we might be getting in

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.819 
that's something we might be getting in

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
job of slimming it down while still

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.920 
job of slimming it down while still
keeping<00:03:17.890> it<00:03:18.160> just<00:03:18.190> bulky<00:03:18.940> enough<00:03:19.269> to<00:03:19.540> maintain

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
keeping it just bulky enough to maintain

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.229 
keeping it just bulky enough to maintain
some<00:03:20.200> of<00:03:20.230> its<00:03:20.500> 80s

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
some of its 80s

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.670 
some of its 80s
feel<00:03:22.239> but<00:03:22.870> I'm<00:03:22.959> glad<00:03:23.080> that<00:03:23.170> they<00:03:23.380> didn't<00:03:23.590> go

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
feel but I'm glad that they didn't go

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.259 
feel but I'm glad that they didn't go
totally<00:03:23.920> 80s<00:03:24.340> and<00:03:24.519> I<00:03:24.580> didn't<00:03:24.760> I'm<00:03:24.910> glad<00:03:25.120> they

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
totally 80s and I didn't I'm glad they

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.210 
totally 80s and I didn't I'm glad they
didn't<00:03:25.540> go<00:03:25.630> to<00:03:25.690> sleek<00:03:26.380> and<00:03:26.590> slim<00:03:26.800> down<00:03:27.010> I<00:03:27.040> think

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
didn't go to sleek and slim down I think

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.310 
didn't go to sleek and slim down I think
they<00:03:27.459> found<00:03:27.610> a<00:03:27.760> very<00:03:28.000> good<00:03:28.209> balance<00:03:28.390> and<00:03:28.780> of

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
they found a very good balance and of

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.140 
they found a very good balance and of
course<00:03:29.560> when<00:03:29.739> they<00:03:29.830> released<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.580> real<00:03:30.790> grade

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
course when they released the real grade

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.600 
course when they released the real grade
of<00:03:31.300> this<00:03:31.480> in<00:03:31.690> the<00:03:31.750> year<00:03:31.900> 2020<00:03:32.650> I'm<00:03:33.070> sure<00:03:33.400> that

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610
