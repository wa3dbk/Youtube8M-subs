00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.920
 regional blockade in nintendo you know 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.139
 that users are crazy 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.939
 withdraw this regional blockade has already been 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.950
 made that petition for signatures that 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:20.480
 we have commented to those who reflected in 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.580
 game and this time 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.680
 satoru iwata president of nintendo has 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.090
 defended the regional blockade that 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.250
 continues to use in their consoles 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.020
 domestic and that so many problems of 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.970
 head is causing the 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.860
 different users so look at the 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.840
 words of satoru iwata because it says 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.879
 from the perspective of some people 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.949
 It may seem like a restriction 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.510
 However we hope that people appreciate 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.120
 the fact that we sell our 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.799
 products worldwide and has not 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.690
 it's been so wide uncle says too 

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:49.580
 there are many different regions all over 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.710
 the world and each one has its 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.750
 legal restrictions also have their 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.089
 cultural constraints as well as 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.339
 different classification systems by 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:01.100
 ages there are always different things that 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:03.379
 we are required for each region what 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.600
 can go against the idea of ​​the 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.250
 players from around the world to play what 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.979
 that they want for these reasons 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.120
 Both Sony and Microsoft have bet 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.250
 to eliminate 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.890
 of regional restrictions on their 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.440
 consoles that yes do not forget that in the 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.960
 case of the publishers if they wish it 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.730
 they can choose to introduce that system 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.080
 regional blockade both in the 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.120
 sony consoles like in those of 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.980
 Microsoft certainly do not know 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.290
 you get clear in all this but to me 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.690
 sincerely what I did satoru iwata me 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.820
 it seems absolute nonsense I think 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.130
 honestly you could end up by five 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.780
 in that regional blockade since it's something 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.060
 that all players are going to 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.650
 thank you if you do not imagine for example in 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.630
 playstation3 we could not acquire 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.580
 games through pages like dabi 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.590
 pages that leave the games to us 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.780
 very affordable price of course 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.730
 there you have had that new news 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.650
 news in which satoru iwata has 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.870
 I tried to justify something that I 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:01.000
 I sincerely see it unjustifiable and it is 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.000
 the regional blockade in videogames
