00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
this if you cannot eat it and most

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.440 
this if you cannot eat it and most
people<00:01:28.740> don't<00:01:29.070> eat<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.430> stuff<00:01:29.670> now<00:01:30.000> if<00:01:30.270> you

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
people don't eat this stuff now if you

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.990 
people don't eat this stuff now if you
don't<00:01:30.750> eat<00:01:31.049> enough<00:01:31.380> drink<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.490> can't<00:01:32.790> eat

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
don't eat enough drink it you can't eat

don't eat enough drink it you can't eat
it<00:01:33.030> drink<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:33.960> that's<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.320> loss<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.799> what<00:01:35.220> won't

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369
