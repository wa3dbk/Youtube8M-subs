well all you're doing is creating a

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.030 
well all you're doing is creating a
problem<00:01:29.610> somewhere<00:01:29.760> else<00:01:30.030> there's<00:01:31.020> six<00:01:31.380> six

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
problem somewhere else there's six six

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.730 
problem somewhere else there's six six
levels<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.400> progression<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.000> tumbling<00:01:33.740> you

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
levels of progression and tumbling you

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.680 
levels of progression and tumbling you
know<00:01:34.830> major<00:01:35.040> progressions<00:01:35.580> but<00:01:36.479> there's<00:01:36.600> only

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
know major progressions but there's only

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.499 
know major progressions but there's only
five<00:01:36.930> levels<00:01:37.610> so<00:01:38.610> if<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:38.820> took<00:01:38.940> the<00:01:39.060> fools<00:01:39.300> and

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
five levels so if you took the fools and

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.719 
five levels so if you took the fools and
brought<00:01:39.630> them<00:01:39.690> down<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.990> level<00:01:40.229> four<00:01:40.440> well<00:01:41.220> the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
brought them down to level four well the

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.249 
brought them down to level four well the
first<00:01:41.759> flips<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.240> can<00:01:42.390> do<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.570> now<00:01:42.690> layouts

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
first flips you can do it now layouts

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.040 
first flips you can do it now layouts
and<00:01:43.580> everything<00:01:44.580> else<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:45.659> know<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:45.930> just
