This episode of "In the
Making," is brought you by Ting,

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:04.485
mobile to make sense.

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:08.850
[MUSIC]

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.940
Tell me about this Airmaker.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.860
Right, well it's an app that
let's you draw in the air

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.790
and see it in 3D real space.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.040
So the concept is,
when you have an idea,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.230
and you want to draw it, all
throughout history you've

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.520
had to flatten it into
2D, onto a surface, right?

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.020
Right.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.870
And you were
limited to the frame

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.810
of the size of your canvas.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.240
What I want people to do is
to be able to go anywhere

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.910
and when it moves them,
just be able to draw

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.516
as big as they want in 3D.

00:00:45.516 --> 00:00:47.150
It's like making sandcastles.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.040
It's kind of making
sand-- well, not quite,

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.650
but-- our whole
frickin' world is in 3D,

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.580
why do we have to
express our ideas in 2D?

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.910
That doesn't make sense.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:56.600
Totally.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.790
Yeah.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.370
So this is kind of
like, if you were

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.475
playing with Play-Doh
in outer space.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.239
Well let me see how it
works and it might help.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:05.960
Right.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:14.540
So if I go, for example--
maybe I take a photo of you.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:16.990
Right, so that's it there.

00:01:20.098 --> 00:01:20.598
And--

00:01:20.598 --> 00:01:21.550
It's nice.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.323
You can move it around.

00:01:23.323 --> 00:01:23.822
Cool.

00:01:23.822 --> 00:01:25.640
Tell me a little
bit about tracking.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.060
You know I know that you can
move a new device around,

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.643
you can sense where it is using
accelerometers and gyrometers,

00:01:30.643 --> 00:01:33.674
and magnetometers, and even
GPS which isn't very accurate.

00:01:33.674 --> 00:01:35.590
But that's kind of like,
how you sense motion.

00:01:36.307 --> 00:01:37.640
But you're doing something else.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.598
Where all that's going
on now is linear motion,

00:01:39.598 --> 00:01:41.670
forward, back, up,
down, left, right.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.350
And there are a couple of
approaches to that, SLAM, PTAM,

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.490
some other algorithms.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.741
But they require a bit of
calibration beforehand.

00:01:47.741 --> 00:01:50.115
You just can't pull up the
phone and go straight into it.

00:01:50.115 --> 00:01:52.450
They're very good for other
things, but our strength,

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.260
and what's unique
about this approach is,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.780
once again, it doesn't
require calibration.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.250
It's straight up and it's
maximally easy for the person

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.990
to use.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.130
I see 3D graffiti.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.050
Super cool, I love
it, I love graffiti.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.650
But what else is there?

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.199
Like, for example, making
music through gestures, right.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.090
There is, you know, for health.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.360
You know, I can
do motion therapy.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.877
So you have to trace a certain
movement and I can track that.

00:02:17.877 --> 00:02:19.460
The person can send
it to their doctor

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.260
and they can track the
progress of how they're moving.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.450
This is another way for humans
to interface with technology.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.690
Absolutely, yeah.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.190
I want people to be able to go
out anywhere, on the streets,

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.420
in front of the building
at dawn, you know.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.290
In a park, you know,
and just do whatever

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.760
they like without being confined
to space, without having

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.070
to buy an external gadget.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.302
Just using the devices
that they already own.

00:02:47.302 --> 00:02:48.760
I want it in the
hands of everybody

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.660
so they can just all go crazy.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.110

Making," is brought you by Ting.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.410
Ting, mobile that makes sense.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.910
