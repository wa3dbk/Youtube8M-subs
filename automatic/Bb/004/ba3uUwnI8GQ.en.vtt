 two children that is upset 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.500
 but in the western conference 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.210
 there are rules of decency that has become

 That is also important that you admit 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.750
 writers the planned school 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.950

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.970
 part of the competition 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.600
 it's just through 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.600
 it was 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.719
 Beijing actually nobody had to move 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:40.780
 on thursday 3 and pc 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.369
 you can actually come as a top ten in sports 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.090
 and maybe in the government after the games 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.810
 These are guys who if you can be very self-aware these actually already know that 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.680
 he already did the rounds 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.010
 the animal shelter is not really busy 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.520
 how it appears in the first four in the premier league it happened is not yet 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.950
 ready for people smuggling 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.120
 the search market 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.860
 Mothers Foxes creator of the rooms and a new school 

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:13.779
 but a role 4 now let's just say 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:17.939
 in response to the 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:19.949
 Past 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:22.770
 the dead 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.770
 4 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.670
 has now or never been shown 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.239
 was fired 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.169
 music must be on 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:44.449
 an explanation 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:47.179
 the city council the flight 

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:50.539
 mother of basts of through traffic 

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:53.819
 Bosman supervisors only then the result yes 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:55.729
 I think so 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:03:00.329
 when I was still good in itself but there is 3 really whole in the list 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:01.969
 are doing well 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:04.969
 I expect he wants everything from it 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:09.429
 all fronts 

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:12.289
 noortje a start 

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:13.919
 with ten people 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:17.649
 I don't see why wilders have to give up more power 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:22.749
 this happens through 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:26.449
 you go better and better but you can tidy up anyway 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:30.620
 we work 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.620
 even worse 

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:36.389
 athlete is built 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:39.769
 sound cs braine verte good pass movement 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.769
 is therefore in the right place to reach a compromise 

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:46.979
 and has a brain tumor 

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:49.979
 that's why we ask present 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:51.549
 the sport must 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.549
 and sometimes I don't have he cracked 

00:03:59.149 --> 00:04:02.269
 the company is coming to the Netherlands 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.180
 and I think that has concentration problems and that too 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.180
 to do with age 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:13.379
 that is an increase in the number of jobs 

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:19.419
 9 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.419
 sommelsdijk 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.550
 what has changed the encounters work 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:33.169
 let it be clear that do this 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:34.550
 the coming developments 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.360
 the next time 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.659
 now the one says 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:40.520
 for the chairman 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.390
 I hope of course that you are the best even if it is not as the reserve players 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:45.879
 so 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:50.639
 that would be nice for him the city had the current shape in parts of 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.249
 the netherlands also better we had to do 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:55.439
 and still working hard for that 

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:58.139
 I still have time to do people do 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.340
