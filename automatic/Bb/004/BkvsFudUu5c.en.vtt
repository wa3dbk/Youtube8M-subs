00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.049
 the description of the video I'm going to 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.300
 leave in mediafire so that you what 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.680
 can download without any problem and 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.939
 Well, only what they are going to do 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.369
 after they already have it in their 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.660
 computer will give you right click and 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.090
 they will give you the option that says 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.510
 extract here as you give in 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.510
 this option 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.270
 the only thing they are going to do next is 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.340
 open this folder that will appear 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.500
 which is called game and inside that 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.059
 folder two files come 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.309
 these two files are the applications 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.090
 of the games but they are for different 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.879
 uses I have two games that the first is 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.340
 so you can play with the keys 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.579
 of the computer or the keyboard 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.340
 better said and the other this that says peace 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.649
 is for you to connect some 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.780
 controls so that you can 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.479
 handle this easier 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.280
 as we do not have at the moment the 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.100
 controls of the adapter for controls 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.950
 Well, what are we going to do? Let's open 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.810
 the application that says keys ok is that 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.729
 here says here that I am 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.830
 showing if I have the controls but 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.659
 I'll show you that later ok 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.729
 for easier we are going to open this 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.369
 application we're just going to click 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:31.159
 right and open and we'll wait for that 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.159
 open us the game of mario karts 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.659
 then the application at this time already 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.049
 is opening only we have to 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.470
 wait for the game to start ok 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.230
 here is how you can see 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:53.460
 and to select any menu of 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:55.860
 all this game deals with the letter q ok 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.520
 to choose and select all this 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.520
 is here 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.100
 and we are going to press the letter 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.440
 with the letter that we are going to handle the 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.440
 most I'm going to give later 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:20.850
 and we can move with the keys 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.710
 of the game with the arrows that we have 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.070
 here on the keyboard in this case I 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:29.370

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.620

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.079
