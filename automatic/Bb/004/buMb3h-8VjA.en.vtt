00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.560
 Hey 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.210
 Yup 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:13.490
 Hello everyone 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:15.700
 How to make Welcome this time to anywhere in the cup cake cake pop stick ice decoration 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:20.880
 We introduce 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:23.740
 Necessary materials and tools are blocks of Styrofoam 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.860
 A bag of scissors zip lock 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:31.840
 How I love you so certain cake pop balls of 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:37.210
 Use two cake pop balls to make one ice 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:39.180
 Because what you have prepared here are chilled in the refrigerator immediately Torikakare in decoration 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.120
 I will 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.329
 Toka car dark chocolate 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.430
 White chocolate crowned with sprinkle 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:53.540
 More than a knife spoon 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:55.560
 This time I will make it as in Japan, but please go back and make colors and designs freely 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.310
 Let's get started 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:03.380
 At first we make ice shape 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:07.680
 Make one ice with two cake black balls as I said earlier 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:12.240
 After summarizing the two holding hands and a big bowl 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:16.680
 This is a measure of how much cake pop mix is ​​used 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:22.720
 If possible, smash it with your palm and flatten it 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:29.890
 If it is a flat circle, drop it from above and make beautiful noodles on the surface 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:31.220
 Straighten the knitting with your finger Only one side wants to leave a round shape so leave the most beautiful prosperity 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.730
 Please give me 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.730
 It is okay if there is such a small crack here 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:47.229
 Let's check the size if you can get here 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:51.720
 When putting on a stick of ice stick, let the stick to support about half of the ice 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:58.290
 Otherwise the ice will look small and the balance will be worse 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:59.600
 So I stretched it a little more flatly to make it a little bigger, but I felt it was not too thin 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:06.000
 Let's put on 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:11.370
 If this is too thin, the stick may be said to come out of the cake pop when you stick the stick 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.490
 Please adjust the size and adjust the shape little by little while watching the situation 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:18.200
 Since it was about the necessary size 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:21.470
 It seems clean and the surface dropped from the top 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:25.900
 If you think that it is a semi-circular boat on the top, sand resistance number 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.900
 Let the lower part be the amount we can live 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.209
 It has been cut now so it will be a bit thinner if it is not long enough 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.960
 But 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:40.230
 Please stretch and adjust the size 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:46.610
 Make aligned as much as possible all sizes 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.610
 The thing that made now is to rest and purchase about 15 minutes in the refrigerator 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:54.000
 Because the thing that as I said earlier there to here are already allowed to rest in the refrigerator and use it next 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.670
 Let's go to 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.950
 I will stave you 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:06.030
 This ice bars I think that can also be purchased easily on the Internet also in the shop 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:10.850
 About 2 thousand just was in the dark chocolate has been turned into a 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.850
 Stab cake cake pop that unraves the shape of ice 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:17.590
 To match the height of the so stuck in the middle of the cake pop sticks a stick 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:25.239
 At this time , please be careful not to crack the cake pops . 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:38.940
 The ice stick is now stabbing up to about 3/4 of the cake pop 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:41.000
 Also wipe the chocolate around Po with a finger and stick the stick part 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.040
 I finish clean 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.040
 You should have prepared this far 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:51.910
 Let's dry the chocolate completely free 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:56.550
 Move to decoration when it's dry 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.550
 Put in the refrigerator for a few minutes to dry the chocolate 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.970
 Is what came out of the refrigerator 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:05.200
 The chocolate is dry and the stick is firmly fixed 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:10.660
 Let the decoration 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:14.050
 This time I use the darkened food rate, but I use chocolate of my favorite color and taste 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:19.900
 Please try to make a variety of stick ice Te 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:25.240
 Even if you use anything , please prepare in a deep container as shown here 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:27.480
 Please firmly with the chocolate until the boat of the joint is hidden 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.589
 I will take it out if I can 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:34.729
 I will drop extra chocolate here 

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:40.189
 As a result of trying various ways of dropping, it is in the state as it is 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:41.650
 The best way is to tap the wrist with a stick and put the chocolate back 

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:47.800
 See directly below 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:50.919
 Even when rolled through chocolate , the entire product is finished equally even in this form 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.930
 It does not need to turn because there is no such 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:57.770
 I got this whole chocolate 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:00.260
 Then point your wrists up slightly and come a few times 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:06.200
 Please ring the top chocolate 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:07.969
 You can see bubbles of air here, but this time I put white chocolate on this so it's all right 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:13.100
 is 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:18.010
 Once you have done this , pierce the foam and dry the chocolate 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.010
 Once dry, let's complete the rest of the decoration 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.770
 The chocolate has dried out and it is safe to touch 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:29.259
 Please dry completely 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.259
 I finish white chocolate from the top 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:38.250
 Put the melted white chocolate in a Ziplock bag and bring it to one corner 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.250
 Close the mouth of the bag 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:48.300
 Please cut a few corners 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:53.539
 We do not specify size in particular, but think that it is not necessary to cut small as it is not small work 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.539
 Now it drips chocolate from above and finishes it deliciously 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:07.070
 I put the Jiplock bag on top of I love it and put out the chocolate 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:13.570
 Squeeze out chocolate where you want to correct it 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:13.570
 Please put the rate there all over while repeating it too 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:20.120
 When finished , squeeze the chocolate to fill the open area of ​​the top 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:29.070
 Once squeezed out, tap the wrist holding the stick . 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:31.980
 Then the whole chocolate drips cleanly 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:35.030
 This is already done 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:40.849
 Let's proceed faster from here 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:45.830
 Sprinkle the sprinkles from above to finish before the chocolate dries 

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:47.959
 Here it would with a sprinkle throughout and dark chocolate is not completely dry 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:51.999
 So be sure to finish 

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:51.999
 Please make sure the dark chocolate is dry 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:07:02.360
 I think that this issue of ice cake pop will be active in various events 

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:02.360
 I think it is good for surprise as it looks like stick ice 

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:09.639
 This is the end of the cake pop for stick ice cream 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:12.330
 Could you enjoy it 

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:13.330
 Thank you for watching 

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.979
 Hmm 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.979
 Wow 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.520
 Yeah N 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.520
 Hmm
