00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
hey everyone and welcome to my review of

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:14.560 
hey everyone and welcome to my review of
the<00:00:02.700> night-vision<00:00:03.090> camera<00:00:04.080> by<00:00:04.350> finger<00:00:04.830> soft

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.510 

the<00:00:15.570> night<00:00:15.750> vision<00:00:15.960> camera<00:00:16.260> basically<00:00:16.520> turns

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
the night vision camera basically turns

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.939 
the night vision camera basically turns
your<00:00:17.699> camera<00:00:18.510> into<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.869> night-vision<00:00:19.289> camera

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
your camera into a night-vision camera

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.070 
your camera into a night-vision camera
if<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.609> can<00:00:20.760> see<00:00:20.939> here<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.210> can<00:00:21.449> wave<00:00:21.660> my<00:00:21.689> hand

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
if you can see here I can wave my hand

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.960 
if you can see here I can wave my hand
in<00:00:22.350> front<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.920> keyboard<00:00:23.670> I've<00:00:23.820> got<00:00:23.939> a

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
in front of the keyboard I've got a

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.550 
in front of the keyboard I've got a
keyboard<00:00:24.210> seven<00:00:24.660> foot<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:24.869> this<00:00:24.960> now

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
keyboard seven foot of this now

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.900 
keyboard seven foot of this now
obviously<00:00:25.980> I've<00:00:26.070> got<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> light<00:00:26.460> shadow<00:00:26.699> right

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
obviously I've got a light shadow right

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.150 
obviously I've got a light shadow right
so<00:00:27.060> it's<00:00:27.180> not<00:00:27.210> great<00:00:27.570> if<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.439> was<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.710> turn<00:00:28.949> the

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
so it's not great if I was to turn the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.440 
so it's not great if I was to turn the
light<00:00:29.400> off<00:00:29.580> which<00:00:30.210> I'll<00:00:30.390> do<00:00:30.660> now<00:00:32.210> you<00:00:33.210> can<00:00:33.360> see

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
light off which I'll do now you can see

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.430 
light off which I'll do now you can see
that<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.660> quality<00:00:33.840> does<00:00:34.110> differently

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
that the quality does differently

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.990 
that the quality does differently
although<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.829> screen<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.309> still<00:00:35.489> lighting<00:00:35.850> it

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
although the screen is still lighting it

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.830 
although the screen is still lighting it
but<00:00:36.239> as<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:37.290> can<00:00:37.530> see<00:00:38.390> I'm<00:00:39.390> moving<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.780> around

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
but as you can see I'm moving it around

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.930 
but as you can see I'm moving it around
and<00:00:40.379> yeah<00:00:41.040> it's<00:00:41.250> pretty<00:00:41.399> much<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.640> night-vision

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
and yeah it's pretty much a night-vision

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.840 
and yeah it's pretty much a night-vision
camera<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:43.590> has<00:00:44.219> turned<00:00:44.430> my<00:00:44.640> camera

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
camera that this has turned my camera

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.209 
camera that this has turned my camera
into<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:46.050> here<00:00:46.289> we<00:00:46.379> are<00:00:46.410> walking<00:00:46.649> on<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.039> house

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
into so here we are walking on the house

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.619 
into so here we are walking on the house
and<00:00:47.460> as<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.670> can<00:00:47.820> see<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.059> mean<00:00:48.390> pretty<00:00:48.570> much

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
and as you can see I mean pretty much

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.810 
and as you can see I mean pretty much
low<00:00:48.899> light<00:00:49.079> conditions<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.340> camera<00:00:50.640> does

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
low light conditions and the camera does

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.910 
low light conditions and the camera does
work<00:00:51.000> pretty<00:00:51.030> well<00:00:51.420> although<00:00:51.750> once<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.469> walk

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
work pretty well although once you walk

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.209 
work pretty well although once you walk
into<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.399> pitch-black<00:00:53.910> room<00:00:54.980> you<00:00:55.980> lose

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
into a pitch-black room you lose

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.700 
into a pitch-black room you lose
complete<00:00:56.820> visibility<00:00:57.390> on<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.079> camera<00:00:58.469> it's

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
complete visibility on the camera it's

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.770 
complete visibility on the camera it's
not<00:00:58.890> designed<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.340> work<00:00:59.550> in<00:00:59.820> total<00:01:00.510> darkness

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
not designed to work in total darkness

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.290 
not designed to work in total darkness
but<00:01:01.710> if<00:01:02.010> there's<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.250> smidgen<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.820> light<00:01:03.000> and

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
but if there's a smidgen of light and

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.539 
but if there's a smidgen of light and
the<00:01:03.359> sensitive<00:01:03.809> sensitivity<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.559> up<00:01:04.680> for<00:01:04.979> then

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
the sensitive sensitivity is up for then

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.630 
the sensitive sensitivity is up for then
yes<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.299> quite<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.960> good<00:01:06.990> application<00:01:07.920> over

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
yes it is quite a good application over

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.789 
yes it is quite a good application over
here<00:01:08.909> on<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.840> left<00:01:10.229> hand<00:01:10.439> side<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.740> screen

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
here on the left hand side of the screen

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.980 
here on the left hand side of the screen
you<00:01:11.040> have<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.280> zooms<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:12.030> we<00:01:12.210> can<00:01:12.450> zoom<00:01:12.780> in

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
you have the zooms so we can zoom in

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.330 
you have the zooms so we can zoom in
like<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:15.259> it's<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.320> little<00:01:16.470> bit<00:01:16.710> laggy<00:01:16.950> but<00:01:17.220> it

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
like so it's a little bit laggy but it

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.539 
like so it's a little bit laggy but it
does<00:01:17.490> work<00:01:18.740> and<00:01:19.740> obviously<00:01:20.009> on<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.220> side<00:01:20.430> you

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
does work and obviously on this side you

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.190 
does work and obviously on this side you
have<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.700> sensitivity<00:01:21.090> which<00:01:21.479> increases<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
have the sensitivity which increases the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.399 
have the sensitivity which increases the
sensitivity<00:01:22.500> for<00:01:22.890> light<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:24.200> back<00:01:25.200> down

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
sensitivity for light and back down

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.609 
sensitivity for light and back down
together<00:01:27.110> that's<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.200> nifty<00:01:28.320> little<00:01:28.500> feature

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
together that's a nifty little feature

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.440 
together that's a nifty little feature
if<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.070> only<00:01:29.159> got<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.340> tiny<00:01:29.790> bit<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.240> light<00:01:30.420> in

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
if you only got a tiny bit of light in

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.450 
if you only got a tiny bit of light in
the<00:01:30.689> room<00:01:30.900> but<00:01:31.680> over<00:01:31.860> all<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.400> this
