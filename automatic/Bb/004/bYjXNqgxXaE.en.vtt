00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
this and then you put a little bit right

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:05.729 
this and then you put a little bit right
underneath<00:04:04.750> there<00:04:05.109> you<00:04:05.349> don't<00:04:05.470> want<00:04:05.590> to<00:04:05.650> do

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
underneath there you don't want to do

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:06.990 
underneath there you don't want to do
too<00:04:05.919> much<00:04:06.040> because<00:04:06.190> going<00:04:06.370> to<00:04:06.459> look<00:04:06.609> like<00:04:06.639> to

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
too much because going to look like to

smudging kind messy but just a little
bit<00:04:11.139> really<00:04:11.440> helps<00:04:11.769> bring<00:04:12.639> the<00:04:12.669> look<00:04:12.970> together

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:13.199

medium pink i've never actually used
this<00:05:31.630> before<00:05:31.690> so<00:05:32.440> I<00:05:32.680> don't<00:05:32.770> know<00:05:32.919> it<00:05:33.400> seems

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
this before so I don't know it seems

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:34.790 
this before so I don't know it seems
like<00:05:33.700> it<00:05:33.880> would<00:05:33.940> go<00:05:34.090> with<00:05:34.210> the<00:05:34.270> look<00:05:34.450> though

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
like it would go with the look though

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.100 
like it would go with the look though
gonna<00:05:35.800> get<00:05:35.979> a<00:05:36.039> little<00:05:36.280> bit<00:05:36.520> and<00:05:36.870> put<00:05:37.870> you<00:05:37.990> down

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
gonna get a little bit and put you down

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:43.350 
gonna get a little bit and put you down
my<00:05:38.320> cheeks<00:05:41.460> you<00:05:42.460> don't<00:05:42.610> want<00:05:42.760> to<00:05:42.820> use<00:05:42.910> to<00:05:43.120> dark

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360

of<00:05:43.539> the<00:05:43.570> color<00:05:43.780> blush<00:05:44.169> with<00:05:44.350> this<00:05:44.500> look

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
of the color blush with this look

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.870 
of the color blush with this look
because<00:05:44.800> I<00:05:44.979> think<00:05:45.160> it<00:05:45.520> would<00:05:45.610> just<00:05:45.700> be<00:05:45.850> a

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
because I think it would just be a

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.370 
because I think it would just be a
little<00:05:46.090> overwhelming<00:05:46.450> all<00:05:47.080> right<00:05:47.229> now<00:05:47.320> I'm
