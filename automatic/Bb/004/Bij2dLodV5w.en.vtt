split<00:00:11.540> fence<00:00:11.870> is<00:00:12.230> and<00:00:12.530> so<00:00:13.430> instead<00:00:14.360> of<00:00:15.110> typing

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:15.289 
split fence is and so instead of typing

split fence is and so instead of typing
a<00:00:15.530> thousand<00:00:15.980> answers<00:00:16.340> i<00:00:16.490> thought<00:00:16.730> i'd<00:00:16.880> show

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
a thousand answers i thought i'd show

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.860 
a thousand answers i thought i'd show
you<00:00:17.150> on<00:00:17.480> a<00:00:17.510> video<00:00:17.930> this<00:00:18.650> is<00:00:18.920> a<00:00:19.369> fixed<00:00:20.000> fence<00:00:20.510> and

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:20.870 
you on a video this is a fixed fence and

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.080 
you on a video this is a fixed fence and
the<00:00:21.620> reason<00:00:22.010> you<00:00:22.130> can<00:00:22.280> tell<00:00:22.490> i'll<00:00:22.730> just<00:00:22.940> go

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
the reason you can tell i'll just go

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.150 
the reason you can tell i'll just go
ahead<00:00:23.210> and<00:00:23.360> turn<00:00:23.660> this<00:00:23.810> is<00:00:24.050> because<00:00:24.410> the<00:00:24.620> front

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
ahead and turn this is because the front

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.020 
ahead and turn this is because the front
face<00:00:25.580> of<00:00:25.880> the<00:00:26.570> fence<00:00:26.900> is<00:00:27.250> solid<00:00:28.250> it's<00:00:28.370> all<00:00:28.520> one

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:29.030 
face of the fence is solid it's all one

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.889 
face of the fence is solid it's all one
piece<00:00:29.450> there's<00:00:29.840> no<00:00:30.020> core<00:00:30.470> this<00:00:31.220> is<00:00:31.280> a<00:00:31.899> homemade

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
piece there's no core this is a homemade

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:34.930 
piece there's no core this is a homemade
design<00:00:33.379> that<00:00:33.739> actually<00:00:34.309> works<00:00:34.550> pretty<00:00:34.670> well

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
design that actually works pretty well

design that actually works pretty well
it<00:00:35.930> just<00:00:35.960> has<00:00:36.379> a<00:00:36.740> piece<00:00:37.430> of<00:00:38.380> MDF<00:00:39.380> connected<00:00:40.340> on

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:40.490 
it just has a piece of MDF connected on

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.569 
it just has a piece of MDF connected on
the<00:00:41.090> back<00:00:41.270> side<00:00:41.540> we<00:00:41.750> put<00:00:41.990> this<00:00:42.370> pretty<00:00:43.370> nice

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
the back side we put this pretty nice

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.060 
the back side we put this pretty nice
little<00:00:44.000> universal<00:00:44.690> dust<00:00:45.620> port<00:00:45.890> on<00:00:46.220> the<00:00:47.060> back

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
little universal dust port on the back

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.840 
little universal dust port on the back
and<00:00:49.070> it's<00:00:49.640> just<00:00:49.910> an<00:00:50.060> l-shaped<00:00:50.690> design<00:00:51.850> very

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
and it's just an l-shaped design very

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.370 
and it's just an l-shaped design very
very<00:00:53.239> simple<00:00:53.720> to<00:00:53.989> make<00:00:55.120> economical<00:00:56.200> and<00:00:57.200> I

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.380 
very simple to make economical and I

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.490 
very simple to make economical and I
think<00:00:57.680> they<00:00:57.890> work<00:00:58.100> great<00:00:58.340> ok<00:00:59.300> so<00:00:59.809> you<00:00:59.870> have<00:01:00.140> one

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
think they work great ok so you have one

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.749 
think they work great ok so you have one
face<00:01:01.510> here<00:01:02.510> now<00:01:03.320> the<00:01:03.920> difference<00:01:04.489> between

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
face here now the difference between

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:07.539 
face here now the difference between
that<00:01:05.469> and<00:01:06.469> we'll<00:01:06.649> move<00:01:06.829> this<00:01:07.040> out<00:01:07.250> of<00:01:07.310> the<00:01:07.430> way

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
that and we'll move this out of the way

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.480 
that and we'll move this out of the way
and<00:01:08.590> your<00:01:09.590> split<00:01:10.190> fence<00:01:11.110> is<00:01:12.110> your<00:01:12.620> split<00:01:13.130> fence

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
and your split fence is your split fence

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.920 
and your split fence is your split fence
sits<00:01:14.360> upon<00:01:15.170> a<00:01:15.530> core<00:01:16.159> if<00:01:17.090> you<00:01:17.240> look<00:01:17.420> back<00:01:17.600> here

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
sits upon a core if you look back here

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.430 
sits upon a core if you look back here
this<00:01:18.590> is<00:01:18.799> a<00:01:18.830> aluminum<00:01:19.790> core<00:01:20.390> ok<00:01:21.080> and<00:01:21.290> I<00:01:21.380> took

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
this is a aluminum core ok and I took

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.710 
this is a aluminum core ok and I took
the<00:01:21.740> bolts<00:01:22.100> out<00:01:22.220> that<00:01:22.940> show<00:01:23.240> you<00:01:23.299> how<00:01:23.540> this

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
the bolts out that show you how this

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.520 
the bolts out that show you how this
rides<00:01:24.080> in<00:01:24.320> this<00:01:24.470> track<00:01:26.200> the<00:01:27.200> main<00:01:27.500> difference

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
rides in this track the main difference

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:36.130 
rides in this track the main difference
between<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:28.430> split<00:01:28.820> fence<00:01:30.250> is<00:01:34.659> use<00:01:35.659> me<00:01:35.689> while

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
between the split fence is use me while

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.990 
between the split fence is use me while
I<00:01:36.170> move<00:01:36.530> this<00:01:36.740> camera<00:01:37.189> around<00:01:37.400> so<00:01:37.610> as<00:01:37.729> you<00:01:37.880> can

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
I move this camera around so as you can

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.240 
I move this camera around so as you can
see<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:39.560> split<00:01:39.979> fence<00:01:40.750> extensions<00:01:42.250> are

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
see the split fence extensions are

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.230 
see the split fence extensions are
movable<00:01:44.080> now<00:01:45.080> what<00:01:45.260> does<00:01:45.320> that<00:01:45.380> do<00:01:45.710> for<00:01:45.740> you

you to make a nice clothes profile when

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.200 
you to make a nice clothes profile when
your<00:01:53.150> bit<00:01:53.330> comes<00:01:53.659> up<00:01:53.869> here<00:01:54.080> ok<00:01:54.590> so<00:01:55.549> that<00:01:55.790> it's

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
your bit comes up here ok so that it's

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.960 
your bit comes up here ok so that it's
kind<00:01:56.420> of<00:01:56.509> like<00:01:56.600> a<00:01:56.659> zero<00:01:57.049> clearance<00:01:57.409> insert<00:01:57.970> for

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
kind of like a zero clearance insert for

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.999 
kind of like a zero clearance insert for
your<00:01:59.090> table<00:01:59.450> saw<00:01:59.630> you<00:02:00.140> can<00:02:00.350> tighten<00:02:00.619> this<00:02:00.829> up

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
your table saw you can tighten this up

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.910 
your table saw you can tighten this up
it<00:02:01.759> also<00:02:02.600> allows<00:02:03.140> you<00:02:03.439> to<00:02:03.619> attach<00:02:03.740> a<00:02:05.920> safety

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
it also allows you to attach a safety

bit cover but I can show you a couple of

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.020 
bit cover but I can show you a couple of
different<00:02:09.170> things<00:02:09.349> how<00:02:09.530> you<00:02:09.590> can<00:02:09.769> do

and it gives you some movement and some
measuring<00:02:13.840> measuring<00:02:14.440> abilities<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:15.550> you

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
measuring measuring abilities and you

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.940 
measuring measuring abilities and you
can<00:02:16.240> also<00:02:16.450> offset<00:02:16.810> some<00:02:17.319> of<00:02:17.350> these<00:02:17.500> split

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
can also offset some of these split

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.880 
can also offset some of these split
fences<00:02:18.459> for<00:02:19.240> jointing<00:02:19.840> capabilities<00:02:20.590> that's

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
fences for jointing capabilities that's

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.800 
fences for jointing capabilities that's
the<00:02:21.100> basic<00:02:21.490> difference<00:02:21.670> this<00:02:22.209> is<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.510> split

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
the basic difference this is the split

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.610 
the basic difference this is the split
the<00:02:23.440> other<00:02:23.620> one<00:02:23.830> is<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:24.069> fixed<00:02:24.280> base
