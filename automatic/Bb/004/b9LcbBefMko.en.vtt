00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:38.250
 incredible to believe the truth is that all the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.650
 effort all the tears in your two 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.079
 the bruises and all the blows 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.260
 They were worth it if you want a super 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.039
 surprise if you look over there 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.039
 what happens 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.000
 I think it is worth the truth 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:01.190
 they were very much effort on the part of 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.930
 she much family sacrifice that 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:09.200
 dedicate this prize easy good 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:13.219
 to my mom because she has always been 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.469
 my support and my gratitude totally 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:17.390
 obviously towards toni that if there is not 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:20.500
 been for him he would not have achieved 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.500
 I would have come so far 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.070
 to me because if I did not have to suffer 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.070
 I would not have lived so happy 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.759
 I would also love that moment that 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.829
 we were looking so much so many 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:40.000
 weeks then after the storm the 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.000
 calm will come the song says 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.020
 if you also deserved it 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.490
 you know that I'm very happy 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.960
 It would have hurt a lot even if you 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.610
 you would have left with nothing because I 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.810
 it would have hurt that they will not appreciate the great 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.369
 talent that you have 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.229
 I want that when you are more famous than 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.050

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.640
 we were divided and we are both 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.220
