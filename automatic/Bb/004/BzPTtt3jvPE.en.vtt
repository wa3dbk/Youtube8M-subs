00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:48.819 
to be my great-grandmother Henrietta
Lacks<00:00:46.760> cells<00:00:47.179> it<00:00:47.780> was<00:00:47.899> very<00:00:48.109> important<00:00:48.649> for<00:00:48.679> us

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
Lacks cells it was very important for us

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.309 
Lacks cells it was very important for us
to<00:00:49.129> do<00:00:49.399> these<00:00:49.639> cells<00:00:49.940> it<00:00:50.629> was<00:00:50.809> important

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:51.319 
to do these cells it was important

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:53.739 
to do these cells it was important
because<00:00:51.469> it<00:00:52.429> gave<00:00:52.639> us<00:00:52.699> the<00:00:52.850> opportunity<00:00:52.999> to

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
one feel a little more closer as a

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.239 
one feel a little more closer as a
family<00:00:55.929> to<00:00:56.929> our<00:00:56.960> great-grandmother<00:00:57.739> because

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:58.249 
family to our great-grandmother because

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:00.549

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
we didn't have a chance to meet her as

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.229 
we didn't have a chance to meet her as
we<00:01:00.889> were<00:01:01.039> in<00:01:01.249> there<00:01:01.519> we<00:01:01.699> were<00:01:01.729> viewing<00:01:02.089> the

we were in there we were viewing the

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.500 
we were in there we were viewing the
cells<00:01:02.659> we<00:01:03.530> were<00:01:04.430> a<00:01:04.460> little<00:01:04.729> more<00:01:04.940> closer<00:01:05.210> and

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
cells we were a little more closer and

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.580 
cells we were a little more closer and
we<00:01:05.570> learned<00:01:05.780> a<00:01:05.960> little<00:01:06.110> more<00:01:06.229> about<00:01:06.409> our

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
we learned a little more about our

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.789 
we learned a little more about our
history<00:01:06.979> and<00:01:07.880> about<00:01:08.150> how<00:01:08.330> they<00:01:08.540> divide<00:01:09.080> and

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
together as a family my favorite part of

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.060 
together as a family my favorite part of
the<00:01:16.040> day<00:01:16.220> was<00:01:16.970> we<00:01:17.360> went<00:01:17.660> to<00:01:17.840> see<00:01:18.200> what<00:01:18.470> room<00:01:18.770> he

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
the day was we went to see what room he

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.450 
the day was we went to see what room he
actually<00:01:19.310> took<00:01:20.210> her<00:01:20.390> cells<00:01:20.720> from<00:01:20.990> and<00:01:21.710> that

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
actually took her cells from and that

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.820 
actually took her cells from and that
was<00:01:22.580> my<00:01:22.700> favorite<00:01:23.060> part<00:01:23.300> because<00:01:23.420> you<00:01:24.260> can<00:01:24.410> act

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
was my favorite part because you can act

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.560 
was my favorite part because you can act
like<00:01:24.980> you're<00:01:25.310> there<00:01:25.610> and<00:01:25.940> you<00:01:26.090> can<00:01:26.240> look<00:01:26.450> out

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
like you're there and you can look out

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.600 
like you're there and you can look out
the<00:01:26.600> window<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:27.290> looked<00:01:27.500> at<00:01:27.740> my<00:01:28.310> great

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
the window and looked at my great

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.450 
the window and looked at my great
grandmother's<00:01:29.240> house<00:01:29.420> Henrietta<00:01:30.020> Lacks<00:01:30.460> the

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
grandmother's house Henrietta Lacks the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.150 
grandmother's house Henrietta Lacks the
HeLa<00:01:31.700> cells<00:01:32.120> they're<00:01:32.780> found<00:01:33.320> in<00:01:33.650> polio

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
HeLa cells they're found in polio

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.040 
HeLa cells they're found in polio
vaccines<00:01:34.730> well<00:01:34.910> basically<00:01:35.060> all<00:01:35.390> around<00:01:35.660> us

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
vaccines well basically all around us

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.250 
vaccines well basically all around us
now<00:01:36.260> I<00:01:37.330> thought<00:01:38.330> it<00:01:38.420> was<00:01:38.540> pretty<00:01:38.720> awesome

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
now I thought it was pretty awesome

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.190 
now I thought it was pretty awesome
I<00:01:39.940> think<00:01:40.940> about<00:01:41.120> both<00:01:41.330> my<00:01:41.510> grandma<00:01:41.930> and<00:01:42.140> my

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
I think about both my grandma and my

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.290 
I think about both my grandma and my
great-grandmother<00:01:42.770> because<00:01:43.610> my<00:01:43.850> grandma<00:01:44.180> was

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
great-grandmother because my grandma was

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.120 
great-grandmother because my grandma was
the<00:01:44.360> one<00:01:44.480> who<00:01:44.600> told<00:01:44.810> us<00:01:44.960> about<00:01:45.110> cells<00:01:45.560> but<00:01:45.890> I

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
the one who told us about cells but I

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.100 
the one who told us about cells but I
know<00:01:46.280> where<00:01:46.610> they<00:01:46.700> basically<00:01:47.090> came<00:01:47.420> from<00:01:47.660> when

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
know where they basically came from when

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.630 
know where they basically came from when
I<00:01:48.140> looked<00:01:48.530> at<00:01:48.710> those<00:01:48.860> cells<00:01:49.280> through<00:01:49.610> the

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
I looked at those cells through the

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.390 
I looked at those cells through the
microscope<00:01:50.390> it<00:01:50.690> was<00:01:51.170> amazing<00:01:51.770> because<00:01:51.890> such

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
microscope it was amazing because such

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.920 
microscope it was amazing because such
tiny<00:01:52.909> cells<00:01:53.570> could<00:01:54.470> cure<00:01:55.240> millions<00:01:56.240> of<00:01:56.480> people

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
tiny cells could cure millions of people

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.230 
tiny cells could cure millions of people
I<00:01:57.080> mean<00:01:57.290> the<00:01:57.470> entire<00:01:57.890> world<00:01:58.310> so<00:01:58.850> that<00:01:59.120> was

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
I mean the entire world so that was

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.820 
I mean the entire world so that was
important<00:01:59.750> for<00:01:59.810> our<00:01:59.900> families<00:02:00.530> to<00:02:00.650> know<00:02:00.800> that

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
important for our families to know that

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.130 
important for our families to know that
such<00:02:01.550> a<00:02:01.580> little<00:02:02.030> part<00:02:02.270> of<00:02:02.330> our<00:02:02.510> grandmother

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
such a little part of our grandmother

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.070 
such a little part of our grandmother
still<00:02:03.710> divides<00:02:04.460> and<00:02:05.210> it's<00:02:05.420> conquering<00:02:05.990> the

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
still divides and it's conquering the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:17.510 
still divides and it's conquering the
world

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.200 

Henrietta<00:02:18.520> Lacks<00:02:18.790> helped<00:02:19.270> a<00:02:19.450> lot<00:02:19.630> of<00:02:19.750> people
