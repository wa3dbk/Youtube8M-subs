00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
and out there in real life that are

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.050 
and out there in real life that are
certain<00:00:19.529> height<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.130> we<00:00:20.490> try<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.789> replicate

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
certain height and we try to replicate

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.080

use<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.910> do<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.390> measure<00:00:36.719> some<00:00:37.110> things<00:00:37.320> in

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
use this to do is measure some things in

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.770 
use this to do is measure some things in
my<00:00:37.590> layout<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.190> determine<00:00:38.940> whether<00:00:39.120> they're

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
my layout to determine whether they're

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.200 
my layout to determine whether they're
the<00:00:40.020> correct<00:00:40.200> height<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.860> real<00:00:41.070> life<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.610> one

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
the correct height in real life and one

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.119 
the correct height in real life and one
suspect<00:00:42.899> on<00:00:43.019> my<00:00:43.170> layout<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.589> I<00:00:43.679> know<00:00:43.739> for<00:00:44.070> a

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
suspect on my layout that I know for a

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.849 
suspect on my layout that I know for a
fact<00:00:44.219> isn't<00:00:45.149> right<00:00:45.329> are<00:00:45.629> these<00:00:46.050> windmills<00:00:46.409> so

00:00:46.849 --> 00:00:46.859 
fact isn't right are these windmills so

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:48.020 
fact isn't right are these windmills so
let's<00:00:47.039> go<00:00:47.159> ahead<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.460> take<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.579> look<00:00:47.819> at<00:00:47.909> these

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
let's go ahead and take a look at these

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.419 
let's go ahead and take a look at these
and<00:00:48.239> see<00:00:48.870> what<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:49.289> ruler<00:00:49.710> says<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.309> they

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:50.429 
and see what this ruler says that they

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:53.450 
and see what this ruler says that they
are<00:00:51.140> this<00:00:52.140> skill<00:00:52.440> ruler<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.769> just<00:00:52.980> simply<00:00:53.249> put

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
are this skill ruler you just simply put

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.180 
are this skill ruler you just simply put
it<00:00:53.489> up<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.819> the<00:00:53.909> structure<00:00:54.359> on<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.920> foot<00:00:55.920> side

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
it up to the structure on the foot side

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.139 
it up to the structure on the foot side
it'll<00:00:56.489> say<00:00:56.760> right<00:00:57.030> off<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.300> bat<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.809> these

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
it'll say right off the bat that these

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.569 
it'll say right off the bat that these
windmills<00:01:00.149> are<00:01:00.359> only<00:01:00.539> showing<00:01:00.989> up<00:01:01.579> maybe

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
windmills are only showing up maybe

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.200 
windmills are only showing up maybe
thirty<00:01:03.149> five<00:01:03.949> feet<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.550> you're<00:01:05.790> telling<00:01:06.180> me

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
thirty five feet so you're telling me

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.050 
thirty five feet so you're telling me
that<00:01:06.570> those<00:01:07.200> massive<00:01:08.040> windmills<00:01:08.640> out<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:09.000> the

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
that those massive windmills out in the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.240 
that those massive windmills out in the
wind<00:01:09.240> farms<00:01:09.600> are<00:01:09.780> shorter<00:01:10.740> than<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:11.010> truck

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
wind farms are shorter than a truck

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.590 
wind farms are shorter than a truck
trailer<00:01:11.610> standing<00:01:11.940> up<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.299> ends<00:01:12.510> a

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
trailer standing up on the ends a

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.600 
trailer standing up on the ends a
53-foot<00:01:13.229> truck<00:01:13.500> trailer<00:01:13.800> I<00:01:13.980> don't<00:01:14.250> think<00:01:14.460> so

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
53-foot truck trailer I don't think so

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.410 
53-foot truck trailer I don't think so
Tim<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.480> what<00:01:15.750> we're<00:01:15.900> going<00:01:16.050> to<00:01:16.080> do<00:01:16.320> is

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
Tim so what we're going to do is

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.440 
Tim so what we're going to do is
actually<00:01:18.420> try<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.050> find<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:20.450> realistic

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
actually try to find a realistic

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.470 
actually try to find a realistic
windmill<00:01:21.870> and<00:01:22.140> that's<00:01:22.380> going<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.800> take<00:01:23.010> us<00:01:23.160> out

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.480 
windmill and that's going to take us out

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.800 
windmill and that's going to take us out
on<00:01:24.480> a<00:01:25.080> search<00:01:25.470> for<00:01:25.800> a<00:01:25.830> realistic<00:01:26.370> height<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:27.180> web

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
on a search for a realistic height a web

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.570 
on a search for a realistic height a web
search<00:01:28.110> maybe<00:01:28.530> going<00:01:28.860> out<00:01:28.980> and<00:01:29.130> checking<00:01:29.370> it

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
search maybe going out and checking it

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:41.440 
search maybe going out and checking it
out<00:01:29.670> for<00:01:29.880> ourselves

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.149 

well<00:01:42.110> we're<00:01:42.320> out<00:01:42.470> here<00:01:42.619> in<00:01:42.680> the<00:01:42.770> middle<00:01:43.040> of

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
well we're out here in the middle of

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.249 
well we're out here in the middle of
Iowa<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:43.850> whenever<00:01:44.330> you<00:01:44.630> want<00:01:44.659> to<00:01:44.930> model

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
Iowa and whenever you want to model

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.020 
Iowa and whenever you want to model
something<00:01:45.500> accurately<00:01:46.159> sometimes<00:01:46.580> it's<00:01:46.850> good

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
something accurately sometimes it's good

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.999 
something accurately sometimes it's good
to<00:01:47.060> go<00:01:47.330> check<00:01:47.570> it<00:01:47.720> out<00:01:47.810> for<00:01:47.869> yourself<00:01:48.350> so<00:01:48.830> we're

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
to go check it out for yourself so we're

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.830 
to go check it out for yourself so we're
out<00:01:49.159> here<00:01:49.400> over<00:01:49.700> an<00:01:49.820> hour<00:01:49.909> away<00:01:50.180> from<00:01:50.450> where<00:01:50.689> I

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
out here over an hour away from where I

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.080 
out here over an hour away from where I
live<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.680> go<00:01:51.830> look<00:01:52.040> at<00:01:52.159> these<00:01:52.220> massive<00:01:52.820> wind

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
live to go look at these massive wind

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.850 
live to go look at these massive wind
turbines<00:01:53.479> look<00:01:53.810> up<00:01:53.930> the<00:01:54.080> shaft<00:01:54.320> of<00:01:54.530> this<00:01:54.619> thing

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
turbines look up the shaft of this thing

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.029 
turbines look up the shaft of this thing
it<00:01:55.159> is<00:01:55.460> absolutely<00:01:56.000> huge<00:01:56.119> over<00:01:56.930> 250<00:01:57.590> feet<00:01:57.619> tall

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
it is absolutely huge over 250 feet tall

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:01.359 
it is absolutely huge over 250 feet tall
and<00:01:58.399> to<00:01:59.180> model<00:01:59.840> that<00:02:00.020> correctly<00:02:00.590> we'll<00:02:01.039> do<00:02:01.250> the

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
and to model that correctly we'll do the

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.139 
and to model that correctly we'll do the
math<00:02:01.610> and<00:02:01.940> see<00:02:02.720> what<00:02:03.110> size<00:02:03.680> of<00:02:04.340> wind<00:02:04.729> turbine

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
math and see what size of wind turbine

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.800 
math and see what size of wind turbine
we<00:02:05.330> need<00:02:05.570> on<00:02:05.810> our<00:02:05.840> HOCl<00:02:06.799> layout<00:02:07.250> now<00:02:08.090> there's<00:02:08.720> a

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
we need on our HOCl layout now there's a

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.660 
we need on our HOCl layout now there's a
math<00:02:09.019> equation<00:02:09.350> we're<00:02:09.679> gonna<00:02:09.769> go<00:02:09.979> over<00:02:10.160> to<00:02:10.310> do

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
math equation we're gonna go over to do

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.670 
math equation we're gonna go over to do
that<00:02:10.880> and<00:02:11.269> sometimes<00:02:11.900> you<00:02:12.050> may<00:02:12.230> not<00:02:12.380> be<00:02:12.530> able

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
that and sometimes you may not be able

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.910 
that and sometimes you may not be able
to<00:02:12.769> find<00:02:13.099> accurate<00:02:14.170> representations<00:02:15.170> in

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
to find accurate representations in

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.530 
to find accurate representations in
model<00:02:16.340> form<00:02:16.610> so<00:02:16.819> you<00:02:16.910> have<00:02:17.030> to<00:02:17.150> either<00:02:17.239> kit

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
model form so you have to either kit

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.330 
model form so you have to either kit
bash<00:02:17.750> or<00:02:18.050> come<00:02:18.200> as<00:02:18.350> close<00:02:18.560> as<00:02:18.739> you<00:02:18.830> can<00:02:19.069> and

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
bash or come as close as you can and

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.780 
bash or come as close as you can and
we'll<00:02:20.090> be<00:02:20.209> talking<00:02:20.420> about<00:02:20.630> that<00:02:20.900> as<00:02:21.080> well<00:02:21.790> this

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
we'll be talking about that as well this

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.699 
we'll be talking about that as well this
is<00:02:23.000> a<00:02:23.030> wind<00:02:23.299> turbine<00:02:23.660> quick<00:02:24.049> facts<00:02:24.380> sheet

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
is a wind turbine quick facts sheet

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.410 
is a wind turbine quick facts sheet
which<00:02:24.980> basically<00:02:25.370> goes<00:02:25.700> over<00:02:26.030> some<00:02:26.209> of<00:02:26.330> the

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
which basically goes over some of the

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.600 
which basically goes over some of the
details<00:02:26.840> part<00:02:27.620> of<00:02:27.739> your<00:02:27.830> research<00:02:27.980> should

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
details part of your research should

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.370 
details part of your research should
include<00:02:29.000> getting<00:02:29.360> some<00:02:29.540> information<00:02:29.690> about

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
include getting some information about

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.050 
include getting some information about
what<00:02:30.500> you're<00:02:30.620> trying<00:02:30.830> to<00:02:30.920> model<00:02:31.100> now<00:02:31.910> this

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
what you're trying to model now this

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.140 
what you're trying to model now this
wind<00:02:32.269> turbine<00:02:32.630> from<00:02:32.870> ground<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.470> hub<00:02:33.680> is<00:02:34.150> 263

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
wind turbine from ground to hub is 263

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.800 
wind turbine from ground to hub is 263
feet<00:02:35.480> tall<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:36.230> then<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:36.980> blades<00:02:37.280> are<00:02:37.549> each

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
feet tall and then the blades are each

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.770 
feet tall and then the blades are each
126<00:02:38.810> feet<00:02:39.019> so<00:02:39.650> if<00:02:39.739> you<00:02:39.799> add<00:02:40.010> that<00:02:40.160> up<00:02:40.310> that's

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
126 feet so if you add that up that's

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.690 
126 feet so if you add that up that's
389<00:02:41.780> feet<00:02:42.290> that<00:02:42.500> it<00:02:42.620> could<00:02:42.739> be<00:02:42.920> in<00:02:43.130> height<00:02:43.370> if

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
389 feet that it could be in height if

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.360 
389 feet that it could be in height if
that<00:02:44.030> blades<00:02:44.299> point<00:02:44.569> it<00:02:44.660> straight<00:02:44.989> up<00:02:45.100> so<00:02:46.100> that

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
that blades point it straight up so that

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.490 
that blades point it straight up so that
is<00:02:46.519> just<00:02:46.670> some<00:02:46.940> basic<00:02:47.480> information<00:02:48.230> on<00:02:48.320> these

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
is just some basic information on these

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.880 
is just some basic information on these
wind<00:02:48.739> turbines<00:02:49.100> and<00:02:49.780> also<00:02:50.780> another<00:02:51.230> thing<00:02:51.350> is

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
wind turbines and also another thing is

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.400 
wind turbines and also another thing is
you've<00:02:52.430> got<00:02:52.459> to<00:02:52.670> convert<00:02:53.209> that<00:02:53.390> down<00:02:53.600> to<00:02:53.750> HOCl

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
you've got to convert that down to HOCl

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.410 
you've got to convert that down to HOCl
and<00:02:54.709> I'll<00:02:55.040> show<00:02:55.250> you<00:02:55.280> how<00:02:55.489> to<00:02:55.549> do<00:02:55.730> that<00:02:55.910> okay

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
and I'll show you how to do that okay

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.330 
and I'll show you how to do that okay
guys<00:02:56.690> here<00:02:57.109> comes<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.500> part<00:02:57.709> that's<00:02:57.950> not<00:02:58.010> so

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
guys here comes the part that's not so

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.680 
guys here comes the part that's not so
fun<00:02:58.609> but<00:02:58.820> it's<00:02:58.940> really<00:02:59.000> not<00:02:59.239> that<00:02:59.299> bad<00:02:59.630> and

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
fun but it's really not that bad and

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.569 
fun but it's really not that bad and
that's<00:02:59.959> the<00:03:00.109> math<00:03:00.350> anytime<00:03:01.220> you've<00:03:01.400> got<00:03:01.430> a

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
that's the math anytime you've got a

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.099 
that's the math anytime you've got a
structure<00:03:01.970> and<00:03:02.209> you<00:03:02.269> want<00:03:02.450> to<00:03:02.540> size<00:03:02.750> it<00:03:02.989> down

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
structure and you want to size it down

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:04.030 
structure and you want to size it down
to<00:03:03.260> HR<00:03:03.590> skill

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
to HR skill

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.069 
to HR skill
you<00:03:04.310> gotta<00:03:04.489> get<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.790> height<00:03:04.970> well<00:03:05.690> we've<00:03:05.840> got

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
you gotta get the height well we've got

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.940 
you gotta get the height well we've got
389<00:03:07.070> feet<00:03:07.549> like<00:03:07.850> I<00:03:08.000> said<00:03:08.239> on<00:03:08.780> these<00:03:09.140> wind

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
389 feet like I said on these wind

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.860 
389 feet like I said on these wind
turbines<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:10.700> what<00:03:10.850> we<00:03:11.000> want<00:03:11.180> to<00:03:11.299> do<00:03:11.510> is

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
turbines and what we want to do is

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.449 
turbines and what we want to do is
divide<00:03:12.320> that<00:03:12.650> by<00:03:13.130> 87<00:03:14.230> 87<00:03:15.230> comes<00:03:15.680> from<00:03:16.010> a<00:03:16.250> Cho

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
divide that by 87 87 comes from a Cho

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.449 
divide that by 87 87 comes from a Cho
scalloping<00:03:16.940> 187th<00:03:17.810> for<00:03:18.380> you<00:03:18.470> in<00:03:18.680> scalars<00:03:19.250> or

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
scalloping 187th for you in scalars or

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.640 
scalloping 187th for you in scalars or
Oh<00:03:19.519> scalars<00:03:20.180> or<00:03:20.299> G<00:03:20.480> scalars<00:03:20.930> you're<00:03:21.560> gonna

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
Oh scalars or G scalars you're gonna

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.270 
Oh scalars or G scalars you're gonna
have<00:03:21.920> to<00:03:22.070> find<00:03:22.310> out<00:03:22.549> what<00:03:22.820> your<00:03:23.000> scale<00:03:23.299> is<00:03:23.329> and

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
have to find out what your scale is and

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.680 
have to find out what your scale is and
divide<00:03:25.280> it<00:03:25.430> by<00:03:25.459> that<00:03:25.700> bottom<00:03:26.090> number<00:03:26.420> of<00:03:26.540> that

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
divide it by that bottom number of that

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.030 
divide it by that bottom number of that
scale<00:03:27.049> so<00:03:27.739> 389<00:03:28.700> /<00:03:29.359> 87<00:03:29.810> comes<00:03:30.290> out<00:03:30.440> to<00:03:30.680> four

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
scale so 389 / 87 comes out to four

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.960 
scale so 389 / 87 comes out to four
point<00:03:31.640> four<00:03:31.940> seven<00:03:32.269> one<00:03:32.690> two<00:03:32.720> six<00:03:33.290> four<00:03:33.739> three

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
point four seven one two six four three

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.250 
point four seven one two six four three
blah<00:03:34.970> blah<00:03:35.209> blah<00:03:35.390> blah<00:03:35.450> blah<00:03:35.720> and<00:03:35.989> we're<00:03:36.170> not

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
blah blah blah blah blah and we're not

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.660 
blah blah blah blah blah and we're not
gonna<00:03:36.470> need<00:03:36.620> to<00:03:36.739> go<00:03:36.859> any<00:03:37.010> further<00:03:37.220> because

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
gonna need to go any further because

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.300 
gonna need to go any further because
that's<00:03:38.480> basically<00:03:38.660> four<00:03:39.590> and<00:03:39.709> a<00:03:39.739> half<00:03:39.769> feet

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
that's basically four and a half feet

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.020 
that's basically four and a half feet
this<00:03:41.299> is<00:03:41.510> feet<00:03:41.780> and<00:03:42.260> so<00:03:42.650> is<00:03:42.799> this<00:03:42.980> now<00:03:43.819> that's

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
this is feet and so is this now that's

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.240 
this is feet and so is this now that's
huge<00:03:44.359> on<00:03:44.690> an<00:03:44.780> HOCl<00:03:45.319> layout<00:03:45.650> four<00:03:46.010> and<00:03:46.190> a<00:03:46.220> half

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
huge on an HOCl layout four and a half

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.400 
huge on an HOCl layout four and a half
feet<00:03:46.670> that's<00:03:47.359> like<00:03:47.600> a<00:03:47.810> pretty<00:03:48.019> good<00:03:48.200> sized

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
feet that's like a pretty good sized

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.320 
feet that's like a pretty good sized
midget<00:03:48.859> so<00:03:49.370> what<00:03:49.549> you're<00:03:49.700> gonna<00:03:49.790> want<00:03:50.060> to<00:03:50.150> do

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
midget so what you're gonna want to do

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.030 
midget so what you're gonna want to do
is<00:03:50.659> maybe<00:03:51.470> find<00:03:51.920> something<00:03:52.340> a<00:03:52.400> little<00:03:52.430> more

so<00:03:55.560> it<00:03:55.650> doesn't<00:03:55.920> look<00:03:56.040> ridiculous<00:03:56.610> and<00:03:56.879> I've

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
so it doesn't look ridiculous and I've

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.149 
so it doesn't look ridiculous and I've
got<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.659> perfect<00:03:57.840> so<00:03:58.140> you<00:03:58.469> saw<00:03:58.680> absolutely

00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 
got the perfect so you saw absolutely

things<00:04:11.790> just<00:04:12.060> won't<00:04:12.239> cut<00:04:12.510> it<00:04:12.540> so<00:04:12.989> what<00:04:13.140> I<00:04:13.170> had

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:13.409 
things just won't cut it so what I had

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:15.890 
things just won't cut it so what I had
to<00:04:13.530> do<00:04:13.709> was<00:04:14.129> go<00:04:14.310> up<00:04:14.340> a<00:04:14.640> scale<00:04:14.939> so<00:04:15.450> I<00:04:15.480> went<00:04:15.780> to<00:04:15.870> Oh

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
to do was go up a scale so I went to Oh

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.140 
to do was go up a scale so I went to Oh
scale<00:04:16.380> and<00:04:16.620> I<00:04:16.680> found<00:04:16.919> Lionel<00:04:17.430> made<00:04:17.699> these<00:04:17.850> wind

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
scale and I found Lionel made these wind

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.029 
scale and I found Lionel made these wind
turbines<00:04:18.539> they're<00:04:19.139> run<00:04:19.320> about<00:04:19.500> seventy-five

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
turbines they're run about seventy-five

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:21.770 
turbines they're run about seventy-five
bucks<00:04:20.250> a<00:04:20.430> pop<00:04:20.639> and<00:04:20.970> a<00:04:21.000> cool<00:04:21.239> thing<00:04:21.419> is<00:04:21.600> they

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
bucks a pop and a cool thing is they

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.930 
bucks a pop and a cool thing is they
they<00:04:22.169> actually<00:04:22.530> turn<00:04:22.830> now<00:04:23.550> I'm<00:04:23.669> still<00:04:23.820> gonna

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
they actually turn now I'm still gonna

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.370 
they actually turn now I'm still gonna
get<00:04:24.090> them<00:04:24.210> positioned<00:04:24.389> perfectly<00:04:24.960> on<00:04:25.320> my

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
get them positioned perfectly on my

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.850 
get them positioned perfectly on my
layout<00:04:25.830> and<00:04:26.099> fastened<00:04:26.940> down<00:04:27.060> but<00:04:27.990> yes<00:04:28.530> they<00:04:28.800> do

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
layout and fastened down but yes they do

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.310 
layout and fastened down but yes they do
look<00:04:29.190> massive<00:04:29.849> compared<00:04:30.330> to<00:04:30.389> the<00:04:30.509> layout<00:04:30.840> but

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
look massive compared to the layout but

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.370 
look massive compared to the layout but
like<00:04:31.590> I<00:04:31.770> said<00:04:31.830> the<00:04:32.580> actual<00:04:33.240> real-life<00:04:33.750> wind

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
like I said the actual real-life wind

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.950 
like I said the actual real-life wind
turbines<00:04:34.800> are<00:04:35.070> massive<00:04:36.030> the<00:04:36.419> only<00:04:36.630> thing<00:04:36.810> that

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
turbines are massive the only thing that

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.100 
turbines are massive the only thing that
is<00:04:37.110> slightly<00:04:38.300> detectable<00:04:39.300> is<00:04:39.449> the<00:04:39.599> large<00:04:39.810> base

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
is slightly detectable is the large base

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.659 
is slightly detectable is the large base
which<00:04:40.470> I'm<00:04:40.620> going<00:04:40.770> to<00:04:40.860> try<00:04:41.009> to<00:04:41.070> make<00:04:41.400> an<00:04:41.580> effort

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
which I'm going to try to make an effort

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.909 
which I'm going to try to make an effort
to<00:04:42.030> cover<00:04:42.210> up<00:04:42.539> or<00:04:42.750> something<00:04:43.080> but<00:04:43.560> other<00:04:43.680> than

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
to cover up or something but other than

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.790 
to cover up or something but other than
that<00:04:44.070> it<00:04:44.190> looks<00:04:44.220> really<00:04:44.550> good<00:04:44.880> it's<00:04:45.539> large<00:04:45.960> it

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
that it looks really good it's large it

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.339 
that it looks really good it's large it
kind<00:04:47.070> of<00:04:47.130> accurately<00:04:47.639> represents<00:04:48.330> and<00:04:48.599> now<00:04:48.900> if

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:49.349 
kind of accurately represents and now if

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:52.189 
kind of accurately represents and now if
we<00:04:49.530> take<00:04:49.710> our<00:04:49.949> scale<00:04:50.250> ruler<00:04:50.699> up<00:04:51.210> to<00:04:51.449> this<00:04:51.630> it's

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
we take our scale ruler up to this it's

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:56.240 
we take our scale ruler up to this it's
over<00:04:52.440> a<00:04:52.560> hundred<00:04:53.039> feet<00:04:53.310> tall<00:04:54.090> so<00:04:54.949> that's<00:04:55.949> way

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
over a hundred feet tall so that's way

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.409 
over a hundred feet tall so that's way
better<00:04:56.460> than<00:04:56.970> this

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
better than this

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.070 
better than this
35<00:04:58.289> foot<00:04:58.650> tall<00:04:59.550> wind<00:05:00.210> turbine<00:05:00.570> we<00:05:00.720> had<00:05:00.930> before

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
35 foot tall wind turbine we had before

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.740 
35 foot tall wind turbine we had before
still<00:05:02.039> not<00:05:02.250> quite<00:05:02.430> accurate<00:05:02.729> but<00:05:03.210> as<00:05:03.330> close<00:05:03.570> as

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
still not quite accurate but as close as

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.779 
still not quite accurate but as close as
we<00:05:03.870> can<00:05:04.050> get<00:05:04.229> sometimes<00:05:04.770> you<00:05:05.130> have<00:05:05.400> to<00:05:05.550> settle

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:05.789 
we can get sometimes you have to settle

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:08.990 
we can get sometimes you have to settle
for<00:05:05.909> what<00:05:06.389> you<00:05:07.229> can<00:05:07.440> get<00:05:07.620> the<00:05:07.740> closest<00:05:08.310> to<00:05:08.849> the

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
for what you can get the closest to the

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.629 
for what you can get the closest to the
actual<00:05:09.389> item<00:05:09.870> is<00:05:10.110> make<00:05:10.740> it<00:05:10.860> look<00:05:10.919> as<00:05:11.190> close<00:05:11.400> as

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 
actual item is make it look as close as

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:13.730 
actual item is make it look as close as
possible<00:05:11.669> and<00:05:12.330> really<00:05:13.080> like<00:05:13.380> I've<00:05:13.560> said

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
possible and really like I've said

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.339 
possible and really like I've said
before<00:05:13.889> it's<00:05:14.280> your<00:05:14.460> layout<00:05:14.930> satisfy<00:05:15.930> yourself

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:16.349 
before it's your layout satisfy yourself

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:17.750 
before it's your layout satisfy yourself
some<00:05:16.770> people<00:05:16.979> were<00:05:17.070> going<00:05:17.190> to<00:05:17.250> say<00:05:17.370> this<00:05:17.520> looks

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
some people were going to say this looks

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.029 
some people were going to say this looks
absolutely<00:05:18.000> ridiculous<00:05:18.570> way<00:05:18.930> too<00:05:18.990> huge<00:05:19.500> but<00:05:20.010> a

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 
absolutely ridiculous way too huge but a

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:21.230 
absolutely ridiculous way too huge but a
lot<00:05:20.220> of<00:05:20.250> those<00:05:20.370> people<00:05:20.550> haven't<00:05:20.940> been<00:05:21.060> out<00:05:21.210> to

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
lot of those people haven't been out to

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.270 
lot of those people haven't been out to
the<00:05:21.419> wind<00:05:21.599> turbines<00:05:21.930> like<00:05:22.169> I<00:05:22.320> showed<00:05:22.500> you<00:05:22.680> to

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
the wind turbines like I showed you to

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.460 
the wind turbines like I showed you to
see<00:05:23.550> how<00:05:24.120> large<00:05:24.360> that<00:05:24.900> was<00:05:24.990> actually<00:05:25.320> are

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
see how large that was actually are

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.360 
see how large that was actually are
thanks<00:05:26.220> for<00:05:26.340> watching<00:05:26.669> see<00:05:26.940> you<00:05:27.000> next<00:05:27.240> time
