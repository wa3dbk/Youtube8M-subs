use for the valve and that is incoming

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.600 
use for the valve and that is incoming
water<00:00:17.080> so<00:00:18.080> you<00:00:18.169> can<00:00:18.380> use<00:00:18.529> incoming<00:00:19.070> water<00:00:19.310> to

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:19.610 
water so you can use incoming water to

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.100 
water so you can use incoming water to
in<00:00:19.849> in<00:00:20.360> this<00:00:20.630> case<00:00:20.840> I'll<00:00:21.110> be<00:00:21.169> flushing<00:00:21.529> the

engage and here we go you can see right
here<00:00:48.710> we<00:00:49.400> have<00:00:49.430> a<00:00:49.610> valve<00:00:51.100> plumbed<00:00:52.100> into<00:00:52.309> the

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:53.799 
here we have a valve plumbed into the

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:58.570 
here we have a valve plumbed into the
cooling<00:00:54.799> system<00:00:55.190> on<00:00:55.400> my<00:00:56.920> Mercruiser<00:00:57.920> on<00:00:58.430> my

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 
cooling system on my Mercruiser on my

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.600 
cooling system on my Mercruiser on my
dive<00:00:58.729> boat<00:00:58.970> here<00:00:59.239> and<00:00:59.449> so<00:01:00.290> we<00:01:00.890> can<00:01:01.070> use<00:01:01.100> this

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
dive boat here and so we can use this

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.780 
dive boat here and so we can use this
valve<00:01:01.939> as<00:01:02.260> incoming<00:01:03.260> water<00:01:03.619> as<00:01:03.890> well<00:01:04.460> as<00:01:04.640> we

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
valve as incoming water as well as we

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.640 
valve as incoming water as well as we
used<00:01:05.030> over<00:01:05.180> there<00:01:05.420> as<00:01:05.659> outgoing<00:01:05.930> water<00:01:06.409> the

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
used over there as outgoing water the

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.520 
used over there as outgoing water the
only<00:01:06.770> difference<00:01:07.250> is<00:01:07.460> we<00:01:08.060> have<00:01:08.270> taken<00:01:08.780> this

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
only difference is we have taken this

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.280 
only difference is we have taken this
valve<00:01:10.189> and<00:01:10.430> taken<00:01:10.850> out<00:01:10.970> the<00:01:11.119> check<00:01:11.360> valve<00:01:11.390> now

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
valve and taken out the check valve now

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.109 
valve and taken out the check valve now
for<00:01:12.619> convenience<00:01:12.860> I<00:01:13.369> don't<00:01:13.549> have<00:01:13.700> it<00:01:13.820> on<00:01:13.880> this

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
for convenience I don't have it on this

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.319 
for convenience I don't have it on this
hose<00:01:14.359> but<00:01:15.079> we<00:01:15.590> can<00:01:15.890> put<00:01:16.219> a<00:01:16.399> small<00:01:16.759> ball<00:01:17.060> valve

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:17.329 
hose but we can put a small ball valve

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:18.880 
hose but we can put a small ball valve
right<00:01:17.539> here<00:01:17.780> so<00:01:17.990> you've<00:01:18.109> got<00:01:18.259> to<00:01:18.350> turn<00:01:18.590> it<00:01:18.770> on

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
right here so you've got to turn it on

and on so what we're going to do is we

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.830 
and on so what we're going to do is we
plumb<00:01:21.259> this<00:01:21.950> deck<00:01:22.219> wash<00:01:22.490> valve<00:01:22.789> here<00:01:23.119> right

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
plumb this deck wash valve here right

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.380 
plumb this deck wash valve here right
into<00:01:24.259> the<00:01:26.200> cooling<00:01:27.200> system<00:01:27.560> on<00:01:27.909> my<00:01:28.909> boat<00:01:29.179> and

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
into the cooling system on my boat and

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.810 
into the cooling system on my boat and
it's<00:01:29.570> we're<00:01:29.749> going<00:01:29.869> to<00:01:29.960> use<00:01:30.140> it<00:01:30.320> to<00:01:31.219> flush<00:01:31.609> out

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
it's we're going to use it to flush out

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.819 
it's we're going to use it to flush out
the<00:01:33.039> upper<00:01:34.039> risers<00:01:34.429> and<00:01:34.700> also<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:36.109> lower<00:01:36.530> end

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
the upper risers and also the lower end

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.620 
the upper risers and also the lower end
of<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:36.979> engine<00:01:37.340> this<00:01:37.579> is<00:01:37.729> how<00:01:37.850> easy<00:01:38.119> this<00:01:38.390> one

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
of the engine this is how easy this one

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.490 
of the engine this is how easy this one
is<00:01:38.840> to<00:01:39.109> engage<00:01:40.179> into<00:01:41.179> both<00:01:42.049> just<00:01:42.409> like<00:01:42.619> that

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
is to engage into both just like that

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.570 
is to engage into both just like that
now<00:01:43.590> water<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.310> flowing<00:01:44.580> and<00:01:45.410> flushing<00:01:46.410> out

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
now water is flowing and flushing out

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.120 
now water is flowing and flushing out
the<00:01:47.580> boat<00:01:47.760> so<00:01:48.330> you're<00:01:48.480> flushing<00:01:48.810> out<00:01:49.080> all<00:01:49.620> the

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
the boat so you're flushing out all the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.190 
the boat so you're flushing out all the
salt<00:01:50.400> water<00:01:50.580> cooling<00:01:51.120> well<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.930> boat<00:01:52.080> was

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
salt water cooling well the boat was

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.060 
salt water cooling well the boat was
being<00:01:52.380> used<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.190> you<00:01:53.310> can<00:01:53.460> run<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.930> so<00:01:55.070> the

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
being used and you can run that so the

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.610 
being used and you can run that so the
only<00:01:56.970> thing<00:01:57.270> you're<00:01:57.390> flushing<00:01:57.690> out<00:01:57.990> down<00:01:58.229> here

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
only thing you're flushing out down here

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.280 
only thing you're flushing out down here
is<00:01:58.830> is<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.580> lower<00:01:59.760> in<00:02:00.090> here<00:02:00.720> you're<00:02:01.020> flushing

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
is is the lower in here you're flushing

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.030 
is is the lower in here you're flushing
from<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.740> very<00:02:01.979> top<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:03.619> don't<00:02:04.619> even<00:02:04.800> have<00:02:04.920> to

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
from the very top and don't even have to

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.350 
from the very top and don't even have to
have<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.190> engine<00:02:05.880> running

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
have the engine running

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.160 
have the engine running
and<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:07.020> can<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.530> course<00:02:07.860> run<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.759> engine<00:02:09.179> off

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
and you can of course run the engine off

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.390 
and you can of course run the engine off
like<00:02:10.500> this<00:02:10.709> as<00:02:10.920> well

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
like this as well

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.730 
like this as well
