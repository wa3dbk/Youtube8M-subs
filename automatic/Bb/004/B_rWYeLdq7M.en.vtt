00:00:00.558 --> 00:00:01.922
(cork pops)
- Boo-boo!

00:00:01.922 --> 00:00:03.574
(upbeat jazz)

00:00:03.574 --> 00:00:04.313
Hello!

00:00:06.373 --> 00:00:08.427
Oh no, somebody already was here before.

00:00:08.427 --> 00:00:10.595
Hey, guys... cheers!

00:00:10.595 --> 00:00:12.072
Get it? It's a toast.

00:00:12.072 --> 00:00:13.406
C'mon, guys, it's been four years.

00:00:13.406 --> 00:00:15.724
Four years of hellos and no goodbyes.

00:00:18.484 --> 00:00:19.685
This week on My Drunk Kitchen

00:00:19.685 --> 00:00:22.927
♫ we're making burrata and bruschetta! ♫

00:00:22.927 --> 00:00:25.831
Welcome to My Drunk Romantic Kitchen.

00:00:25.831 --> 00:00:27.210
Love is based off magic.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.333
It takes a lot of skill
and a lot of forethought.

00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.804
Just like burrata!

00:00:31.804 --> 00:00:33.342
Is what I'm-- ahh!

00:00:33.342 --> 00:00:36.252
Literally a fly just
jumped inside my drink.

00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:38.184
I can taste it.

00:00:38.184 --> 00:00:39.245
There's only one choice!

00:00:39.245 --> 00:00:40.689
Now I have to drink from the bottle.

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:42.565
The first step in making your burrata

00:00:42.565 --> 00:00:44.154
brusch-ketta mash-ter-peesh

00:00:44.154 --> 00:00:46.718
is to take your bread, slice
it into one-inch thick pieces,

00:00:46.718 --> 00:00:48.900
drizzle it with olive oil,
and stick it in the oven.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.296
Pyon! Romance.

00:00:51.296 --> 00:00:53.444
This is how I get all the ladies.

00:00:55.184 --> 00:00:56.992
Let's not get a-bread of ourselves.

00:00:57.592 --> 00:01:00.221
This is the only upper-body
workout I ever get.

00:01:00.221 --> 00:01:01.446
Take your one-inch slices

00:01:01.446 --> 00:01:03.015
and lightly drizzle them with olive oil!

00:01:03.015 --> 00:01:04.184
♫ Drizzle, drizzle, drizzle ♫

00:01:04.184 --> 00:01:05.870
Drizzle lightly, lightly.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.112
Now place it under your broiler

00:01:07.112 --> 00:01:10.087
and really, really,
really try and remember.

00:01:10.087 --> 00:01:11.222
In fact, maybe set a timer!

00:01:11.222 --> 00:01:13.414
Oh my god! Have we never used the timer?

00:01:13.414 --> 00:01:14.258
Woohoo!

00:01:14.258 --> 00:01:15.669
Have you thought about getting a massage?

00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:17.049
You look a little wound up.

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:21.287
Mmm...

00:01:21.517 --> 00:01:22.919
I forgot about the fly!

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:25.002
Now you're gonna be making
the tomato-y goodness

00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:26.910
that goes on top of your bru-sketta.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.838
I don't know if that's
how you pronounce it

00:01:28.838 --> 00:01:30.966
so just bear with me, guys.

00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:32.965
While your bread...

00:01:32.965 --> 00:01:34.295
broasts?

00:01:34.295 --> 00:01:35.561
Broils? Toasts?

00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:37.117
While you're bread... cooks?

00:01:37.727 --> 00:01:39.586
While you're waiting for
your bread to be done

00:01:39.586 --> 00:01:41.500
go ahead and chop up all
your other ingredients

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.941
and saute them over this pan!

00:01:42.941 --> 00:01:44.693
Your other ingredients include

00:01:44.693 --> 00:01:46.239
three diced tomatoes.

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:48.867
I hope I get a six!

00:01:49.857 --> 00:01:51.325
Just kidding, that's not dicing.

00:01:51.325 --> 00:01:52.940
If you're nervous about dicing tomatoes

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.759
it probably means that you
should stop dicing them

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.631
because if you, like me, close
your eyes when you're nervous

00:01:57.631 --> 00:01:59.539
that's not a combination you wanna do.

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:04.526
Ooo! Yes!

00:02:04.526 --> 00:02:06.358
Garlic!

00:02:06.358 --> 00:02:08.282
Tomatoes!

00:02:08.282 --> 00:02:10.149
Mmm... mmm!

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.146
Forgive me. How rude!

00:02:13.532 --> 00:02:14.944
Salt and pepper!

00:02:14.944 --> 00:02:16.325
Pew, pew, pew!

00:02:16.325 --> 00:02:18.482
I think My Drunk Kitchen
sounds like a fun video game

00:02:18.482 --> 00:02:20.713
and that at the end of the
video game you get to eat.

00:02:20.713 --> 00:02:23.079
Pjoom! Pjoom! Pjoom!

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:24.326
(smooth piano)
This saute reminds me

00:02:24.326 --> 00:02:25.965
a lot of love itself.

00:02:26.625 --> 00:02:28.099
(upbeat music)
I think if you fundamentally

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.690
love the elements, you're gonna enjoy it

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.044
no matter what way it's presented.

00:02:31.044 --> 00:02:32.243
Do I love garlic? Yeah.

00:02:32.243 --> 00:02:33.385
Do I love tomato? Yeah.

00:02:33.385 --> 00:02:36.578
Do I fucking love some burrata?

00:02:36.578 --> 00:02:40.155
I mean, who was the genius that
decided to stuff mozzarella

00:02:40.155 --> 00:02:42.449
with a heavier, creamier cheese?

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:44.848
Jesus Christ. Yes!

00:02:44.848 --> 00:02:46.929
Speaking of love, let's add the cheese!

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:47.989
Hello.

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.038
(groaning)

00:02:49.038 --> 00:02:52.200
Oh my god, like the
testes of a young bull!

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.744
(laughing)
Oh wow!

00:02:56.744 --> 00:03:00.148
♫ And I'm here to remind you ♫

00:03:00.148 --> 00:03:02.141
blah blah blah, long song...

00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:05.156
♫ bu-bu-burrata know! ♫

00:03:05.156 --> 00:03:07.083
Does anybody remember Alanis Morissette?

00:03:07.083 --> 00:03:08.103
Burrata know.

00:03:08.103 --> 00:03:10.886
♫ I just wanna put it in my mouth ♫

00:03:10.886 --> 00:03:12.314
Who's stopping me?

00:03:12.314 --> 00:03:13.766
Only myself.

00:03:15.456 --> 00:03:16.676
Oh my god...

00:03:17.236 --> 00:03:18.822
Done? Done!

00:03:18.822 --> 00:03:20.935
(deep voice)
It's gonna be good this time!

00:03:20.935 --> 00:03:22.278
It's gonna be good!

00:03:23.098 --> 00:03:24.288
Now that you've plated your cheese

00:03:24.288 --> 00:03:25.764
take your bread out of the oven,

00:03:25.764 --> 00:03:28.915
put it on the plate, and
add your tomato stuff.

00:03:29.665 --> 00:03:30.730
Buddy!

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.639
Hello!

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:33.226
Watch out for your face!

00:03:34.606 --> 00:03:37.281
Ooo, ooo!

00:03:37.681 --> 00:03:39.120
This is another one of those things

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.189
just like eggs Benedict, that
now that I've made it at home

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:44.555
I'm gonna eat this all the time!

00:03:45.505 --> 00:03:47.924
Now take your perfectly-sauteed stuff

00:03:47.924 --> 00:03:49.940
and add it on top of the other stuff.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.430
Just add all of it actually.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.162
(whispering)
Yes, God, yes!

00:03:53.162 --> 00:03:55.772
Take some fresh basil and
then put your face in it.

00:03:55.772 --> 00:03:56.942
(sniffs)

00:03:56.942 --> 00:03:59.127
Take your basil, chop
it up with your hands.

00:03:59.127 --> 00:04:01.151
That's how you show cooking confidence.

00:04:01.151 --> 00:04:03.729
(jazz music)
Holy God, we did it again!

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:05.827
Cheer-- oh no!

00:04:05.827 --> 00:04:08.024
Come on, man! Be a cool guy!

00:04:08.024 --> 00:04:10.453
Guess it's back to you, fly wine.

00:04:11.883 --> 00:04:13.903
Guys, you have made an incredible

00:04:13.903 --> 00:04:16.040
burrata bruschetta concoction.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.861
Just take a minute to appreciate

00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:20.111
how far you've come and what you've done.

00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:21.687
Regardless of the results,

00:04:21.687 --> 00:04:23.590
this is an accomplishment.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.817
This looks goddamn beautiful!

00:04:26.817 --> 00:04:28.954
Burrata's up!

00:04:28.954 --> 00:04:32.210
Mmm!

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.196
Oh my god! Yah!

00:04:34.196 --> 00:04:35.910
You know what we've learned here today?

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.320
What we've learned here today is that

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.784
it doesn't matter how it looks,

00:04:38.784 --> 00:04:41.032
it doesn't matter how
you think it needs to be,

00:04:41.032 --> 00:04:44.449
what matters is if you
love what it's made of

00:04:45.209 --> 00:04:48.036
it'll feel right, and it'll feel easy,

00:04:48.586 --> 00:04:51.414
and dare I say, slightly cheesy.

00:04:51.414 --> 00:04:52.993
(jazz music stops) This is the lamest show

00:04:52.993 --> 00:04:54.699
on the internet.
(upbeat music)

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:55.814
Thank you so much for watching.

00:04:55.814 --> 00:04:56.859
Please subscribe to my channel

00:04:56.859 --> 00:04:58.356
for new videos every Tuesday and Thursday

00:04:58.356 --> 00:05:00.283
and also, I mean...

00:05:00.283 --> 00:05:03.081
I could literally just eat this

00:05:03.081 --> 00:05:04.741
and just be the happiest person

00:05:04.741 --> 00:05:06.610
I've ever been in my whole life.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.434
Have a great day.

00:05:08.434 --> 00:05:09.754
Mwah!
