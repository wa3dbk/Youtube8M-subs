billet and they got one other thing is
that<00:04:38.100> we<00:04:38.430> got<00:04:38.639> and<00:04:40.070> it's<00:04:41.070> not<00:04:41.250> special<00:04:41.930> pay<00:04:42.930> too

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
that we got and it's not special pay too

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.780 
that we got and it's not special pay too
much<00:04:43.139> for<00:04:43.350> it<00:04:43.680> but<00:04:44.190> it's<00:04:45.180> this<00:04:45.389> NBA<00:04:45.750> sit<00:04:46.169> and

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
much for it but it's this NBA sit and

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.219 
much for it but it's this NBA sit and
the<00:04:47.790> reason<00:04:48.210> I<00:04:48.360> got<00:04:48.780> it<00:04:49.050> is<00:04:49.229> because<00:04:50.190> I<00:04:50.580> just

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229 
the reason I got it is because I just

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:53.540 
the reason I got it is because I just
just<00:04:52.229> want<00:04:52.440> to<00:04:52.500> show<00:04:52.680> you<00:04:52.740> that<00:04:52.950> they<00:04:53.070> had<00:04:53.310> it

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
just want to show you that they had it

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.250 
just want to show you that they had it
and<00:04:53.729> I<00:04:54.090> guess<00:04:54.270> I<00:04:54.390> could<00:04:54.539> have<00:04:54.630> done<00:04:54.720> a<00:04:54.780> video<00:04:54.930> of

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
and I guess I could have done a video of

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.990 
and I guess I could have done a video of
it<00:04:55.350> in<00:04:55.530> the<00:04:55.650> store<00:04:55.919> and<00:04:56.130> then<00:04:56.310> not<00:04:56.520> bought<00:04:56.789> it

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
it in the store and then not bought it

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.520 
it in the store and then not bought it
there's<00:04:57.510> fifteen<00:04:57.900> dollars<00:04:58.260> which<00:04:58.410> is

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
there's fifteen dollars which is

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.760 
there's fifteen dollars which is
actually<00:04:58.710> a<00:04:58.919> fair<00:04:59.250> price<00:04:59.610> for<00:04:59.669> it<00:05:00.500> it'd<00:05:01.500> been

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
actually a fair price for it it'd been

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:02.990 
actually a fair price for it it'd been
better<00:05:01.979> if<00:05:02.160> it'd<00:05:02.280> been<00:05:02.430> one<00:05:02.640> of<00:05:02.729> the<00:05:02.820> other

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
better if it'd been one of the other

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.600 
better if it'd been one of the other
sets<00:05:03.479> because<00:05:04.289> this<00:05:04.560> one<00:05:04.770> is<00:05:04.950> the<00:05:05.190> tracy

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
sets because this one is the tracy

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.469
