I'm sorry I think it was the latter I
think<00:02:31.950> top<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:32.910> probably<00:02:33.150> are<00:02:33.270> as<00:02:33.420> good<00:02:33.570> as

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
they're going to be very good good but

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
they're going to be very good good but
they're<00:02:36.660> going<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.840> get<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.960> few<00:02:37.170> heightens

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
they're going to get a few heightens

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.890 
they're going to get a few heightens
because<00:02:37.950> they<00:02:38.100> are<00:02:38.670> going<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.180> still<00:02:39.450> concede

Liverpool<00:05:46.419> again<00:05:46.660> I<00:05:46.690> think<00:05:46.870> it<00:05:47.110> for<00:05:47.320> the

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
Liverpool again I think it for the

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.249 
Liverpool again I think it for the
too-short<00:05:48.460> 524<00:05:49.060> on<00:05:49.180> against<00:05:49.449> Wigan<00:05:49.780> okay<00:05:50.050> they

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:50.259 
too-short 524 on against Wigan okay they

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:52.770 
too-short 524 on against Wigan okay they
did<00:05:50.560> a<00:05:50.590> much<00:05:50.800> better<00:05:50.880> team<00:05:51.880> with<00:05:52.150> the<00:05:52.270> bottom

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
did a much better team with the bottom

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.029 
did a much better team with the bottom
line<00:05:52.900> is<00:05:52.930> they<00:05:53.199> school<00:05:53.410> in<00:05:53.470> the<00:05:53.530> last<00:05:53.710> minute

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 
line is they school in the last minute

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:55.830 
line is they school in the last minute
against<00:05:54.479> bolton<00:05:55.479> and<00:05:55.539> we're<00:05:55.660> probably

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
against bolton and we're probably

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.390 
against bolton and we're probably
fortunate<00:05:56.380> to<00:05:56.500> win<00:05:56.620> at<00:05:56.740> the<00:05:56.830> Reebok<00:05:57.130> on<00:05:57.310> the

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
fortunate to win at the Reebok on the

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.689 
fortunate to win at the Reebok on the
last<00:05:57.610> away<00:05:58.419> start<00:05:58.840> and<00:05:59.229> I<00:05:59.740> think<00:06:00.190> an<00:06:00.310> and<00:06:00.490> field

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:00.699 
last away start and I think an and field

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:02.760 
last away start and I think an and field
inspired<00:06:01.150> game<00:06:01.389> against<00:06:01.750> Chelsea<00:06:02.139> I<00:06:02.169> we<00:06:02.470> make

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
inspired game against Chelsea I we make

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.350

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
Liverpool support at Wigan and the

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.760 
Liverpool support at Wigan and the

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
better the week is the West time as well

better the week is the West time as well
in<00:06:08.979> West<00:06:09.280> Ham<00:06:09.460> I<00:06:09.729> know<00:06:10.630> they<00:06:10.750> keep<00:06:10.900> conceding

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
in West Ham I know they keep conceding

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.890 
in West Ham I know they keep conceding
but<00:06:11.680> West<00:06:12.220> Brom<00:06:12.460> the<00:06:12.610> just<00:06:13.030> signs<00:06:13.479> the<00:06:13.720> West

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:18.099 
think West am 32 dem probably need the

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:20.580 
think West am 32 dem probably need the
point<00:06:18.310> more<00:06:18.580> than<00:06:18.789> West<00:06:19.539> Brom<00:06:19.840> third<00:06:20.139> 11<00:06:20.440> to

five and I can see three points for the
hammers<00:06:23.110> and<00:06:23.349> that<00:06:23.560> needed<00:06:24.460> three<00:06:24.669> points<00:06:24.940> of
