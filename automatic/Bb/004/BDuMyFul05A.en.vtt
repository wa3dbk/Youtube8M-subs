we have the keyboard controlling this

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.920 
we have the keyboard controlling this
time<00:01:02.820> it's<00:01:02.969> not<00:01:03.149> going<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.390> work<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.780> way

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
time it's not going to work that way

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.380 
time it's not going to work that way
this<00:01:04.619> time<00:01:04.949> for<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:05.549> stone<00:01:05.970> what<00:01:06.270> we're

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
this time for this stone what we're

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.270 
this time for this stone what we're
going<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.570> do<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.990> we're<00:01:07.619> going<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.830> have<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
going to do is we're going to have the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.359 
going to do is we're going to have the
stone<00:01:08.640> when<00:01:09.210> it's<00:01:09.390> created<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:10.920> going<00:01:11.310> to

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
stone when it's created it's going to

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.080 
stone when it's created it's going to
automatically<00:01:12.500> start<00:01:13.500> moving<00:01:13.979> left<00:01:14.430> or<00:01:14.670> right

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
automatically start moving left or right

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.050 
automatically start moving left or right
at<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.420> speed<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.320> let's<00:01:16.680> say<00:01:16.950> three<00:01:18.200> ok<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:20.060> the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
at a speed of let's say three ok so the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.450 
at a speed of let's say three ok so the
creation<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.320> event<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:22.830> whenever<00:01:23.159> one<00:01:23.430> of

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
creation is the event so whenever one of

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.330 
creation is the event so whenever one of
these<00:01:23.729> stones<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.659> created<00:01:25.409> it's<00:01:26.040> going<00:01:26.280> to

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
these stones is created it's going to

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.330 
these stones is created it's going to
automatically<00:01:27.150> start<00:01:27.659> moving<00:01:28.110> ok<00:01:28.590> that

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
automatically start moving ok that

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.910 
automatically start moving ok that
presents<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.850> little<00:01:30.150> issue<00:01:30.240> for<00:01:30.570> us<00:01:30.600> right<00:01:30.840> now

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
presents a little issue for us right now

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.270 
presents a little issue for us right now
in<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.430> case<00:01:32.729> we<00:01:33.030> don't<00:01:33.180> have<00:01:33.360> any<00:01:33.479> any<00:01:34.280> walls

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
in this case we don't have any any walls

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.940 
in this case we don't have any any walls
in<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.759> ring<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.659> at<00:01:36.750> some<00:01:36.960> point<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.530> objects

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
in the ring so at some point the objects

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.899 
in the ring so at some point the objects
are<00:01:38.009> going<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.220> leave<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.759> room<00:01:39.020> which<00:01:40.020> is

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
are going to leave the room which is

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.980 
are going to leave the room which is
going<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:41.970> cause<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.150> problem<00:01:42.390> for<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.810> few

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
going to cause a problem for a few

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.950 
going to cause a problem for a few
reasons<00:01:43.020> one<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.740> they'll<00:01:44.009> just<00:01:44.159> be<00:01:44.340> gone

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
reasons one is that they'll just be gone

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.630 
reasons one is that they'll just be gone
secondly<00:01:45.960> even<00:01:46.200> though<00:01:46.770> they're<00:01:46.950> off<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.520> the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
secondly even though they're off of the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.030 
secondly even though they're off of the
room<00:01:47.880> they're<00:01:48.570> still<00:01:48.899> taking<00:01:49.110> up<00:01:49.439> space<00:01:49.619> in

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
room they're still taking up space in

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.130 
room they're still taking up space in
like<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.399> game's<00:01:50.640> memory<00:01:51.119> as<00:01:51.329> if<00:01:51.509> they<00:01:51.689> exist

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
like the game's memory as if they exist

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.139 
like the game's memory as if they exist
so<00:01:52.680> it's<00:01:52.799> like<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.100> leaves<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.460> room<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.820> it's

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
so it's like it leaves the room and it's

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.480 
so it's like it leaves the room and it's
as<00:01:54.240> if<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.540> just<00:01:54.570> keeps<00:01:54.960> going<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.799> going<00:01:55.829> and

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
as if it just keeps going and going and

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.719 
as if it just keeps going and going and
going<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:57.119> going<00:01:57.210> which<00:01:58.020> we<00:01:58.200> don't<00:01:58.380> want<00:01:58.729> what

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
going and going which we don't want what

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.289 
going and going which we don't want what
we<00:01:59.850> do<00:02:00.090> want<00:02:00.390> though<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.409> add<00:02:01.740> an<00:02:01.979> event

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
we do want though is to add an event

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.330 
we do want though is to add an event
this<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.360> under<00:02:03.750> other<00:02:04.020> we're<00:02:05.009> going<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.189> say

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
this is under other we're going to say

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.809 
this is under other we're going to say
when<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.640> goes<00:02:05.820> outside<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.899> room<00:02:07.550> we<00:02:08.550> want

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
when it goes outside of the room we want

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.180 
when it goes outside of the room we want
it<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.119> do<00:02:09.300> this<00:02:09.599> which<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.440> wrap

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
it to do this which is wrap

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.490 
it to do this which is wrap
screen<00:02:11.550> meaning<00:02:12.240> it's<00:02:12.630> going<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.900> go<00:02:12.990> over<00:02:13.020> and

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
screen meaning it's going to go over and

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.870 
screen meaning it's going to go over and
then<00:02:13.590> it's<00:02:13.710> going<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:13.890> come<00:02:14.040> back<00:02:14.190> through<00:02:14.760> the

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
then it's going to come back through the

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.650 
then it's going to come back through the
other<00:02:15.000> side<00:02:15.200> okay<00:02:16.200> we<00:02:17.160> could<00:02:17.550> ask<00:02:17.850> it<00:02:18.270> to<00:02:18.300> do<00:02:18.510> it

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
other side okay we could ask it to do it

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.650 
other side okay we could ask it to do it
both<00:02:19.620> directions<00:02:20.130> if<00:02:20.550> this<00:02:20.760> moved<00:02:21.060> randomly

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
both directions if this moved randomly

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.960 
both directions if this moved randomly
any<00:02:21.870> direction<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:23.070> would<00:02:23.160> make<00:02:23.340> sense<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.730> say

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
any direction it would make sense to say

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.420 
any direction it would make sense to say
both<00:02:24.210> directions<00:02:24.600> in<00:02:25.020> this<00:02:25.710> case<00:02:26.010> we<00:02:26.250> know

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
both directions in this case we know

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.460 
both directions in this case we know
it's<00:02:26.640> only<00:02:26.820> moving<00:02:27.270> horizontally<00:02:27.600> so<00:02:28.350> it's

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
it's only moving horizontally so it's

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.140 
it's only moving horizontally so it's
just<00:02:28.560> going<00:02:28.710> to<00:02:28.800> go<00:02:28.890> off<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.130> screen<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.820> come

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
just going to go off the screen and come

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.910 
just going to go off the screen and come
back<00:02:30.270> on<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.600> other<00:02:30.810> side<00:02:31.110> ok<00:02:32.030> so<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.060> hit<00:02:33.270> ok

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
back on the other side ok so I hit ok

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.510 
back on the other side ok so I hit ok
now<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:35.370> click<00:02:36.330> OK<00:02:36.840> here<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:37.800> now<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.010> have<00:02:38.310> this

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
now I click OK here and now I have this

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.400 
now I click OK here and now I have this
object<00:02:38.760> it's<00:02:39.390> already<00:02:39.660> kind<00:02:39.990> of<00:02:40.020> programmed

object it's already kind of programmed

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.230 
object it's already kind of programmed

selected I'm going to change it to the

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.650 
selected I'm going to change it to the
meteor<00:02:50.100> and<00:02:50.730> I'm<00:02:50.850> going<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.000> put<00:02:51.180> in<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.450> bunch

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
meteor and I'm going to put in a bunch

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.660 
meteor and I'm going to put in a bunch
of<00:02:51.900> these<00:02:52.340> randomly<00:02:54.080> to<00:02:55.080> have<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.530> deal<00:02:56.400> with

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
of these randomly to have to deal with

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.150 
of these randomly to have to deal with
in<00:02:56.850> our<00:02:57.000> game<00:02:57.270> there<00:02:58.230> are<00:02:58.320> other<00:02:58.440> ways<00:02:58.710> to<00:02:58.740> have

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
in our game there are other ways to have

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.220 
in our game there are other ways to have
them<00:02:59.340> come<00:02:59.550> in<00:02:59.670> you<00:02:59.880> could<00:03:00.030> have<00:03:00.150> them<00:03:00.360> spawn

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
them come in you could have them spawn

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.010 
them come in you could have them spawn
randomly<00:03:01.740> which<00:03:02.370> we'll<00:03:02.580> learn<00:03:02.760> later<00:03:03.030> right

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
randomly which we'll learn later right

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.510 
randomly which we'll learn later right
now<00:03:04.140> we<00:03:04.200> don't<00:03:04.350> have<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:04.620> do<00:03:04.800> that<00:03:04.830> but<00:03:05.280> we<00:03:05.400> do

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
now we don't have to do that but we do

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.100 
now we don't have to do that but we do
know<00:03:05.640> how<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.760> click<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:06.330> put<00:03:06.540> as<00:03:06.630> many<00:03:06.780> as<00:03:06.990> we

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
know how to click and put as many as we

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.650 
know how to click and put as many as we
want<00:03:07.140> on<00:03:07.560> there<00:03:07.800> for<00:03:08.070> now<00:03:08.250> so<00:03:09.180> now<00:03:09.330> we're<00:03:09.540> going

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
want on there for now so now we're going

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:17.470 
want on there for now so now we're going
to<00:03:09.720> try<00:03:09.960> to<00:03:10.020> game<00:03:10.320> out

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.640 

and<00:03:18.519> there<00:03:19.519> it<00:03:19.670> is<00:03:19.810> we<00:03:20.810> have<00:03:20.959> to<00:03:21.140> avoid<00:03:21.319> Dean's

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
and there it is we have to avoid Dean's

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.080 
and there it is we have to avoid Dean's
although<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.159> funny<00:03:22.370> thing<00:03:22.610> is<00:03:22.640> we<00:03:23.000> don't

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
although the funny thing is we don't

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.190 
although the funny thing is we don't
really<00:03:23.209> have<00:03:23.659> to<00:03:23.810> avoid<00:03:24.019> them<00:03:24.260> because<00:03:24.440> why<00:03:26.200> we

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
really have to avoid them because why we

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.780 
really have to avoid them because why we
don't<00:03:27.319> have<00:03:27.409> any<00:03:27.530> lives<00:03:27.769> we<00:03:28.220> didn't<00:03:28.459> tell<00:03:28.640> it

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
don't have any lives we didn't tell it

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.580 
don't have any lives we didn't tell it
that<00:03:28.819> anything<00:03:29.269> bad<00:03:29.510> happens<00:03:30.049> where<00:03:30.260> they<00:03:30.379> hit

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
that anything bad happens where they hit

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.830 
that anything bad happens where they hit
us<00:03:30.620> or<00:03:31.069> whatever<00:03:31.340> right<00:03:31.610> so<00:03:32.450> we'll<00:03:32.629> do<00:03:32.810> that

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
us or whatever right so we'll do that

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.070 
us or whatever right so we'll do that
shortly<00:03:33.560> but<00:03:34.549> for<00:03:34.819> now<00:03:35.000> I<00:03:35.360> just<00:03:35.420> want<00:03:35.900> you<00:03:35.989> to

shortly but for now I just want you to

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.920 
shortly but for now I just want you to
understand<00:03:36.530> how<00:03:36.620> to<00:03:36.739> add<00:03:37.180> element<00:03:38.180> sing<00:03:38.420> that

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
understand how to add element sing that

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.440 
understand how to add element sing that
move<00:03:39.170> on<00:03:39.349> their<00:03:39.500> own<00:03:39.610> wrap<00:03:40.610> around<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.120> screen

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
move on their own wrap around the screen

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.440 
move on their own wrap around the screen
etc<00:03:42.260> as<00:03:42.860> you<00:03:43.370> can<00:03:43.519> imagine<00:03:43.760> we<00:03:44.120> could<00:03:44.150> also

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
etc as you can imagine we could also

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.050 
etc as you can imagine we could also
have<00:03:44.840> things<00:03:45.049> coming<00:03:45.470> up<00:03:45.590> and<00:03:45.829> down<00:03:46.069> and<00:03:46.340> as<00:03:46.760> we

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
have things coming up and down and as we

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.940 
have things coming up and down and as we
build<00:03:47.299> more<00:03:47.569> levels<00:03:48.049> on<00:03:48.230> to<00:03:48.349> this<00:03:48.470> game<00:03:48.709> will

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
build more levels on to this game will

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.890 
build more levels on to this game will
do<00:03:49.159> things<00:03:49.430> like<00:03:49.640> that<00:03:49.849> but<00:03:50.329> for<00:03:50.569> now<00:03:50.690> I'm

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
do things like that but for now I'm

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.970 
do things like that but for now I'm
going<00:03:51.049> to<00:03:51.110> let<00:03:51.230> you<00:03:51.260> all<00:03:51.440> try<00:03:51.890> to<00:03:51.950> get<00:03:52.160> this<00:03:52.459> far
