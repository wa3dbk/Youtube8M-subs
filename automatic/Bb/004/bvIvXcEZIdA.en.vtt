 Hello everyone, today we talk about 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.429
 formidable forasacchi foreign bodies in 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.860
 vegetables that anyone has had 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.960
 a canon cat has certainly heard 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.080
 name some of you maybe he had 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.690
 also a close encounter with this 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.390
 kind of problem they are very frequent 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.640
 problems caused by these false 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.949
 what mission in korea bags are 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.260
 practically of the ears similar to 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.820
 those of the wheat that have one 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.540
 particular structure that they succeed 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.030
 practically get stuck everywhere 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:41.460
 in this video I will show you where i 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.050
 forasacchi can slip on and give 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.200
 also some advice to avoid 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.239
 obviously this problem we start 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.760
 immediately from the offices where we can 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.219
 find the forasacchi then those more 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.860
 common are from the nose 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.230
 very often they are inhaled come 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.500
 breathe so your dog goes in 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.409
 these fields where these are present 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:08.040
 vegetable and inadvertently in ara one 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.619
 bad luck that goes up for the nostril that goes 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:15.170
 in the nasal cavity and very often then 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:20.750
 we see the dog sneeze maybe go out 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:23.700
 blood are sometimes inhaled e 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:27.060
 then they can give with the 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:32.470
 bacteria that just because forasacco 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:36.790
 obviously it is rich in beating being 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:39.880
 a foreign body that is obviously not 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.430
 sterile another location where we can 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.010
 find the forasacco and in the ear 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.430
 the sacks that we are very frequent 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:51.130
 we find at the bottom then is that these 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.970
 they can usually cause problems 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.560
 come the dogs that have the head 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.980
 voted other times continue to 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.350
 shake it other times may puncture 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:06.190
 the eardrum therefore obviously needs 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:09.760
 to remove this we say are sunny 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:13.380
 most known locations, however, very often there 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:16.209
 we can find inside the third 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.060
 brown part they can just slip into 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.610
 inside it also happened to me in a cat of 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.000
 find a proper slipper 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.280
 under the third eyelid another seat e 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.820
 through the mouth 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.940
 very often it happened to me recently 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.760
 for example of a forasacco that has 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.459
 perforated the gum the cheek and it is 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.260
 managed to get inside are 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.200
 very subtle because very often 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.170
 they manage to enter and if you are not 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.390
 let's say quite carefully the hole of 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.519
 entry then closes and later 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.370
 over time we face each other 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:57.160
 the infection starts with access caused 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.050
 obviously of the bacteria he brought 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.420
 the foreign body inside the body 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.090
 sometimes they are sucked and can 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.160
 obviously ending up through the mouth 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.230
 they are then aspirated they go in tranche a 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.620
 they can obviously perforate the lung 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:15.700
 and even get through 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:18.310
 obviously a path that is obligatory 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.019
 from the structure of the forasacco that not 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.190
 obviously allows to return 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:26.500
 back end up at the level of 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.900
 vertebrae and can give a disc 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.019
 spondylitis there was a disc infection 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.570
 intervertebral other times end 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.520
 inside the skin ie they succeed 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.470
 just to pierce the skin 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.450
 slowly they come in, not yes 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.200
 close the usual most frequent places 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.060
 they are the interdigital spaces of the legs 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.260
 of dogs but can also enter into 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:53.560
 hips in the perineal area and therefore 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.020
 you have to be careful I repeat because it is a 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.420
 foreign body that carries gods with it 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.600
 bacteria and therefore if you don't notice in 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.880
 time and do not remove this challenge yes 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:08.620
 then goes to meet later 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:12.610
 accesses that obviously create these 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:16.780
 bacteria the advice the first advice is 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:20.410
 that of not bringing your dog in 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:23.170
 places where these forasacchi are there 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.930
 in short, try to avoid those fields 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.690
 where they are rich in forasacchi but maybe 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.740
 prefer meadows this is the first one 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.880
 council 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:37.630
 the second is to check the 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.580
 own dog daily after that if 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.890
 go for a walk because it is 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.630
 true that the song forasacchi am true 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.360
 for a structure that does not allow the 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.310
 forasacco to go out though if you 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.110
 they check enough immediately 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.860
 especially those that penetrate into the 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:56.170
 cute and then obviously go and creating of 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.850
 tangenti fisto losi or those who 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.060
 they come maybe that they manage to enter 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.220
 in the mouth and maybe pierce it 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.410
 cheek like the one that happened to me 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.720
 recently in this video 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.340
 certainly 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.740
 so you can see so you can 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.650
 intervene especially those I repeat 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.030
 of the skin in the interdigital spaces 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:20.120
 check the interdigital spaces well 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.949
 the thing can then be removed 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.680
 it is important to remove any 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:26.840
 forasacco you find attached to 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.820
 fur the dog's skin this is the 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.770
 the second council is obviously the best 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:34.280
 as soon as you suspect yours 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:36.620
 dog has inhaled breathed or 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.320
 ungrateful in the ear a forasacco you are 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:42.650
 been an area you saw that the 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.990
 your dog to signs of symptoms 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.760
 related to the present still sack 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:51.440
 take it to the doctor immediately, of course 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:54.290
 veterinarian who will remove tos forasacco 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:58.010
 in the area where he went to 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:59.990
 slipping in is advice enough 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.360
 simple to check though they are 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.919
 those that rise maybe then 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.550
 surgery removal 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:08.990
 of the ear in the paw or removal 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:12.530
 of the ear after one was formed 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:15.440
 choice on white or even 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:18.880
 as we have said before the presence of 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:21.919
 a bag that came up to 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.139
 to the vertebrae then truly creating 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:26.990
 very big problems for thani i hope 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:29.800
 you enjoyed this video and there 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.800
 see you next time
