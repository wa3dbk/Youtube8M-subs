00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:09.510
 hi guys today new recipe today 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:13.949
 very simple recipe because it did 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.039
 a move to read pink because I have 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:20.400
 bought these roses does not make it to paris 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:23.010
 like kimi if this will be this store 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.289
 my name is sharma used I said that 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.750
 would have used social today finally 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.010
 then a very simple envelope with 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.890
 very few ingredients 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.829
 I did a little decoration what e 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.620
 nothing I do n't release photos I leave you 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.769
 coming the ingredients and that's it 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.629
 connected average hands let me know what 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:45.780
 do you think if the evidence to do it? 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.210
 follow me on facebook and thank you all 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.280
 those that keep me commenting that 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.940
 each put of kutcher instead must 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.530
 happen 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.530
 a good wine kiss 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:09.220
 then the ingredients we need 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:12.340
 are 350 g of whipping cream well 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.590
 cold put it in the fridge in this 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.050
 point I didn't put 80 grams of honey myself 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.930
 I know what to hunt because I want a 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.520
 let's say more delicate is possible 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.470
 there being the rose 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.800
 mine is very strong so it would risk 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:30.070
 to cover the flavor and 50 grams of 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.890
 glucose because in theory the sum 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.750
 total face 130 grams since 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.840
 as I said the honey is too strong 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.229
 so I decided to break the sweetness 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.970
 using their sweet path if it is 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:48.220
 you can use all 10 grams of roses 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.650
 then I try because I needed the hole 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.780
 he knows when they were from Paris to no course 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.890
 a fictional lawn the store of 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.180
 gastronomy 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.060
 I don't need to advertise you 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.720
 me because face up these things 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:05.009
 these rose buds and I didn't have 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:09.100
 never used yet decided we do today 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:11.830
 nothing is edible roses what one is 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.900
 they can eat so I took it 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.460
 I flipped through it because there was also the 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:21.160
 stalk here and there chopped with the mix then 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:24.420
 these six grams of isinglass e 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.260
 Neapolitan already put 70 grams of yolk 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.580
 proceed 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.380
 the first thing we need to do is 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.540
 put the gelatin on the isinglass 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:37.120
 to soak in cold water so I took it 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:40.180
 a cold bowl and then at a time but 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.620
 was let it soften and then there 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.880
 will come in handy 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.590
 now we have to do what we do 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.630
 called the pata bombacha the meringue 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.720
 Italian style made with egg yolks ie the 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.550
 cooking chickens while riding with 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.840
 of sugar cooked in sugar 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.840
 our case is honey glucose 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.760
 and we have to get to 100 21 degrees 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.280
 in the meantime sugar arrives at 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.280
 121 grams we note with the whip 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.769
 egg yolks and when evening sugar 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.870
 he had 321 mali the over we are at the wire 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:17.239
 of the yolks that are mounting and there 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.239
 let's set up a cooling 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:34.700
 ok this is the brought of the pa from bonn 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:37.610
 the first time cold but nasa is the 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.800
 we can also add during while 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.330
 is still mounting but I wanted to 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:48.320
 providing and indeed carmela is why so 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:50.420
 avoid to deflate it understood and this 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:55.480
 let's put aside 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:58.250
 now the jelly melts it in 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.990
 about 50 grams of the initial mother who 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.520
 said the rest of the cream 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.590
 mounted 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:08.630
 so now let's put the cream 50 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:10.090
 grams to warm the gelatin the omitted one 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:14.240
 soak in cold water 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.790
 the spice and once a clear merchant 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.739
 let's put it inside the melt and 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.790
 we also work in place of cancer it 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.790
 sugar and rose 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.560
 then here is the water bubbles 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:31.990
 sorry the cream bills we put the 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.990
 I leave jelly and diana 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:46.409
 and mine but composed of sugar yolks 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:56.849
 and pink always risking will put a little 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:58.349
 because this is a bit now we miss it 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:06.110
 just to combine the fame we have 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:09.240
 invented we have and we lighten 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:12.229
 of ascola imposed from the bottom crash 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.229
 upward 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:29.890
 who chose these glasses for me 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.890
 calls do everything are not entirely 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:38.090
 this kind of glasses and you can 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:39.950
 decide where you want to release it then 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.110
 I did is that this takes over 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.970
 another truly African, therefore 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:56.290
 jelly inside so now it seems to me 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:56.290
 actually liquid rather than mom 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:04.479
 enough and instead yes you like them but certainly 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:06.100
 but ok we have the foot glasses and I have to 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:07.780
 be honest in the portion I have 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:11.320
 given you don't have a lot then of 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:13.810
 glasses places you live at least 78 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:16.360
 I would say then the rest I put it in 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:19.330
 a plastic container so there is 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:22.180
 we eat very raw here at home 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:25.060
 that's enough so now you have to put it 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.919
 in the fridge for at least an hour 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.199
 two so I recommend if you have to 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:32.380
 eat it in the evening to do it machine 

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:34.449
 afternoon and August ended later 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:37.360
 aspect that then solidifies it 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:39.850
 let's decorate a little bit then it's gone 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.250
 not even an hour because in the meantime yes 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:44.289
 learns very quickly and this is the 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.870
 our move that I have prepared with 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:49.720
 care of currants and 2 euro feelings those 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:53.050
 that we used in the Russian enough 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:55.479
 affinity recipes I give you an advice in the 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:59.470
 in case you'd like to do a little lighter at 

00:06:55.479 --> 00:07:01.750
 new dietary you can replace instead 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:03.729
 to put the yolk you use the egg whites 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:08.229
 in this way managed a bit of calories 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:11.530
 fat and obviously the taste will be more 

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:15.169
 in the sense it will be less favored however in 

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:17.270
 this way will be lighter and that's it 

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:20.620
 in this recipe over fast and 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.620
 we give each other video
