obviously<00:02:23.680> this<00:02:23.739> is<00:02:23.920> when<00:02:24.190> iOS<00:02:24.519> 8<00:02:24.760> comes<00:02:25.030> out

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
obviously this is when iOS 8 comes out

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.030 
obviously this is when iOS 8 comes out
at<00:02:25.299> the<00:02:25.390> same<00:02:25.569> time<00:02:25.780> basically<00:02:26.680> if<00:02:26.799> you're<00:02:26.920> not

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
at the same time basically if you're not

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.260

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
the main reason to change but I think

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.950 
the main reason to change but I think
there<00:02:44.240> could<00:02:44.330> be<00:02:44.420> something<00:02:44.630> out<00:02:44.780> there<00:02:44.840> that

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960

third-party<00:03:45.470> apps<00:03:45.890> now<00:03:46.010> they're<00:03:46.130> going<00:03:46.220> to

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
third-party apps now they're going to

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.280 
third-party apps now they're going to
introduce<00:03:46.520> it<00:03:46.850> so<00:03:47.000> say<00:03:47.210> like<00:03:47.630> you<00:03:48.020> leave<00:03:48.170> your

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
introduce it so say like you leave your

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.540 
introduce it so say like you leave your
phone<00:03:48.440> unlocked<00:03:48.740> but<00:03:49.130> something<00:03:49.340> wants<00:03:49.490> to

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
phone unlocked but something wants to

try and hop into your facebook they

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.120 
try and hop into your facebook they
can't<00:03:51.110> do<00:03:51.200> it<00:03:51.230> without<00:03:51.380> your<00:03:51.650> fingerprint

those<00:03:52.250> kind<00:03:52.460> of<00:03:52.490> things<00:03:52.640> I<00:03:52.820> guess<00:03:53.000> that's

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
those kind of things I guess that's

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.550 
those kind of things I guess that's
obviously<00:03:53.480> the<00:03:53.570> general<00:03:54.110> idea<00:03:54.320> that<00:03:54.440> they're

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
obviously the general idea that they're

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.350 
obviously the general idea that they're
going<00:03:54.740> for<00:03:55.100> but<00:03:55.370> it<00:03:55.460> could<00:03:55.550> be<00:03:55.640> obviously<00:03:56.030> set

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
going for but it could be obviously set

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.760 
going for but it could be obviously set
banking<00:03:56.780> software<00:03:56.990> those<00:03:57.350> kind<00:03:57.560> of<00:03:57.620> things

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
banking software those kind of things

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.350 
banking software those kind of things
it's<00:03:58.010> a<00:03:58.370> little<00:03:58.640> more<00:03:58.760> protection<00:03:58.910> for<00:03:59.300> your

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
it's a little more protection for your

it's basically a new programming
language<00:04:37.520> which<00:04:38.210> focuses<00:04:38.630> on<00:04:38.690> speed<00:04:38.960> and<00:04:39.140> ease

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
language which focuses on speed and ease

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.630 
language which focuses on speed and ease
of<00:04:39.350> use<00:04:39.530> so<00:04:39.830> it's<00:04:39.950> like<00:04:40.070> an<00:04:40.190> easier<00:04:40.520> way<00:04:40.610> to

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
of use so it's like an easier way to

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.830 
of use so it's like an easier way to
make<00:04:40.790> programs<00:04:41.330> of<00:04:41.560> our<00:04:42.560> apps<00:04:42.830> for<00:04:43.400> iOS<00:04:44.150> 8<00:04:44.360> and

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
make programs of our apps for iOS 8 and

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.180 
make programs of our apps for iOS 8 and
basically<00:04:45.080> from<00:04:45.260> what<00:04:45.530> everything's<00:04:45.950> been

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
basically from what everything's been

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.470 
basically from what everything's been
announced<00:04:46.430> is<00:04:46.640> going<00:04:46.940> to<00:04:47.090> be
