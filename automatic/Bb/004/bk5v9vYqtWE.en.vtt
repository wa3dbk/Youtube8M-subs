00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
there try to just soften it down so I

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.139 
there try to just soften it down so I
just<00:01:55.560> kind<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.829> applied<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.640> then<00:01:56.759> blended

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
just kind of applied it and then blended

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.240 
just kind of applied it and then blended
it<00:01:57.240> out<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.619> wasn't<00:01:58.799> too<00:01:59.040> crazy

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
it out so that it wasn't too crazy

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.980 
it out so that it wasn't too crazy
because<00:01:59.610> this<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.030> just<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.270> transition<00:02:00.659> color

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
because this is just a transition color

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.020 
because this is just a transition color
but<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:01.860> didn't<00:02:02.070> want<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.310> use<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> soft<00:02:02.729> brown<00:02:02.969> I

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
but I didn't want to use a soft brown I

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.370 
but I didn't want to use a soft brown I
felt<00:02:03.390> like<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:03.659> was<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.869> nicer<00:02:04.259> transition

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
felt like this was a nicer transition

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.839 
felt like this was a nicer transition
just<00:02:07.380> because<00:02:07.649> especially<00:02:08.099> since<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.640> lid

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
just because especially since the lid

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.020 
just because especially since the lid
color<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.330> um

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
color is um

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.620 
color is um
Matt<00:02:10.780> so<00:02:11.290> I<00:02:11.320> use<00:02:11.500> a<00:02:11.530> shimmer<00:02:11.860> transition<00:02:12.640> hey

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
like a nice transition from the taupe

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.020 
like a nice transition from the taupe
into<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:49.660> UM<00:02:50.910> its<00:02:51.910> satin<00:02:52.270> taupe<00:02:53.760> see<00:02:54.760> how<00:02:54.880> it

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
into the UM its satin taupe see how it

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.670 
into the UM its satin taupe see how it
creates<00:02:55.390> kind<00:02:55.570> of<00:02:55.660> a<00:02:55.780> nice<00:02:55.959> transition<00:02:56.560> right

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
creates kind of a nice transition right

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.630 
creates kind of a nice transition right
there<00:02:58.050> and<00:02:59.050> this<00:02:59.260> just<00:02:59.500> adds<00:02:59.709> definition<00:02:59.980> to

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
there and this just adds definition to

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.820 
there and this just adds definition to
your<00:03:00.790> outer<00:03:00.970> V<00:03:01.300> of<00:03:01.330> course<00:03:01.680> especially<00:03:02.680> if<00:03:02.739> you

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
your outer V of course especially if you

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.080 
your outer V of course especially if you
don't<00:03:02.920> really<00:03:03.100> have<00:03:03.370> one<00:03:03.400> because<00:03:03.700> my<00:03:03.820> crease

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
don't really have one because my crease

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.270 
don't really have one because my crease
is<00:03:04.239> kind<00:03:04.450> of<00:03:04.540> deep<00:03:04.840> so<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:05.650> got<00:03:05.890> a<00:03:05.920> kind<00:03:06.190> of

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
is kind of deep so I got a kind of

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.360 
is kind of deep so I got a kind of
contour<00:03:06.730> and<00:03:07.030> I'm<00:03:07.150> gonna<00:03:07.270> take<00:03:07.570> a<00:03:07.600> Mac<00:03:07.900> 217<00:03:08.370> and
