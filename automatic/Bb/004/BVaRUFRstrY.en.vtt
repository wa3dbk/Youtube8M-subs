00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.010
 Well 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:18.870
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.440
 kriga tv and today we have hot on 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.830
 wreath 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.110
 Mars 15 Light tank level 10 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.230
 listen to this light tank 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:31.650
 This is the first light tank of level 10 which 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.650
 I do not see at all in this game 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.600
 Generally, if you want to watch the whole review 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.840
 look but I will say right away for the most 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.600
 impatient tank is interesting and it is very 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.910
 not bad but not imba of course 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.520
 get down to business first here 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.120
 there is a weapon with a single damage in 4 st and 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.579
 penetration in 259 on armor-piercing shells 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.800
 also on gold 330 this is enough 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.620
 to punish all wrong there when 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:04.140
 this it has incredible accuracy in 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:06.210
 zero 28 units 028 leopard worse 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.670
 in general, this pipets just no circle 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.670
 scatter in fact but so there 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.440
 made in the update to the variation of the 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.860
 I can't get in right away anyway 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.090
 I'm wondering what other tanks are doing now 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.150
 reloading with pumped skills and 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:25.200
 crew of 12 levels raiser 3 and 3 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.810
 seconds dpm per minute just wild 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.299
 but it needs to be implemented but we have 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.369
 other problems because of which we are not 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.100
 we can implement as successfully as here 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.649
 we have it at the circuses is namely small 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.979
 number of hp and a small amount of armor 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:43.680
 HP only 2 500 I have a module on 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.990
 400 hit points so two and a half 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.840
 thousand friends two and a half thousand 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.700
 can be found at the eighth level which 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.520
 already there 10 from a horse 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.990
 one shot and you stay on shot 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.500
 any of the seventh well and in 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.210
 principle 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.259
 most other tanks of the tenth 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.719
 level all there storming tiger fv 4005 is 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.729
 in general, just for you the restricted area 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.850
 they can kill you one shot 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.649
 no problem at all and so on 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.210
 I would like to note that since it is easy 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.880
 tank that task he must perform 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.310
 light tank it shines itself and 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.440
 everyone else shine shoot in the side 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.980
 feed and move quickly across the field 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.379
 fight 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.860
 what, then, with the speed of the problems we have 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:27.560
 no actually more than 20 horse 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.740
 forces per ton flies car turns 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.440
 fast maximal 75 this tin is just 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.840
 i enjoyed flying back and forth 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.270
 field but it is not described in words 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.160
 in general, this is a light tank, I understood it 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.590
 but he is so beautiful 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.320
 he has drawbacks good enough but 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.540
 you can see for yourself what bp is from 701 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.220
 go ricochets on the tower he's all with us 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.410
 so streamlined of course not worth it 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.750
 rely heavily on armor but by playing from 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.420
 towers neatly you can somehow 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.790
 several shells for possible and repelled 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.980
 also machines are incredibly compact and 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.709
 It means that it glows badly 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.989
 really not seen while very comfortable 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.239
 to tank because of some 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.739
 I do not know allies and get out for them and 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.110
 back for them hides we can 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.310
 hide actually probably for any 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.709
 tank in our game 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.900
 although it should be noted that this 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.720
 car is not the second world war 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:24.350
 this is a completely different era machine 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.900
 development of the 80s of the 80s but in principle 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.280
 in the game she fit very well if 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.739
 you are alone against the crowd 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.930
 opponents are unlikely to be able to drag 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.060
 if you donâ€™t work with the brain but even 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.480
 if you are, then, too, the chances are not very 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.580
 lot 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.340
 one-on-one machine shows itself 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.830
 extremely bad due to but poor vitality 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.620
 we have a disgusting amount of hp armor 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.480
 little but we have a good dpm even 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.610
 despite this we interrupt even 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.040
 one on one is unlikely we can 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.560
 because you need to target anyway anyway 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.290
 places weak moisture with precision from ours 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.390
 it's no problem at all but anyway 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.549
 Immediately you will not fall twist 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.380
 opponents you can of course but not 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:06.140
 it is worth counting on it all the same 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.100
 usually opponents drive in packs 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.709
 duel game 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.299
 so use your allies yes 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.820
 I'm not afraid of this word really 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.500
 use and then you will be happy 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.239
 because you most likely 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.400
 distractions will not so much want 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.410
 honestly always see me well because i 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.600
 I usually arrive first at the point 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.510
 comfortable position and he begins to influence 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.940
 opponents even now we have the strength 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.669
 it was not actually but at the beginning of the battle I 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.870
 distracted the enemy he got up he 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.040
 could capture the base 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.170
 but here was 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.350
 and which we had there a couple of tanks 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:41.510
 would be killed if my support in 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.550
 In general, you just need to have time to be 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.400
 everywhere and on this tank you have it 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.830
 get to be honest the car I really 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:52.640
 much liked but also repeat 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.980
 it is very difficult for her to fold 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.200
 need still a skill comrades for one 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:00.140
 a day does not work out in general if 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.700
 want to buy recommend 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.830
 and you had a hook tv 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.100
 I hope you enjoyed the video and bye 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.100
 until
