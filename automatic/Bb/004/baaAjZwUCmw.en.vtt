00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.550
 in the court 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.200
 welcome everyone in this new 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.040
 video then we will start a new 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.570
 micro tutorial series so these micro tutorial 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.760
 are very short videos on each 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.040
 option even creator so creation of 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.050
 blogs creation of items creation of files 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.570
 and so it's these micro tutorial they have 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.920
 two goals of 1 you can you 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.860
 focus on just one option the same 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.110
 creator because in my old 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.030
 videos for example what would make a 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.350
 dimension I will be extra a block and 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.520
 so that's where it's really the strict 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.360
 needed on one option 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.040
 and they will also serve for the wiki that 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.720
 I am putting in place so 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.530
 it's a wiki that will be around the same 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.630
 created waiting so this is for the 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.790
 French community 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.930
 you can trade on it so there 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.000
 will have pages that I'm trying to 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.380
 do so thanks to his basic videos 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.610
 who will serve me devotes to create 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.170
 a series of options I have not explored by 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.430
 example or change my pages or that 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.390
 others to buy the details of 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.700
 tips etc 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.590
 we will be based on a planet is 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.970
 rather strong and sure of sharing so 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.810
 here it is, you are worried 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.149
 I do not work on it 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.680
 he should be released very soon 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.509
 So here we go without further ado 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.470
 to start 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.850
 so I avoided doing anything 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.289
 that I had already done before so I 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.590
 think about cra his blog that was an extra 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:47.850
 already seen and so we will see a novelty 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:50.490
 of two creators 1.3.3 is the weapons 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.000
 to fire so we will start with texture 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.530
 altitude camp 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.979
 so here I used the generator of 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.660
 basic textures why why 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.530
 I do not use guim at the time of my 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.330
 Another video is because one is 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.550
 to show that pilot plans when 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.060
 even things every time he is 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.259
 released provides detection of 2 g no 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.190
 base finally I have no idea to create 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.050
 a firearm of course I could 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.700
 to take the image of one of the 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.630
 elite creators and to make beautiful 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.010
 access cost because the colors 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.990
 textures are disgusting 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.150
 but the goal is that it is fast no 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.370
 so here I remember that I 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.740
 intertextual sorts objects by words 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:30.480
 so firearms this single is a I 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.740
 so you take a two years to fire no 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.819
 that we have a style scared a gun and 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.709
 different forms made eating take 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.090
 to what looks like someone here and 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.530
 I will not put colors because when 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.700
 I said the colors are managed on time 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.400
 textures are disgusting so 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:45.069
 I like it ak-47 gray and gray 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:49.329
 dark so use it m 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:51.099
 and I will call him john key and 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.900
 now we're going to make the texture of the 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.249
 dombasle ball his dumplings removed so 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.329
 at the top I'll take the big ones 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:55.659
 balls we saw that there are different 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.109
 sizes 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:00.010
 I take the big as paint ball 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:01.959
 this one I'll put a texture 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.980
 red so that we see it anyway 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:08.170
 see that it's still 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:11.230
 disgusting that a little use this theme me 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.900
 I call bull while we noted on 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.719
 excites and so we have to 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.969
 ball theme credit 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:23.079
 No, you are going to be desired 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:26.139
 I called dumpling texture items 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:28.419
 where are you looking for my downstream 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:30.099
 she's here so I 'm going to go very 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:32.409
 quickly on the creation the dumpling especially 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:33.819
 that the bosses influence on their 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:35.799
 mafia I will explain why 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.269
 and then I do it again a tutorial so 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.449
 specially for the occasion of objects 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:43.530
 so the mine jean is at stake it will be stupid 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:45.549
 it is in the combat tab 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.409
 obstacles up to 64 is not in 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.989
 singable at has no duration of use 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:52.329
 maximum is not a tool does zero 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.669
 damage I'll explain why that 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:56.019
 there is no next event 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:57.669
 ex as we have kraft 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.959
 I did a stupid job that 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:01.239
 not used like that in on of the 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:04.900
 hatch you're serious on the wheel next 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:09.459
 so check our ball then the 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:12.599
 modes we grew up and so here we will do 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:15.310
 tears so gun she hockey 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:19.509
 texture range so where to look for your 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:22.590
 firearms here select next the soul he 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:25.630
 so enjoy not in play so it's gay 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.820
 it is done then leave to morgan in molac 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.259
 art of robots so that's the object that 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.630
 will serve as ammo it's not about 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:32.919
 the object that will leave a gun 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.419
 red and that serves as missions that you 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:37.030
 must have physically in 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:41.639
 the inventory as the arrows so me 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:43.630
 I take the ball that is here so 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.070
 the maximum use of the firearm 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.320
 from which she can shoot without a ball goes there 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.229
 touch powerball then the 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.159
 power dumpling it's power like 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.050
 bow 

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:54.909
 so there he is one like the bow is 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.940
 when you hear the bow knowingly 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:58.380
 that the gun in the tender years 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.910
 you shoot once the ball she not 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.410
 so that's fine enough 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.730
 slow so I 'm going to touch it you 're 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.820
 domain I advise you a little the 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.350
 go down because with the tests I 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.080
 noticed that 5 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.520
 it kills all animals at once 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.910
 are almost lincou all the zombies 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.850
 so here it's done rather a lot of 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.350
 damage then britney bac 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.630
 the report that I managed to calculate 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.700
 it's a point of October bac it's 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.960
 back two ink boxes with 5 mac 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.230
 you to roll back 10 boxes 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.450
 so I dropped a little m to 3 for 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.860
 decline about six boxes then confessed 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.270
 of particles this is actually when the 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.110
 ball did not stay there particles 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.480
 a bit like an explosion that was scared 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.330
 we destroyed two pellets 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.890
 yg nightfire snuggle actually serves this 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.210
 if the ball hits Lyon we go 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.890
 to say kind the ground it will ignite ground 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.140
 so I showed you a fairway and the 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.150
 mud the texture so yes this dialogue he 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.680
 progresses so that is to say that for 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.060
 the moment we can not change the texture 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.670
 of the ball is so good that you have 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.440
 a physical object bull is therefore the 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.970
 ammunition in your inventory will not be 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.530
 that's going to go so there as he says that 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.460
 is going to be the arrow that's going to leave he's 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.650
 working on it let 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.330
 him a little bit of time so next how on 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:08.490
 will crafter the device I use a kraft 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:11.669
 all stupid I'm doing a lake at bbl on 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:14.490
 the ultra values ​​are imaginative next 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.660
 finished so we ended our shelter with 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.010
 our ball is here we will test 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:21.380
 all that was 10 and video microphones 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.310
 intended for the yes that is for 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.710
 something you are looking for 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:29.760
 particular so I tend who finishes of 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:32.160
 recompile in the background and once 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:36.870
 that it will be done we will look at all this 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:39.980
 it's gone a little full for 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.980
 quietly who launches 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:56.430
 full-screen single player I create a 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:58.480
 movement in creative so it's gone 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.730
 here is a beautiful band of 

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.170
 sheep for target that's fine then 

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.550
 we're going to have a casting table ' 

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:07.420
 to check that kraft works well 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:10.900
 already the dumpling and tears are here so 

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:16.450
 i'm going to need two gravol 3 

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:18.330
 forgiveness is a bit like 'the so my 

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:20.980
 two opponents to make my ball is 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:23.200
 mccaw boston below the world these 

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:25.510
 business then gun in creative 

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:28.360
 it's like with the sharks the basics 

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:30.910
 are unlimited you see well I 

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:33.970
 can she if she's fighting her share and 

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:36.570
 while in the ball portion survival 

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:39.100
 well I showed you about the poor utp 

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:40.570
 so I lost my ball I would have 

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.700
 that part sustainability and if I'm 

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:44.020
 in law I can no longer say beach hours 

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:48.550
 spent in games 

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:50.170
 no we'll put the night and I'll 

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:55.450
 show on ad more resistant than 

00:07:50.170 --> 00:08:01.270
 the name your look tombak so after a 

00:07:55.450 --> 00:08:04.180
 little zoom by that I put here not 

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:05.950
 really then you see well so I 

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.510
 make good live move and learn it 

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:09.460
 drop slightly but here so be 

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.630
 dogba attention that a good one 

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:13.480
 value and as can be seen when I 

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:14.920
 shoot it in flames so voila voila 

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:18.630
 it was a small video to show 

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.630
 gun ciao ciao
