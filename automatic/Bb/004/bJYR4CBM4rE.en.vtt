SATA<00:01:36.659> drives<00:01:36.990> all<00:01:37.829> right<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:40.079> is

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
SATA drives all right this is a this is

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.700 
SATA drives all right this is a this is
a<00:01:40.290> pull<00:01:40.710> tab<00:01:40.920> right<00:01:41.189> here<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:42.380> what<00:01:43.380> happens

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
a pull tab right here and what happens

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.210 
a pull tab right here and what happens
is<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.070> cd-rom<00:01:45.030> drives<00:01:45.479> come<00:01:45.720> right<00:01:45.899> back

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
is the cd-rom drives come right back

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.389 
is the cd-rom drives come right back
actually<00:01:47.220> this<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:48.329> one<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:50.100> doors<00:01:50.310> right

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
actually this this one the doors right

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.149 
actually this this one the doors right
here<00:01:50.689> right<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.840> think<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.290> one<00:01:52.409> goes<00:01:52.560> through

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
here right I think this one goes through

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:00.450 
here right I think this one goes through
because<00:01:53.280> no<00:01:53.610> room<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.030> back<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:57.590> hard

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460

blue things here so you can actually put
another<00:03:11.600> hard<00:03:12.380> drive<00:03:12.560> there<00:03:12.920> if<00:03:13.639> you<00:03:13.760> follow

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
another hard drive there if you follow

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.930 
another hard drive there if you follow
these<00:03:14.239> ports<00:03:14.630> around<00:03:15.040> you'll<00:03:16.040> see<00:03:16.220> there's<00:03:16.880> a

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
these ports around you'll see there's a

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.809 
these ports around you'll see there's a
there's<00:03:17.359> two<00:03:18.049> plugs<00:03:18.680> plugged<00:03:19.310> in<00:03:19.459> down<00:03:19.639> here

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
there's two plugs plugged in down here

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.610 
there's two plugs plugged in down here
the<00:03:19.970> orange<00:03:20.299> one<00:03:20.450> another<00:03:20.750> blue<00:03:21.290> one<00:03:21.319> there's

right we see on color there's two extra

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.390 
right we see on color there's two extra
ports<00:03:27.109> down<00:03:27.230> here<00:03:27.440> too<00:03:27.650> so<00:03:27.829> you<00:03:27.920> can<00:03:28.040> put<00:03:28.190> two

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
ports down here too so you can put two

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.240 
ports down here too so you can put two
more<00:03:28.609> SATA<00:03:29.109> driving<00:03:30.109> it<00:03:30.260> there's<00:03:30.799> a<00:03:30.920> bay<00:03:31.099> on

the bottom underneath the cd-rom drive

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.699 
the bottom underneath the cd-rom drive
they<00:03:35.180> could<00:03:35.420> put<00:03:35.540> another<00:03:35.720> cd-rom<00:03:36.260> drive<00:03:36.500> in

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
they could put another cd-rom drive in

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.140 
they could put another cd-rom drive in
there's<00:03:36.980> another<00:03:37.190> area<00:03:38.030> right<00:03:38.239> there<00:03:38.510> for<00:03:39.170> the

heads<00:04:21.079> down<00:04:21.259> here<00:04:22.539> underneath<00:04:23.539> this<00:04:23.780> one<00:04:23.960> and

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:24.259 
heads down here underneath this one and

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:25.960 
heads down here underneath this one and
there<00:04:24.500> is<00:04:24.530> a<00:04:24.680> power<00:04:24.979> there<00:04:25.250> is<00:04:25.610> a<00:04:25.639> power

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
there is a power there is a power

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
there is a power there is a power
connector<00:04:27.190> so<00:04:28.190> you<00:04:28.250> can<00:04:28.580> you<00:04:29.090> can<00:04:29.120> as<00:04:29.750> long<00:04:29.900> as

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
connector so you can you can as long as

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.050 
connector so you can you can as long as
you<00:04:30.080> get<00:04:30.199> another<00:04:30.380> cable<00:04:30.650> a<00:04:30.979> blue<00:04:31.580> cable<00:04:31.970> like

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
you get another cable a blue cable like

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.330 
you get another cable a blue cable like
this<00:04:32.090> or<00:04:32.630> red<00:04:33.350> it<00:04:33.590> could<00:04:33.770> be<00:04:33.889> orange<00:04:34.250> or

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
this or red it could be orange or

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.790 
this or red it could be orange or
whatever<00:04:34.580> all<00:04:35.300> right<00:04:35.360> you<00:04:36.320> can<00:04:36.470> put<00:04:36.500> another

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
whatever all right you can put another

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.620 
whatever all right you can put another
hard<00:04:37.160> drive<00:04:37.370> in<00:04:37.550> there<00:04:37.699> for<00:04:38.150> the<00:04:38.270> extra

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
hard drive in there for the extra

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.860 
hard drive in there for the extra
storage<00:04:38.949> so<00:04:39.949> that's<00:04:40.130> a<00:04:40.220> pretty<00:04:40.370> good<00:04:40.610> thing<00:04:41.090> so

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
storage so that's a pretty good thing so

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.689 
storage so that's a pretty good thing so
you<00:04:42.169> can't<00:04:42.410> put<00:04:42.590> another<00:04:42.770> CD<00:04:43.070> over<00:04:43.520> here

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699 
you can't put another CD over here

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:45.580 
you can't put another CD over here
because<00:04:43.970> there's<00:04:44.120> not<00:04:44.240> a<00:04:44.300> other<00:04:45.050> power<00:04:45.349> thing

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
because there's not a other power thing

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:46.930 
because there's not a other power thing
but<00:04:45.800> you<00:04:45.889> can't<00:04:46.160> put<00:04:46.310> another<00:04:46.490> hard<00:04:46.759> drive

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
but you can't put another hard drive

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.779 
but you can't put another hard drive
over<00:04:47.090> here<00:04:47.210> which<00:04:48.050> is<00:04:48.169> a<00:04:48.259> good<00:04:48.410> thing<00:04:48.440> so<00:04:49.190> to

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:49.789 
over here which is a good thing so to

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:51.730 
over here which is a good thing so to
put<00:04:49.970> this<00:04:50.090> all<00:04:50.270> back<00:04:50.389> together<00:04:50.599> one<00:04:51.530> hand

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
put this all back together one hand

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.659 
put this all back together one hand
