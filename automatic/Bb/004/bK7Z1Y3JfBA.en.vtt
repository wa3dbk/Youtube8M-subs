00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
picked up and the first thing you said

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.830 
picked up and the first thing you said
about<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.759> ID<00:01:50.880> thought<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> great<00:01:51.540> hand

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
about that ID thought it a great hand

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.440 
about that ID thought it a great hand
float<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.380> we've<00:01:52.979> got<00:01:53.189> more<00:01:53.850> applications

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
float so we've got more applications

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.850 
float so we've got more applications
than<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.689> maybe<00:01:55.170> same<00:01:55.470> may<00:01:55.590> be<00:01:55.619> said<00:01:55.710> of

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
than that maybe same may be said of

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.709 
than that maybe same may be said of
husband<00:01:56.399> Isis<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.850> duck<00:01:56.969> down<00:01:57.240> well<00:01:57.479> but

husband Isis of a duck down well but

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.410 
husband Isis of a duck down well but
absolutely<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:59.130> then<00:01:59.250> maybe<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.090> next<00:02:00.240> one

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
absolutely and then maybe the next one

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.580 
absolutely and then maybe the next one
would<00:02:00.570> come<00:02:00.689> through<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:00.990> couple<00:02:01.530> of

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
would come through is a couple of

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.840 
would come through is a couple of
dippers<00:02:01.860> which<00:02:02.009> are<00:02:02.130> obviously<00:02:02.369> great<00:02:02.820> for

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
dippers which are obviously great for

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.459 
dippers which are obviously great for
shallow<00:02:03.180> work<00:02:03.479> yeah<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:03.840> mean<00:02:04.049> this<00:02:04.229> one's

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
shallow work yeah I mean this one's

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.889 
shallow work yeah I mean this one's
really<00:02:04.890> like<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.640> just<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.030> typical<00:02:06.240> shouldered

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
really like a just a typical shouldered

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.499 
really like a just a typical shouldered
shallow<00:02:07.770> fishing<00:02:08.099> pattern<00:02:08.459> what<00:02:09.179> we<00:02:09.270> do<00:02:09.390> with

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
shallow fishing pattern what we do with

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.020 
shallow fishing pattern what we do with
that<00:02:09.539> one<00:02:09.750> for<00:02:09.959> Joe<00:02:10.280> channel<00:02:11.280> or<00:02:11.400> on<00:02:11.489> Shelikof

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
that one for Joe channel or on Shelikof

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.460 
that one for Joe channel or on Shelikof

and if Eli out to start to a three-foot
date<00:02:15.900> yeah<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.590> know<00:02:16.710> you<00:02:16.800> were<00:02:16.890> saying<00:02:17.100> you

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
date yeah I know you were saying you

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.920 
date yeah I know you were saying you
think<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.550> one's<00:02:17.730> probably<00:02:17.910> better<00:02:18.180> for<00:02:18.510> you

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
think that one's probably better for you

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.210 
think that one's probably better for you
wooden<00:02:19.200> deeper<00:02:19.440> down<00:02:19.560> in<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:19.800> water<00:02:19.980> what

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
wooden deeper down in the water what

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.710 
wooden deeper down in the water what
yeah<00:02:20.340> definitely<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:20.820> think<00:02:20.850> that<00:02:21.150> definitely

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
yeah definitely I think that definitely

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.620 
yeah definitely I think that definitely
very<00:02:22.470> far<00:02:22.710> for<00:02:22.950> yeah<00:02:23.520> absolutely<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:24.510> then

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
very far for yeah absolutely and then

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.740 
very far for yeah absolutely and then
this<00:02:24.840> one<00:02:25.080> maybe<00:02:25.590> for<00:02:26.100> shallow<00:02:26.540> yeah<00:02:27.540> this

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
this one maybe for shallow yeah this

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.900 
this one maybe for shallow yeah this
little<00:02:28.020> ice<00:02:28.860> is<00:02:29.010> like<00:02:29.070> a<00:02:29.130> little<00:02:29.400> in<00:02:29.460> life<00:02:29.610> slap

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
little ice is like a little in life slap

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.300 
little ice is like a little in life slap
before<00:02:30.270> I<00:02:30.440> absolutely<00:02:31.440> ideal<00:02:31.740> fishing<00:02:32.250> up

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
before I absolutely ideal fishing up

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.870 
before I absolutely ideal fishing up
just<00:02:32.520> off<00:02:32.640> of<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:33.030> foot<00:02:33.240> they<00:02:34.190> inline<00:02:35.190> flow<00:02:35.430> very

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
just off of a foot they inline flow very

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.520 
just off of a foot they inline flow very
strong<00:02:36.180> cat<00:02:36.450> really<00:02:36.690> get<00:02:36.810> this<00:02:36.870> float<00:02:37.110> angle

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
strong cat really get this float angle

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.320 
strong cat really get this float angle
because<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:37.800> lion<00:02:38.010> exits<00:02:38.340> at<00:02:38.460> the<00:02:38.520> top<00:02:38.730> I<00:02:39.060> know

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
because the lion exits at the top I know

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.630 
because the lion exits at the top I know
that's<00:02:39.600> not<00:02:40.170> brilliant<00:02:40.410> it's<00:02:41.040> an<00:02:41.100> angle<00:02:41.340> proof

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
that's not brilliant it's an angle proof

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.010 
that's not brilliant it's an angle proof
and<00:02:41.820> obviously<00:02:42.060> you<00:02:42.390> know<00:02:42.480> you're<00:02:42.600> not<00:02:42.750> as

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
and obviously you know you're not as

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.440 
and obviously you know you're not as
likely<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.380> damage<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.160> went<00:02:44.340> very<00:02:45.120> very

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
likely to damage it went very very

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.570

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
strong very strong flow and these

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.680 
strong very strong flow and these
diamonds<00:02:48.030> these<00:02:48.240> have<00:02:48.390> been<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.510> really

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
diamonds these have been a really

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.950 
diamonds these have been a really
popular<00:02:48.900> pattern<00:02:49.560> in<00:02:49.770> recent<00:02:50.130> years<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:50.370> mean

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
popular pattern in recent years I mean

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.450 
popular pattern in recent years I mean
there's<00:02:51.960> quite<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.230> few<00:02:52.290> other<00:02:52.710> ones<00:02:53.220> on<00:02:53.370> the

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
there's quite a few other ones on the

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.460 
there's quite a few other ones on the
market<00:02:53.490> but<00:02:54.090> this<00:02:54.390> one's<00:02:54.630> unique<00:02:54.840> really<00:02:55.230> and

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
market but this one's unique really and

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.890 
market but this one's unique really and
it's<00:02:55.650> little<00:02:55.890> bit<00:02:55.980> steeper<00:02:56.460> I<00:02:56.900> think

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
it's little bit steeper I think

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.500 
it's little bit steeper I think
obviously<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.260> spring<00:02:58.530> guy<00:02:58.680> on<00:02:58.800> it<00:02:58.950> as<00:02:59.040> well

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
obviously the spring guy on it as well

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.390 
obviously the spring guy on it as well
that's<00:03:00.510> going<00:03:00.690> to<00:03:00.750> last<00:03:00.930> after<00:03:01.440> swelling<00:03:01.980> yeah

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
that's going to last after swelling yeah

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.800 
that's going to last after swelling yeah
I<00:03:02.430> mean<00:03:02.670> like<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.240> say<00:03:03.450> I<00:03:03.480> mean<00:03:03.690> these

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
I mean like you say I mean these

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.660 
I mean like you say I mean these
patterns<00:03:04.260> have<00:03:04.320> been<00:03:04.380> familiar<00:03:04.680> what<00:03:05.040> really

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
patterns have been familiar what really

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.010 
patterns have been familiar what really
