00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:10.800
 Now , well, there it is and good, we continue 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.650

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.840
 how to do this was the uefa and 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.250
 We regret good we continue as 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.160
 they will realize that we are playing in 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.380
 third person and here is where you grab 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.230

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.330
 a bow and all that we're going to see for this 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.930
 side that is good is the top part 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.269
 where you grab 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.430
 the grenades and they are always firing 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.400
 and camping from above and here 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.010
 are the ads that break you with 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.920
 blows are breaking and then like here 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.280
 they break and a curious fact of the floor 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:52.359
 help that roll since he already wants pure 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:55.299

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.930
 they know they put their boxes to pick up 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.129
 more things and good we keep going up 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.280
 points here where they are always 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:09.129
 changing so they crouch like that so it's done 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:14.169
 to be like that either by dad dad there 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:16.150
 shit destroy and well we continue this 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:19.120
 side this is the red side the side locus 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.909
 and well there are also the grenades 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.519
 that here is another little pass I do not know what 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:27.450
 here I do not remember this on the map 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:31.450
 original but so 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.969
 and well here these and remember that the 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.190
 fire and these things and good 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:40.840
 let's run a little 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:44.280
 to throw square semen and good we go up and 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.800
 we come to the other respawn 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.170
 to this the other response and good is the same 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.050
 and this is the entrance and the exit 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:56.010
 as they realize there is nothing to 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:59.069
 outside and well this was more chavez than me 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.209
 he showed his map and well here he says money 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.390
 as he says in it 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.310
 in the original course and well then I 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.780
 I think this has taught train failure 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.239
 the little trains forgive 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.730
 look at the traffic is very beautiful is 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:14.220
 burned down I really like this detail 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:17.489
 that the fire has set it on fire 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.100
 and all that look at the train or not the truth 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.740
 this did do a lot of work, look, it's a 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.080
 train in fact today here there are more things here 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:29.430
