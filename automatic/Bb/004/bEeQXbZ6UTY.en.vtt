00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:08.040
 hello everyone welcome to my 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.309
 my husband's channel tomorrow birthdays 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.070
 decided to bake a napoleon cake but I don't 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.920
 very friendly with baking rather in this 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.780
 They are lazy and I decided to find a recipe 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:27.450
 such a lazy napoleon and such 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:30.750
 we get in the cut attacked very 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:33.480
 tasty and if you're curious 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.540
 keep looking and why 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.890
 have we attacked it be it because 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:44.040
 I take the dough ready it is 3g 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.000
 puff nauseous dough that is in turkey 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.000
 called milfy 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.340
 there are 20 squares here 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.980
 so here they are in half 20 pieces 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.309
 I always take the brand only super frieze 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.309
 tried other opinions on the taste of the dough 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.820
 like this brand so 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.000
 we will actually cook from this brand 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.380
 Next for the cream we need 2 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.930
 cups of milk 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.930
 better, of course, brother somewhere at grandmothers 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.659
 but I have no opportunity 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:21.299
 a glass of sugar 2 eggs three tablespoons 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.690
 flour and I add vanilla sugar 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.490
 this is if you like custard with 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.799
 vanilla sugar if not then can it 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.670
 do not add first thing we need dough 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.549
 defrost I'll be right on the baking sheet 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.520
 here it was defrosted packs were such 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.799
 corks which we are divided i so 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.869
 I will defrost so that the dough is not 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.520
 weathered 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:48.750
 bowl mix 1 glass of milk 2 eggs and 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.170
 flour and all this hours 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.350
 I will mix a separate blender 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.049
 bowl mix 2 glass of milk and a glass 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.790
 sugar and start to bring it all up 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.860
 boiling to simmer once 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.990
 start it all boil then pour in 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.700
 our rest of the mix is ​​a trickle and 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.190
 again bring to a boil 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.580
 same milk poured milk sugar 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.340
 the mixture and now it is necessary constantly stirring 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:24.050
 bring this mixture to a boil also 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:27.470
 has added vanilla sugar trial cream 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.980
 already thickened as you see now it is necessary 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.610
 so that it gets cold and when it gets cold 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.590
 it will still beat him a little dough 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.700
 our unfrozen ship warmed 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:44.180
 up to 200 degrees oven for 20-25 minutes 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.630
 before the appearance of such a brown crust here 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.880
 so they have us browned and rose 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.040
 so that they are not layers of these 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.959
 Napoleon is so high 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.720
 it will be necessary then when they cool down 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.580
 press them down a little bit and just 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.840
 those crumbs that will remain we will 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.620
 use to napoleon 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:08.870
 sprinkle each square on top I'm so 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:11.090
 press down her tree at all I do it 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:17.360
 of course but I hand inconvenient shows 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:21.440
 hand and it turns out just crumbs like 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.299
 times to sprinkle the top 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.670
 layer under start our cake to collect 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:32.130
 as you can see i press down 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:34.790
 each square is and now put 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.790
 cream h 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:44.340
 in principle, you can spare no napoleon 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.340
 must be pretty well soaked 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:02.120
 Here is such a cake after assembly 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.030
 as you can see, it turned out not so much 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:09.080
 too low is five layers 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.970
 on top I sprinkled some chips and how 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.960
 You can also see how the tank was lubricated. 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:20.030
 cream enough exactly butt on such 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:23.270
 the amount of dough and now our cake 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:27.070
 need to put soak somewhere on 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.070
 seven to eight hours cool place
