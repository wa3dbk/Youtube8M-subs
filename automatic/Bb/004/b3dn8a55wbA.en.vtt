00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.539 
that RC car so now I'm doing one on QB
AMAs<00:01:01.890> set<00:01:02.890> and<00:01:03.190> it's<00:01:04.409> it's<00:01:05.409> the<00:01:05.440> Sun<00:01:05.830> sunset

and like so yeah and so there it comes
with<00:01:16.300> like<00:01:16.509> cushy<00:01:16.869> tubes<00:01:17.280> right<00:01:18.280> here<00:01:18.490> and

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
with like cushy tubes right here and

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.300 
with like cushy tubes right here and
tippet<00:01:20.170> trampoline<00:01:20.649> I'll<00:01:20.860> show<00:01:21.009> you<00:01:21.130> what

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
tippet trampoline I'll show you what

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.559 
tippet trampoline I'll show you what
that<00:01:21.520> actually<00:01:21.549> does<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:24.250> it<00:01:24.369> just<00:01:24.610> goes<00:01:25.299> into

00:01:25.559 --> 00:01:25.569 
that actually does and it just goes into

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:27.809 
that actually does and it just goes into
the<00:01:25.720> Robin<00:01:26.500> for<00:01:26.679> testing<00:01:27.100> this<00:01:27.250> is<00:01:27.399> the<00:01:27.460> marble

00:01:27.809 --> 00:01:27.819 
the Robin for testing this is the marble

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:30.149 
the Robin for testing this is the marble
vortex<00:01:28.240> and<00:01:28.539> then<00:01:28.990> there's<00:01:29.200> these<00:01:29.380> cascade

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
vortex and then there's these cascade

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.760 
vortex and then there's these cascade
slits<00:01:30.690> when<00:01:31.690> you<00:01:31.750> put<00:01:31.959> them<00:01:32.110> in<00:01:32.259> the<00:01:32.350> Cascade

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
slits when you put them in the Cascade

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:41.330 
slits when you put them in the Cascade
slit<00:01:33.069> it<00:01:33.729> goes<00:01:33.940> down<00:01:34.179> like<00:01:34.299> that<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.979> then<00:01:39.600> so

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
slit it goes down like that and then so

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.570 
slit it goes down like that and then so
I've<00:01:42.340> been<00:01:42.670> wanting<00:01:43.149> this<00:01:43.179> for<00:01:43.479> about<00:01:44.580> three

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
I've been wanting this for about three

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.240 
I've been wanting this for about three
months<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:49.080> so<00:01:50.080> it<00:01:50.319> comes<00:01:50.500> with<00:01:50.679> so<00:01:51.009> once

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
months and so it comes with so once

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.440 
months and so it comes with so once
you're<00:01:51.369> done<00:01:51.520> with<00:01:51.640> it<00:01:51.819> it<00:01:51.910> comes<00:01:52.060> with<00:01:52.179> like

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
you're done with it it comes with like

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.800 
you're done with it it comes with like
uh<00:01:52.660> extra<00:01:53.319> pieces<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:54.250> I<00:01:55.060> am<00:01:55.269> no<00:01:55.509> idea<00:01:55.720> with

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
uh extra pieces and I am no idea with

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.719 
uh extra pieces and I am no idea with
this<00:01:55.959> and<00:01:56.170> forth<00:01:56.379> but<00:01:56.950> I<00:01:56.979> think<00:01:57.129> you<00:01:57.429> can<00:01:57.580> like

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
this and forth but I think you can like

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.589 
this and forth but I think you can like
add<00:01:58.060> mods<00:01:58.269> to<00:01:58.539> it<00:01:58.660> and<00:01:58.869> yourself<00:01:59.170> and<00:01:59.769> so<00:02:00.399> it<00:02:01.119> so

00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:01.599 
add mods to it and yourself and so it so

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:09.419 
add mods to it and yourself and so it so
there<00:02:02.050> are<00:02:02.259> there<00:02:02.890> are<00:02:03.750> type<00:02:04.750> there<00:02:05.349> are<00:02:08.429> types

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
there are there are type there are types

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:17.430 
there are there are type there are types
of<00:02:13.530> so<00:02:14.530> there<00:02:14.769> are<00:02:14.819> three<00:02:15.819> types<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.480> since

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
of so there are three types and since

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.430 
of so there are three types and since
most<00:02:18.310> of<00:02:18.519> them<00:02:18.670> are<00:02:18.849> on<00:02:19.150> here<00:02:19.420> so<00:02:19.690> here's<00:02:20.260> our

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
most of them are on here so here's our

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.729 
most of them are on here so here's our
two<00:02:20.590> ism<00:02:20.920> this<00:02:21.640> is<00:02:21.849> a<00:02:21.879> double<00:02:22.300> exit<00:02:22.690> so<00:02:23.560> like

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
two ism this is a double exit so like

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.170 
two ism this is a double exit so like
the<00:02:23.890> mob<00:02:24.069> will<00:02:24.250> chooses<00:02:24.610> which<00:02:24.790> way<00:02:25.000> in<00:02:25.060> it

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
the mob will chooses which way in it

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.149 
the mob will chooses which way in it
just<00:02:25.420> went<00:02:25.599> that<00:02:25.720> way<00:02:25.930> mesh<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:26.769> then<00:02:26.980> there's

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
just went that way mesh and then there's

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.930 
just went that way mesh and then there's
a<00:02:27.310> bottom<00:02:27.879> exit<00:02:28.180> when<00:02:28.540> so<00:02:29.200> when<00:02:29.890> it<00:02:30.489> drops<00:02:30.730> in

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
a bottom exit when so when it drops in

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.360 
a bottom exit when so when it drops in
the<00:02:31.060> marble<00:02:31.739> dish<00:02:32.739> goes<00:02:33.010> straight<00:02:33.310> through

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
the marble dish goes straight through

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.830 
the marble dish goes straight through
the<00:02:33.670> bottom<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:34.540> then<00:02:35.349> there's<00:02:35.590> also<00:02:36.840> single

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
the bottom and then there's also single

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.610 
the bottom and then there's also single
exits

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.600 

single<00:02:42.620> exit<00:02:42.920> this<00:02:43.160> is<00:02:43.340> a<00:02:43.370> single<00:02:43.760> exit<00:02:45.610> this

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
single exit this is a single exit this

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.670 
single exit this is a single exit this
is<00:02:46.850> a<00:02:46.880> single<00:02:47.300> exit<00:02:47.630> when<00:02:48.170> there's<00:02:48.380> just<00:02:48.440> an

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
is a single exit when there's just an

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.890 
is a single exit when there's just an
exit<00:02:49.010> on<00:02:49.070> one<00:02:49.280> side<00:02:49.550> and<00:02:50.710> that's<00:02:51.710> all<00:02:52.100> and<00:02:52.900> this

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
exit on one side and that's all and this

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.990 
exit on one side and that's all and this
is<00:02:54.170> a<00:02:54.200> joke<00:02:54.590> like<00:02:54.740> basically<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.430> cursor<00:02:55.760> tips

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
is a joke like basically the cursor tips

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.870 
is a joke like basically the cursor tips
it<00:02:56.450> goes<00:02:56.750> like<00:02:57.020> a<00:02:57.200> dropper<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:58.070> then<00:02:58.280> it

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
it goes like a dropper and then it

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.210 
it goes like a dropper and then it
thinks<00:02:59.180> like<00:02:59.270> goes<00:02:59.600> follows<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.530> tube<00:03:00.740> and

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
thinks like goes follows the tube and

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.900 
thinks like goes follows the tube and
then<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.430> vortex<00:03:02.890> it<00:03:03.890> just<00:03:04.220> spins<00:03:04.460> around<00:03:04.640> in

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
then the vortex it just spins around in

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.030 
then the vortex it just spins around in
a<00:03:04.970> circle<00:03:05.210> like<00:03:05.480> that<00:03:05.680> until<00:03:06.680> it<00:03:06.830> drops

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
a circle like that until it drops

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:14.160 
a circle like that until it drops
through<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:07.490> hole<00:03:07.670> and<00:03:08.140> then<00:03:09.140> trampoline

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.979 

that's<00:03:15.170> just<00:03:15.350> juice<00:03:15.560> that<00:03:15.770> just<00:03:16.370> oh<00:03:19.360> yeah<00:03:20.360> that
