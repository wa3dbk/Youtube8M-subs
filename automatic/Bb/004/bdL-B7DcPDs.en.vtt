00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
echo chord and put that into flashback

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.890 
echo chord and put that into flashback
x4<00:02:12.769> but<00:02:13.610> with<00:02:13.760> all<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:14.060> benefits<00:02:14.239> that<00:02:14.629> get

x4 but with all the benefits that get

x4 but with all the benefits that get
from<00:02:15.080> flashback<00:02:15.500> x4<00:02:15.620> so<00:02:16.220> that<00:02:16.400> is<00:02:16.550> no<00:02:16.940> noise

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
from flashback x4 so that is no noise

another<00:02:30.190> reason<00:02:30.610> for<00:02:30.850> this<00:02:31.420> is<00:02:31.750> that<00:02:32.110> there's

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
another reason for this is that there's

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.750 
another reason for this is that there's
all<00:02:32.500> these<00:02:32.770> little<00:02:33.130> quirks<00:02:33.370> with<00:02:33.640> all

it's<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.650> little<00:02:35.920> bit<00:02:36.010> noisy<00:02:36.510> but<00:02:37.510> let's<00:02:37.690> just

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
it's a little bit noisy but let's just

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.460 
it's a little bit noisy but let's just
try<00:02:38.080> to<00:02:38.140> turn<00:02:38.380> on<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.740> delayed<00:02:39.960> and<00:02:40.960> you'll

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
try to turn on the delayed and you'll

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.250 
try to turn on the delayed and you'll
notice<00:02:42.060> why<00:02:43.060> you<00:02:43.120> maybe<00:02:43.720> want<00:02:43.960> to<00:02:44.020> use

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
notice why you maybe want to use

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.930 
notice why you maybe want to use
something<00:02:44.500> you<00:02:44.680> want<00:02:45.010> let's<00:02:45.670> see<00:02:47.490> and<00:02:48.490> I'll

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
something you want let's see and I'll

00:02:48.940 --> 00:03:10.690 
something you want let's see and I'll
turn<00:02:49.600> it<00:02:49.750> on

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.520 

well<00:03:10.910> I<00:03:11.240> kind<00:03:11.540> of<00:03:11.599> figured<00:03:11.900> you<00:03:11.990> guys<00:03:12.140> didn't

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
well I kind of figured you guys didn't

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.600 
well I kind of figured you guys didn't
want<00:03:12.650> to<00:03:12.740> spend<00:03:12.860> an<00:03:13.010> entire<00:03:13.160> day<00:03:13.370> just

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
watching me noodle away on the computer

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.520 
watching me noodle away on the computer
and<00:03:16.520> maybe<00:03:16.640> play<00:03:17.150> a<00:03:17.180> couple<00:03:17.420> of<00:03:17.540> bunks<00:03:18.290> and

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
and maybe play a couple of bunks and

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.800 
and maybe play a couple of bunks and
Lincoln<00:03:18.770> table<00:03:18.950> once<00:03:19.190> in<00:03:19.310> a<00:03:19.370> while<00:03:19.810> we're

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
Lincoln table once in a while we're

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.910 
Lincoln table once in a while we're
actually<00:03:20.900> here<00:03:21.170> at<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.380> final<00:03:21.709> result<00:03:22.510> and

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
actually here at the final result and

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.070 
actually here at the final result and
I'm<00:03:24.920> a<00:03:25.040> bit<00:03:25.190> tired<00:03:25.400> now<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:26.660> game<00:03:26.840> that's

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
I'm a bit tired now the game that's

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.510 
I'm a bit tired now the game that's
definitely<00:03:27.590> tired<00:03:27.800> from<00:03:27.980> being<00:03:28.190> turned<00:03:28.340> on

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
definitely tired from being turned on

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.350 
definitely tired from being turned on
the<00:03:28.700> entire<00:03:29.000> day

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
the entire day

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.460 
the entire day
hence<00:03:29.690> all<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.050> noise<00:03:31.150> but<00:03:32.150> let's<00:03:33.110> check<00:03:33.380> it

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
hence all the noise but let's check it

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.199 
hence all the noise but let's check it
out<00:03:33.590> this<00:03:33.890> is<00:03:34.040> actually<00:03:34.550> the<00:03:34.730> sound<00:03:34.910> that<00:03:35.150> you

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
out this is actually the sound that you

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.570 
out this is actually the sound that you
will<00:03:35.330> get<00:03:35.480> when<00:03:36.110> you<00:03:36.260> buy<00:03:36.470> a<00:03:36.500> flashback<00:03:37.040> x4<00:03:37.190> and

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
will get when you buy a flashback x4 and

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.820 
will get when you buy a flashback x4 and
set<00:03:37.760> it<00:03:37.880> to<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.209> to<00:03:39.019> the<00:03:39.140> tube<00:03:39.350> setting<00:03:39.709> up

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
set it to the to the tube setting up

00:03:39.830 --> 00:04:09.229 
set it to the to the tube setting up
here

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.760 

and<00:04:10.239> just<00:04:10.599> the<00:04:10.690> fun<00:04:10.870> that's<00:04:11.080> compared<00:04:11.470> to<00:04:11.650> the

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
and just the fun that's compared to the

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:46.420 
and just the fun that's compared to the
original<00:04:11.920> a<00:04:12.400> coke<00:04:12.580> or

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.610 

there<00:04:47.430> you<00:04:47.490> go
