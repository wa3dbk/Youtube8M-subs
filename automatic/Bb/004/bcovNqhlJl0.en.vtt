00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:10.090
 hello friends look at the idea that I'm going 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:14.019
 to teach how to use how to transfer games 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:17.890
 or files with music or whatever from 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:20.439
 your computer to the console to the psp without 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.259
 use any type of cable only 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.630
 using the wifi network that you are on 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:28.150
 in your case 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.420
 for it obviously gives them two things 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.940
 First 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.840
 you have the blocking console in this 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:39.650
 case my console is blocked with the 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:42.050
 6.6 process and the second install a 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.460
 program that is called 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.460
 but from here 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.820
 with games 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:59.000
 and here is 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:03.320
 the pspv or a people also look for it in 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.049
 internet as stpsp 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:10.890
 the idea of ​​this program is to convert your 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:15.540
 console on an ftp server so that you 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.540
 you can transfer or extract data from 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.259
 the console wirelessly through 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.259
 your computer 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.550
 as if it were any game 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.900
 it is charging 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.229
 already the first thing he's going to do is 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.420
 ask what kind of connection do we have 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:48.000
 I have several I will choose the one 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.720
 I have here in the house the last 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.350
 and now that the wifi light went on 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.720
 is configuring the server is 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.750
 testing the network and at any time 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.240
 give me the address and the 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.480
 direction as to where to connect them 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:13.480
 you need to remove 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:16.010
 es a fps 98.168 punto 1.3 ok this 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.190
 we could for a moment we here we go 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.819
 to the console we go to the we go to the 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.189
 pc 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.340
 ok I do not have to move away a little bit because 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:28.109
 they invited me a little big ok me in 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.659
 this case I'm using ubuntu but it gives what 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:31.530
 same if you are split you can use it with 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.900
 windows 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.840
 the program that I use to transfer 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.870
 It is simply that this sub- section 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:45.960
 environment even planting android 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.960
 in my case for miami home 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.870
 and here I have the single of all 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.180
 ways 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.780
 you can also download it what 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.920
 have ubuntu and can download it from 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.920
 ubuntu software center 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.489
 it is free 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.480
 in my case I then have to do 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.260
 in the File 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.260
 simple 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:22.270
 here it is necessary to be granite 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.390
 in my case I already have it installed if 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:28.510
 they want if you should not install and it does 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.970
 immediately officially the 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.550
 avoided the risk of contracting any 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.160
 virus when your typical dpt those 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.140
 web pages that go down and entered half take 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.730
 a lot of typical things he chose 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.830
 executable files that he should not 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.660
 be there normally all your 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.080
 programs are not only compressed 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:50.430
 does not enter the uncle deputy 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.800
 ok as I told you, we are going to execute it in 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.319
 simple 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.689
 okay 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:00.800
 this is the program is very simple to use 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:03.260
 the only thing I have to add is 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.720
 the server address that in this 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.960
 case the sound of remember it is 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.450
 that address 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:13.630
 192 points 107 points 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.840
 ok it will not add so well 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:20.889
 in the period 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:25.380
 point 168 point 1.3 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:29.520
 and I'm going to fast connection 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:31.290
 ok it costs him to appear a series of 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.900
 commands below are automatic they do not have 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.810
 to do anything 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:39.280
 and on the other side appears on this site 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.280
 remote here is the p esp 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:45.949
 and is also from the console 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:48.949
 also not only the teams so much 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:48.949
 is 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.650
 very good to be brief is with this 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.860
 recording you go to bed I can 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:01.030
 navigate through browse through 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:06.220
 the console remotely 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:09.550
 in this case I'm going to see a music 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:14.050
 so that to do it fast only 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:16.320
 then let's choose music the team 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.860
 of things 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.860
 or what 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.610
 although we are going to choose this file 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:29.229
 from this 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:31.270
 and those five medias is not very fast and 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:35.740
 the only thing that imagines if it were a 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:37.810
 game they would go to the iso folder and 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.920
 inside of folder did drag sail 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:43.160
 in this case to start music follow 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:48.470
 so what I will do is 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:50.890
 in the music music folder and select 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.890
 archive 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:58.049
 he dragged it he took the traces where 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.639
 example is loose and 

00:05:58.049 --> 00:06:02.590
 automatically starts the 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:05.580
 transfer of assets 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.580
 And here too 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.750
 and 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:14.920
 just finished the reference 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:19.360
 I already add it to the site 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:24.540
 and to finish a file that you 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:27.260
 they have to leave the console tighten the 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:30.669
 square 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:34.360
 and close the server 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:36.900
 return to the main menu 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.040
 as the moment we return to the main 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.690
 in this 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:46.050
 in this case as cheerful an active 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:46.050
 music whose music you select 

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:59.240
 it's super simple to use is much more 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.669
 comfortable to do with the channel for all 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.689
 parts and I recommend it 

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:04.689
 I recommend them too 

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:11.590
 and that also install the end follows 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:14.820
 for android if you want me to wait 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:18.420
 directly your cell phone to the console 

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:21.640
 are yes to replace that cell phone 

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:24.220
 have the ability to make point 

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.670
 anchoring cause thoroughly that you can 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:29.540
 share 

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:30.650
 on the internet that is ideal for 

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:35.090
 find 

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:37.550
 on his cell phone I have my motorola 

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:39.920
 via cellular Wi-Fi to the console 

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:42.140
 also as it can not be with a tablet 

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.030
 or judges thousands of things with this 

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:47.450
 program really recommend it 

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:49.440
 much now on the console as they see the 

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:51.680
 sewing that sells you to 2 

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:54.650
 as you realize you are 

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:59.330
 but for dust but this sin does not have 

00:07:54.650 --> 00:08:02.930
 absolutely no any line in the 

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:06.610
 screen nothing is as new it does not have 

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:06.610
 no fault anymore 

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:14.530
 that's all I hope it was 

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:14.530
 clear and now I say it to market
