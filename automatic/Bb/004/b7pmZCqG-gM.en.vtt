00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.960
 when metro 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.960
 she once 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:33.650
 Generally hello continue briefly 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:40.260
 fix cooking legs and here i am 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:43.559
 drilled a hole cut pieces and already 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:48.140
 I'm starting to process the map in detail 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:52.280
 all this show well I think that 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:57.239
 I want to wave viewers of my channel people 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:59.940
 technically literate and more than confident 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.030
 what i'm curious about them is to look at 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:08.060
 how I just without any frills 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:13.560
 drill metal or drill this plastic 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.960
 no good for themselves they are not 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.600
 gleaned 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.990
 on informativeness can only be compared 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.209
 so here i would take off see how i eat 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.209
 buns or picking my nose 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:37.050
 okay evil stuff 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.000
 that slap a particular file emery 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.520
 mykarta 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.880
 very quickly throughout though worth 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.729
 burnt ebony smell 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:51.000
 as we said our time at work 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.459
 it smells like electricity even the cat started 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.660
 sneeze 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:02:01.619
 so I recommend doing the left 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:06.000
 no strangers either with good 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:12.500
 very exhausting but patience and work all 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:17.960
 let's continue for a minute and 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:23.480
 well here are the contours of the workpiece blanks under 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:27.230
 lining ready to form m3 up to the hole 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:31.730
 I drilled right under the riveter material 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:35.510
 and squeezed them respectively screw and well 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.730
 I was lucky that the rivets I have under 6 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:44.290
 millimeters and vintage respectively 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.290
 so too at this stage with the overlays all
