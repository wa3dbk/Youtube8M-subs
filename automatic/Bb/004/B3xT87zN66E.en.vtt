00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 IMAGINE AN ​​ALTERNATIVE WORLD 

00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:19.001
 WITH YOUR OWN GRAVITY 

00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:23.002
 WELL ABOVE OUR 

00:00:25.503 --> 00:00:27.003
 What is your name? 

00:00:27.004 --> 00:00:30.004
 - I can not talk to you. "Why not?" 

00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:31.505
 You come from below. 

00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:33.006
 I'm Adam. 

00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:40.007
 Three underdogs were arrested last week to increase tensions. 

00:00:40.508 --> 00:00:41.508
 We did not go to the underworld. 

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:44.009
 And we certainly do not want them in our world. 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.010
 THE LAWS OF THE UNIVERSE BETWEEN THEM 

00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:51.500
 The separation is total between the two worlds. No contact with those above. 

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:56.512
 NOTHING CAN BE SEPARATED 

00:00:57.013 --> 00:01:00.013
 What if we could go wherever we wanted? 

00:01:01.514 --> 00:01:02.314
 Police! 

00:01:03.515 --> 00:01:05.515
 Adam! 

00:01:12.016 --> 00:01:14.016
 Contact her again and this will cost you her life. 

00:01:15.017 --> 00:01:16.017
 I need your help. 

00:01:17.018 --> 00:01:18.018
 What is your plan? 

00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:21.319
 "We have to find her." "If you go up there, you're going to kill yourself. 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.020
 - All against the wall! - I have to go. 

00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:35.020
 - No. - Hey! 

00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:37.020
 IN THIS YEAR 

00:01:38.021 --> 00:01:40.020
 The police began the hunt for the fugitive. 

00:01:42.021 --> 00:01:43.020
 LOVE WILL CHANGE 

00:01:44.021 --> 00:01:47.020
 If I have a glimmer of hope, I will not hesitate. 

00:01:49.021 --> 00:01:51.020
 OUR VISION OF THE WORLD 

00:01:56.021 --> 00:01:58.020
 - Do not let go! - I'm sorry. 

00:02:00.021 --> 00:02:03.020
 UPSIDE DOWN 

00:02:03.021 --> 00:02:06.021
