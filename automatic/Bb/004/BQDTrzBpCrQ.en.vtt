what<00:01:13.920> direction<00:01:14.280> they<00:01:14.520> going<00:01:15.030> with<00:01:15.180> this

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
what direction they going with this

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.660 
what direction they going with this
maybe<00:01:15.720> like<00:01:15.990> an<00:01:16.140> open<00:01:16.470> map<00:01:16.650> that's<00:01:16.920> like<00:01:17.100> it

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
maybe like an open map that's like it
