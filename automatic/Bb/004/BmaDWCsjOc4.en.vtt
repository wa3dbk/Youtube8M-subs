00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:03.150
 children today we talk about the sea 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.150
 you would like some sea in your room, no mothers or grandmothers 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.809
 worry we won't send to the floor we'll build an aquarium 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:12.530
 naturally the lean mass 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.530
 with the little thumb and colored christmas card d 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.250
 to make our aquarium 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.029
 take a drawing card of a good 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.279
 with this we realize the base that we can make different squared shapes 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.919
 or post 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.380
 let's build a round shape, for example 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.110
 and to make it come from the kitchen of the hand of the grandmother we take a dish that goes 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.250
 we can do it on the cardboard, holding it firmly, and we eliminate a proper circle 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.540
 so careful to follow the shape 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.350
 one we cut the body shape 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.910
 and starting from the edge towards the inside of the card always following ours 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.910
 drawings 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.060
 here ready at the base of our new aquarium we do not throw away cardboard 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.119
 remaining we will need to build the inhabitants of the sea 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.140
 Let's start with a nice puffer fish 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.740
 let's start with the prombron that sends you castle we put on the sheet 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.590
 we draw careful outline to follow the shape 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.200
 now we can imagine the fins the caudal fins that is the tail and with a 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.030
 bright color we can eat the cow the eye and if you want even gills 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.030
 teams 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.850
 how do you see our first summer fish? 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.920
 no matter if it is not perfect the final magic will make it beautiful 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.810
 you can billiards cut all types of pools 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.810
 just like I do 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.420
 door for this iphone 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.760
 to get the true marine effect we take some adhesive paper 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.969
 transparent 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:18.889
 colorful resources of an asset 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:20.309
 and we apply ours 

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:23.309
 right in these 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:31.229
 now we cut the adhesive paper following DVD 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:35.819
 we place our fish as we like at the bottom of the aquarium 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:50.249
 we recover everything with a sheet of transparent adhesive paper 

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:52.010
 and the game 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.010
 ie the aquarium epa 

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:01.859
 you can enrich aquariums with striped corals and all kinds of fish 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:02.519
 little ones 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.129
 up to get fantastic aquariums to hang on your room 

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:09.479
