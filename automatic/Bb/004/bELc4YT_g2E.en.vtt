 of the child is oregano and ground cumin that 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.930
 this the dressings that although I always 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.050
 I 'm going to put mushrooms all my life 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.430
 say laminated peas I'm not going to 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.240
 put diamond in instant quotes 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.410
 obviously olive oil oil and 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.260
 also with three bales that can 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.820
 chop into cubes and these freire 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.430
 they are put up and when the dish 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.930
 is finished so now we are going to 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.990
 start with the first we have the 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:50.970
 warm it up let's put the chicken 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.970
 so that having a little 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.840
 It is such 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.580
 and we are going to do it 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.460
 a few minutes when we see that 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:17.670
 it is getting white 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.670
 outside and highlighting the chicken 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.740
 where 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.740
 I believe that everything comes 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.800
 still not completely koster 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:38.280
 obviously to release a bit of 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:40.910
 flavor in oil with the chicken piece 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.910
 I 'm going to 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.990
 but ye 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.290
 the garlic 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.040
 we will let it go by cutting the 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.040
 vegetable 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.780
 now we will add feeling 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.970
 one hour 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.780
 to 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.020
 a few minutes and then we add the 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.330
 chicken 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.330
 We will arrive with the chicken companies 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.750
 let's add him to the roads 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.979
 the cumin 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.900
 the oregano 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.449
 we remove 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.860
 with care that was in the dams of 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:43.860
 chicken from the pot 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.350
 about a liter of water out there 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.600
 little bit less 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.320
 You left that chicken because it was almost 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.320
 almost covered 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:06.830
 we also tested how salt is if 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.490
 we need to rectify and if not 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:13.990
 we leave like this and this we cover and what 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:18.070
 we let the water start to boil 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.070
 because he has put faith 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.820
 t 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:25.940
 when the water is already boiling 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.410
 we will add the peas save dates and 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:31.250
 the mushrooms because as they are already 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:34.080
 cooked simply is for them to take a 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:38.620
 little bit of flavor along with the chicken 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:40.870
 about ten bright minutes 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.160
 well now we will start to put the 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.020
 green peas 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.790
 I'm going to put 600 grams because 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.790
 carboncito is 300 grams 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.740
 and of this opinion 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:08.729
 ah 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:23.100
 and we let this be so 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:25.500
 less about 10 or 20 minutes more in the 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:29.550
 pot good girls silver is 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:33.360
 finished here is the chicken housed or 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:36.990
 a pea and its potato chips in 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:39.240
 square on top with your caldito and 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:41.550
 let's see that it is delicious so if not 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:44.490
 name I never encourage you to try it 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:46.950
