look and you can kind of find i mean
every<00:00:55.199> time<00:00:55.379> there's<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.920> new<00:00:55.949> device<00:00:56.309> coming

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
every time there's a new device coming

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.639 
every time there's a new device coming
out<00:00:56.850> on<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.030> market<00:00:57.090> like<00:00:57.539> with<00:00:58.079> radio

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
out on the market like with radio

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.860 
out on the market like with radio
features<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.520> things<00:00:59.699> it<00:01:00.030> needs<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.719> go

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
features and things it needs to go

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.889 
features and things it needs to go
through<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.440> FCC<00:01:02.059> and<00:01:03.059> then<00:01:03.449> they<00:01:03.660> kind<00:01:03.870> of

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
through this FCC and then they kind of

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.840 
through this FCC and then they kind of
like<00:01:04.049> me<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.409> have<00:01:04.619> pictures<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.549> device

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
like me to have pictures of the device

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.420 
like me to have pictures of the device
and<00:01:06.240> then<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.560> seems<00:01:07.740> like<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.040> was<00:01:08.280> probably

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
and then it seems like this was probably

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.830 
and then it seems like this was probably
going<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.760> be<00:01:08.820> based<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.240> LG<00:01:09.510> g2

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
going to be based on the LG g2

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.649 
going to be based on the LG g2
smartphone<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.830> 5-inch<00:01:11.280> phone<00:01:11.520> 1080p<00:01:12.150> screen

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
smartphone so 5-inch phone 1080p screen

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.130 
smartphone so 5-inch phone 1080p screen
second<00:01:13.200> episode<00:01:13.439> camera<00:01:14.369> probably<00:01:14.990> you<00:01:15.990> can

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
second episode camera probably you can

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.200 
second episode camera probably you can
see<00:01:16.259> here<00:01:16.470> also<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.830> back<00:01:17.100> looks<00:01:17.610> very<00:01:18.060> very

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
see here also the back looks very very

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.609 
see here also the back looks very very
similar<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:19.310> anything<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.030> did<00:01:21.270> see<00:01:21.720> on

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
similar to anything that we did see on

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.870 
similar to anything that we did see on
them<00:01:23.689> on<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:25.170> leak<00:01:25.320> with<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.799> big<00:01:25.950> sensor<00:01:26.520> and

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
them on the leak with the big sensor and

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.999 
them on the leak with the big sensor and
we<00:01:27.540> don't<00:01:27.689> have<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.930> nexus<00:01:28.229> text<00:01:28.619> here<00:01:28.799> it's

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
we don't have the nexus text here it's

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.740 
we don't have the nexus text here it's
probably<00:01:29.310> just<00:01:29.430> because<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.880> maybe<00:01:30.509> has<00:01:30.720> a

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
probably just because it maybe has a

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.109 
probably just because it maybe has a
shell<00:01:31.140> on<00:01:31.170> top<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.400> can<00:01:32.549> see<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.759> text

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
shell on top of it you can see the text

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.200 
shell on top of it you can see the text
not<00:01:33.270> for<00:01:33.509> sale<00:01:33.780> here<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.530> we<00:01:35.220> can<00:01:35.759> expect<00:01:36.060> on

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
not for sale here and we can expect on

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.600 
not for sale here and we can expect on
this<00:01:36.360> device<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:37.020> you'll<00:01:37.380> probably<00:01:37.680> be<00:01:38.220> be

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
this device and you'll probably be be

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.230 
this device and you'll probably be be
based<00:01:39.000> on<00:01:39.829> dg2<00:01:40.829> same<00:01:41.579> as<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.880> think<00:01:42.090> the

based on dg2 same as I think the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.249 
based on dg2 same as I think the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
optimist LG optimus G the next for most

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.859 
optimist LG optimus G the next for most
based<00:01:46.470> on<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.890> optimus<00:01:47.220> G<00:01:47.520> last<00:01:47.820> year<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:48.420> the

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
based on the optimus G last year so the

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.530 
based on the optimus G last year so the
plugin<00:01:49.259> CLG<00:01:49.860> doing<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.280> same<00:01:50.430> thing<00:01:50.759> at<00:01:51.149> this

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
plugin CLG doing the same thing at this

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.260 
plugin CLG doing the same thing at this
time<00:01:51.810> around<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.680> phone<00:01:52.890> also<00:01:53.159> probably<00:01:53.700> will

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
time around the phone also probably will

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.929 
time around the phone also probably will
have<00:01:54.509> android<00:01:54.869> 4.4<00:01:55.170> Kit<00:01:55.649> Kats<00:01:56.040> can<00:01:56.759> be<00:01:56.850> the
