00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
people you get a new one activated if

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.150 
people you get a new one activated if
you<00:00:33.899> look<00:00:34.020> on<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.260> right<00:00:34.410> hand<00:00:34.590> side<00:00:34.739> you'll

genesis types i believe in within the

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.990 
genesis types i believe in within the
game<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.670> they<00:00:54.210> are<00:00:54.390> bio<00:00:55.199> necro<00:00:56.070> quantum

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
game and they are bio necro quantum

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.290 
game and they are bio necro quantum
plasma<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.140> cyber<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.129> no<00:00:59.850> i<00:00:59.879> don't<00:01:00.180> mean

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
disgusting and not what I think max this

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.640 
disgusting and not what I think max this
was<00:01:07.439> really<00:01:07.650> going<00:01:08.010> for<00:01:08.280> if<00:01:09.020> we<00:01:10.020> have<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.500> look

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
was really going for if we have a look

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.910 
was really going for if we have a look
at<00:01:10.860> bio<00:01:11.450> dead<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.479> green<00:01:13.200> guys<00:01:13.500> are<00:01:13.770> definitely

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
at bio dead a green guys are definitely

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.590 
at bio dead a green guys are definitely
coming<00:01:14.220> like<00:01:14.490> color-coded<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.330> it's<00:01:15.450> not<00:01:15.540> that

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
coming like color-coded so it's not that

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.410 
coming like color-coded so it's not that
hard<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.020> tell<00:01:16.290> about<00:01:16.470> Viper<00:01:17.130> here<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.790> then

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
hard to tell about Viper here and then

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.340 
hard to tell about Viper here and then
we've<00:01:18.540> got<00:01:18.570> sage<00:01:19.580> he's<00:01:20.580> arranged<00:01:21.180> healer<00:01:21.450> they

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
we've got sage he's arranged healer they

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.420 
we've got sage he's arranged healer they
deal<00:01:22.530> more<00:01:22.799> with<00:01:23.060> plants<00:01:24.060> animals<00:01:25.430> throwing

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
deal more with plants animals throwing

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.940 
deal more with plants animals throwing
up<00:01:26.549> neat<00:01:27.030> nature<00:01:27.689> type<00:01:27.900> stuff<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:28.560> that's<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
up neat nature type stuff so that's the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.990 
up neat nature type stuff so that's the
kind<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.189> path<00:01:29.430> they<00:01:29.700> go<00:01:29.909> down<00:01:30.200> then<00:01:31.200> we<00:01:31.439> have

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
kind of path they go down then we have

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.270 
kind of path they go down then we have
quantum<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.180> if<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.390> just<00:01:33.570> click<00:01:33.900> on<00:01:33.990> fire<00:01:34.229> as<00:01:35.159> we

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
quantum so if I just click on fire as we

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.510 
quantum so if I just click on fire as we
look<00:01:35.430> at<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:36.479> types<00:01:36.689> you'll<00:01:36.900> get<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.400> quick<00:01:38.400> on

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
look at the types you'll get a quick on

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.789 
look at the types you'll get a quick on
the<00:01:38.579> next<00:01:38.820> one<00:01:38.909> which<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.060> necro<00:01:39.689> these<00:01:40.530> are

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
the next one which is necro these are

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.950 
the next one which is necro these are
more<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.880> deal<00:01:42.060> with<00:01:42.270> life<00:01:42.720> steal<00:01:43.340> fear<00:01:44.960> more

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
more and deal with life steal fear more

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.810 
more and deal with life steal fear more
your<00:01:46.290> kind<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.590> like<00:01:46.740> deaf<00:01:47.009> war<00:01:47.280> key<00:01:47.640> type

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
your kind of like deaf war key type

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.399 
your kind of like deaf war key type
stuff<00:01:48.210> if<00:01:48.420> we<00:01:48.630> go<00:01:48.840> over<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:49.110> rave<00:01:50.100> over<00:01:50.340> he<00:01:50.490> has<00:01:50.909> a

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
stuff if we go over a rave over he has a

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.380 
stuff if we go over a rave over he has a
terrifying<00:01:52.409> ghost<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.700> life<00:01:53.909> cycle<00:01:54.180> in

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
terrifying ghost and a life cycle in

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.319 
terrifying ghost and a life cycle in
service<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.750> type<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:54.960> thing<00:01:56.090> next<00:01:57.090> up<00:01:57.210> we

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
service that type of thing next up we

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.080 
service that type of thing next up we
have<00:01:57.360> quantum<00:01:57.990> maybe<00:01:58.229> with<00:01:58.590> time<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.579> space

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
have quantum maybe with time and space

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.090 
have quantum maybe with time and space
said<00:02:00.840> have<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.049> lot<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.320> pull<00:02:01.680> an<00:02:01.770> enemy's

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
said have a lot of pull an enemy's

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.569 
said have a lot of pull an enemy's
towards<00:02:02.579> them<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.909> lot<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.119> teleports<00:02:04.579> shields

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
towards them a lot of teleports shields

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.940 
towards them a lot of teleports shields
to<00:02:05.790> make<00:02:06.180> things<00:02:06.570> move<00:02:06.990> slower<00:02:07.409> as<00:02:07.649> they<00:02:07.770> go

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
to make things move slower as they go

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.090 
to make things move slower as they go
through

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
through

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
and all that kinda good goodness plasma

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.140 
and all that kinda good goodness plasma
you'd<00:02:14.380> expect<00:02:14.800> it<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:15.040> be<00:02:15.130> like<00:02:15.310> more<00:02:15.490> plasma

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
you'd expect it to be like more plasma

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.510 
you'd expect it to be like more plasma
as<00:02:16.870> in<00:02:17.260> you<00:02:17.440> know<00:02:17.560> other<00:02:17.800> dunno<00:02:18.190> what<00:02:18.370> you'd

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
as in you know other dunno what you'd

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.340 
as in you know other dunno what you'd
expect<00:02:18.640> quite<00:02:19.000> admit<00:02:19.210> to<00:02:19.300> be<00:02:19.420> but<00:02:19.600> it's

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
expect quite admit to be but it's

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.310 
expect quite admit to be but it's
actually<00:02:20.470> fire<00:02:21.040> basically<00:02:22.030> fire<00:02:22.780> you<00:02:23.200> are

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
actually fire basically fire you are

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.270 
actually fire basically fire you are
magma<00:02:24.070> and<00:02:24.220> some<00:02:24.940> electricity<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:26.950> that's<00:02:27.130> all

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
magma and some electricity so that's all

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.030 
magma and some electricity so that's all
good<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:29.070> ring<00:02:30.070> here<00:02:30.490> is<00:02:30.990> quite<00:02:31.990> aptly<00:02:32.620> a<00:02:32.740> fire

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
good and ring here is quite aptly a fire

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.030 
good and ring here is quite aptly a fire
guy<00:02:33.310> it's<00:02:33.730> not<00:02:33.970> hard<00:02:34.180> to<00:02:34.300> tell<00:02:34.570> what<00:02:34.750> he<00:02:34.990> is<00:02:35.080> and

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
deal with a lot with electricity if they

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.550 
deal with a lot with electricity if they
some<00:02:45.550> agree<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:45.970> say<00:02:46.120> summin<00:02:46.360> little<00:02:47.290> mine
