00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hey and welcome to here 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.259
 Advent calendar today is the eighth and 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.590
 so that's not really eight 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.820
 murder conception because I'm at the beginning but 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.889
 Now it's on again today is the 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.279
 next motto and we have again 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.410
 a very nice mod for you and that 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.000
 we have for you today if you play 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.480
 in 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:31.349
 right here we have thing for you 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:34.350
 mercedes benz mbg 65 amg for 264 108 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:39.210
 euro beautiful small mini amount in close 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:42.510
 it costs 25 euro per day has 612 hp 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.020
 so really cool and me up to four 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.309
 hours 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.809
 like you see three pieces here because the 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.090
 let me look in the face 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.680
 so drive really well but in 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.070
 it's quite nice to meet me 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.899
 Just think right to the right one meets 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.969
 very nice and you can do it 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.390
 just not you control it can 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.320
 Generally not really control 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.270
 but that's the way it is 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.619
 So to the textures it is to say 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.560
 really nice 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.760
 he reflects he shines nothing from them 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.090
 to complain 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.530
 the display redevelops everything perfectly over 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.030
 So the slices drive us under 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.490
 which of course is totally unnecessary 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.810
 it would of course still be optimal 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.159
 can buy the car in colors because we 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.650
 We would not look here for a good wife 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:31.869
 So drove here 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:33.790
 Buy buy exactly so 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.189
 Murder is really nicely done 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.380
 can also be short 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:44.360
 Recording is best for you 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:46.610
 So good idea first the light and that 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.210
 light so there is a bit something 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.250
 available 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.319
 I wanted that now, I know 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:56.360
 not why the Wichtel yes I know there 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:59.030
 way that was very clever flash 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.899
 Of course, blinky is also a beacon 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.539
 Logically, that's not exactly what it is 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.039
 It was then already to these beautiful 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:09.019
 wonderful motto if you like it 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.489
 I have positive reviews I have noticed 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.569
 I 'm a little quieter know a bit 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.040
 later it's really a bit tired 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.750
 am 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.160
 we look forward to seeing you soon 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.120
 us again in the live stream at the latest 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.230
 we'll still watch that one 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.260
 small lottery until then 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.489
 get twentieth twelfth's live 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.290
 stream at the latest tomorrow does not exist 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.510
 So imagine next advent calendars 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:31.069

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.599
