00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.609
 when you're not used to dating 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.870
 a noblewoman but also an actress 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.630
 the same thing is famous 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.219
 the first time you are a little uncomfortable there 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.550
 second you are a little awkward but it already goes 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.280
 better 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.529
 and the third began to take us 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.510
 taste driving a range rover gives the 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.970
 same sensations is an experience of 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.320
 life because she is the queen in the divers is the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.119
 larger and more luxurious the more 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.070
 expensive and many other things 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.900
 find out which ones to buy 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.779
 even if in the end you can't do it 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.930
 allow like me but together we will live 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:42.030
 a fairy tale at least for a few minutes 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:43.649
 outside as monumental you see it from you 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.300
 lenin and the proportions are those 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.070
 classic of the squared range 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.329
 massive imposing to the face of 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.050
 any principle of efficiency 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.360
 aerodynamics 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.190
 how to say the unstoppable are the 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.320
 nice is that a range can afford to 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.719
 be so great without going through the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.550
 suv super arrogant pure chrome or 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.350
 headlights with technological LEDs both in front and 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.899
 behind are consistent with his spirit 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.400
 majestic though you have to know 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.260
 choose the right color like this 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.700
 metallic blue in my opinion is one of the 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.670
 best after the British green 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.820
 obviously 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.540
 it's spacious exterior dimensions are from 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.250
 studio flat 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.990
 but not all that glitters is gold 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.190
 start from the trunk 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.190
 open range 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.790
 if you specialize apart from the ability to 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.860
 load is good but not unbelievable yes 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.450
 starts from 550 liters 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.820
 the compartment is regular and very refined 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.570
 load something wet dirt does 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.190
 feel guilty 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.750
 on a practical level instead the threshold of 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.040
 load is definitely high 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.630
 therefore before lifting objects 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.100
 heavy and better to lower the 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.960
 air suspension at the level 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.670
 minimum no effort instead for 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.200
 break down the seats are completely 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.180
 electric and form a load plan 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.740
 flat under the floor then there are a 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.650
 normal spare wheel in this case 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.420
 from 21 on a range rover you go up 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.220
 machine in the true sense of the word e 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.020
 it obviously goes down that in life 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.700
 everyday is an inconvenience too 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.170
 the same applies to a fit person 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.790
 first recommendation is appropriate 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.680
 lower the suspension level 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.120
 once aboard the space abounds in 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.830
 all directions but especially in 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.380
 usual width the rear sofa 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.270
 is designed to pamper two adults with 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.310
 independent electrical settings for 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.780
 backrests and air conditioning but also the 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.610
 third passenger does not feel bad 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.050
 in front of it you enjoy instead of what you 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.150
 land rover brochure defines a 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.040
 dominant driving position produced 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.840
 means traveling very high in a 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.530
 environment that looks like the bridge 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.780
 of a cruise ship and quality 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.320
 the video I ca n't pass on to you 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.700
 after all, what do you feel by touching e 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.290
 sniffing the materials of a range there 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.810
 I try anyway let's start with the skin 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.470
 which for the British is a must 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.230
 very soft and able to cover 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.940
 any form dashboard dash seats 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.350
 handles the atmosphere is that of a 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.450
 living room where everything is massive 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.550
 voluminous visually done well 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.590
 look at which door panel or the 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.180
 double sun visor and then all in 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.709
 some way electrically assisted 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.540
 I have already shown the seats and the 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.130
 trunk but there are also doors that 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.660
 they close themselves or the drawer 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.700
 glove box that is double the deal 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.800
 the lights also think about the atmosphere 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.480
 can be customized in the color la 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.160
 in short, perception is one that is not 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.840
 never given at the expense and rightly so 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.870
 on a car that costs more than 100 thousand 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.870
 EUR 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.160
 how the navigator works an installation 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.540
 of infotelematics all touch screen 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.190
 with an 8-inch screen 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.690
 super tested interface on 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.010
 land rover models with maps that 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.970
 they also have the navigation function 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.770
 in off-road vehicles 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.540
 not to mention the split view 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.460
 which transmits to the passenger to look 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.020
 television while those who drive continue 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.430
 see other information and not 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.300
 missing screens for driving in off 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.540
 road cameras including in the city ​​like 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.540
 never 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.450
 seems a bit like being aladin on 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.879
 magic carpet 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:54.060
 the movement looks at others 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:56.640
 vehicles from the top down and you are 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.340
 completely isolated from the outside world 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.989
 hole traffic noise no problem a 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.569
 more reason about this version 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:06.060
 hybrid that can move for example into 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.800
 departure in complete silence using 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.780
 only the electric motor and in the 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.970
 acceleration eliminates any 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.860
 you don't have to relax, though 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.769
 too much because the width in 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.959
 particular is not so easy to manage 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.519
 then the sensors the cameras 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.650
 especially the back ones are 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.380
 fundamental to get out of situations 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.360
 more complicated but finding parking 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.300
 it will always be an adventure not so bad 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.720
 instead the visibility in motion because 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.460
 the glass and uprights are positioned in the 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.050
 right points and forms of 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.419
 bodywork allow you to check 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.870
 quite well the overall dimensions and beautiful from 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:44.880
 drive a range and this means that 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.910
 the beautiful driving is linked to that idea 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.919
 to be unstoppable not in want 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.560
 go strong but drive steadily 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.840
 relax enjoying that feeling 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.000
 of isolation I mentioned earlier and 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.870
 the softness of all the controls go 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.450
 however strong you can just crush 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.310
 I only tell you that the v6 diesel engine 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.919
 electric through the gearbox 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.169
 automatic put together 340 horses 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.060
 700 newton meters that you do 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:14.160
 sink into these armchairs and it seems 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.110
 also incredible time 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.330
 acceleration from 0 to 100 for a car 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.270
 so large the latter needed the weight 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.370
 instead it makes itself felt in curve despite 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.590
 the shell is completely in aluminum 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.330
 to be lighter and on the problem 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.130
 however offroad 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.500
 you can see it in the test I have 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.990
 made a few years ago in Morocco 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.840
 on this hybrid version then the 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:39.060
 battery has been integrated into the floor 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.039
 and is completely covered by one 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.860
 ultra resistant plate for not having 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:46.500
 off-road limits and has not changed 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.569
 not even another typical aspect of the 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.119
 range rover the excellent steering angle 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:54.099
 how much you consume before you answer vi 

00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:56.199
 I say that this machine is a hybrid of 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:57.699
 first generation in which the engine 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:59.229
 one-hand electric to diesel for 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:01.209
 consume less and improve 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:03.520
 performance in practice this version 

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:04.569
 at the same power as empty diesel but 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.629
 consumes as 16 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:09.729
 we are on the 10 11 liters 100 km in the city and 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:11.589
 on eight liters on extra-urban roads 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:13.659
 not bad for a beast like that 

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:15.999
 instead electric mode is as if not 

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:19.059
 exist at full battery do you 

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:21.689
 just 1.6 km 

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:21.689
 how much it costs 

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:28.089
 brace yourself for this version 

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:29.860
 hybrid is over 130 thousand euros 

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:31.869
 in reality all the ranges cost more than 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:36.069
 100,000 apart from the diesel version in 

00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:37.599
 basic set-up hs discard logic 

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:39.459
 the speed of operation of the info 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:40.869
 telematics are not at the level of 

00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:42.669
 best German land rover cars 

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:44.379
 however it is introducing a new one 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:45.939
 system in the whole range starting from 

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:48.189
 discovery sport is another detail 

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:50.649
 improved on this hybrid and the fact 

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:52.449
 to be able to take off more quickly from 

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:54.399
 some crossings with a greater push 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:55.779
 of the electric motor what not 

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:58.119
 should be a problem on 

00:06:55.779 --> 00:07:00.550
 next pending hybrid plug version 

00:06:58.119 --> 00:07:02.649
 for 2016 which will also allow for 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.089
 travel with zero emissions in the journey 

00:07:02.649 --> 00:07:06.909
 home work everyday 

00:07:04.089 --> 00:07:08.139
 but she the best version or this one 

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:09.550
 hybrid the advantage in terms of 

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:11.319
 consumption performance is not proportional 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.789
 at the price but is compensated by one 

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:14.619
 wonderful ability to move without 

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:16.269
 effort and in some cities the hybrids do not 

00:07:14.619 --> 00:07:17.979
 pay parking on the blue lines e 

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:19.509
 they have tax concessions so can 

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:21.689
 worth choosing this range 

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:24.519
 hybrid would recommend it 

00:07:21.689 --> 00:07:26.259
 yes if you have the economic availability 

00:07:24.519 --> 00:07:28.659
 to buy any SUV but you don't want to
