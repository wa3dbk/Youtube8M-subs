harmonix<00:00:19.439> worm<00:00:20.480> you<00:00:21.480> can<00:00:21.600> see<00:00:21.720> I've<00:00:21.840> got<00:00:21.869> it

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
harmonix worm you can see I've got it

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.019 
harmonix worm you can see I've got it
connected<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.980> expression<00:00:23.519> pedal<00:00:23.820> input

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
connected to the expression pedal input

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.630 
connected to the expression pedal input
on<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:25.019> pedal<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:26.390> connected<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:28.160> the<00:00:29.160> effect

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
on the pedal and connected to the effect

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.299 
on the pedal and connected to the effect
itself<00:00:30.000> which<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.050> fairly<00:00:31.410> simple<00:00:31.679> it's<00:00:32.070> just

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
itself which is fairly simple it's just

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.200 
itself which is fairly simple it's just

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
you purchase the puddle just plug it in

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.299 
you purchase the puddle just plug it in
and<00:00:46.489> it<00:00:47.489> will<00:00:47.879> work<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.329> semi<00:00:48.890> low<00:00:49.890> level

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
and it will work in semi low level

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.580 
and it will work in semi low level
lighting<00:00:50.789> but<00:00:51.090> for<00:00:51.360> demo<00:00:51.600> purposes<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:52.289> do<00:00:52.350> have

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
lighting but for demo purposes I do have

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
a little extra light on there to make

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.340 
a little extra light on there to make
sure<00:00:59.910> we<00:01:00.030> get<00:01:00.120> full<00:01:00.359> emphasis<00:01:00.840> for<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.109> video

I<00:01:02.449> will<00:01:04.460> turn<00:01:05.460> on<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.760> worm<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.380> let<00:01:07.380> my

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
I will turn on the worm and let my

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.469 
I will turn on the worm and let my
friend<00:01:07.830> Dean<00:01:08.040> here<00:01:08.340> just<00:01:08.760> play<00:01:09.030> with<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.240> worm

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
friend Dean here just play with the worm

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.810 
friend Dean here just play with the worm
itself<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.140> its<00:01:10.170> self<00:01:10.590> modulation<00:01:11.250> then<00:01:11.700> we

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
itself on its self modulation then we

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:31.410 
itself on its self modulation then we
will<00:01:11.970> turn<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.510> expression

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.030 

alright<00:01:32.420> and<00:01:32.450> now<00:01:32.810> we<00:01:32.869> will<00:01:33.200> put<00:01:33.470> it<00:01:33.590> into

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
alright and now we will put it into

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.290 
alright and now we will put it into
manual<00:01:34.490> mode<00:01:34.610> which<00:01:35.119> will<00:01:35.860> engage<00:01:36.860> the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
manual mode which will engage the

00:01:37.300 --> 00:02:03.570 
manual mode which will engage the
expression<00:01:38.300> pedal<00:01:38.570> itself<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:39.520> go<00:01:40.520> ahead

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.660 

take<00:02:04.580> some<00:02:05.080> either<00:02:06.080> movement<00:02:06.920> of<00:02:07.009> the<00:02:07.039> hand<00:02:07.399> if

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
take some either movement of the hand if

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.070 
take some either movement of the hand if
you're<00:02:07.910> a<00:02:07.940> tabletop<00:02:08.649> noisemaker<00:02:09.649> or<00:02:10.989> just<00:02:11.989> a

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
you're a tabletop noisemaker or just a

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.500 
you're a tabletop noisemaker or just a
little<00:02:12.110> movement<00:02:12.470> of<00:02:12.680> your<00:02:12.800> foot<00:02:13.070> and<00:02:13.280> you<00:02:13.510> can

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
little movement of your foot and you can

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.170 
little movement of your foot and you can
use<00:02:14.840> this<00:02:14.989> a<00:02:15.070> touchless<00:02:16.070> expression<00:02:16.820> pedal

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
use this a touchless expression pedal

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.840 
use this a touchless expression pedal
and<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:18.890> hope<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:19.790> enjoy<00:02:20.090> it<00:02:20.120> thank<00:02:20.660> you
