00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.250
 richard seaver 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.250
 you are the real wizard 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.580
 it is the stone of tears thanks to its 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.900
 power I could be immortal and 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.939
 as the guardian gives me the great 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.540
 flavor of wiping out all 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.309
 miserable beings that populate this world 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:37.309
 you're going to order Richard to become my 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.739
 companion and so he and I we 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.110
 will create a race our image a people 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.980
 obeying my will is at no 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.890
 other 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.840
 the veil is torn between us 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.980
 kingdom of the dead the guardian said 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.020
 the war to the world of the living 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.910
 he uses the tear to send it 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.900
 horrible creatures we must 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.640
 redo but the veil 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.470
 only the stone of tears can we 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.300
 help or come back to an existence 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.010
 where the dead walk among the living and 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.170
 where the guardian is at the gates of life 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.610
 from all those born who brings me 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.440
 lapierre and tears 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.080
 neither of us is used anymore 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.550
 guardian I received a message thanks to 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.540
 travel book saying that the dowser 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.520
 course is a big danger 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.170
 the eve of the summer solstice in the skin 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.030
 of a young boy the guardian will walk 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.020
 among us and by his hand the dowser 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.020
 will blindly guide 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.030
 mistress give me yours 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.030
 you death of the site 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.550
 I will see there 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.450
 I would not stand to take offense 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.040
 to stop you from whining the dowser 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.370
 will not kill me and little synthe it will be 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.370
 at my orders 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.759
 the Lord explicitly asked us 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.740
 to join us with this man without 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.539
 heart was taken from a burst of generosity 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.490
 let's say it's the instinct of 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.840
 survival if the guardian takes away the 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.460
 Lord Rahal will return to the 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.289
 kingdom of the dead to face 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.420
 eternally the pain inflicted by 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:12.879
 his former master who is the leader 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:15.420
 it's me who has the boss 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.420
 let's go 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.120
 m 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.819
 it's blood arches 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.730
 new to other mistress nurturing handsome
