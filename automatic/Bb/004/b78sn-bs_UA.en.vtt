you'll<00:00:24.300> see<00:00:24.360> me<00:00:24.630> do<00:00:24.780> it<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:25.110> did<00:00:25.950> not<00:00:26.070> think<00:00:26.670> of

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
you'll see me do it I did not think of

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.180 
you'll see me do it I did not think of
that<00:00:26.880> name<00:00:27.120> I<00:00:27.480> wish<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.500> did<00:00:28.710> it's<00:00:28.950> an<00:00:29.039> awesome

that name I wish I did it's an awesome

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.010 
that name I wish I did it's an awesome
but<00:00:30.180> the<00:00:30.300> reason<00:00:30.570> why<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.690> was<00:00:30.780> called<00:00:30.960> the

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020 
but the reason why I was called the

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.930 
but the reason why I was called the
world's<00:00:31.260> greatest<00:00:31.440> stretches<00:00:31.860> because<00:00:32.009> you

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
world's greatest stretches because you

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.000 
world's greatest stretches because you
only<00:00:33.059> have<00:00:33.210> one<00:00:33.239> stretch<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.930> do<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.770> should

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
only have one stretch to do that should

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.860 
only have one stretch to do that should
be<00:00:35.070> one<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.399> stretches<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.059> should<00:00:36.780> be

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
be one of the stretches and should be

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.410 
be one of the stretches and should be
these<00:00:37.079> stretch<00:00:37.379> you<00:00:37.559> should<00:00:37.739> do<00:00:37.890> because<00:00:38.420> it's

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
these stretch you should do because it's

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.870 
these stretch you should do because it's
like<00:00:39.540> your<00:00:39.660> hips<00:00:39.870> opens<00:00:40.380> up<00:00:40.500> your<00:00:40.620> spy<00:00:40.920> opens

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:41.880 
like your hips opens up your spy opens

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
up everything and everything in the body

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.940 
up everything and everything in the body
is<00:00:45.300> stretched<00:00:45.750> through<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.140> exercise<00:00:46.470> if

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
is stretched through that exercise if

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.190
