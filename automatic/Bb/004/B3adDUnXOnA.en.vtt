lines there's different ways to do it
there's<00:01:31.250> that<00:01:31.460> way<00:01:31.640> and<00:01:31.820> then<00:01:31.910> I<00:01:31.970> go<00:01:35.020> which<00:01:36.020> is

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
there's that way and then I go which is

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.010 
there's that way and then I go which is
a<00:01:36.200> version<00:01:36.440> the<00:01:36.680> spider<00:01:36.950> chord<00:01:37.369> or<00:01:41.020> sliding

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
a version the spider chord or sliding

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.280 
a version the spider chord or sliding
off<00:01:42.229> here<00:01:42.759> and<00:01:43.759> that's<00:01:44.600> just<00:01:44.810> as<00:01:45.020> different

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
off here and that's just as different

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.139 
off here and that's just as different
stuff<00:01:45.649> like<00:01:45.830> there's<00:01:46.040> another<00:01:46.580> technique<00:01:46.970> I

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
stuff like there's another technique I

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.109 
stuff like there's another technique I
started<00:01:48.220> sliding<00:01:49.220> in<00:01:49.460> the<00:01:49.550> chords<00:01:49.820> like<00:01:49.940> that

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
started sliding in the chords like that

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.990 
started sliding in the chords like that
I<00:01:50.149> did<00:01:50.390> it<00:01:50.539> with<00:01:50.720> the<00:01:51.440> stuff<00:01:51.770> that

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
I did it with the stuff that

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.480 
I did it with the stuff that
some<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.480> stuff<00:01:54.690> I<00:01:54.840> did<00:01:54.900> with<00:01:55.230> Metallica

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:05.060 

like<00:01:59.490> uh<00:01:59.520> was<00:02:00.150> it<00:02:00.860> I<00:02:03.290> did<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:04.470> that's<00:02:04.710> my<00:02:04.860> riff

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
like uh was it I did that that's my riff

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.310 
like uh was it I did that that's my riff
so<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.370> came<00:02:05.880> up<00:02:06.060> with<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.330> stuff<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:07.020> think

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
so I came up with that stuff and I think

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.140 
so I came up with that stuff and I think
it's<00:02:07.770> really<00:02:08.100> heavy<00:02:08.250> when<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.610> do<00:02:08.760> that<00:02:08.970> you

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:09.150 
it's really heavy when you do that you

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.370 
it's really heavy when you do that you
instead<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.540> going<00:02:09.720> like<00:02:10.790> you<00:02:11.790> know<00:02:12.380> that's

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
instead of going like you know that's

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.680 
instead of going like you know that's
heavier

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.620 

I<00:02:19.810> don't<00:02:20.530> have<00:02:20.620> a<00:02:20.650> famous<00:02:21.010> scale<00:02:21.510> they<00:02:22.510> were

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
I don't have a famous scale they were

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.340 
I don't have a famous scale they were
they<00:02:23.020> were<00:02:23.080> there<00:02:23.290> before<00:02:23.470> I<00:02:23.620> was<00:02:23.800> here<00:02:24.010> so<00:02:24.340> I

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350
