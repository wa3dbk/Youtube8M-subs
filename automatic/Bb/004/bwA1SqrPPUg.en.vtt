 depression asthenia anxiety 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.580
 nootropic over experience drugs oversimplified 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.670
 saying improve blood flow and exchange 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.770
 substances brain is very good and interesting 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.630
 a group of drugs that are actively 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.350
 used in the correction 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.310
 psycho-emotional disorders 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.830
 because they are all of themselves 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.260
 beautiful cute people often 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.740
 take them either without a prescription 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.660
 or the doctor prescribes and does not give detailed 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.059
 drug information and yet 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.920
 like 10 years ago and now rather 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.129
 keep coming patient how on 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.899
 admission to the clinic and in the medical unit 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.899
 who for some reason are taking 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.149
 wonderful drugs nonetheless 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:50.660
 get insomnia for some reason they 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.910
 pressure drops they faint 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.730
 is it really that scary 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.070
 and not the drugs themselves are scary what people 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.649
 use them absolutely not to look 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.960
 even the instructions for use are bad 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.970
 that many experts prescribe a 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.010
 nootropil so why rely then well 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.170
 okay there by take it sometime 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.990
 man accepts his appointment speed 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.200
 here so that there are no such here forgive 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.310
 but in another way you can't say nonsense 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.299
 review the following information 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.369
 block 3 times and take this information into account 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.080
 when using nature and even better 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.080
 we consult with specialists 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.530
 freely resistant drugs for 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.869
 treating depression asthenia anxiety part 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.070
 3 nootropics 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.070
 information block number nine 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.670
 quite difficult at the same time and listen 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.369
 what the author says 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.229
 and view the slide and so I 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.420
 I recommend at the beginning to listen to what I 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.600
 I will talk then put a pause 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.549
 carefully read the text of a slide as 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.409
 I draw your attention to the fact that 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.450
 use of presentation separately from 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:11.039
 materials site mid science. not 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.580
 practically meaningless and so nootropic 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.870
 these are drugs that are simplistic 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.160
 improve blood circulation and metabolism 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.940
 the brain 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.560
 they have divisions by predominantly 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.180
 vascular action predominantly on 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.019
 fuel but on this we will not 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.480
 stop for what they are accepted 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.910
 they apply they apply in 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.810
 combination therapy and depressive and 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.810
 alarming 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.760
 and asthenic syndrome however for 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.579
 each of these syndromes the role of nootropics 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.140
 completely different so with treatment 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.480
 depressive syndrome on top and 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.519
 enhance the effect of antidepressants and 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.739
 reduces the severity of their side 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.540
 effects amplification action 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.790
 antidepressant advantage occurs 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.310
 at the expense of the hotel due to the stimulating 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.290
 actions on tops therefore here more often 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.519
 such drug is used as on 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:05.430
 hurried on the other hand if at 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.130
 depression expressed anxiety or 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.799
 insomnia then you can use on top 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.380
 to improve sedative gain 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.480
 antidepressant action or enhancement 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.430
 sedation sedatives 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.540
 drugs then used another 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.519
 drug cinnarizine 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.440
 further it will be considered more 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.920
 detail also materials you can 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.450
 look at the site science mid. no with 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.819
 treating anxiety syndrome 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.739
 as already mentioned is used 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.410
 cinnarizine and absolutely not 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.450
 use stimulating nootropic 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.600
 drug such as nootropil since 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.630
 they alone can cause development 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.150
 street disturbing syndrome to this 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.810
 slopes in the treatment of asthenic 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.840
 syndrome 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.010
 nootropic drugs are base 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.960
 here can be used as 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.880
 stimulating so and soothing 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.040
 nootropic drugs depending on 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.170
 of what component of asthenic 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.670
 syndrome as we said 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.860
 weakness and lethargy brokenness 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:08.860
 fatigue or irritability 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:12.280
 quick temper prevails accordingly 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:16.750
 for asthenic syndrome with more 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.930
 severe weakness lethargy 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.310
 fatigue stimulating are used 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.530
 NATO for such as hurried 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.060
 for asthenic syndrome you 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.730
 predominantly irritability 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.370
 hot temper over opus yet 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.920
 action such as cinnarizine saren 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.330
 by the way here is if about this 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:39.070
 speak advantage vascular 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:41.110
 drugs draw your attention to something 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.419
 the fact that there are medicines 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.850
 drugs like absolutely everything 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.280
 medications they have contraindications and 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.720
 side effects 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.400
 be sure to read the instructions and 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.870
 even better consult with 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.870
 by a specialist before using them 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:01.000
 cinnarizine is now separate by drug 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:03.000
 cinnarizine like I said drug 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.190
 improves blood flow to the brain 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.680
 is the advantage of the vascular with 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.870
 soothing hypnotic effects into it 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.510
 are not the main and side topics 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.760
 less it is quite suitable for combination 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.030
 with sedatives for 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.919
 enhancing their actions such as persin 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.870
 for combination with afobazole om in order 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:25.330
 to add a calming effect to 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:28.060
 anti-anxiety action afobazole and 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.560
 or with hypnotic drugs to such 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.820
 as such as donor 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.600
 to enhance their sleeping pills then 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.350
 have cinnarizine 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:40.560
 strengthens sleeping pills and soothing 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.760
 action and possesses it himself 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.550
 should remember that the drug can 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.400
 lower blood pressure certainly not 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.590
 since let's say so Wali zatar or 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.360
 neuroleptics but nonetheless to api 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.460
 real pressure may decrease if 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.160
 a person has hypotension that is 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.530
 lowered 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:01.690
 blood pressure him with this 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.690
 drug is better not to experiment 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.420
 Further 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.760
 Nootropil besides actually stomping 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.400
 there is 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:22.010
 action enhancing improving 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.990
 Krasnov is not a metabolism of the brain natr 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.460
 saws have a moderately pronounced 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.570
 stimulating effect 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:31.670
 therefore it is necessary to remember the following 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:34.370
 admission to tropillo is carried out only 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:37.130
 morning and afternoon evening reception 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.090
 disturb sleep and how we talked to you and 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.850
 with asthenic 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:44.870
 and with depressive sleep syndromes and so 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:46.430
 violated also because nootropil 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.840
 activates both healthy and 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.210
 painful processes 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:56.270
 therefore it is used under control 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:57.470
 sedatives and in well 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.370
 accordingly applied when 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.160
 asthenic 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:03.680
 and depressive syndrome since 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:06.140
 hurry can increase anxiety 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:09.890
 with anxiety syndrome, naturally not 

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:14.230
 used at all pay for it 

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:19.660
 attention thanks for attention 

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:19.660
