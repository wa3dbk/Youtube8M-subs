and<00:00:23.460> see<00:00:23.580> if<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.699> can't<00:00:23.910> figure<00:00:24.090> out<00:00:24.240> what<00:00:24.359> that

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
and see if I can't figure out what that

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:24.920 
and see if I can't figure out what that
is

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
is

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.259 
is
but<00:00:25.619> uh<00:00:25.650> can't<00:00:26.430> wait<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.640> see<00:00:26.789> what<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.090> it

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
and then this has been formed what into

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.810 
and then this has been formed what into
the<00:00:33.030> shape<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.540> spoon<00:00:34.579> kind<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.640> see<00:00:35.730> the

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
the shape of a spoon kind of see the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.889 
the shape of a spoon kind of see the
rings<00:00:36.030> on<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.239> everything<00:00:36.570> it's<00:00:36.660> kind<00:00:36.840> of

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
rings on it everything it's kind of

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.990 
rings on it everything it's kind of
pretty<00:00:37.620> wild-looking<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.640> then<00:00:39.149> this<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.570> a

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
pretty wild-looking and then this is a

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.720 
pretty wild-looking and then this is a
j-hook<00:00:42.079> missing<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.170> little<00:00:43.379> disc<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.890> then

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
j-hook missing the little disc and then

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.520

sign I think that was off in my
pinpoints<00:02:12.660> be<00:02:12.750> honest<00:02:13.050> with<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:14.270> lucky<00:02:15.270> I

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.789 

well<00:02:51.549> if<00:02:51.819> it<00:02:51.970> sounds<00:02:52.329> like<00:02:52.480> a<00:02:52.510> bullet<00:02:52.930> and

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
well if it sounds like a bullet and

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.339 
well if it sounds like a bullet and
gives<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.069> number<00:02:54.310> like<00:02:54.459> a<00:02:54.489> bullet

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349
