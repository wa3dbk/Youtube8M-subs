straight<00:01:30.180> up<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.600> sky<00:01:30.840> like<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.820> so

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
straight up in the sky like that so

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.490 
straight up in the sky like that so
let's<00:01:33.299> try<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.509> see<00:01:33.780> if<00:01:33.810> we<00:01:33.900> can<00:01:34.079> get<00:01:34.229> something

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
let's try to see if we can get something

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.749 
let's try to see if we can get something
good<00:01:34.770> here<00:01:36.320> like<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.920> that's<00:01:38.400> gonna<00:01:38.549> go

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
good here like that and that's gonna go

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:39.980 
good here like that and that's gonna go
pretty<00:01:39.060> far<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.540> that's<00:01:39.630> what<00:01:39.840> you're<00:01:39.960> trying

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
pretty far and that's what you're trying

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.649 
pretty far and that's what you're trying
to<00:01:40.650> do<00:01:40.920> you're<00:01:41.490> trying<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:42.030> get<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
to do you're trying to get it to the

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.380 
to do you're trying to get it to the
limit<00:01:43.079> nice<00:01:43.860> bounce<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.520> we<00:01:44.610> will<00:01:44.820> make<00:01:45.090> that

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
limit nice bounce and we will make that

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.960 
limit nice bounce and we will make that
limit<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.229> that's<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.590> max<00:01:46.920> limit<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.549> can

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
limit so that's the max limit you can

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.510 
limit so that's the max limit you can
in<00:01:48.180> minor<00:01:48.540> mode<00:01:48.870> as<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.080> thousand<00:01:49.680> feet<00:01:49.950> gives

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
in minor mode as a thousand feet gives

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.520 
in minor mode as a thousand feet gives
you<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.670> bunch<00:01:50.940> of<00:01:51.060> points<00:01:51.300> but<00:01:52.050> you<00:01:52.170> want<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.410> do

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
I'm sorry it's all levels $2.99 so

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.650 
I'm sorry it's all levels $2.99 so
basically<00:04:41.430> -<00:04:41.610> it<00:04:41.669> cost<00:04:41.880> you<00:04:42.030> 99<00:04:42.330> cents<00:04:42.570> for

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
basically - it cost you 99 cents for

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.070 
basically - it cost you 99 cents for
each<00:04:42.990> level<00:04:43.680> if<00:04:44.010> you<00:04:44.280> get<00:04:44.460> five<00:04:44.780> no<00:04:45.780> price

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
each level if you get five no price

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.130 
each level if you get five no price
break<00:04:46.380> actually<00:04:47.070> it's<00:04:47.340> even<00:04:47.520> more<00:04:47.789> expensive

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
break actually it's even more expensive

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.900 
break actually it's even more expensive
$9.99<00:04:49.140> or<00:04:49.350> there<00:04:49.650> is<00:04:49.800> a<00:04:49.830> minor<00:04:50.190> price<00:04:50.550> break<00:04:50.820> I

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
$9.99 or there is a minor price break I

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.820 
$9.99 or there is a minor price break I
guess<00:04:51.060> because<00:04:51.240> that<00:04:51.330> would<00:04:51.450> be<00:04:51.539> 15<00:04:52.110> levels<00:04:52.440> so

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
guess because that would be 15 levels so

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.680 
guess because that would be 15 levels so
you<00:04:53.039> are<00:04:53.430> getting<00:04:53.760> a<00:04:53.820> little<00:04:54.120> bit<00:04:54.300> of<00:04:54.419> a<00:04:54.479> break

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
you are getting a little bit of a break

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.110
