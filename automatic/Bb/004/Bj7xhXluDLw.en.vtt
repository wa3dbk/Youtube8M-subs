caliber<00:00:11.849> led<00:00:13.639> over<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.849> chronograph<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.980> the

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
caliber led over the chronograph and the

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.710 
caliber led over the chronograph and the
snap<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.850> Bands<00:00:18.060> as<00:00:18.270> they<00:00:18.390> hit<00:00:18.539> my

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
snap of the Bands as they hit my

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.939 
snap of the Bands as they hit my
slingshot<00:00:19.850> that<00:00:21.320> audible<00:00:22.320> one<00:00:22.500> will<00:00:22.680> pick<00:00:22.920> it

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
slingshot that audible one will pick it

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.040 
slingshot that audible one will pick it
up<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.430> then<00:00:23.970> I've<00:00:24.359> also<00:00:24.480> found<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:24.900> you've

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
up and then I've also found that you've

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.420 
up and then I've also found that you've
got<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.230> shoot<00:00:25.380> into<00:00:25.680> some<00:00:25.859> wood<00:00:26.039> or<00:00:26.070> something

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
got to shoot into some wood or something

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.830 
got to shoot into some wood or something
hard<00:00:26.789> on<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.000> other<00:00:27.119> side<00:00:27.359> over<00:00:27.570> there<00:00:27.689> so

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
hard on the other side over there so

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.660 
hard on the other side over there so
they<00:00:27.930> can<00:00:28.080> actually<00:00:28.439> hear<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.949> pick<00:00:29.369> up<00:00:29.519> that

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
they can actually hear and pick up that

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.790 
they can actually hear and pick up that
sound<00:00:30.060> I'm<00:00:30.119> pretty<00:00:30.330> well<00:00:30.480> again<00:00:31.439> today<00:00:31.650> it's

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
sound I'm pretty well again today it's

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.080 
sound I'm pretty well again today it's
got<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:31.949> little<00:00:32.070> bit<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.279> wind<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:32.730> it's<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.910> good

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
got a little bit of wind so it's a good

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.630 
got a little bit of wind so it's a good
test<00:00:33.270> ever<00:00:33.480> we'll<00:00:33.660> see<00:00:33.780> how<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:33.960> works<00:00:34.640> all

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
test ever we'll see how it works all

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.270 
test ever we'll see how it works all
right<00:00:35.700> let's<00:00:36.390> see<00:00:36.510> here<00:00:36.809> let<00:00:36.930> me<00:00:36.989> zoom<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.260> in

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:48.709 

you<00:00:41.280> can<00:00:41.460> see<00:00:44.660> start<00:00:46.670> and<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.820> set<00:00:48.000> for<00:00:48.120> 35<00:00:48.480> feet

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
you can see start and it set for 35 feet

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:57.860 
you can see start and it set for 35 feet
away<00:00:49.760> which<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.910> exactly<00:00:51.360> how<00:00:51.449> far<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:56.870> 256

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
away which is exactly how far it is 256

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:10.039 
away which is exactly how far it is 256
feet<00:00:58.230> per<00:00:58.379> second<00:00:58.879> 256<00:00:59.879> 8<00:01:00.059> feet<00:01:00.329> per<00:01:00.359> second

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049

262 feet per second 258 feet per second

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.850 
262 feet per second 258 feet per second
and<00:01:14.700> have<00:01:15.700> one<00:01:15.940> shot<00:01:16.180> left<00:01:16.350> I'm<00:01:17.350> gonna<00:01:17.560> see<00:01:17.799> if

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
and have one shot left I'm gonna see if

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:26.609 
and have one shot left I'm gonna see if
they're<00:01:18.009> pretty<00:01:18.310> close<00:01:18.460> again<00:01:25.320> 251<00:01:26.320> feet<00:01:26.500> per

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
they're pretty close again 251 feet per

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.999 
they're pretty close again 251 feet per
second<00:01:27.030> 239<00:01:28.030> feet<00:01:28.270> per<00:01:28.390> second<00:01:28.780> now<00:01:29.649> last<00:01:29.860> one

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
second 239 feet per second now last one

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:31.680 
second 239 feet per second now last one
I<00:01:30.070> pulled<00:01:30.310> it<00:01:30.520> a<00:01:30.580> little<00:01:30.759> bit<00:01:30.909> didn't<00:01:31.270> shoot<00:01:31.479> as

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
I pulled it a little bit didn't shoot as

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.300 
I pulled it a little bit didn't shoot as
hard<00:01:31.930> as<00:01:32.049> I<00:01:32.110> could<00:01:32.289> just<00:01:32.500> to<00:01:32.560> just<00:01:32.920> to<00:01:32.950> check<00:01:33.190> it

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
hard as I could just to just to check it

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.590 
hard as I could just to just to check it
out<00:01:33.600> but<00:01:34.600> it<00:01:34.750> apparently<00:01:35.049> looks<00:01:35.470> to<00:01:35.560> me<00:01:35.680> like

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
out but it apparently looks to me like

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.899 
out but it apparently looks to me like
this<00:01:37.600> measures<00:01:38.020> a<00:01:38.110> little<00:01:38.259> bit<00:01:38.759> faster<00:01:39.759> feet

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
this measures a little bit faster feet

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.430 
this measures a little bit faster feet
per<00:01:40.060> second<00:01:40.450> then<00:01:40.659> the<00:01:40.780> actual<00:01:40.960> chronograph

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
per second then the actual chronograph

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.800 
per second then the actual chronograph
does<00:01:44.220> I'm<00:01:45.220> thinking<00:01:45.610> that<00:01:45.759> it's<00:01:45.909> a<00:01:46.000> it's<00:01:46.569> good

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
does I'm thinking that it's a it's good

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.300 
does I'm thinking that it's a it's good
for<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:49.270> know<00:01:49.360> within<00:01:49.690> 5%<00:01:49.960> time<00:01:50.619> top<00:01:51.009> range

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
for you know within 5% time top range

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.730 
for you know within 5% time top range
maybe<00:01:51.580> because<00:01:52.479> this<00:01:52.690> is<00:01:52.869> set<00:01:53.110> for<00:01:53.350> this<00:01:53.560> is

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
maybe because this is set for this is

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.050 
maybe because this is set for this is
this<00:01:53.950> is<00:01:54.100> of<00:01:54.190> course<00:01:54.399> it's<00:01:54.490> going<00:01:54.580> to<00:01:54.640> be<00:01:54.700> exact

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
this is of course it's going to be exact

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.800 
this is of course it's going to be exact
all<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:55.360> time

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
all the time

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.700 
all the time
where's<00:01:56.409> the<00:01:56.619> smartphone<00:01:57.280> app<00:01:58.259> as<00:01:59.259> you<00:01:59.440> see<00:01:59.619> it

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
where's the smartphone app as you see it

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.940 
where's the smartphone app as you see it
does<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:01.360> does<00:02:01.630> three<00:02:01.869> shot<00:02:02.110> strings<00:02:02.560> then<00:02:02.860> you

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
does it does three shot strings then you

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.559 
does it does three shot strings then you
got<00:02:03.100> a<00:02:03.130> started<00:02:03.610> restart<00:02:04.060> it<00:02:04.179> so<00:02:04.270> that's<00:02:04.420> why<00:02:04.539> I

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
got a started restart it so that's why I

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:06.809 
got a started restart it so that's why I
did<00:02:04.720> three<00:02:04.899> shots<00:02:05.250> anyway<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.429> smartphone

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819 
did three shots anyway the smartphone

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:08.910 
did three shots anyway the smartphone
app<00:02:07.000> for<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.479> chrony<00:02:07.690> is<00:02:08.170> good<00:02:08.440> within<00:02:08.590> 5

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
app for the chrony is good within 5

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.859 
app for the chrony is good within 5
percent<00:02:08.950> of<00:02:09.519> actual<00:02:10.209> I<00:02:10.239> think<00:02:10.509> so<00:02:10.690> that's

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
percent of actual I think so that's

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.560 
percent of actual I think so that's
that's<00:02:10.989> a<00:02:11.170> it's<00:02:11.769> a<00:02:11.890> viable<00:02:12.100> product<00:02:12.489> and<00:02:12.820> you

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
that's a it's a viable product and you

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.850 
that's a it's a viable product and you
can<00:02:13.720> kind<00:02:13.870> of<00:02:13.930> get<00:02:14.079> an<00:02:14.170> idea<00:02:14.230> of<00:02:14.530> what<00:02:14.709> you're

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
can kind of get an idea of what you're

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.710 
can kind of get an idea of what you're
looking<00:02:14.890> for<00:02:15.340> when<00:02:16.180> you're<00:02:16.299> shooting<00:02:16.450> it's

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
looking for when you're shooting it's

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.080 
looking for when you're shooting it's
not<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:16.989> way<00:02:17.079> maybe<00:02:17.320> -<00:02:17.850> alright<00:02:18.850> thanks<00:02:19.060> for
