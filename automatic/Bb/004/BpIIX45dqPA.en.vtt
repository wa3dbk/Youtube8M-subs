mechanically inclined of course you know
if<00:00:42.070> you're<00:00:42.190> all<00:00:42.309> thumbs<00:00:42.670> it's<00:00:43.390> not<00:00:43.600> a<00:00:43.629> project

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
if you're all thumbs it's not a project

if you're all thumbs it's not a project
for<00:00:44.350> you<00:00:44.409> there's<00:00:44.769> quite<00:00:44.920> a<00:00:44.949> bit<00:00:45.159> of<00:00:45.190> building

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
for you there's quite a bit of building

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.090 
for you there's quite a bit of building
involved<00:00:46.059> primarily<00:00:47.050> cutting<00:00:47.769> and<00:00:47.949> welding

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
involved primarily cutting and welding

steel<00:00:48.670> tube<00:00:48.999> and<00:00:49.379> fiberglass<00:00:50.379> work<00:00:50.699> but<00:00:52.319> it's

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:53.319 
steel tube and fiberglass work but it's

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:56.129 
steel tube and fiberglass work but it's
not<00:00:53.649> as<00:00:53.920> difficult<00:00:54.129> a<00:00:54.609> project<00:00:55.089> as<00:00:55.239> mike<00:00:55.449> is<00:00:55.929> it

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:56.139 
not as difficult a project as mike is it

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:57.540 
not as difficult a project as mike is it
might<00:00:56.289> appear<00:00:56.589> on<00:00:56.620> the<00:00:56.769> surface

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
might appear on the surface

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.180 
might appear on the surface
well<00:00:58.059> almost<00:00:58.629> anybody<00:00:59.079> Riley<00:00:59.559> and<00:00:59.739> Kari<00:00:59.920> claim

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
well almost anybody Riley and Kari claim

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.160 
well almost anybody Riley and Kari claim
that<00:01:00.339> the<00:01:00.460> Tri<00:01:00.639> Magnum<00:01:00.999> will<00:01:01.120> do<00:01:01.329> 100<00:01:01.749> miles<00:01:01.899> an

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
that the Tri Magnum will do 100 miles an

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.110 
that the Tri Magnum will do 100 miles an
hour<00:01:02.289> but<00:01:02.799> because<00:01:03.129> of<00:01:03.159> its<00:01:03.399> low<00:01:03.609> center<00:01:04.089> of

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
hour but because of its low center of

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.910 
hour but because of its low center of
gravity<00:01:04.269> they<00:01:04.839> say<00:01:05.049> it's<00:01:05.199> less<00:01:05.409> likely<00:01:05.650> to

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
gravity they say it's less likely to

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.830 
gravity they say it's less likely to
turn<00:01:06.130> over<00:01:06.310> than<00:01:06.610> a<00:01:06.729> four-wheel<00:01:07.240> vehicle

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
turn over than a four-wheel vehicle

00:01:07.840 --> 00:02:26.490 
turn over than a four-wheel vehicle
looks<00:01:08.680> pretty<00:01:08.980> good<00:01:09.190> that's

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500
