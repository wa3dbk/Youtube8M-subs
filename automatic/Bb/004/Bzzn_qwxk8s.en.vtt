00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.679 

the<00:00:01.170> evolution<00:00:01.380> of<00:00:01.680> stars<00:00:02.330> let's<00:00:03.330> now<00:00:03.629> talk

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
the evolution of stars let's now talk

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.730 
the evolution of stars let's now talk
about<00:00:04.160> the<00:00:05.160> timeline<00:00:06.230> start<00:00:07.230> starts<00:00:07.560> as<00:00:07.710> a

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
about the timeline start starts as a

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.600 
about the timeline start starts as a
proto<00:00:09.500> cloud<00:00:10.500> or<00:00:10.800> sometimes<00:00:11.370> called<00:00:11.460> a

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
proto cloud or sometimes called a

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.360 
proto cloud or sometimes called a
protostar<00:00:12.380> that's<00:00:13.380> you<00:00:14.040> can<00:00:14.160> see<00:00:14.309> the

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
protostar that's you can see the

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.450 
protostar that's you can see the
timeline<00:00:14.849> here<00:00:15.210> collapses<00:00:15.780> on<00:00:15.929> itself

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
timeline here collapses on itself

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.700 
timeline here collapses on itself
eventually<00:00:17.460> it<00:00:18.119> heats<00:00:18.359> up<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.710> gravitational

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
eventually it heats up the gravitational

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.429 
eventually it heats up the gravitational
attraction<00:00:20.100> becomes<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.939> star<00:00:21.270> lives<00:00:22.170> on<00:00:22.350> the

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
attraction becomes a star lives on the

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.050 
attraction becomes a star lives on the
main<00:00:22.590> sequence<00:00:22.890> that's<00:00:23.279> at<00:00:23.490> yellow<00:00:23.789> dot

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
main sequence that's at yellow dot

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.429 
main sequence that's at yellow dot
eventually<00:00:24.840> turns<00:00:25.109> into<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.769> red<00:00:26.760> giant

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
eventually turns into a red giant

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.589 
eventually turns into a red giant
eventually<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.740> diffuses<00:00:29.490> kind<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.150> turns

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
eventually it diffuses kind of turns

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.950 
eventually it diffuses kind of turns
into<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.900> nebula<00:00:32.210> eventually<00:00:33.210> becomes<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.780> white

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
into a nebula eventually becomes a white

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.410 
into a nebula eventually becomes a white
dwarf<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.710> then<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.100> brown<00:00:35.370> dwarf<00:00:35.399> let's<00:00:36.120> go

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
dwarf and then a brown dwarf let's go

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.510 
dwarf and then a brown dwarf let's go
through<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.840> process<00:00:37.079> in<00:00:37.649> some<00:00:37.860> detail<00:00:38.340> now

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
through that process in some detail now

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.010 
through that process in some detail now
so<00:00:38.850> I'm<00:00:38.969> kind<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.390> moving<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.750> little<00:00:39.870> bit

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
so I'm kind of moving a little bit

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.650 
so I'm kind of moving a little bit
faster<00:00:40.489> we<00:00:41.489> need<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.760> understand<00:00:42.120> two<00:00:42.329> terms

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
faster we need to understand two terms

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.970 
faster we need to understand two terms
we<00:00:42.960> need<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.260> understand<00:00:44.120> luminosity<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.980> the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
we need to understand luminosity and the

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.779 
we need to understand luminosity and the
concept<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.670> spectra<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.780> temperature<00:00:49.530> a

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
concept of spectra and temperature a

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:52.790 
concept of spectra and temperature a
luminosity<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.270> star<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.320> total<00:00:52.590> energy

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
luminosity of a star is the total energy

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.189 
luminosity of a star is the total energy
estar<00:00:53.399> emits<00:00:53.699> per<00:00:54.120> unit<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.539> time<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.050> can

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
estar emits per unit of time so you can

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:02.840 
estar emits per unit of time so you can
think<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.710> as<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.309> power<00:01:00.739> luminosity<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:02.340> a

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
think of it as a power luminosity is a

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.660 
think of it as a power luminosity is a
property<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.140> star<00:01:04.439> itself<00:01:04.670> doesn't

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
property of the star itself doesn't

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.520 
property of the star itself doesn't
depend<00:01:06.000> on<00:01:06.119> how<00:01:06.360> far<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.869> away<00:01:06.930> from<00:01:07.140> the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
depend on how far it is away from the

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.679 
depend on how far it is away from the
earth<00:01:07.619> doesn't<00:01:08.400> depend<00:01:08.760> on<00:01:08.939> if<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.330> clouds

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
earth doesn't depend on if this clouds

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.130 
earth doesn't depend on if this clouds
in<00:01:09.900> between<00:01:10.320> whatever<00:01:11.119> however<00:01:12.119> we<00:01:12.780> have<00:01:12.810> to

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
in between whatever however we have to

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.380 
in between whatever however we have to
measure<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.560> star<00:01:13.799> from<00:01:14.010> Earth<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.760> term<00:01:15.210> is

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
measure the star from Earth that term is

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.620 
measure the star from Earth that term is
called<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.960> parent<00:01:16.740> brightness<00:01:17.420> and<00:01:18.420> of

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
called the parent brightness and of

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.260 
called the parent brightness and of
course<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.290> stars<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.070> point<00:01:20.460> source<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:21.060> its

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
course of stars a point source so its

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.090 
course of stars a point source so its
intensity<00:01:21.810> falls<00:01:22.110> off<00:01:22.290> as<00:01:22.530> one<00:01:22.560> over<00:01:22.740> d

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
intensity falls off as one over d

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.920 
intensity falls off as one over d
squared<00:01:23.130> therefore<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:23.970> brightness<00:01:24.450> is

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
squared therefore the brightness is

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.520 
squared therefore the brightness is
equal<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.470> luminosity<00:01:26.180> divided<00:01:27.180> by<00:01:27.299> four<00:01:27.659> PI<00:01:27.689> d

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
equal to luminosity divided by four PI d

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.819 
equal to luminosity divided by four PI d
squared<00:01:28.920> or<00:01:29.009> DS<00:01:29.310> distance<00:01:30.560> ultimately<00:01:31.560> we

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
squared or DS distance ultimately we

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.649 
squared or DS distance ultimately we
want<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.159> measure<00:01:32.280> luminosity<00:01:33.119> does<00:01:33.329> one<00:01:33.540> of

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
want to measure luminosity does one of

want to measure luminosity does one of
the<00:01:33.810> characteristics<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.860> star<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:37.250> very

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
the characteristics of a star and very

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.550 
the characteristics of a star and very
hard<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.640> do<00:01:38.759> but<00:01:38.970> trust<00:01:39.240> me<00:01:39.329> can<00:01:39.689> be<00:01:39.720> done<00:01:40.020> the

hard to do but trust me can be done the

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.530 
hard to do but trust me can be done the
other<00:01:40.710> thing<00:01:40.950> we<00:01:41.070> need<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.280> talk<00:01:41.549> about<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:42.479> the

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
other thing we need to talk about is the

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.060 
other thing we need to talk about is the
temperature<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.350> start<00:01:43.710> because<00:01:43.890> only

characterizing stars we're looking at

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.830 
characterizing stars we're looking at

the surface temperature the Sun is a
typical<00:01:49.229> star<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.479> this<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.630> actually<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:52.079> plot

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
typical star and this is actually a plot

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.880 
typical star and this is actually a plot
of<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:53.250> its<00:01:53.670> blackbody<00:01:54.509> spectrum<00:01:54.659> it's<00:01:55.350> actual

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
see the Sun is yellow you actually

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.510 
see the Sun is yellow you actually
notice<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.290> most<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.770> energy<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.219> really

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
notice that most of the energy is really

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.990 
notice that most of the energy is really
coming

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
coming

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.090 
coming
at<00:02:03.120> a<00:02:03.180> little<00:02:03.690> bit<00:02:03.810> higher<00:02:04.020> range<00:02:04.380> but<00:02:04.860> our

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
at a little bit higher range but our

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.960 
at a little bit higher range but our
eyes<00:02:05.460> are<00:02:05.940> tuned<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:07.410> see<00:02:07.620> yellow<00:02:08.220> greenish<00:02:08.580> so

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
eyes are tuned to see yellow greenish so

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.720 
eyes are tuned to see yellow greenish so
we<00:02:09.090> can<00:02:09.330> see<00:02:09.600> the<00:02:09.750> Sun<00:02:09.990> as<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.200> maximum<00:02:10.730> yellow

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
we can see the Sun as a maximum yellow

comparing<00:02:58.650> our<00:02:58.770> stars<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.640> Sun<00:02:59.850> so<00:03:00.170> in

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
comparing our stars to the Sun so in

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.640 
comparing our stars to the Sun so in
terms<00:03:01.380> of<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.590> luminosity<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.970> Sun

how much work goes into making good
measurements<00:03:55.049> but<00:03:55.200> indeed<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:56.220> luminosity

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
measurements but indeed the luminosity

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.690 
measurements but indeed the luminosity
instead<00:03:57.329> of<00:03:57.480> temperature<00:03:57.959> can<00:03:58.320> be<00:03:58.700> determined

instead of temperature can be determined

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.259 
instead of temperature can be determined
and<00:03:59.850> what<00:04:00.630> happens<00:04:01.049> is<00:04:01.200> if<00:04:01.380> we<00:04:01.610> make<00:04:02.610> a<00:04:02.640> plot<00:04:03.000> of
