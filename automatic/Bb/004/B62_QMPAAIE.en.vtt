00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:22.779
 Hard Tobak from Sestak game 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.779
 it continues to concern the Iranians in December 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.710
 can get on your PC and thus has created a backup copy 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.680
 Of course we need something good for that and what is also very important is one 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.149
 Small town how the whole works you see now 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.100
 Of course, the first thing we need is the game, which she regrets 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.440
 and our Flash Card and of course the memory card 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.440
 for the flash approx 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.410
 there I make the package of Sweat Klier and a parking space then we have 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.400
 two active rounds like a pack first of all 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.530
 the TFTP archive 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.620
 there you will find a takes the air and an exe-file and we will open it 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.990
 eksim 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.310
 a new window opens and we go also Settings and Jena 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.300
 there each other the FDP fort in 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.300
 8080 and click on OK 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.570
 then put it back on odd uses 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.090
 and there we put a check mark at her local p 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.050
 otherwise leave everything and we click OK 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.190
 then one last time on Settings and on the guys 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.760
 and then we go to at 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.360
 giving test to a loved one will test and password can also test some 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.630
 Of course, modify that too 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.900
 next to it at TUI is also up 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.900
 and there would be few physicists there 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.640
 Colon DAX easily Zemp 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.759
 this is where the files are stored afterwards 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.780
 Thermal Skin is also up and giving because Commission SEC 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.980
 RW Ahlen 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.980
 there stands for Listing Blue Ideas End click 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.840
 we confirm again with okay 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.840
 and looked at it again 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.689
 be okay again and now also clean and self-confectionery 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:20.459
 the configuration saved so far and the setting will be in this 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.509
 new ones of the time 

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:26.689
 Now we can start the server by pressing Play or Serra 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:27.170
 was 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.749
 and indeed 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:32.349
 if everything is configured correctly for Delsberg the BI server it 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.349
 predominate 

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:40.899
 the program will let you in your groups we will take care of others 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:41.899
 rich IV 

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:45.599
 namely the program that comes later on the Nintendo DS 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.860
 Again, there are two files in Idar time and an NDS again 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:50.639
 time of the crime 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.979
 we edit the songs time with a right click 

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:56.209
 and then work there 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.179
 there is this at PI 

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:03.009
 of course also our data which we would have given before in a 

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:06.009
 So change that and that they fit your data 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:12.380
 but how does Ipro find out we go to state and they enter CMD 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.700
 and soon the AXA will change up at least on Windows 7 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:18.719
 then give if the prompt 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:21.209
 enter the conflict 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.279
 once older we already had a ben eliezer a list but beer 

00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:28.569
 We're finally interested in the iApp for the above 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.839
 like pioneer St 

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:34.389
 And it is precisely this declared rassam that is now in everyone's mind 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:37.389
 Contribute part 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:46.570
 Of course, the pornography also stands at 8080 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.570
 and at the moment we will save it 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.930
 Prompt baskets close and these two files if the interest 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.439
 So Wolfert's save it to the root directory of our sd card 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.549
 if that is on it we can now look around the Nintendo DS 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:12.380
 Wagener concert hall but holding hands 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.449
 and fast Schillig also our Flash Card 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:18.639
 In my case that would be the n3 MoliÃ¨re 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.719
 the state has arrived in the designated destination 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.270
 the complaining of it and start them 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.380
 in the about made the file from the Belgrade our Flash Card 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.380
 namely have the in the Astor 2 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.930
 Now we are in the program itself and on the throne to a screen 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.080
 we see now that will have to take the ability out 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.129
 and then we have to do the game that we want to thank, so now for a moment 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:00.059
 swap the cards 

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:03.059
 and then confirm with the APA key 

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:10.319
 Now we have date some info about the game for example the title 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:13.719
 and the room size and reports to Sal Ethan Becker 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:16.530
 this is sort of a menu now 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.810
 and there you can save your memory 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.010
 but we also want to secure our game, that means you can join us now 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.599
 So he could navigate Dr with the shoulder buttons and we'll go twice 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:30.229
 right the second most valuable 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:34.509
 then if he does not go down to fronts and we push the bitterest 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:37.509
 led Unas at Create 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.889
 Now we are asked again if we really want to do that and we 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.889
 of course deal with the Arthas Tel 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:03.110
 how it might look the game is 64 MB in size at 4 60 MB it takes about 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.599
 to thank the game for an hour 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:09.039
 for a more detailed look a handy video description 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:11.759
 on the program screen now begins 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:15.029
 the display shows how far the Becker has progressed 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:21.650
 and when it's done, it's of course in the Buches folder 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.990
 saved 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.990
 in this case Dorfman turns 10 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:30.389
 and go to the folder Temp 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:33.600
 and dat is now our CERN sign 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.289
 and NDS Tatzeit 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:38.020
 which of course we can open again and so maybe we could pull 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.499
 and thus could play on the go without having to bring along all modules
