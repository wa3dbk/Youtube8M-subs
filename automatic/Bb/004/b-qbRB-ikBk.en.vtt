is the computer itself it is a I think

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.320 
is the computer itself it is a I think
that's<00:05:21.970> gateway<00:05:22.389> I'm<00:05:22.599> not<00:05:22.750> sure<00:05:22.960> well<00:05:23.680> yeah

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
that's gateway I'm not sure well yeah

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.930 
that's gateway I'm not sure well yeah
it's<00:05:25.330> an<00:05:26.080> old<00:05:26.260> thing<00:05:26.680> i<00:05:26.979> got<00:05:27.159> it<00:05:27.280> for<00:05:27.370> like<00:05:27.490> 200
