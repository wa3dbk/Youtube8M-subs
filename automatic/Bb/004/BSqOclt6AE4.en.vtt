include some proof

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.330 
include some proof
it's<00:00:12.360> basically<00:00:12.840> an<00:00:13.080> open<00:00:13.440> G<00:00:13.710> tuning<00:00:13.740> that's

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
it's basically an open G tuning that's

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.919 
it's basically an open G tuning that's
without<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:15.089> capo<00:00:15.450> on<00:00:15.570> we're<00:00:15.719> going<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:15.870> put

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
without the capo on we're going to put

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.560 
without the capo on we're going to put
the<00:00:16.109> cap<00:00:16.260> on<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.560> fourth<00:00:16.859> fret<00:00:17.190> so<00:00:17.490> open<00:00:18.390> G

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
the cap on the fourth fret so open G

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.019 
the cap on the fourth fret so open G
tuning<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:19.050> change<00:00:19.289> your<00:00:19.439> top<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:20.580> fat<00:00:20.789> a

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
tuning and change your top the fat a

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.160 
tuning and change your top the fat a
string<00:00:21.359> down<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.810> D<00:00:22.850> then<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.210> string<00:00:24.779> the

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.710 

and<00:00:30.280> then<00:00:30.580> the<00:00:30.700> rest<00:00:30.880> of<00:00:31.000> the<00:00:31.090> same<00:00:31.270> apart<00:00:31.630> from

and then the rest of the same apart from

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.430 
and then the rest of the same apart from
the<00:00:31.870> very<00:00:32.080> thin<00:00:32.950> east<00:00:33.430> ring<00:00:33.760> the<00:00:33.970> top<00:00:34.210> one<00:00:34.440> this

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
the very thin east ring the top one this

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:42.390 
the very thin east ring the top one this
one<00:00:35.710> here<00:00:36.120> change<00:00:37.120> that<00:00:37.360> down<00:00:37.989> to<00:00:38.320> a<00:00:38.350> D<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:42.280> when

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
one here change that down to a D so when

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.869 
one here change that down to a D so when
you<00:00:42.489> play<00:00:42.670> it<00:00:43.860> should<00:00:44.860> only<00:00:44.980> be<00:00:45.190> a<00:00:45.280> nice<00:00:45.460> G

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
move in that but on the fifth fret

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.500 
move in that but on the fifth fret

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
starting at the fifth string so you get

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:54.710 
starting at the fifth string so you get
that<00:02:47.510> okay<00:02:48.510> so

right<00:03:25.470> okay<00:03:25.740> so<00:03:27.140> that's<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.320> first<00:03:28.560> chord<00:03:28.800> and

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
right okay so that's the first chord and

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.440

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:55.130 
then we're putting this pinky one on the
second<00:03:33.870> string<00:03:34.140> on<00:03:35.960> the<00:03:36.960> fifth<00:03:37.110> fret<00:03:42.950> open<00:03:54.140> so

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
second string on the fifth fret open so

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:06.140 
second string on the fifth fret open so
to<00:03:55.200> shift<00:03:55.530> it<00:03:55.710> back<00:03:55.920> and<00:03:56.100> forth

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.890 

and<00:04:07.150> moving<00:04:07.480> this<00:04:07.570> down

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:25.090 

you

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:31.440 

so<00:04:25.400> I'm<00:04:25.490> doing<00:04:25.669> theirs<00:04:26.770> first

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.280 

then<00:04:32.450> I'm<00:04:32.510> taking<00:04:32.690> this<00:04:32.990> one<00:04:34.120> and<00:04:35.200> moving<00:04:36.200> it

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
then I'm taking this one and moving it

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.400 
then I'm taking this one and moving it
down<00:04:36.440> a<00:04:36.500> fret

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:48.880 

take<00:04:42.410> this<00:04:42.530> one<00:04:42.710> off<00:04:42.830> I<00:04:47.290> was<00:04:48.290> hammering<00:04:48.590> on<00:04:48.710> the

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
take this one off I was hammering on the

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.650 
take this one off I was hammering on the
third-string

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:11.720 

like<00:04:54.660> that

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:17.190 

and<00:05:12.730> then<00:05:12.940> we're<00:05:13.270> going<00:05:15.450> first<00:05:16.450> fret<00:05:16.780> second

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
and then we're going first fret second

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:28.890 
and then we're going first fret second
string<00:05:23.940> second<00:05:24.940> finger<00:05:27.030> second<00:05:28.030> fret<00:05:28.330> fourth

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
string second finger second fret fourth

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.020 
string second finger second fret fourth
string

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.230 

putting<00:05:34.600> this<00:05:34.690> pinky<00:05:35.050> on<00:05:35.170> the<00:05:35.200> third<00:05:36.240> fret

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
putting this pinky on the third fret

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:43.010 
putting this pinky on the third fret
second<00:05:37.630> string<00:05:37.660> hammering<00:05:38.530> on

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.310 

and<00:05:43.259> open

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
and open

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.670 
and open
opens<00:05:46.190> from<00:05:46.400> there<00:05:47.080> and<00:05:48.080> then<00:05:48.440> we're<00:05:48.590> doing

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
opens from there and then we're doing

00:05:48.680 --> 00:06:08.369 
opens from there and then we're doing
like<00:05:51.910> first<00:05:52.910> fret<00:05:53.770> second<00:05:54.770> string

00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:08.379 

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:12.249 

so<00:06:09.379> the<00:06:09.469> first<00:06:09.739> fret<00:06:09.979> second<00:06:10.369> string<00:06:11.259> would

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:12.259 
so the first fret second string would

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:14.409 
so the first fret second string would
the<00:06:12.409> second<00:06:12.739> thing<00:06:12.949> up<00:06:13.159> in<00:06:13.399> the<00:06:13.489> second<00:06:13.879> fret

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:14.419 
the second thing up in the second fret

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:25.950 
the second thing up in the second fret
on<00:06:14.689> the<00:06:14.809> 5th<00:06:15.169> string<00:06:15.550> so<00:06:16.550> we<00:06:16.610> doing<00:06:16.849> that<00:06:17.080> open

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.129 

that's<00:06:26.470> kind<00:06:26.770> of<00:06:26.830> it<00:06:27.540> so<00:06:28.540> that's<00:06:28.630> those<00:06:28.840> two

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:29.139 
that's kind of it so that's those two

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:33.400 
that's kind of it so that's those two
fingers<00:06:29.530> using<00:06:29.710> that<00:06:29.889> cord

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:33.410 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.050 

and<00:06:33.890> I'ma<00:06:34.100> can<00:06:34.220> just<00:06:34.370> move<00:06:34.490> back<00:06:34.520> into<00:06:34.910> this

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.060 
and I'ma can just move back into this

00:06:35.060 --> 00:07:14.760 
and I'ma can just move back into this
first<00:06:35.330> shape

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:14.770 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:37.059 

you

00:07:37.059 --> 00:07:37.069 

00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:41.810 

it's<00:07:38.069> kind<00:07:38.280> of<00:07:38.400> it<00:07:38.520> helping<00:07:39.389> make<00:07:39.509> sense
