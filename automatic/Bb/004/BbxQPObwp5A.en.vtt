record vocals actually got lost in the
recording<00:00:24.089> session<00:00:24.509> so<00:00:24.630> we<00:00:24.660> only<00:00:24.900> had<00:00:25.140> a

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:25.169 
recording session so we only had a

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:27.259 
recording session so we only had a
version<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.859> with<00:00:26.339> his<00:00:26.640> own<00:00:26.820> game<00:00:27.060> play

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
version of it with his own game play

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.810 
version of it with his own game play
audio<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.960> our<00:00:28.349> vocals<00:00:28.859> from<00:00:28.949> skype<00:00:29.310> mixed<00:00:29.730> in

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
audio and our vocals from skype mixed in

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.609 
audio and our vocals from skype mixed in
with<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.390> if<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:30.660> hear<00:00:30.900> doubling<00:00:31.349> up<00:00:31.499> at

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
with that so if you hear doubling up at

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.710 
with that so if you hear doubling up at
occasions<00:00:32.160> that's<00:00:32.760> why<00:00:33.060> but<00:00:33.330> I<00:00:33.360> think<00:00:33.570> for<00:00:33.660> the

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
occasions that's why but I think for the

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.780 
occasions that's why but I think for the
most<00:00:33.900> part<00:00:34.050> after<00:00:34.530> about<00:00:35.040> an<00:00:35.190> hour<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> half

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
most part after about an hour and a half

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.760 
most part after about an hour and a half
of<00:00:35.910> slaving<00:00:36.360> over<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.810> I<00:00:37.020> got<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.620> sound

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
of slaving over it I got it to sound

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.380 
of slaving over it I got it to sound
okay<00:00:38.220> so<00:00:38.580> if<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.760> enjoyed<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.090> video<00:00:39.180> please
