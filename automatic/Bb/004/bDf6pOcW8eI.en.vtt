00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:39.900 

look<00:00:31.580> you<00:00:32.580> meant<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.850> do<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.060> tail<00:00:33.450> touch

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:59.290 

you're<00:00:40.910> clear<00:00:41.180> to<00:00:41.300> your<00:00:41.390> right

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.710 

kind<00:01:06.430> of<00:01:06.460> what<00:01:06.580> it<00:01:06.670> was<00:01:06.760> designed<00:01:06.909> for<00:01:07.420> I<00:01:09.720> think

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
kind of what it was designed for I think

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.330 
kind of what it was designed for I think
it<00:01:10.840> still<00:01:11.050> depends<00:01:11.380> on<00:01:11.560> who's<00:01:11.740> on<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:12.040> sticks

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
it still depends on who's on the sticks

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.940 
it still depends on who's on the sticks
though<00:01:12.780> they<00:01:13.780> could<00:01:13.960> quite<00:01:14.260> do<00:01:14.440> that<00:01:14.470> if<00:01:14.800> I

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
though they could quite do that if I

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.770 
though they could quite do that if I
