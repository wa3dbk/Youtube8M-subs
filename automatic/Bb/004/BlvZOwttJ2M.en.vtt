00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
is enough to get double class because I

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.910 
is enough to get double class because I
have<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.479> feeling<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.079> want<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.650> go<00:01:40.770> for

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
have a feeling that I want to go for

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.620 
have a feeling that I want to go for
double<00:01:41.100> class<00:01:41.280> now<00:01:41.490> considering<00:01:42.329> how<00:01:42.450> much

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
double class now considering how much

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.359 
double class now considering how much
easier<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.229> it's<00:01:43.500> about<00:01:43.710> like<00:01:43.950> three<00:01:44.280> to

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
easier it is it's about like three to

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.340 
easier it is it's about like three to
four<00:01:44.549> times<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:45.000> easier<00:01:45.450> as<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.869> was<00:01:46.170> before

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
four times is easier as it was before

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.530 
four times is easier as it was before
