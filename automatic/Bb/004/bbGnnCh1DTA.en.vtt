00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
gonna start by assembling the center

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.179 
gonna start by assembling the center
tubes<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.509> the<00:01:12.630> side<00:01:12.840> tubes<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.920> we're<00:01:14.069> gonna

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
tubes to the side tubes and we're gonna

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.510 
tubes to the side tubes and we're gonna
insert<00:01:15.020> the<00:01:16.020> side<00:01:16.229> tube<00:01:16.530> just<00:01:17.039> a<00:01:17.130> few<00:01:17.340> inches

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
insert the side tube just a few inches

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.730 
insert the side tube just a few inches
now<00:01:18.329> you<00:01:18.420> don't<00:01:18.719> have<00:01:18.959> to<00:01:19.109> go<00:01:19.229> all<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.590> way<00:01:19.619> to

now you don't have to go all the way to

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.319 
now you don't have to go all the way to
the<00:01:19.920> tape<00:01:20.130> edge<00:01:20.340> that's<00:01:20.609> not<00:01:20.789> what<00:01:20.969> this<00:01:21.090> tape

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:32.330 
so just to start we're gonna insert all
the<00:01:28.619> tubes<00:01:29.299> into<00:01:30.299> one<00:01:30.479> side<00:01:30.749> try<00:01:31.709> to<00:01:31.770> align<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
the tubes into one side try to align the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.800 
the tubes into one side try to align the
edges<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.819> that<00:01:32.969> they<00:01:33.119> have<00:01:33.299> about<00:01:33.539> equal

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
edges so that they have about equal

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.480 
edges so that they have about equal
standoff<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.619> start<00:01:34.889> Oh<00:01:34.979> make<00:01:35.189> things<00:01:35.369> a
