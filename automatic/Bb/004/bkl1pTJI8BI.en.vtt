00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.329
 Child reports impress 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.710
 despite the young age, the experience in 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:05.180
 world of drugs is amazing the one 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.369

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.440
 narcotic 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.619
 unfortunately this is a reality of 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.240
 many public schools in the country according to 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.750

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.829
 involving children 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.590
 the poles where the problem is most critical 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.780
 the need for an increase in the 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.149
 but the problems in the 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.250
 schools are not just the drug cases 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.200
 of violence against students and even 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.000
 teachers are registered with 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.439
 frequency in police stations 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.360
 a union survey of 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.090
 education specialists from the state of 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.709
 São Paulo shows that only 18% of 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.810
 educational institutions of the interior 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:15.380
 do not have event records 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.750
 police in 82% of the institutions 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.910
 an educator has already suffered physical aggression 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.160
 recently even a tv crew 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.440
 record has been beaten while 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:34.320
 did a report on the subject 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:36.660
 the in November last year the inspector 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.060
 was seriously injured he surprised 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.710
 three students outside of class time 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.780
 pulling the tires of 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.580
 teachers in the parking lot of this 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.440
 school located in a district of são 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.390
 black river josé the 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.250
 The employee was torn and 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.340
 blood spots per brought the 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.790
 eyebrow mouth the eye stayed very 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.010
 purple and swollen about 66 percent of 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.930
 Brazilian students claim to have 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.960
 suffered or committed assaults against 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.090
 classmates in addition to punching and kicking 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.550
 Another type of frequent aggression is 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.380
 psychological violence characterized by 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.130
 also as bullying is an English term 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.320
 which means this persecution debauchery 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.900
 12 year old girl is part of the 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.510
 statistical account that she picked up five 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.900
 times within the school in all cases 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:28.710
 there was no reason to speak the truth 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:31.140
 You think it's all right once. 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:34.230
 showed the cursing autonomy few 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.300
 you 've got one thing, but it 's in the 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.640
 school that the problem happens is in 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.980
 own school that may be the solution 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.290
 according to educators, situations of 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.630
 vandalism and trafficking in 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.790
 drugs can be avoided 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.230
 I think if all the municipalities 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.020
 have a part that really 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.300
 invest in this extended journey offer 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.260
 what they really like and enjoy 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.300
 to do 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.530
 they started looking at the gold school 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.630
 with other eyes 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.570
 may even seem indiscipline to students 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.030
 But the mess here in this classroom is 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.400
 released is that they are rehearsing for 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.440
 a theater presentation projects like 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.410
 The purpose of this is to prevent 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.799
 crime more time in schools - 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.239
 time through activities like this. 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.000
 the future of these 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.550
 us and adolescents begins to be traced 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.310
 in children totalitarian viability that 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.250
 that discovers inside the project, right? 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.789
 another view of life here the lessons are 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.979
 hip hop theater and dance activities that 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:37.319
 can arouse a taste for art to 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:40.020
 citizenship and even professional interest 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:40.800
 You and I, I see them. 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.780
 dancing 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.120
 There you have dance class here to 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.169
 People are beautiful then and it 's not just the gift 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.270
 that has a dream 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.669
 hugo who had childhood stolen by 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.930
 knows that the future can be 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:05:05.849
 different 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:05:09.080
 is a form with an organ to the nose panel 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:09.080
