00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:09.429
 the poetry books and the novels photos 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:09.429
 planets that it rains 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.820
 what a disco cristian and I hope that 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.440
 are very well today I come to 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.080
 talk about a fight night news 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.060
 sad fredys super chida and at the same time super 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.230
 rare good not super rare first that 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.689
 nothing today 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.960
 scott well it was not today it was actually yesterday 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:31.560
 yesterday scott wilson with 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.560
 mcdonald 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.880
 it occurred to me to say that is called scott 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.610
 count on but only coolest rivers' of 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.800
 mcdonald's good I'm already laughing myself 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.470
 only from myself of those investigated that 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.840
 I say sometimes said yesterday that supposedly 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.060
 he had been hacked and then he said no 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.980
 many people logically cared is 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.840
 as if suddenly I upload a video 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.940
 saying there they hacked me I pinched 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.250
 YouTube account and I put a robot voice 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.200
 and then I say oh no kidding 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.360
 basically that did yesterday yesterday 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.130
 the same clarified that it was a joke that 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.350
 that they have not hacked it that follows 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.659
 working on the game that was already tested 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.420
 a beta or they already tried a little the 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.920
 I play him and two friends he has good not 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.150
 He said their names but said that two 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.640
 people help 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.950
 to try the game says it was a success 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.110
 the game is still just taking 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.310
 many have asked me if this 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.740
 Once you wanted someone you have not heard 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.540
 some rumor or something really does not 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.090
 you know for sure the day of 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.580
 exit but it is assumed that in about two 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.170
 months may already be the game still 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.300
 he has not said anything but they are already 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.920
 trying as it says something that was done to me 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.770
 very father and at the same time very rare is that 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.480
 put the download link for a game and 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.760
 that game is supposed to be fight night 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.560
 and freddie stress when you download it 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.530
 it's a game he had already made 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.020
 platform game called bears know 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.930
 button pause or there is no pause button 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.060
 and it's a platform game basically 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.830
 What he did is put that game on only 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.290
 the character comes out with the head of 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.930
 freddy I tried to record several times the 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.850
 gameplay but it's very weird because the 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.610
 three times I tried to record my 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.470
 computer crasos to my computer it 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.840
 He turned off when he played the game after 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.790
 to finish the game I was skype and it was 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.100
 turned off the computer so 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.230
 honestly I do not know what that was 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.580
 I do not think it was my computer 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.920
 yes because it has 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.050
 the components my computer is not 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.150
 it's so bad for it to be turned off by a 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.370
 game of those or got confused with 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.020
 something who knows but I could not 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.910
 record very well a gameplay of all 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.560
 ways I'll look around for some photo 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.450
 or something that I can put to 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.360
 see what I mean is basically 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.860
 a platform game that he put 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.560
 supposedly when you download it says 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.790
 fire chat fredys 3 runs it if it is not a 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.220
 game that I had done with 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.810
 precedence of platforms only that 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.820
 it comes out on freddy's head instead of 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.430
 leave the normal game that's something else 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.500
 very interesting and the last but not 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.709
 less important is that it is 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.780
 rumored a new a new character 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.730
 a new animatronic or let them tell 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.920
 the story basically in this message 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.870
 who are now watching on the screen if 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.690
 they are fixed is wrong written is fine 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.480
 written but some words have two 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.370
 letters for example night has 23 is 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.220
 poorly written and so there is one another 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.040
 word if all these letters together 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.170
 suppose it says my name is sprint trap 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.660
 that for those who do not know I guess the 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.060
 Most know spring is like spring and 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.800
 trap is cheating many are saying that 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.290
 this 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.480
 is going to be a new animatronic, that is, 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.660
 done the full sentence is my name is 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.450
 spring trap my name is spring cheat 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.340
 it's like spring trap who 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.530
 know if it refers to who spring 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.690
 go out the game or just a 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.700
 new animatronic or simply the 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.920
 people are very drugged that also that 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.780
 is an option is an option today new and 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.460
 I do not say that you are the drugged street 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.630
 is the snout basically this video for 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.760
 tell them that 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.260
 scott was updating and there is beta or 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.660
 be good there is no beta rather well 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.330
 he tried already they were testing it there is a 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.340
 thing hidden in his message that says my 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.260
 name is spring trap that we do not know if 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.450
 It is an animatronic or if it is a date of 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.910
 exit or just as I tell them is 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.790
 something of the people who invents and 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.530
 the other thing is that he put a mini game 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.150
 titled as a fight night fredys 3 that 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.250
 it's just a game he had already made 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.290
 with freddy's face they will not be 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.700
 looking out there in the background until here I'm going to 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.740
 leave this remember that if you want 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.990
 keep seeing things like this interesting 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.760
 fight night fredys even to see if 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.890
 then I can make a top or something 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.870
 that catches my attention for you 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.129
 when the game comes out it would go up on 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.469
 channel that's more 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:38.939
