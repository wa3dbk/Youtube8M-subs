step on the potatoes when they're
cultivating<00:01:20.700> they<00:01:20.850> would<00:01:21.030> step<00:01:21.299> too<00:01:21.540> wide<00:01:21.780> and

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
cultivating they would step too wide and

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.810 
cultivating they would step too wide and
not<00:01:22.170> be<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.530> furrow<00:01:22.740> important<00:01:23.700> that

give them more fullness on this side

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.719

than<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.200> do<00:01:55.409> on<00:01:55.439> this<00:01:55.770> side<00:01:56.009> because<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.549> the

oftentimes<00:01:59.430> when<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.880> pick<00:02:00.420> them<00:02:00.509> up<00:02:00.630> on<00:02:00.810> your

oftentimes when you pick them up on your

oftentimes when you pick them up on your

host and you can see a lot of that but

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.830 
host and you can see a lot of that but
it<00:02:02.640> becomes<00:02:02.850> difficult<00:02:03.149> with<00:02:03.570> all<00:02:03.719> this

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
it becomes difficult with all this

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.929 
it becomes difficult with all this
feathering<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:05.100> when<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.340> pick<00:02:05.520> them<00:02:05.640> up<00:02:05.790> and

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
feathering so when you pick them up and

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.719 
feathering so when you pick them up and
take<00:02:06.119> them<00:02:06.149> in<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.450> natural<00:02:06.810> range<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.110> motion

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
take them in the natural range of motion

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.339 
take them in the natural range of motion
just<00:02:08.729> smooth<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.149> feathering<00:02:09.479> out

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
just smooth the feathering out

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.530 
just smooth the feathering out
and<00:02:10.649> look<00:02:11.310> down<00:02:11.489> that<00:02:11.670> limb<00:02:11.909> you<00:02:12.090> can<00:02:12.239> see<00:02:12.390> it

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
and look down that limb you can see it

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.319 
and look down that limb you can see it
goes<00:02:12.689> in<00:02:12.719> and<00:02:13.200> then<00:02:13.499> it<00:02:13.560> goes<00:02:13.680> in<00:02:13.829> again<00:02:14.329> you

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
goes in and then it goes in again you

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.929 
goes in and then it goes in again you

in the future we'll consider bringing
this<00:04:11.560> branch<00:04:12.560> out<00:04:12.830> a<00:04:12.860> little<00:04:13.040> further<00:04:13.480> maybe

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
this branch out a little further maybe

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.940 
this branch out a little further maybe
giving<00:04:14.810> him<00:04:14.930> a<00:04:15.019> little<00:04:15.170> more<00:04:15.409> material<00:04:15.560> by

giving him a little more material by

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.629 
giving him a little more material by
bumping<00:04:16.370> that<00:04:16.400> quarter<00:04:16.880> up<00:04:17.090> or<00:04:18.340> swelling<00:04:19.340> that

bumping that quarter up or swelling that

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:35.230 
bumping that quarter up or swelling that
he'll<00:04:20.000> to<00:04:20.720> make<00:04:20.870> it<00:04:20.989> wider
