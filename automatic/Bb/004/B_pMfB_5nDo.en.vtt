00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
afraid I make a building which acts as a

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.300 
afraid I make a building which acts as a
stage<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:52.600> garden<00:01:53.110> is<00:01:53.320> in<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:53.619> center<00:01:54.100> not

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
stage the garden is in the center not

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.480 
stage the garden is in the center not
you<00:01:54.520> and<00:01:54.759> not<00:01:54.909> me<00:01:54.939> and<00:01:55.600> not<00:01:55.659> anybody<00:01:56.409> else<00:01:56.799> we

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
you and not me and not anybody else we

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.600 
you and not me and not anybody else we
around<00:01:58.030> God<00:01:58.509> not<00:01:58.869> in<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.500> garden<00:01:59.680> so<00:02:00.130> I<00:02:00.340> think

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
around God not in the garden so I think

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.920 
around God not in the garden so I think
this<00:02:00.789> is<00:02:01.000> really<00:02:01.180> beautiful

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
this is really beautiful

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.100 
this is really beautiful
and<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:03.100> think<00:02:03.549> everybody<00:02:04.000> understands<00:02:04.750> right

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
and I think everybody understands right

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.529 
and I think everybody understands right
