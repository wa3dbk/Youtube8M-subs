00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.790
 enter college and graduate in a 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.280
 profession is not an easy task for anyone. 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.379
 now imagine trying to fulfill this dream 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.500
 without listening to anything 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.930
 In Brazil, more and more deaf people come to 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.210
 university but the number according to 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.310
 organizations that represent people 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.320
 with this deficiency are still 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.449
 considered small 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.000
 check out the report by tamires claire 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.730
 henrique farias 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.450
 silvio has been deaf administrator since 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.510
 was born 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.730
 achieving this goal was not easy 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.410
 A lot of people I did not have anymore like that 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.600
 I'm going to develop this part without 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.210
 interpreter then I started to 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.620
 develop these parts by reading then 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.379
 I had to be very patient I had 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.960
 that I suffered a lot on my part from 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.180
 communication for those who do not 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.850
 there begins the Brazilian language 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.649
 signs or simply pounds 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.570
 the Portuguese for the majority stays in 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.000
 which makes it difficult to 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.150
 Most students drop out of school 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.310
 in the early years tatiana knows 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.890
 well this reality is the only one 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.380
 deaf teacher at the federal university 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.210
 from Amazonas in Itaacoatiara where she is 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.790
 one of those responsible for 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.400
 compulsory discipline for 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.430
 teacher training courses and there 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.380
 none of the students are deaf even invited the 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.200
 study will study with me is coming 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.360
 with me I'm undoing so it 's a 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.579
 expression of shyness 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.869
 This makes it very difficult, because I think 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.939
 that he already has an idea that the school 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.490
 but the absence of deafness in the 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.460
 universities is not limited to the 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.939
 the fact that it extends throughout the 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.220
 state according to a decree of 2005 all 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.530
 federal educational institutions have 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.200
 obligation to provide facilities to 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.520
 deaf people giving them conditions to 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.189
 follow the lessons 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.680
 that is, interpreters are needed both in 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.840
 in classrooms in 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.570
 all levels of education 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.350
 but here in Manaus the law is not put into 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.810
 practice 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.119
 Joana, for example, had to give up 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.370
 one 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.140
 of psychology because the institution in 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.010
 that she studied did not offer 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.500
 interpreter 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.080
 now the deaf community will enter 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.239
 resource for the next enem to be 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.790
 all translated into pounds 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.159
 joan made the enem for the second time in the year 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.620
 passed the student account that had 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.549
 difficulties in the test because it is all 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.190
 Portuguese 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.379
 the few interpreters in rooms only draw 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.370
 some doubts but even with the 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:39.280
 obstacles 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.940
 She still dreams of graduating in explodes. 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.290
 I think that in the future when and 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.739
 psychologist I may be helping 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.200
 community deaf to the community hear this 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.120
 but the deaf community 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.989
 listeners and we have professionals 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.510
 psychologists and I 'll be helping 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.879
 further encouraging them to deaf culture 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.370
 the national coordinating councilor 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:05.920
 integration of the person carrying the 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.930
 explains that there is still much to 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.530
 be made to fully include the 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:14.680
 deaf people in the academic community is 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.230
 it is not only easy to put the interpreter 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.720
 which to guarantee the right to 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.980
 of the deaf requires academic support 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:26.049
 also to some questions of proof 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.930
 for example the teacher delivers proof 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:31.450
 For me and I needed a teacher. 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.489
 particular to adapt to this test 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:38.560
 to the language the sign language by 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:41.459
 example of 50 questions is 5 eu 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.410
 I was able to accomplish 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:47.079
 because it was interpreted and I got it 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.030
 understand university is more capable 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.310
 Why do you imagine only the group of it all? 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.069
 inside the university and everything else when 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.440
 he enters he ends up having a 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.840
 communication between everyone then this 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.419
 only to the detriment of the listeners and 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.970
 deaf people will not be there anymore because they 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:06.900
 will stand on the same footing as the 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.900
 sign language too
