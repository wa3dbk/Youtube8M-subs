limited-slip front and rear we can

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.979 
limited-slip front and rear we can
continue<00:00:39.000> driving<00:00:39.210> we<00:00:39.450> don't<00:00:39.629> need<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.870> do

continue driving we don't need to do

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.889 
continue driving we don't need to do
above<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.379> drone<00:00:40.620> but<00:00:41.480> done<00:00:42.480> once<00:00:42.750> we

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
above a drone but done once we

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.690 
above a drone but done once we
straighten<00:00:43.110> out<00:00:43.410> we're<00:00:43.980> going<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.280> use<00:00:44.399> crawl

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
straighten out we're going to use crawl

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.880 
straighten out we're going to use crawl
control<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.690> modulate<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.289> brake<00:00:46.530> pressure

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
control to modulate the brake pressure

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.279 
control to modulate the brake pressure
to<00:00:47.700> allow<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.329> smoothly<00:00:48.629> go<00:00:48.899> down<00:00:49.079> that

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
to allow this to smoothly go down that

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.830 
to allow this to smoothly go down that
grade<00:00:49.820> all<00:00:50.820> we're<00:00:51.059> going<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.239> do<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.420> focus<00:00:51.600> on

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
grade all we're going to do is focus on

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.709 
grade all we're going to do is focus on
steering<00:00:55.430> so<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.850> really<00:00:57.300> great<00:00:57.420> shot

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
steering so this is a really great shot

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.090 
steering so this is a really great shot
that's<00:00:57.989> going<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.199> happen<00:00:58.469> right<00:00:58.620> now

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
that's going to happen right now

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.500 
that's going to happen right now
it's<00:00:59.399> going<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.699> get<00:00:59.789> up<00:00:59.940> here<00:01:00.149> he's<00:01:00.329> going<00:01:00.449> to

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
it's going to get up here he's going to

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.979 
it's going to get up here he's going to
go<00:01:00.629> off<00:01:00.809> camber<00:01:01.289> off<00:01:01.949> camber<00:01:02.660> is<00:01:03.660> going<00:01:03.930> to

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
go off camber off camber is going to

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.570 
go off camber off camber is going to
allow<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.260> bring<00:01:04.680> on<00:01:04.830> flex<00:01:07.250> so<00:01:08.250> you're<00:01:08.460> gonna

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
allow that bring on flex so you're gonna

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.520 
allow that bring on flex so you're gonna
see<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.760> little<00:01:08.939> wheel<00:01:09.180> left<00:01:09.390> on<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.840> left-hand

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
see a little wheel left on the left-hand

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.500 
see a little wheel left on the left-hand
side<00:01:10.560> we're<00:01:11.250> gonna<00:01:11.430> go<00:01:11.520> forward<00:01:11.790> compression
