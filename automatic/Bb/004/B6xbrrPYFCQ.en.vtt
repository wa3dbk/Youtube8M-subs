00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:13.389
 many say good 20 percent off 8 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.699
 I would still be up to 5 2 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:17.689
 so 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:20.689
 Norbert manage to sell as a researcher 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:24.339
 DÃ¶rfler degree brought 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.050
 so i was not sure her now 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.140
 as they 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.140

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.039
 Roger Richman once 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:41.130
 Koenigstein 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.990
 St

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.430
 rare actually and pool 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.860
 at 2 1 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.420
 it's best to set it free immediately 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.420
 yes or no for complex products 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.410
 and give the tip on 24 and does not really look at more 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.450
 Percent have lost a game 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.480
 still 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.510
 why is it still clear to the corner today 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.460
 do not allow here yes 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.480
 I have super Prof 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.080
 Mayor Norbert Brugger I also know that something has been done 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.800
 often dispensable 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.900
 the sequence stores panic and consequence so 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.580
 it does not hurt if I say the gun now, too, we are gone 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.560
 otherwise I would have the tires 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.560
 while Jonas Brothers is not speaker of the church folk 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.460

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.470
 to go live 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.470
 yes, if now a case from Garrel II 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.410

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.789
 how many times when it is necessary you ask me stored there 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.999

 press here 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:16.959
 just to feel that way 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.959
 yes, never in love with me so initially outweighed 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.669
 The reason why the incident is wrong is that the chains are now in 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:28.949
 next or at least it feels 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:31.949

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:36.619

 even as a star to describe 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.359

 Century, the tablet is not that on Monday or steam clouds morning 

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:22.149
 then go straight on do not say 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:26.289
