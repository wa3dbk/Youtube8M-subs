00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 Hi, I'm back today and I'll tell you one. 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:11.340
 a little about the little book 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:15.540
 Prince of the anthurian of this acting and santi 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:23.010
 ex super rich in French is great and level 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:25.470
 to read and I do not even measure and dagil is the 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.670
 already finished small editions 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.759
 Prince is this is the 48th edition and 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.210
 with author's watercolors then he has 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.210
 graphic 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:45.660
 rodriguinho is access is just one that is more 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:51.899
 which is much nicer for the book 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.969
 the child is in the katori victory of the 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.280
 author 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.989
 he says that a book with the child but 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.809
 he dedicates an adult 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:07.470
 so he dedicates the child to the adult 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:12.180
 It was one day and I think a child she 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.100
 You're not going to get it, maybe you 'll get more. 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.710
 I think most will not get it 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:22.470
 to pick up or what the author wants to 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:26.310
 kind of some teaching and why 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.490
 despite being a lightweight book he has 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.440
 too much content 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.990
 the little prince he is a living young man 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:40.510
 Who lives in Brazil completes a lot? 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:44.290
 small planet b 612 and he 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:47.020
 he has 31 beautiful thing and a rose to 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:52.000
 rose she went there to seed the rose 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:56.800
 thence through the wind and decided 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.950
 planting the seed and a rose was 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:03.820
 pink conversation with him pink pants 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:08.619
 she is very bossy 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:11.430
 So she wants him to do everything for her. 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:15.490
 and nothing that makes it good for her 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:19.060
 I think the least why the small 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:25.240
 prince to visit other planets and 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:28.230
 leave his granddaughter alone there and well 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.450
 pink that teaches us a lot too 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.330
 and when it will veto other planets 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.170
 every planet he goes he knows 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.170
 someone different 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:46.989
 he discovers they charge he's a king 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.110
 who lives there 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.390
 the king charges everything and such in the second 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.630
 planet has a vain 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.110
 on the third planet has a drunk and 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:03.160
 so it goes 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:07.870
 he will learn a little more with the 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:10.350
 I liked the people there. 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:15.700
 when he visited the king's grandson 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:17.830
 until I found the wise king and some things 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.769
 have excuse little prince who 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.280
 people can bring it into our lives 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.280
 same 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:30.910
 What I really liked was when 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:33.190
 he came ashore and he found the 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.410
 fox was not only the fox found 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.959
 found other animals also others 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.540
 beings 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:44.510
 but the fox was the part I think all 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:48.140
 world like but from the fox is 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:52.099
 fox and befriends the fox and 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:58.310
 stay active and the cutest part 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:04:01.519
 even from the book and the saint andrÃ© I take 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:06.079
 written for the enrolled child that he 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:08.599
 if you write you do understand but 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:14.569
 You do not stop reading the book though 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:18.109
 thin so you read it in a day but 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:21.320
 it's a book so if you read you will 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:26.510
 understand the story you 're going to take 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:29.479
 teachings for your life that teaches 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.960
 a lot is not a read 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:36.320
 superficial that you ale there illegal 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.690
 Such a story if you stayed away forget it 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.370
 it's not the book it 's a story that you 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:48.289
 it will take for your entire life and you 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:50.960
 take many things to your day to day you 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:55.400
 understands what the people want to 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:58.400
 People are beautiful, this book is fine 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:01.490
 very worth reading 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.820
 if you have not read it's still a classic you 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:09.199
 You do not know what you're missing 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:15.380
 I think I think 19 reais but in 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:18.560
 some places you buy cheaper is 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:24.050
 the illustrations are pretty cute sebben 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:29.740
 kind of perfect solution but that's what 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:32.720
 what gives life to say so by book 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:36.860
 It's very beautiful, we learn a lot from it. 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.990
 the little native prince is with you 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.960
 as before but the writing is 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:46.729
 first person I turn physical to the boy 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:50.270
 very smart and this asks questions and 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:53.210
 the trainer the narrator he discovered 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.689
 the little ones where I did not want to see 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.229

00:05:54.689 --> 00:06:00.029
 came what he knew and such 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:03.149
 We meet little prince. 

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:09.569
 gradually we are enchanted with 

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:14.849
 that little boy who is a dreamer is wise 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:18.289
 and learns from the little prince. 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:21.599

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:26.519
