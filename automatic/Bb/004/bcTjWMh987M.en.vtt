left<00:02:44.900> on<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.140> hi-hat<00:02:45.320> but<00:02:45.740> we're<00:02:46.070> gonna<00:02:46.160> open

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
left on the hi-hat but we're gonna open

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.250 
left on the hi-hat but we're gonna open
that<00:02:46.610> hi-hat<00:02:47.120> so<00:02:47.480> we're<00:02:47.660> then<00:02:47.780> practicing

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
that hi-hat so we're then practicing

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.390 
that hi-hat so we're then practicing
cause<00:02:48.320> you<00:02:48.410> know<00:02:48.500> how<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:48.680> start<00:02:49.010> of<00:02:49.160> the

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
cause you know how the start of the

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.040 
cause you know how the start of the
actual<00:02:49.640> groove<00:02:49.820> goes<00:02:50.060> like<00:02:50.300> both<00:02:50.660> feet<00:02:50.900> at<00:02:50.990> the

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
actual groove goes like both feet at the

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.720 
actual groove goes like both feet at the
same<00:02:51.110> time<00:02:51.410> if<00:02:51.740> we're<00:02:51.920> lifting<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.250> hi-hat<00:02:52.610> on

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
same time if we're lifting the hi-hat on

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.730 
same time if we're lifting the hi-hat on
the<00:02:52.820> before<00:02:53.810> it's<00:02:54.230> then<00:02:54.380> gonna<00:02:54.470> land

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
the before it's then gonna land

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.230 
the before it's then gonna land
perfectly<00:02:55.310> on<00:02:55.400> beat<00:02:55.580> one<00:02:55.760> when<00:02:55.850> we<00:02:55.910> go<00:02:56.060> round

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
perfectly on beat one when we go round

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.960 
perfectly on beat one when we go round
two<00:02:56.390> loop<00:02:56.600> it<00:02:56.750> again<00:02:57.020> so<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:57.890> last<00:02:58.070> four<00:02:58.730> notes

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
two loop it again so the last four notes

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.380 
two loop it again so the last four notes
we<00:02:59.150> can<00:02:59.180> go<00:02:59.360> snare<00:02:59.959> kick<00:03:00.709> right<00:03:04.180> that<00:03:05.180> one

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
we can go snare kick right that one

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.360 
we can go snare kick right that one
alright<00:03:06.170> so<00:03:06.290> this<00:03:06.350> now<00:03:06.560> stick<00:03:06.800> beats<00:03:07.070> three

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
alright so this now stick beats three

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.860 
alright so this now stick beats three
and<00:03:07.489> four<00:03:07.790> together<00:03:07.970> and<00:03:08.510> this<00:03:08.570> actually

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
and four together and this actually

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.090 
and four together and this actually
generates<00:03:09.170> quite<00:03:09.410> a<00:03:09.440> cool<00:03:09.709> little<00:03:09.830> loop

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
generates quite a cool little loop

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.590 
generates quite a cool little loop
itself<00:03:10.459> so<00:03:10.670> I'll<00:03:10.760> just<00:03:10.880> play<00:03:11.090> that<00:03:11.269> on<00:03:11.360> its<00:03:11.480> own

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
itself so I'll just play that on its own

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.990 
itself so I'll just play that on its own
and<00:03:12.340> then<00:03:13.340> we'll<00:03:13.430> see<00:03:13.519> if<00:03:13.580> we<00:03:13.610> can<00:03:13.760> stick<00:03:13.910> the

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
and then we'll see if we can stick the

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:50.440 
and then we'll see if we can stick the
whole<00:03:14.090> thing<00:03:14.269> together<00:03:14.390> so<00:03:14.750> here<00:03:14.989> we<00:03:15.050> go<00:03:49.450> okay

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
whole thing together so here we go okay

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.330 
whole thing together so here we go okay
so<00:03:50.510> now<00:03:50.720> we<00:03:50.780> move<00:03:50.930> on<00:03:51.560> tricky<00:03:51.920> part<00:03:52.130> and<00:03:52.250> that

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
so now we move on tricky part and that

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.130 
so now we move on tricky part and that
is<00:03:52.430> between<00:03:52.519> everything<00:03:53.090> together<00:03:53.450> so<00:03:54.049> what

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
is between everything together so what

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.240 
is between everything together so what
I'll<00:03:54.230> do<00:03:54.380> is<00:03:54.410> we'll<00:03:54.560> go<00:03:54.709> over<00:03:54.890> it<00:03:55.010> one<00:03:55.220> more

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
I'll do is we'll go over it one more

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.370 
I'll do is we'll go over it one more
time<00:03:55.549> just<00:03:55.580> saying<00:03:56.060> as<00:03:56.239> I<00:03:56.450> play<00:03:56.660> it<00:03:56.690> and<00:03:56.900> then

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
time just saying as I play it and then

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.990 
time just saying as I play it and then
I'll<00:03:57.590> play<00:03:57.769> a<00:03:57.799> few<00:03:58.010> different<00:03:58.310> speeds<00:03:58.580> so<00:03:58.940> you

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
I'll play a few different speeds so you

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.039 
I'll play a few different speeds so you
can<00:03:59.120> sort<00:03:59.209> of<00:03:59.330> have<00:03:59.420> a<00:03:59.450> look<00:03:59.570> and<00:03:59.660> see<00:03:59.810> how<00:03:59.930> it's

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
can sort of have a look and see how it's

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:01.720 
can sort of have a look and see how it's
going<00:04:00.170> to<00:04:00.230> sound<00:04:00.410> okay<00:04:01.010> so<00:04:01.070> from<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:01.489> very

going to sound okay so from the very

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.560 
going to sound okay so from the very
beginning<00:04:02.120> we've<00:04:02.239> got<00:04:02.480> feet<00:04:03.019> left<00:04:03.860> right<00:04:04.670> step

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
beginning we've got feet left right step

00:04:05.570 --> 00:06:32.050 
beginning we've got feet left right step
and<00:04:05.750> then<00:04:06.110> we<00:04:06.230> had<00:04:06.410> left

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
which you probably can't use in everyday
