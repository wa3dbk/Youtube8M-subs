00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
to and get to the RAM because on the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.870 
to and get to the RAM because on the
bottom<00:00:18.140> you<00:00:19.140> don't<00:00:19.410> have<00:00:19.619> any<00:00:19.770> plates<00:00:20.609> that

already explained the whole thing and if

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.080 
already explained the whole thing and if

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
you just watch the video you can hear

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.790 
you just watch the video you can hear
you<00:00:36.630> should<00:00:36.690> understand<00:00:37.380> actually

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
you should understand actually

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.049 
you should understand actually
everything<00:00:38.280> even<00:00:38.550> though<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.730> don't<00:00:38.969> speak

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
everything even though you don't speak

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.209 
everything even though you don't speak
German<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.170> first<00:00:40.379> thing<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.800> take<00:00:41.040> out

German so the first thing is take out
the<00:00:41.370> keyboard<00:00:41.579> then<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.600> unscrew<00:00:42.750> this

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
the keyboard then you unscrew this

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.029 
the keyboard then you unscrew this
middle<00:00:44.100> plate<00:00:44.340> here<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.640> take<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:45.210> one<00:00:45.420> out

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
middle plate here and take this one out

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.220 
middle plate here and take this one out
after<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.489> take<00:00:48.120> out<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.570> six<00:00:48.960> screws

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
after that you take out the six screws

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.889 
after that you take out the six screws
on<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.559> bottom<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.070> then<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.760> just<00:00:50.969> take<00:00:51.629> off

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899

on the bottom and then you just take off
this<00:00:52.770> top<00:00:53.719> cover<00:00:56.750> which<00:00:57.750> isn't<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.230> easy

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
this top cover which isn't that easy

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.280 
this top cover which isn't that easy
there<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.520> go<00:01:00.680> each<00:01:01.680> time<00:01:02.100> painting<00:01:02.460> yes<00:01:02.789> and

this video in English because I know

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.310 
this video in English because I know
it's<00:01:33.150> not<00:01:33.270> available<00:01:33.869> actually<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.229> America

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
it's not available actually in America

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.069 
it's not available actually in America
on<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.890> UK<00:01:35.220> yet<00:01:35.520> but<00:01:36.329> what<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.720> find

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
on the UK yet but what I find

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.700 
on the UK yet but what I find
interesting<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.250> medium<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:39.470> using<00:01:40.470> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
interesting is the medium is using the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.090 
interesting is the medium is using the
atom<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.310> 450<00:01:42.270> without<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.869> heat<00:01:43.049> pipe<00:01:43.290> the

it if I take this one out that median

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.319 
it if I take this one out that median
doesn't<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.229> didn't<00:01:52.890> use<00:01:53.070> this<00:01:53.340> time<00:01:55.009> ms<00:01:56.009> e

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329

platform but they use the hand saw
platform<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.219> I<00:02:00.000> just<00:02:00.180> don't<00:02:00.299> understand<00:02:00.840> why

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
platform and I just don't understand why

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.080 
platform and I just don't understand why
they<00:02:01.229> put<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.500> fan<00:02:01.950> here<00:02:02.310> if<00:02:02.490> they<00:02:02.670> don't<00:02:02.790> there

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
they put a fan here if they don't there

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.510 
they put a fan here if they don't there
isn't<00:02:03.390> any<00:02:03.509> heat<00:02:03.719> pipes<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.829> this<00:02:05.100> was<00:02:05.310> the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
isn't any heat pipes so this was the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.839 
isn't any heat pipes so this was the
