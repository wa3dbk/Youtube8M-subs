00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello guys my followers 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.259
 channel in today's video I'd like 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.690
 tell how to make a match wick 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.330
 for this we need matches here 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:17.840
 such matches we feel the sulfur of them 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:22.130
 here I have purified sulfur and then 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:25.470
 grind it to such a state 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.300
 here is the state of dot state 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.570
 jump 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:35.010
 or in a mortar or since i did i 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:38.960
 ground it with a spoon here and then take 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.579
 lure here the thread I took a cotton thread 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.620
 I recommend you take a cotton thread so 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:50.250
 how it totally helps in blending off and 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:52.350
 also we will need unnecessary or already 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.420
 spoiled and that's such a glass or 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:08.820
 a glass we take our gray extracted 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:14.070
 and pour it in Rome here we have gray 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:19.220
 and then add a little water to 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:21.509
 gray we were not very so thick and 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:28.500
 front end I mean now I â€™ll give you everything 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:33.150
 I'll show you the hoof 78 add here 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:37.670
 about one box of sulfur psychos 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:45.500
 Naziri and then we take a match matches 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:45.500
 match and all good times kalacheva them 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:57.490
 You see, I have a thick and now 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.490
 a little more this bath 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:15.890
 Well, that's such a state is still a little bit 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.870
 I will add water and everything will be in general if you 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.220
 took just such a box if the walls 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:26.540
 from her cerato 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:28.430
 somewhere both drank 15 walks and now everything 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.010
 thoroughly blur you 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:35.500
 waves and don't need to add much here and 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:43.030
 since then sulfur is not completely with you 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:52.190
 dissolve here you see I have already 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:58.070
 rarely is such a state and then we take 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:03:03.920
 our thread and now we will wet it in this 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:06.080
 mix and advance preparation or plywood 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.680
 or here is such a piece of paper where you will be 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.290
 and 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.570
 mist layouts I dried and I will 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.480
 dry on the battery and I will use 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:17.050
 Here is such a piece of paper to 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:22.430
 the fuse I got runes 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:25.820
 when she dries the wick dries he for 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.940
 it becomes stone and it will be exactly if you 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.430
 put on the runes and 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.170
 places here is such a wick 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:41.600
 not good for him wet it 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:45.140
 totally wet it 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:49.130
 completely lock and now take and 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.560
 squeeze a little so squeeze this 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:59.450
 our wick 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:04:02.230
 here and then take it you straighten it 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.230
 such a wick 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:11.440
 Here you put on such a 3 piece of paper and 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:18.420
 let it dry dry this 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:21.070
 wick in about an hour or half an hour if 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.230
 depends on his case will plant him 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:27.270
 if you will it on a warm battery 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:29.980
 dry it dry for about half an hour 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.920
 if you just put it there i'm not 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:36.160
 I know Lenin on the table is the length on the bedside table and 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.310
 then he will stew around you 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.990
 two or three hours 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:46.330
 but if in a warm place like this you put 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:51.180
 do not think there half an hour-hour enough leg 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:53.460
 so squeezed and straighten our wick 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.380
