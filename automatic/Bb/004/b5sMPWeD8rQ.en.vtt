00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
with the extra comfort insoles basically

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.880 
with the extra comfort insoles basically
it's<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.899> same<00:00:36.960> as<00:00:37.140> lightweight<00:00:37.469> insole

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
it's the same as lightweight insole

it's the same as lightweight insole
without<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.280> holes<00:00:38.489> has<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.329> little<00:00:39.600> bit<00:00:39.690> extra

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
without the holes has a little bit extra

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.720 
without the holes has a little bit extra
cushion<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.829> has<00:00:40.950> kind<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.340> synthetic

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
cushion and it has kind of a synthetic

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.090 
cushion and it has kind of a synthetic
suede<00:00:42.090> liner<00:00:42.750> which<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.590> lot<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.710> people<00:00:43.770> like

shoes on the market it is only in the
synthetic<00:01:37.110> version<00:01:37.790> so<00:01:38.790> definitely<00:01:39.600> worth

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
synthetic version so definitely worth

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.440 
synthetic version so definitely worth
noting<00:01:40.140> but<00:01:40.560> again<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:41.009> haven't<00:01:41.939> worn<00:01:42.030> both<00:01:42.240> of

the<00:01:43.950> synthetic<00:01:44.130> version<00:01:44.700> over<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.090> leather

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
the synthetic version over the leather

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.300 
the synthetic version over the leather
simply<00:01:46.380> because<00:01:46.590> i<00:01:46.680> feel<00:01:46.829> like<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.040> fits<00:01:47.250> a

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
a pick up a pair of basically a

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.229 
a pick up a pair of basically a
microchip<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.709> track<00:03:29.100> your<00:03:29.250> stats<00:03:29.580> basically

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
microchip to track your stats basically

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
and then you have this kind of a unique

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.880 
and then you have this kind of a unique
triangular<00:03:33.120> sub<00:03:33.360> pattern<00:03:33.720> it's<00:03:34.650> something

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
triangular sub pattern it's something

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.890

we've only really ever seen on the ID 0

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.570 
we've only really ever seen on the ID 0
now<00:03:37.590> you<00:03:37.650> do<00:03:37.860> see<00:03:38.010> it<00:03:38.100> on<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.250> rest<00:03:38.400> of<00:03:38.519> the

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
now you do see it on the rest of the

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.650 
of conical as well as bladed studs so
it's<00:03:43.590> kind<00:03:43.739> of<00:03:43.799> a<00:03:44.010> an<00:03:44.760> attempt<00:03:45.090> at<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.269> best<00:03:45.480> of

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
it's kind of a an attempt at the best of

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.130 
it's kind of a an attempt at the best of
both<00:03:45.810> worlds<00:03:46.230> and<00:03:46.350> it<00:03:46.709> really<00:03:46.830> does<00:03:47.040> work<00:03:47.250> well

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
both worlds and it really does work well

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.350 
both worlds and it really does work well
its<00:03:49.140> turf<00:03:49.380> friendly<00:03:49.799> as<00:03:49.950> well<00:03:50.160> so<00:03:50.880> if<00:03:51.120> you<00:03:51.269> are

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360
