them and then you hold and then they're

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.420 
them and then you hold and then they're
pretty<00:00:44.219> easy<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.640> kill<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:46.250> don't<00:00:47.250> know<00:00:47.340> if

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
pretty easy to kill and I don't know if

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.770 
pretty easy to kill and I don't know if

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
more on this island sometimes it take a

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.799 
more on this island sometimes it take a
couple<00:00:56.370> minutes<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.789> spawn<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.570> there's

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
couple minutes to spawn and there's

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.959 
couple minutes to spawn and there's
there's<00:00:58.109> usually<00:00:58.289> long<00:00:58.859> five<00:00:59.309> or<00:00:59.520> 6i<00:00:59.940> believe

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
there's usually long five or 6i believe

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.470 
there's usually long five or 6i believe
total<00:01:00.870> spawned<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:01.920> at<00:01:02.039> once<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:03.149> just<00:01:03.300> gotta

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
total spawned in at once you just gotta

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:12.499 
total spawned in at once you just gotta
walk<00:01:03.690> around<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.049> find<00:01:04.110> them

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.330 

rawhide<00:01:13.509> and<00:01:13.750> they<00:01:14.200> also<00:01:14.380> drop<00:01:14.799> some<00:01:15.070> foul

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
rawhide and they also drop some foul

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.819 
rawhide and they also drop some foul
hides<00:01:15.640> so<00:01:15.939> that<00:01:16.119> can<00:01:16.270> also<00:01:16.390> be<00:01:16.570> helpful<00:01:16.930> if

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 
hides so that can also be helpful if

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
hard to get so you can probably just

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.760 
hard to get so you can probably just
swim<00:01:37.689> to<00:01:37.869> it<00:01:37.899> because<00:01:38.079> there's<00:01:38.229> a<00:01:38.289> beach<00:01:38.500> over
