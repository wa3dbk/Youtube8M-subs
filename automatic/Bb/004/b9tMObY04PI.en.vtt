few days the guy who did my turn

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.130 
few days the guy who did my turn
piercing<00:02:12.200> said<00:02:12.440> that<00:02:12.710> I<00:02:13.000> could<00:02:14.000> smoke<00:02:14.390> or<00:02:14.810> eat

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
piercing said that I could smoke or eat

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.100

dairy<00:02:16.100> and<00:02:16.700> things<00:02:16.910> like<00:02:17.030> that<00:02:17.180> but<00:02:17.360> I<00:02:17.630> really

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
dairy and things like that but I really

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.900 
dairy and things like that but I really
wouldn't<00:02:18.320> want<00:02:18.500> to<00:02:18.680> I<00:02:18.710> wouldn't<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.340> I<00:02:19.580> wouldn't

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
wouldn't want to I wouldn't I I wouldn't

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.050 
wouldn't want to I wouldn't I I wouldn't
do<00:02:20.030> it<00:02:20.060> but<00:02:20.330> you<00:02:21.170> can<00:02:21.530> but<00:02:22.310> you<00:02:22.430> should<00:02:22.700> you

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
do it but you can but you should you

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.650 
do it but you can but you should you
should

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
should

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.120 
should
so<00:02:24.590> it<00:02:24.740> takes<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.100> couple<00:02:25.310> of<00:02:25.430> weeks<00:02:25.640> to<00:02:25.850> heal

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
so it takes the couple of weeks to heal

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.370 
so it takes the couple of weeks to heal
then<00:02:28.130> I<00:02:28.220> could<00:02:28.370> change<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:28.880> bar<00:02:29.060> I<00:02:29.360> went<00:02:30.230> down

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
then I could change the bar I went down

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.380 
then I could change the bar I went down
in<00:02:30.530> like<00:02:30.650> two<00:02:30.920> millimeters<00:02:31.400> at<00:02:31.520> a<00:02:31.550> time<00:02:31.790> of

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
in like two millimeters at a time of

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.530 
in like two millimeters at a time of
repairing<00:02:32.810> about<00:02:33.080> six<00:02:33.470> months<00:02:33.860> so<00:02:34.790> don't<00:02:35.270> do

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
repairing about six months so don't do

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.060 
repairing about six months so don't do
what<00:02:35.690> I<00:02:35.750> did<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:36.050> don't<00:02:36.290> go<00:02:36.470> crazy<00:02:36.740> and<00:02:36.950> buy

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
what I did and don't go crazy and buy

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.950 
what I did and don't go crazy and buy
loads<00:02:37.250> of<00:02:37.370> bars<00:02:37.580> straight<00:02:37.970> away<00:02:38.150> because<00:02:38.330> your

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
loads of bars straight away because your

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.440 
loads of bars straight away because your
talent<00:02:39.350> will<00:02:39.620> get<00:02:39.770> much<00:02:40.100> smaller<00:02:40.340> from<00:02:41.090> the

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
talent will get much smaller from the

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.180 
talent will get much smaller from the
initial<00:02:41.810> thought<00:02:42.020> he<00:02:42.560> said<00:02:42.710> to<00:02:42.830> me<00:02:42.920> that<00:02:43.010> I<00:02:43.040> had

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
initial thought he said to me that I had

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.010 
initial thought he said to me that I had
a<00:02:43.220> really<00:02:43.430> fat<00:02:43.670> tongue<00:02:43.940> and<00:02:44.630> now<00:02:44.780> I'm<00:02:44.900> wearing

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
a really fat tongue and now I'm wearing

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.660 
a really fat tongue and now I'm wearing
a<00:02:45.170> twelve<00:02:45.410> millimeter<00:02:45.590> bastard<00:02:46.190> and<00:02:46.310> I<00:02:46.370> was

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
a twelve millimeter bastard and I was

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.260 
a twelve millimeter bastard and I was
talking<00:02:46.880> about

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
talking about

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.090 
talking about
he<00:02:47.870> said<00:02:48.050> I'd<00:02:48.140> need<00:02:48.320> like<00:02:48.470> an<00:02:48.590> 18<00:02:48.890> millimeter

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
he said I'd need like an 18 millimeter

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.040 
he said I'd need like an 18 millimeter
all<00:02:49.550> the<00:02:49.640> time<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:49.970> that<00:02:50.060> would<00:02:50.210> be<00:02:50.330> huge<00:02:50.750> like

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
all the time and that would be huge like

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.970 
all the time and that would be huge like
hanging<00:02:51.380> out<00:02:51.500> my<00:02:51.680> mouth<00:02:53.080> and<00:02:54.080> then<00:02:54.620> looking

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
hanging out my mouth and then looking

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.710 
hanging out my mouth and then looking
after<00:02:55.190> it<00:02:55.280> now<00:02:55.430> I<00:02:55.850> don't<00:02:56.360> really<00:02:56.510> do<00:02:56.690> much

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720

after it now I don't really do much
every<00:02:57.080> now<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:57.260> then<00:02:57.320> I<00:02:57.380> changed<00:02:57.770> the<00:02:57.860> bar

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
every now and then I changed the bar

every now and then I changed the bar
give<00:02:58.340> it<00:02:58.460> a<00:02:58.490> clean<00:02:59.230> it<00:03:00.230> never<00:03:00.500> really<00:03:00.740> gives<00:03:00.980> me

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
but I did hit my tooth once with a metal

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.270 
but I did hit my tooth once with a metal
one<00:03:08.180> because<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.570> bar<00:03:08.720> was<00:03:08.750> so<00:03:08.989> long<00:03:09.260> but<00:03:10.130> the

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
one because the bar was so long but the

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.010

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
get the less light you have to bite it

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.570 
get the less light you have to bite it
and<00:03:13.550> I'd<00:03:14.330> advise<00:03:14.750> you<00:03:15.020> as<00:03:16.010> soon<00:03:16.220> as<00:03:16.310> you<00:03:16.400> can

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
and I'd advise you as soon as you can

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.699

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
change it change to an acrylic ball

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.190 
change it change to an acrylic ball
because<00:03:19.100> you<00:03:19.310> are<00:03:20.060> really<00:03:20.480> likely<00:03:20.690> to<00:03:21.020> bite

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
because you are really likely to bite

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.320 
because you are really likely to bite
every<00:03:21.470> first<00:03:21.739> day<00:03:21.800> don't<00:03:22.220> you<00:03:22.459> change<00:03:23.090> though

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
every first day don't you change though

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.970 
every first day don't you change though
you<00:03:23.390> -<00:03:23.780> once<00:03:24.440> you've<00:03:24.590> had<00:03:24.680> your<00:03:24.739> tongue

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
you - once you've had your tongue

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.280 
you - once you've had your tongue
piercing<00:03:25.459> like<00:03:25.630> you<00:03:26.630> keep<00:03:26.810> your<00:03:26.959> tongue<00:03:27.110> in

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
piercing like you keep your tongue in

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.080 
piercing like you keep your tongue in
the<00:03:27.350> middle<00:03:27.590> right<00:03:28.220> before<00:03:28.640> you<00:03:28.730> move<00:03:28.970> it

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
the middle right before you move it

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.550 
the middle right before you move it
round<00:03:29.239> to<00:03:29.480> me<00:03:29.570> the<00:03:29.690> food<00:03:29.900> around<00:03:30.080> your<00:03:30.320> teeth

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
round to me the food around your teeth

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.870 
round to me the food around your teeth
so<00:03:30.830> you<00:03:30.890> can<00:03:31.010> chew<00:03:31.160> it<00:03:31.280> another<00:03:31.520> state<00:03:31.760> of<00:03:31.820> a

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
so you can chew it another state of a

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.540 
so you can chew it another state of a
growth<00:03:32.120> image<00:03:32.600> but<00:03:32.930> that's<00:03:33.920> what<00:03:34.100> you<00:03:34.190> do<00:03:34.370> and

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
growth image but that's what you do and

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.430 
growth image but that's what you do and
is<00:03:34.880> really<00:03:35.120> easy<00:03:35.420> to<00:03:35.630> bite<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:36.020> ball<00:03:36.170> and<00:03:36.410> I

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
is really easy to bite the ball and I
