 h 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.390
 robinson and may 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.079
 but for sure they are 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.899
 yes 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:57.859
 of measurement science 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.859
 is what bale says 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.699
 over 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.650
 well I would summarize it / we are not 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.700
 talking about excellent design and 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.979
 great equipment and low aerodynamics 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.990
 fuel consumption if in addition 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.900
 we talk about roughly 250 kilometers 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.210
 per gallon as a mix we actually have 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.369
 four oceans today we do not start 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.619
 in the chips is that it is a smaller 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.950
 about 2200 from there we went up to the city of 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.619
 1400 the sx4 will be that it is very similar to 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.350
 these dimensions but like 2600 and the 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.000
 maybe we are projecting some 600 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.340
 units for the first year that is like 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.300
 5% of the particular segment will be 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.920
 it's real or not if the car already has it in 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.530
 the entire network with a nationwide center 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.030
 is starting with a price 14 thousand 990 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.190
 as the introductory price for the 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.130
 semi full mechanical version we have 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:55.190
 four full automatic mechanical semi 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.229
 and the full mechanical and automatic friend 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.610
 Every car I invite you to visit our 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.530
 central arch networks nationwide 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.990
 can request a test drive of the new 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.470
 be and convince yourself that it is the car that 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.470
 you need 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.620
 and there's a lot 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.630
 sensitive
