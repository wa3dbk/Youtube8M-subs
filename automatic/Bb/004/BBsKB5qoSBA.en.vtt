00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
screw that mounts the fender so I took

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.140 
screw that mounts the fender so I took
the<00:01:22.080> bar<00:01:22.290> with<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> little<00:01:22.830> flappy<00:01:23.040> thing<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.939> I

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
the bar with a little flappy thing and I

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.620 
the bar with a little flappy thing and I
connected<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.200> very<00:01:25.560> first<00:01:25.920> hole<00:01:26.630> now

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
connected it to the very first hole now

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.219 
connected it to the very first hole now
this<00:01:27.900> bar<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.920> wider<00:01:29.369> than<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:31.079> you'll

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
this bar is wider than this so you'll

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.890 
this bar is wider than this so you'll
have<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.619> bend<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.220> but<00:01:33.150> once<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.540> get<00:01:33.720> that

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
have to bend it in but once you get that

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.050 
have to bend it in but once you get that
screwed<00:01:34.439> on<00:01:34.650> don't<00:01:35.250> over<00:01:35.490> screws<00:01:35.790> because

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
screwed on don't over screws because

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.060 
screwed on don't over screws because
like<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.420> say<00:01:36.659> adjustments<00:01:37.409> will<00:01:37.590> be<00:01:37.710> needed

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
like I say adjustments will be needed

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.390 
like I say adjustments will be needed
you<00:01:38.850> take<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.840> put<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.200> here<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.740> once

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.149 
you take it and you put it here and once
it<00:01:41.579> lines<00:01:41.820> up<00:01:42.290> cuz<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.470> flatten<00:01:43.770> dozens

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
it lines up cuz you in flatten dozens

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.700 
it lines up cuz you in flatten dozens
lines<00:01:44.460> up<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.210> then<00:01:45.450> you're<00:01:45.630> ready<00:01:45.869> for<00:01:46.590> the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
lines up and then you're ready for the

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.190 
lines up and then you're ready for the
next<00:01:46.920> step<00:01:47.220> now<00:01:47.880> what<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.149> gonna<00:01:48.270> do<00:01:48.479> is
