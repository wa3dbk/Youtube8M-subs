 and the one who is not fortunate who does not 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.750
 therefore you require that we will talk about 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:19.510
 lose weight because we are going to prepare a 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.480
 metabolic drink that is a drink 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.029
 metabolic because it is a drink that also 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.220
 to know very well will help you 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.169
 lose kilitos because it has some 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.999
 very important properties in the first 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.700
 place accelerates the metabolism what 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:35.770
 it increases what it means that you burn 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.020
 many more fats and on the other hand 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.690
 It also gives us a feeling of fullness with 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.340
 which logically you eat less we are going to 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.410
 start with the main thing that are the 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.460
 ingredients of our drink almost almost 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.060
 miraculous 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.340
 here we have water approximately two 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:55.000
 liters is a cut apple and is 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:58.480
 half cucumber pieces also cut 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.700
 slices and a bar a cinnamon stick 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.800
 cinnamon stick 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.350
 and now we explain a little bit the 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.420
 why these elements of the water 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.170
 water you already know 2 liters and a half a day 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.060
 it's something that we should all drink 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.280
 basically made of water and we need 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.710
 a lot because we lose a lot throughout 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.420
 of the day, so you have to replace the 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.210
 apple is the queen of fruits has 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.729
 vitamins everywhere vitamin c 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.130
 it is also antioxidant also fight 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.560
 against cholesterol and also helps us 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.810
 to protect against cancer and 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.450
 alzheimer the cucumber also has a 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.580
 very interesting quality and that is a 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.970
 grand jury tico with which makes us a 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.130
 cleaning inside or great and we 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.750
 deflates that is also very important 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.800
 as for cinnamon it also has a 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.200
 very curious feature that the 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.149
 women are very interested in us logically 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.320
 it also speeds up our metabolism like 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.270
 we have said that it is a characteristic 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.610
 common of all these elements but it's 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.399
 that also fats that helps us 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.070
 burn are the fat of the tripita those 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:06.009
 both we hate women or whether 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.069
 let's go heavenly blessing and now 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.290
 let's prepare our almost miraculous 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.150
 metabolic drink and let's start with 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.300
 the elements here we have the water let's 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.230
 to put the pieces of apple in the 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.380
 water 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.750
 to Ivan 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.750
 now the cucumber slices 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.450
 all slices for inside the wand 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.470
 of cinnamon 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:38.200
 here well submerged and now the 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.080
 maceration all these elements have 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.800
 to be more closed in cold water in 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.120
 the refrigerator for at least about three 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.069
 hours 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.349
 well nothing to it we will moderate 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.580
 our miraculous elements and here 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:56.260
 is our dear friend the drink 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.290
 metabolic that will help us lose weight 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.480
 and now I'm going to do something that is to happen 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.930
 this water here and I tell you because in the 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.930
 moment 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.010
 we have already passed the water that was here 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.020
 here 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.330
 This is the jar that we can keep in 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.700
 the fridge for three days and drink your 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.800
 content for only three days of 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.650
 agreement and now we move on to this other rockrose 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.990
 here we have left the remains of the 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.300
 maceration here are all the fruits and 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.730
 vegetables that we have been putting with 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.650
 the water to make the liquid these 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.330
 these these fruits and vegetables can be 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:44.280
 reuse you can reuse them during 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.870
 24 hours three times, so with the 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.730
 same fruits three times you can 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.120
 put with a different water and do more 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.820
 pitchers like this will be treated 24 hours and 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.260
 three times then at 24 hours these 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.390
 fruits and vegetables have to be thrown away 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.490
 because they oxidize logically and remember 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.310
 also a very important thing and that is 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.470
 such that these fruits and vegetables are not 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.600
 to eat can not be made or crushed 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.520
 neither puree nor eat them there is no 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.860
 throw them because 24 hours already we 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.470
 they serve here we have this jug already made 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.390
 this jug with the remains of our 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.060
 work of art and now I am going to tell you a 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.239
 little how to take it 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.430
 you should take I would say that at least three 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.080
 glasses a day before the meal 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.940
 half an hour before lunch one before 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.440
 of breakfast half an hour before and before 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.970
 dinner also the three meals 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.300
 main half hour before you take 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.010
 a glass of our slimming drink 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.780
 you can take more if you are more thirsty and 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.940
 It's also good because, as 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.070
 we have commented is a totally drink 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.810
 natural without calories or carbohydrates and 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.370
 fats and you can take the amount that 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.100
 you want but this is ours 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:49.130
 recommended and we also recommend 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.500
 take it for 10 days and now 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:55.040
 you will notice how you take it that way 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.930
 over 10 days and also you also 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.669
 move a little bit do not be lazy 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.000
 climb stairs instead of taking the 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:03.470
 elevator walk a little bit and controls 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.960
 what you eat is not about passing 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.120
 hungry but control what you eat if 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.680
 you do those simple things already 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.770
 You will see how to lose weight in a way 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.949
 totally natural and very healthy 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:18.849
 then you tell me the result of agreement 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:18.849
