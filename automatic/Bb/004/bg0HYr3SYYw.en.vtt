00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
vehicles this one is actually universal

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.940 
vehicles this one is actually universal
one<00:00:48.090> not<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.360> universal<00:00:48.870> one<00:00:48.930> but<00:00:49.140> it's<00:00:49.289> um<00:00:49.469> it's

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
one not a universal one but it's um it's

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.650 
one not a universal one but it's um it's
pretty<00:00:50.010> standard<00:00:50.340> one<00:00:50.700> using<00:00:51.329> this<00:00:51.420> one<00:00:51.570> on

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
pretty standard one using this one on

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.529 
pretty standard one using this one on
most<00:00:52.110> most<00:00:52.920> vehicles<00:00:53.340> nowadays<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.329> anyway

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
most most vehicles nowadays so anyway

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.479 
most most vehicles nowadays so anyway
what<00:00:54.660> I've<00:00:54.719> done<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:55.020> I've<00:00:55.500> disconnected<00:00:56.039> all

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
what I've done is I've disconnected all

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.090 
what I've done is I've disconnected all
the<00:00:56.730> fuel<00:00:56.940> injector<00:00:57.360> connectors<00:00:57.949> this<00:00:58.949> is

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
the fuel injector connectors this is

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.639 
the fuel injector connectors this is
number<00:00:59.250> one<00:00:59.520> right<00:00:59.699> here<00:01:00.260> it's<00:01:01.260> number<00:01:01.469> two

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
number one right here it's number two

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.369 
number one right here it's number two
it's<00:01:02.430> number<00:01:02.670> three<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.600> number<00:01:03.809> four

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
it's number three this is number four

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.440 
it's number three this is number four
the<00:01:05.250> reason<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.580> did<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:05.909> because<00:01:06.210> they

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the reason I did that is because they

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.240 
the reason I did that is because they
don't<00:01:06.630> want<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.869> engine<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.110> start<00:01:07.409> this

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
don't want the engine to start this

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.679 
don't want the engine to start this
particular<00:01:08.520> engine<00:01:08.970> starts<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.330> runs<00:01:09.450> just

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
particular engine starts and runs just

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:10.520 
particular engine starts and runs just
fine<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.020> we're<00:01:10.140> just<00:01:10.229> doing<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.470> for

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
fine and we're just doing this for

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.710 
fine and we're just doing this for
testing<00:01:10.950> purposes<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.580> can<00:01:11.760> show<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:11.970> you

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
testing purposes so I can show you you

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.090 
testing purposes so I can show you you
get<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.960> lot<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.170> questions<00:01:13.320> on<00:01:13.619> what<00:01:13.860> exactly

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
get a lot of questions on what exactly

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.940 
get a lot of questions on what exactly
injector<00:01:15.000> pulse<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.570> how<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.380> check<00:01:16.590> injector

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
injector pulse is how to check injector

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.300 
injector pulse is how to check injector
pulse<00:01:17.900> so<00:01:18.900> I'm<00:01:18.990> Sean<00:01:19.200> yeah<00:01:19.409> all<00:01:20.040> right<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.250> we

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
pulse so I'm Sean yeah all right so we

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.700 
pulse so I'm Sean yeah all right so we
plugged<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.640> in<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.290> that's<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.350> number<00:01:22.560> one

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
plugged it in and that's the number one

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.679 
plugged it in and that's the number one
fuel<00:01:22.979> injector<00:01:23.280> connector<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.360> you're<00:01:24.570> going

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
fuel injector connector and you're going

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:25.280 
fuel injector connector and you're going
to<00:01:24.750> want<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.900> see<00:01:25.020> that

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
to want to see that

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.310 
to want to see that
noid<00:01:26.100> light<00:01:26.369> blink<00:01:26.790> consistently<00:01:27.540> as<00:01:27.750> the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
noid light blink consistently as the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.289 
noid light blink consistently as the
engines<00:01:28.590> being<00:01:28.770> cranked<00:01:29.130> over<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:30.000> let's<00:01:30.180> go

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
engines being cranked over so let's go

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:41.360 
engines being cranked over so let's go
crank<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.630> over<00:01:33.950> no<00:01:34.950> I'd<00:01:35.070> light

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.310 

and<00:01:42.370> there<00:01:43.030> you<00:01:43.090> have<00:01:43.150> it<00:01:43.300> that's<00:01:43.930> exactly

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
and there you have it that's exactly

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.800 
and there you have it that's exactly
what<00:01:44.440> you<00:01:44.530> want<00:01:44.620> to<00:01:44.740> see<00:01:44.890> it's<00:01:45.070> a<00:01:45.130> good<00:01:45.220> signal

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
what you want to see it's a good signal

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.000 
what you want to see it's a good signal
now<00:01:46.810> you<00:01:46.870> know<00:01:47.080> the<00:01:47.200> computer<00:01:47.590> is<00:01:47.680> sending<00:01:47.920> a

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
now you know the computer is sending a

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.250 
now you know the computer is sending a
signal<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.840> the<00:01:49.990> fuel<00:01:50.200> injector<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.810> pulse

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
signal to the fuel injector to pulse

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.770 
signal to the fuel injector to pulse
fuel<00:01:53.620> into<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.640> engine<00:01:54.760> as<00:01:55.240> you're<00:01:55.510> cranking

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
fuel into the engine as you're cranking

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.900 
fuel into the engine as you're cranking
over<00:01:55.870> so<00:01:56.080> it's<00:01:56.200> a<00:01:56.229> very<00:01:56.380> good<00:01:56.530> test<00:01:56.760> it's<00:01:57.760> very

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
over so it's a very good test it's very

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.460 
over so it's a very good test it's very
fast<00:01:58.180> very<00:01:58.420> simple<00:01:58.780> very<00:01:58.960> efficient<00:01:59.320> with<00:01:59.440> a
