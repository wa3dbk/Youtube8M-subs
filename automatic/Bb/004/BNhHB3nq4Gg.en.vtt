00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.370 
then you would have to figure it out now

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.649 
then you would have to figure it out now
you<00:06:28.490> know<00:06:28.699> you<00:06:28.759> can<00:06:28.939> hover<00:06:29.120> and<00:06:29.360> actually

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:37.099 
might miss a diamond because you don't

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:39.010 
might miss a diamond because you don't
know<00:06:37.249> what<00:06:37.550> the<00:06:37.580> the<00:06:38.029> block<00:06:38.270> looks<00:06:38.569> like<00:06:38.779> Greg

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.020 
know what the the block looks like Greg

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.329 
know what the the block looks like Greg
you<00:06:39.169> know<00:06:39.259> he's<00:06:39.379> often<00:06:39.620> often<00:06:40.039> in<00:06:40.249> these

you know he's often often in these

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:41.499 
you know he's often often in these
texture<00:06:40.699> packs<00:06:40.879> you<00:06:40.999> get<00:06:41.120> mixed<00:06:41.300> up<00:06:41.449> with

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:41.509 
texture packs you get mixed up with

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:43.329 
texture packs you get mixed up with
lapis<00:06:41.749> lazuli<00:06:42.020> in<00:06:42.379> diamond<00:06:42.770> right<00:06:43.039> because

00:06:43.329 --> 00:06:43.339
