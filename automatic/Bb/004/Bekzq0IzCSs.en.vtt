the dark spots on the uneven kind of

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.420 
the dark spots on the uneven kind of
implementation<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.379> have<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.920> we

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
implementation that you have and we

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.889 
implementation that you have and we
sleep<00:00:44.700> boosts<00:00:44.940> your<00:00:45.059> translucency<00:00:45.870> and

provides<00:00:46.620> moisture<00:00:47.219> as<00:00:47.340> well<00:00:47.520> now<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
provides moisture as well now the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.670 
provides moisture as well now the
concept<00:00:48.600> behind<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.289> science

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
concept behind this and the science

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.400 
concept behind this and the science
behind<00:00:49.829> this<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.370> basically<00:00:50.850> when<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:52.140> Sun

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
behind this is basically when the Sun

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.889 
behind this is basically when the Sun
hits<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.520> actually<00:00:53.699> produce<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.629> thing

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
hits you you actually produce this thing

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.930 
hits you you actually produce this thing
called<00:00:55.170> melanin<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.890> melanin<00:00:56.760> is

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
called melanin and melanin is

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.119 
called melanin and melanin is
responsible<00:00:57.539> for<00:00:57.780> basically<00:00:57.930> your<00:00:58.800> skin

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
responsible for basically your skin

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.830 
responsible for basically your skin
color<00:00:59.370> your<00:00:59.820> color<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.239> your<00:01:00.359> hair<00:01:00.390> it

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
color your color of your hair it

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.860 
color your color of your hair it
provides<00:01:01.440> pigment<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.160> your<00:01:02.340> skin<00:01:02.640> and

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
provides pigment to your skin and

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.780 
provides pigment to your skin and
sometimes<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.409> Sun<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.920> causes<00:01:05.100> too<00:01:05.580> much

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
sometimes the Sun that causes too much

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.960 
sometimes the Sun that causes too much
of<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.540> over<00:01:07.380> produces<00:01:07.979> melanin<00:01:08.460> so

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
of that and it over produces melanin so

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.910 
of that and it over produces melanin so
that<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.390> have<00:01:09.600> dark<00:01:09.930> spots<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.470> premature

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
that you have dark spots of premature

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.160 
that you have dark spots of premature
aging<00:01:11.100> which<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.670> what<00:01:11.850> we<00:01:12.000> don't<00:01:12.210> want<00:01:12.600> so

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
aging which is what we don't want so

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.679 
aging which is what we don't want so
what<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.500> serum<00:01:13.920> does<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.180> contains

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
what this serum does is that it contains

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.899 
what this serum does is that it contains
the<00:01:16.170> shisho<00:01:16.619> complex<00:01:17.310> now<00:01:17.549> shoot<00:01:17.759> your

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
the shisho complex now shoot your

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.130 
the shisho complex now shoot your
complex<00:01:18.360> or<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.600> bodyshop<00:01:19.140> has<00:01:19.350> made

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
complex or the bodyshop has made

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.899 
complex or the bodyshop has made
complex<00:01:20.590> and<00:01:20.860> if<00:01:21.280> you<00:01:21.370> don't<00:01:21.520> know<00:01:21.640> what<00:01:21.760> she

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
complex and if you don't know what she

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:23.790 
complex and if you don't know what she
Joe<00:01:22.090> is<00:01:22.270> she<00:01:22.540> shows<00:01:22.690> his<00:01:22.930> Japanese<00:01:23.380> leaf<00:01:23.620> as

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
Joe is she shows his Japanese leaf as

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.920 
Joe is she shows his Japanese leaf as
you<00:01:23.920> can<00:01:24.100> see<00:01:24.280> and<00:01:24.580> it's<00:01:24.700> been<00:01:24.880> used<00:01:25.090> and<00:01:25.330> the

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
you can see and it's been used and the

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.930 
you can see and it's been used and the
traditional<00:01:26.350> Japanese<00:01:26.800> medicine<00:01:27.250> for<00:01:27.490> a<00:01:27.520> very

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
traditional Japanese medicine for a very

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.490 
traditional Japanese medicine for a very
very<00:01:28.030> very<00:01:28.570> long<00:01:28.960> time

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
very very long time

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.530 
very very long time
so<00:01:29.830> the<00:01:29.950> shisha<00:01:30.280> complex<00:01:30.700> actually<00:01:30.970> includes

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
so the shisha complex actually includes

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.260 
so the shisha complex actually includes
the<00:01:31.659> shisha<00:01:32.050> leaf<00:01:32.290> extract<00:01:33.010> the<00:01:33.640> vitamin<00:01:34.060> C

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
the shisha leaf extract the vitamin C

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.300 
the shisha leaf extract the vitamin C
licorice<00:01:34.840> and<00:01:35.080> aloe<00:01:35.260> vera<00:01:35.500> the<00:01:35.830> shisho

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
licorice and aloe vera the shisho

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.150 
licorice and aloe vera the shisho
actually<00:01:37.030> stops<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:38.020> melanocytes<00:01:38.470> which<00:01:39.040> is

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
actually stops the melanocytes which is

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.920 
actually stops the melanocytes which is
the<00:01:39.280> cells<00:01:39.520> responsible<00:01:40.270> for<00:01:40.450> producing

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
the cells responsible for producing

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.440 
the cells responsible for producing
melanin<00:01:41.380> from<00:01:42.040> producing<00:01:42.759> from<00:01:43.060> getting

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
melanin from producing from getting

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.270 
melanin from producing from getting
signals<00:01:43.930> to<00:01:44.110> produce<00:01:44.259> more<00:01:44.560> melanin<00:01:44.920> so<00:01:45.159> it

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
signals to produce more melanin so it

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.719 
signals to produce more melanin so it
stops<00:01:45.580> the<00:01:45.909> kind<00:01:46.570> of<00:01:46.659> warning<00:01:47.470> signals<00:01:47.920> number
