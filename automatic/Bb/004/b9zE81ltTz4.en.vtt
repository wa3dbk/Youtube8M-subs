denny to make homework a reasonable
amount<00:01:06.510> i<00:01:06.840> think<00:01:07.020> homework<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.619> important<00:01:08.220> but

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
amount i think homework is important but

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.410 
amount i think homework is important but
it's<00:01:09.450> also<00:01:09.600> important<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:11.000> it<00:01:12.000> doesn't

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
it's also important that it doesn't

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.660 
it's also important that it doesn't
become<00:01:12.510> too<00:01:12.840> much<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.350> burden<00:01:13.500> on<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.400> child

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
become too much of a burden on the child

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.300 
become too much of a burden on the child
so<00:01:15.259> the<00:01:16.259> reason<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.590> think<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.979> work<00:01:17.189> is

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
so the reason I think I work is

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.050 
so the reason I think I work is
important<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:18.119> because<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.900> helps<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:20.060> develop

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
important is because it helps to develop

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.539 
important is because it helps to develop
those<00:01:21.869> independent<00:01:22.650> study<00:01:22.920> habits<00:01:23.340> in

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
those independent study habits in

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.910 
those independent study habits in
children<00:01:24.030> as<00:01:24.240> they<00:01:25.200> go<00:01:25.350> on<00:01:25.530> through<00:01:25.740> life

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
children as they go on through life

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.660 
children as they go on through life
they're<00:01:26.159> going<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.369> have<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.580> write

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
they're going to have to write

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.460 
they're going to have to write
assignments<00:01:27.479> they're<00:01:27.689> going<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.990> have<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.320> do

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
assignments they're going to have to do

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.039 
assignments they're going to have to do
independent<00:01:29.130> study<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.939> if<00:01:30.240> they<00:01:30.420> associate

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
independent study and if they associate

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.690 
independent study and if they associate
learning<00:01:31.619> only<00:01:32.070> with<00:01:32.250> something<00:01:32.579> that

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
learning only with something that

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.530 
learning only with something that
happens<00:01:33.060> inside<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.290> school<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:35.540> something

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
happens inside the school and something

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.499 
happens inside the school and something
which<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.900> directed<00:01:37.439> by<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.680> teacher<00:01:38.479> then<00:01:39.479> I

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
which is directed by the teacher then I

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.120 
which is directed by the teacher then I
believe<00:01:39.990> they<00:01:40.200> will<00:01:40.350> not<00:01:40.619> develop<00:01:41.310> as

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
believe they will not develop as

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.630 
believe they will not develop as
those<00:01:42.729> lifelong<00:01:43.920> habits<00:01:44.920> of<00:01:45.070> good<00:01:45.369> learning

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
those lifelong habits of good learning

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.420 
those lifelong habits of good learning
that<00:01:46.119> we<00:01:46.450> would<00:01:46.630> like<00:01:46.780> to<00:01:46.960> see<00:01:47.170> them<00:01:47.380> see<00:01:48.250> them

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
that we would like to see them see them

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.080 
that we would like to see them see them
have<00:01:48.670> so<00:01:49.180> so<00:01:49.810> homework<00:01:50.289> therefore<00:01:50.799> is<00:01:51.159> more

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
have so so homework therefore is more

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.410

about<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:53.200> character<00:01:53.829> the<00:01:54.430> research<00:01:54.880> skills

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
about the character the research skills

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.600 
about the character the research skills
being<00:01:55.990> able<00:01:56.140> to<00:01:56.470> think<00:01:56.679> questions<00:01:57.159> through

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
being able to think questions through

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.109 
being able to think questions through
without<00:01:58.240> being<00:01:58.659> in<00:01:58.929> directed<00:01:59.409> activity<00:02:00.119> and

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
without being in directed activity and

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.490 
without being in directed activity and
so<00:02:01.780> is<00:02:02.229> it<00:02:02.789> do<00:02:03.789> you<00:02:03.909> have<00:02:04.210> like<00:02:04.689> guidelines<00:02:04.960> for

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.880 
6 and their middle school in do you do
you<00:02:19.030> think<00:02:19.239> homework<00:02:19.690> is<00:02:19.840> equated<00:02:20.230> with<00:02:20.410> time

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
you think homework is equated with time

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.600 
you think homework is equated with time
or<00:02:21.250> is<00:02:21.400> it<00:02:21.549> more<00:02:21.880> about<00:02:22.239> the<00:02:22.569> kind<00:02:22.810> of<00:02:22.930> activity

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
or is it more about the kind of activity

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.830 
or is it more about the kind of activity
well<00:02:24.610> I<00:02:24.670> think<00:02:24.880> it<00:02:24.970> has<00:02:25.150> to<00:02:25.360> be<00:02:25.450> a<00:02:25.480> little<00:02:25.660> bit

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
well I think it has to be a little bit

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.420 
well I think it has to be a little bit
equated<00:02:26.140> with<00:02:26.260> time<00:02:26.590> because<00:02:26.860> we<00:02:26.980> don't<00:02:27.220> want

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
equated with time because we don't want

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.949 
equated with time because we don't want
to<00:02:27.519> overload<00:02:27.790> children<00:02:28.360> we<00:02:28.450> don't<00:02:28.660> want<00:02:28.870> to

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
to overload children we don't want to

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.030 
to overload children we don't want to
put<00:02:29.140> too<00:02:29.170> much<00:02:29.440> stress<00:02:29.739> on<00:02:29.890> families<00:02:30.720> yet<00:02:32.040> we

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
put too much stress on families yet we

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.199 
put too much stress on families yet we
really<00:02:33.400> believe<00:02:33.640> that<00:02:33.670> her<00:02:33.940> work<00:02:34.090> is

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
really believe that her work is

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.170 
really believe that her work is
important<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:34.989> so<00:02:35.620> in<00:02:35.829> the<00:02:35.950> early<00:02:36.280> years<00:02:36.790> it's

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
important and so in the early years it's

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.830 
important and so in the early years it's
reinforcing<00:02:39.299> things<00:02:40.299> that<00:02:40.450> I<00:02:40.480> learned<00:02:40.660> at

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
reinforcing things that I learned at

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.920 
reinforcing things that I learned at
school<00:02:40.870> specifically<00:02:41.709> reading<00:02:42.130> skills<00:02:42.459> so<00:02:42.930> we

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
school specifically reading skills so we

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.870 
school specifically reading skills so we
do<00:02:44.110> issue<00:02:44.470> guidelines<00:02:44.829> we<00:02:45.340> say<00:02:45.549> for<00:02:45.790> instance

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
do issue guidelines we say for instance

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.259 
do issue guidelines we say for instance
in<00:02:46.810> grade<00:02:47.079> one<00:02:47.670> we<00:02:48.670> don't<00:02:48.790> have<00:02:48.940> any<00:02:49.120> homework

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
in grade one we don't have any homework

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:54.390 
in grade one we don't have any homework
in<00:02:49.569> prep<00:02:49.780> by<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:49.989> way<00:02:50.190> in<00:02:51.190> grade<00:02:51.430> one<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:53.400> girl

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
in prep by the way in grade one the girl

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.240 
in prep by the way in grade one the girl
should<00:02:54.670> do<00:02:54.880> 15<00:02:55.480> minutes<00:02:55.810> maximum<00:02:56.319> a<00:02:56.650> day<00:02:57.010> and

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
should do 15 minutes maximum a day and

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.699 
should do 15 minutes maximum a day and
that<00:02:57.280> should<00:02:57.700> generally<00:02:58.690> be<00:02:58.720> reading<00:02:59.530> and

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
that should generally be reading and

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.500 
that should generally be reading and
reading<00:03:00.069> with<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.489> parent<00:03:01.000> is<00:03:01.180> something

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
reading with the parent is something

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.599 
reading with the parent is something
that<00:03:01.660> our<00:03:01.720> state<00:03:02.620> government<00:03:03.069> is<00:03:03.190> very<00:03:03.220> keen

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:03.609 
that our state government is very keen

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:07.170 
that our state government is very keen
to<00:03:03.639> foster<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:05.290> is<00:03:05.500> a<00:03:05.769> wonderful<00:03:06.489> activity

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
to foster it is a wonderful activity

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.539 
to foster it is a wonderful activity
it's<00:03:07.810> a<00:03:07.989> way<00:03:08.139> of<00:03:08.170> involving<00:03:08.470> apparent<00:03:09.250> in<00:03:09.400> the

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
it's a way of involving apparent in the

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.390 
it's a way of involving apparent in the
child's<00:03:09.910> learning<00:03:10.090> and<00:03:11.130> monitoring<00:03:12.130> our

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
the girls are in grade six we're talking

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:39.210 
the girls are in grade six we're talking
up<00:03:35.470> to<00:03:35.620> 45<00:03:36.100> minutes<00:03:36.370> a<00:03:37.299> night<00:03:37.780> and<00:03:38.220> we're

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
up to 45 minutes a night and we're

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.740 
up to 45 minutes a night and we're
talking<00:03:39.730> about<00:03:40.060> a<00:03:40.750> wide<00:03:41.440> variety<00:03:42.090> of<00:03:43.090> activity

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
talking about a wide variety of activity

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.720 
talking about a wide variety of activity
it's<00:03:43.989> been<00:03:44.349> getting<00:03:44.829> wider<00:03:45.220> go<00:03:45.579> out

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
it's been getting wider go out

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.490 
it's been getting wider go out
four-wheeling<00:03:46.150> so<00:03:46.660> they'll<00:03:46.810> be<00:03:46.959> maths<00:03:47.230> and

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
four-wheeling so they'll be maths and

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.280 
four-wheeling so they'll be maths and
science<00:03:48.099> a<00:03:48.250> little<00:03:48.519> bit<00:03:48.639> of<00:03:48.700> research<00:03:49.290> okay

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
science a little bit of research okay

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.430 
science a little bit of research okay
what<00:03:50.739> would<00:03:50.919> it<00:03:50.949> be<00:03:51.070> like<00:03:51.220> for<00:03:51.669> a<00:03:52.209> 14<00:03:52.930> 15

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
what would it be like for a 14 15

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.340 
what would it be like for a 14 15
year-old<00:03:53.709> and<00:03:54.130> how<00:03:54.549> much<00:03:55.540> does<00:03:55.870> it<00:03:56.019> get<00:03:56.169> to

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
year-old and how much does it get to

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.719 
year-old and how much does it get to
foursie's<00:03:57.160> do<00:03:57.519> a<00:03:57.820> little<00:03:58.180> rainbow<00:03:59.459> well<00:04:00.459> this

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:00.729 
foursie's do a little rainbow well this

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:02.580 
foursie's do a little rainbow well this
is<00:04:00.759> tricky<00:04:01.239> because<00:04:01.269> every<00:04:02.169> child<00:04:02.199> is

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
is tricky because every child is

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.620 
is tricky because every child is
different<00:04:02.620> and<00:04:03.070> every<00:04:03.130> child<00:04:03.549> works<00:04:04.389> at

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
different and every child works at

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.140 
different and every child works at
different<00:04:04.930> speeds<00:04:05.229> every<00:04:05.709> child<00:04:06.030> wants<00:04:07.030> to

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
different speeds every child wants to

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.360 
different speeds every child wants to
put<00:04:07.419> different<00:04:08.410> amounts<00:04:08.739> of<00:04:08.739> effort<00:04:09.220> into

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
put different amounts of effort into

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.189 
put different amounts of effort into
their<00:04:09.579> work<00:04:09.790> so<00:04:10.120> it's<00:04:10.359> really<00:04:10.600> hard<00:04:10.900> to<00:04:11.079> be

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:11.199 
their work so it's really hard to be

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:14.670 
their work so it's really hard to be
prescriptive<00:04:11.669> but<00:04:12.669> we<00:04:13.209> would<00:04:13.359> say<00:04:13.600> that<00:04:13.989> from

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
prescriptive but we would say that from

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.170 
prescriptive but we would say that from
around<00:04:14.949> round<00:04:15.220> seven<00:04:15.930> seven<00:04:16.930> or<00:04:17.019> eight<00:04:17.109> if<00:04:18.180> we

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
around round seven seven or eight if we

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.789 
around round seven seven or eight if we
would<00:04:19.329> say<00:04:19.479> to<00:04:19.540> parents<00:04:19.780> if<00:04:20.079> your<00:04:20.199> daughter<00:04:20.410> is

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
would say to parents if your daughter is

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.550 
would say to parents if your daughter is
doing<00:04:21.609> more<00:04:21.970> than<00:04:22.000> an<00:04:22.300> hour<00:04:22.540> maybe<00:04:23.199> an<00:04:23.440> hour

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560
