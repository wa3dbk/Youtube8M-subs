getting<00:03:35.840> asked<00:03:36.230> is<00:03:36.290> well<00:03:36.440> how<00:03:36.620> is<00:03:36.890> this<00:03:37.129> diesel

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.309 
getting asked is well how is this diesel
engine<00:03:38.060> here<00:03:38.269> and<00:03:38.360> the<00:03:38.420> answer<00:03:38.750> is<00:03:38.930> it's<00:03:39.110> just

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
engine here and the answer is it's just

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.170 
engine here and the answer is it's just
what<00:03:39.470> you'd<00:03:39.620> expect<00:03:39.709> of<00:03:40.099> a<00:03:40.220> modern-day<00:03:40.610> diesel
