00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.089
 Hello everyone, the project is all in the best and 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.770
 Today I will try to explain to you who 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.710
 such a robin van percy that he is 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.139
 represents what kind of player is robin van 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.810
 percy dutch forward him 29 years old 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.650
 plays at number 20 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:20.810
 Manchester for this two years in a row 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.700
 becomes top scorer in English 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.720
 Premier League and 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.580
 considered the best English striker 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.720
 probably the premier league and the best hitters 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.720
 Manchester United 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.300
 Today I will try to tell you why I'm with 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.180
 it does not agree 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.000
 First of all you Persia is such a player 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.210
 who knows how to play clean swords 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.390
 who can't get out of there if his 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.170
 pressure that can not be there 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.930
 to open up 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:57.070
 if you need to play more on the flank 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:01:01.300
 somewhere he can not give high quality 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:04.540
 pass model accompanied the match of the series he 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.770
 peach failed just as I find a bunch 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.610
 piss it in the english example 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.100
 cookies 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.530
 Javier Hernandez and Hernandez came out 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.799
 scored he went to a standstill 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.229
 at the end of the match in the middle of the match there still 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.170
 where he went, and he always scored 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.869
 steadily van persie could not do 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.180
 absolutely nothing against it 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.820
 same hatch 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.200
 then ernandez snatch victory where is he 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.119
 went all out 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.310
 and never understood why van percy 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.570
 always plays at its core not at all 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.560
 dare for me 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.050
 he is not cristiano ronaldo 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.700
 along with why its not 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.590
 but 30 years old and he 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.500
 even when he 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.649
 shows unstable football he's all 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.530
 equals stays on the field 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:54.440
 you Persia do not possess that technique 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.940
 whom 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.680
 earlier in the arsenal 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.210
 he does not have that speed 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.040
 he was once in the arsenal 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.130
 and a 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.690
 but with some technique here I do not know 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.820
 last want to express 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.940
 the giver that must do three 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.270
 qualities easy 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.890
 the floor he just opens it 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.020
 so far away that only plays 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.650
 on clean now i don't understand then on 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.770
 four this one needs such an attacker 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.740
 against real was better on the field absolutely 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.440
 starting geeks 40 years man 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.710
 almost bilan 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.790
 was the best on the field also before the 20 year old 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.709
 to Daniel who just so they 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.980
 break on not ripped madrid 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:45.290
 real year van persie 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.379
 absolutely had a new bunch of losses on 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.329
 at times after 100% and 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:51.350
 when I couldn't hit the ball what 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.050
 but 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.780
 this kind of player who needs to go out 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.850
 to replace how I think dry above against 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.980
 you he should not play in the starting 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.060
 part because such players have not logged in 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.430
 starting lineup 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.739
 there should be a cavern 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.870
 don't leave danny welbeck why were you 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.000
 sold dimitar berbatov who dragged on 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.270
 14 in the attack who gave just 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.100
 perfectly 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.660
 remember how he pulled out a victory against 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.550
 liverpool cakes 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.910
 intellect fine him through himself he 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.940
 put down 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.400
 gotta play a game not 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.930
 yet they are in midfield so he has to 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.560
 play the advent of robin van percy 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.510
 will make 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.909
 over 20 extra million 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.360
 damn a man who is almost thirty years old 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:34.360
 and 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.760
 you can talk to him now 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:43.430
 human qualities are ready 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.959
 he goes over the camp we are direct 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.670
 competitors of the most direct rival 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.620
 arsenal but not fighting for the situation but all 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.370
 same arsenal match if it knows it is very 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:58.099
 confrontation which is considered necessary 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.370
 almost some classic that's the same 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:03.430
 watched by a bunch of fans 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:07.690
 and not van persie goes feb with words 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.400
 that he is glad that he passed the digit 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.800
 shoot 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.050
 dis . 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.320
 he is glad that he left the club that gave 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.330
 he calls on life through 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.010
 few months just call 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.959
 communication itself is the best coach with whom he 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.550
 have worked 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.740
 at the same time with all he practically 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.270
 forget about venger down there papus on 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.099
 him 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:33.250
 I'm at the break but 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:35.770
 he remained grateful to the club he did not 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.139
 I was grateful to the coach 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.910
 just picked up and moved for money 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.910
 yes there may be warm
