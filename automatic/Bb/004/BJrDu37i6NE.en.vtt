00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.060
 hello how about friends again this 

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:06.009
 welcome to this video I want 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.889
 share with you this protein 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.809
 whey as I said in the 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.329
 I started with the nitro right now 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:17.160
 I'm with this one with the ISO 100 very good 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:19.500
 product this nitro difference 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.310
 it no longer brings carbohydrates and zero 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.730
 carbohydrates in your service brings 25 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.400
 grams of protein but great 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.949
 product 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.940
 I recommend it enough since this 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:40.150
 brings this this protein unlike 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.150
 the micro brings the essential amino acids 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:48.480
 and the non-essentials ok in each service 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.480
 of 28 grams 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.280
 brings 25 grams of protein 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.280
 ok as we can see them here 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.370
 in each service the 28 grams brings 25 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:05.030
 grams of protein equal brings sodium and 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:09.950
 very good amino acids calcium 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.720
 brings in the part of glutamine that 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.780
 it also helps you a lot in the gym 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.810
 it helps you a lot in the criminal in the 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.570
 food plan 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.220
 and precursors then it is a product to 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.500
 I love it 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:29.260
 from this product I am consuming it 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.140
 at night the increase is 36 grams 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.050
 here it says that they bring 28 the service but 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.780
 in the volume 36 grams in this new video 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.710
 I leave you again the information 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.860
 in my food plan 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.980
 1500 calories 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.480
 this was taking 40% of 1500 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.720
 calories 40 percent were from 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.540
 protein 40 the other 40% were from 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.170
 carbohydrates and the other 20% fat 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.229
 good fats ok 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.710
 I 'll repeat a gram of carbohydrates 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:07.610
 brings 4 calories 1 gram of protein 4 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.259
 calories and a fat gram of 39 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.080
 calories 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:16.150
 ok then combine the compesca of 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:19.160
 chicken meat red egg so you can 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.710
 can be adjusted 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.260
 to you to your food plan that if not 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.730
 are you in a caloric deficit is it supposed or 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.530
 say those who know that you must 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:33.080
 consume one gram for each pound of weight 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.830
 ok then I'll give you an example if I'm 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.500
 thinking now at 80 kilos 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.260
 I have to convert the pounds and take it 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.440
 in that in proteins ok 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.880
 one gram for every pound of weight but you 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.330
 I repeat again that does not mean that 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:52.560
 Take this product all your whole 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.560
 combined protein 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:00.079
 if it combines the compesca of chicken tuna 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.879
 they have to do all of this product 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.460
 that there is all your protein this is 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:07.280
 I recommend it great 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:11.510
 it helps me a lot of gym better 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:15.740
 results that with the nitro is already 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:18.410
 they are watching keeps me very good 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.840
 good weight is not necessary to do some 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.230
 something else and I continue to combine it with 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.520
 spirulina with and with creatine ok 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.440
 I hope you serve the video 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.090
 I recommend it if it fits your plan 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.290
 food to what you want you 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.689
 I repeat this is not a mass augger 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:41.250
 ok because it has nothing carbohydrate 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:43.140
 zero carbohydrates ok then this one does not 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.810
 it is an enhancer but a very protein 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.750
 good that you can consume up to your 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.700
 accounts be smart in consumption and 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.799
 you will see the results that you are given are 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.989
