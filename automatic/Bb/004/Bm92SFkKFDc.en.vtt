00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
just supported by the little grooves you

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:03.460 
just supported by the little grooves you
see<00:00:54.750> right<00:00:54.930> there

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.630 

remove<00:01:05.180> the<00:01:06.180> electric<00:01:06.689> connector<00:01:07.140> for<00:01:07.500> the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.960 

and<00:01:20.360> then<00:01:22.060> you<00:01:23.060> can<00:01:23.270> see<00:01:23.510> there's<00:01:23.810> one<00:01:24.970> right

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
and then you can see there's one right

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.010 
and then you can see there's one right
here<00:01:26.710> this<00:01:27.710> isn't<00:01:27.890> a<00:01:28.270> manual<00:01:29.270> transmission<00:01:29.870> of

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
here this isn't a manual transmission of

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.450 
here this isn't a manual transmission of
the<00:01:30.170> outlets<00:01:30.590> for<00:01:30.980> the<00:01:32.950> cooler<00:01:33.950> it<00:01:34.220> was

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
the outlets for the cooler it was

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.220 
the outlets for the cooler it was
automatic<00:01:35.300> I<00:01:35.450> believe<00:01:35.750> they<00:01:35.990> probably

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
automatic I believe they probably

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.380 
automatic I believe they probably
