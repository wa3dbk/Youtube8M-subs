00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:09.740
 the translation of the DNA 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.590
 translation is the process through 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.270
 which protein synthesis occurs 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.940
 this process occurs in the cytoplasm of 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:19.610
 the cell for most of the 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.980
 proteins continuously throughout 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.050
 the cell cycle except for the 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.820
 stage m the functions of the cells 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.100
 they will always be involved with the 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.480
 functions of proteins by the 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.550
 expression of genetic information 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.770
 as the proteins that guarantee the 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.309
 estimates that accelerate the reactions of 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.050
 metabolism the location of the 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.629
 production is in the ribosome 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.149
 the success organelles ' plasmatic or 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.510
 membranous integrate the DNA or 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.510
 proteins 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.810
 good the parts where the 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.060
 translation process is being 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.900
 the ribosome that comes is located in 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.900
 this part of here 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.780
 the parts that are going to be decoded for 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.760
 can be the DNA translation comes being 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.560
 the 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.560
 the line that is being the air 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.270
 and the one who is in charge of the queen of 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.770
 transfer is being 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.079
 this part 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.840
 the amino acids that are going to conform 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:27.070
 to be able to create the translation dna 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.070
 they are the following 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.280
 good to be able to explain what's coming 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.660
 being the translation process will 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.400
 to work with what has been the 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.050
 adn messenger that in that in our 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.690
 part of blue line that have the 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.460
 different decoding is out of the 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.320
 core and is directed to what is being 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.740
 the ribosome that has been this part 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.170
 from here 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.820
 to be able to do what is being the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.820
 beginning of the process of translation 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.230
 as second point is what comes 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.660
 making a sub unit that joins the 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.260
 arn messenger that is being this 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.260
 line here 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.650
 towards a coming initiation cord 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.270
 being with initiation comes being a 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.420
 part where it's going to start what's coming 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.520
 being the process of the translation 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.440
 that's why, for example, these could be 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.270
 three these three different from 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.200
 encodings or these three that already 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.200
 they come here marked 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.170
 then follow the third point that comes 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.240
 being the transfer harness that 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.150
 it's this blue part that brings 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.610
 another three coding is that it's a 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.890
 strand 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.550
 is a thread that is going to be placed together 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:48.070
 with the messenger DNA and the ribosome to 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.260
 make the transfer of those of the 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.659
 anti laces 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.840
 to then be taken to what is coming 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:59.409
 being the air in the messenger along with 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.409
 the ribosome 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.990
 the messenger arn along with the rn 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.740
 transfer bring the different 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.740
 amino acids 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.849
 the different amino acids that 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.860
 will work together with the 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:21.430
 Transfer DNA and they will be placed 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.700
 one after one making a sequence 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.680
 linear amino acids 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.270
 this amino acid sequence will be 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.670
 taken and packaged what comes 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.650
 being the golgi apparatus for later 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.500
 to then be taken to the membrane 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.160
 where vital proteins will be created 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.160
 for life 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.270
