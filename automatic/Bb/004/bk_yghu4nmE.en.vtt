00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.969
 so now thai for transverse 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.660
 sawing chain new log as i already 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:17.230
 said this pear and here we have 3 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.230
 millimeters 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.050
 I now went on not finished 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.450
 8 centimeters approximately to 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.510
 the table didn't fall apart now I put our 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.400
 before full-time chain to saw and make a cut 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.660
 parallel on we all this 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.660
 break open and compare 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:43.100
 here the width is about 10 millimeters 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:45.410
 here's the average 7 already cut so 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.600
 he happens faster you drank not 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.150
 cross chain color itself casts 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.430
 left-right very naturally 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.959
 the cut is obtained wider therefore the material 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.630
 have to shoot more and cut 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.459
 turns out slower 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.500
 that's the whole difference in my opinion now 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:04.630
 we will now break up the log and see 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.630
 what was the result in the cut 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.099
 here is hennes transverse aim 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.099
 here you can see what adds and snatches 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:29.069
 where is the material here is veil 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:29.069
 the longitudinal chain here rice is smoother 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:37.299
 now you sawn board 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:41.290
 good cut principle is convenient 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:42.599
 sawing transverse chain visible so that 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.599
 walks heavily 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:50.409
 here the phenomenon of the longitudinal cycle to 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:54.579
 allows but less so 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:57.459
 the difference is the most reliable way to drill 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:59.290
 This sawing at a low angle to 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.680
 cutting happened about along 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.680
 of fibers 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.460
 so it was under its own weight 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.940
 it is clear that they are less likely to risk if 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:03.340
 gone from the beginning they reach the end 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.210
 Here is such a terrible bark beetle 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.050
 under the asu 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:12.960
 so that no one would gobble it up 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.960
 wise contagion still vomits 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.139
 uterus 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.630
 here it is acacia 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.080
 and such big plastic 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.169
 so two and a half hours sawed 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.780
 everything is good you and logs 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:06.660
 try lady acacia a little 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.880
 also sawed very well some 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.800
 plates have a width of more than 400 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.509
 millimeters right here they can be 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.199
 make some new project of them 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:18.000
 I will do a master class in heavy rain in 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:19.770
 As a summary, I can say 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.400
 what's in front of a full-time circuit completely yourself 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.740
 justified 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.750
 there was one moment when it seemed to me that 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.970
 she blunted a little bit I set again 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.009
 chain for cross-cutting and say 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.360
 honestly I almost fell off the hands 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:33.710
 there is a regrinding of the chain 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:36.150
 fully justified in the end means 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:39.000
 because i have to harvest 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.560
 moss material myself i probably 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.389
 here are these expensive good chains 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.710
 pumped for ripping for 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:44.340
 cross will use 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.430
 any 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:49.050
 cheap chinese if you are having 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.870
 any questions please ask 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:54.360
 me them in the discussion to the video either 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.340
 vkontakte which are written in the description to 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.780
 video and on it I say goodbye to you not 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:01.099
 forget to like likes subscribe 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.099
 on the channel all bye
