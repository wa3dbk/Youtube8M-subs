things that separate our practice is

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.490 
things that separate our practice is
that<00:00:34.210> we're<00:00:35.079> very<00:00:35.430> specialized<00:00:36.430> and<00:00:36.700> focused

achieve<00:04:43.850> that<00:04:44.240> tightening<00:04:44.810> we're<00:04:45.020> going<00:04:45.139> to

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
achieve that tightening we're going to

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:48.700 
achieve that tightening we're going to
get<00:04:45.320> a<00:04:45.380> more<00:04:45.620> profound<00:04:45.860> swelling<00:04:47.440> because<00:04:48.440> in

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
get a more profound swelling because in

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.800 
get a more profound swelling because in
that<00:04:48.919> area<00:04:49.280> in<00:04:49.580> those<00:04:49.760> deeper<00:04:50.180> layers<00:04:50.419> of<00:04:50.780> the

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
that area in those deeper layers of the

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.080 
that area in those deeper layers of the
skin<00:04:51.260> we're<00:04:51.979> going<00:04:52.100> to<00:04:52.160> have<00:04:52.310> a<00:04:52.340> much<00:04:52.610> more

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
skin we're going to have a much more

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.620 
skin we're going to have a much more
intense<00:04:53.770> inflammatory<00:04:54.880> response<00:04:55.880> rather

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
intense inflammatory response rather

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.750 
intense inflammatory response rather
than<00:04:56.930> the<00:04:57.350> active<00:04:57.830> effects<00:04:58.190> which<00:04:58.430> is<00:04:58.550> more

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
than the active effects which is more

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.969 
than the active effects which is more
superficial<00:04:59.090> so<00:04:59.810> we<00:04:59.960> do<00:05:00.110> find<00:05:00.440> more<00:05:00.680> swelling

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
superficial so we do find more swelling

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.330 
superficial so we do find more swelling
when<00:05:01.430> we<00:05:01.550> use<00:05:01.729> the<00:05:01.760> deep<00:05:02.090> FX<00:05:02.510> modality<00:05:03.220> we<00:05:04.220> have

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
when we use the deep FX modality we have

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.920 
when we use the deep FX modality we have
a<00:05:04.370> lot<00:05:04.580> of<00:05:04.610> experience<00:05:05.150> with<00:05:05.210> the<00:05:05.389> Aqua<00:05:05.720> cool

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
a lot of experience with the Aqua cool

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.480 
a lot of experience with the Aqua cool
especially<00:05:06.169> with<00:05:06.560> our<00:05:06.590> surgical<00:05:07.130> facelift

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
especially with our surgical facelift

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.909 
especially with our surgical facelift
patients<00:05:08.419> and<00:05:08.599> what<00:05:09.080> we<00:05:09.200> found<00:05:09.530> is

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
patients and what we found is

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.339 
patients and what we found is
immediately<00:05:10.460> they<00:05:11.020> describe<00:05:12.020> a<00:05:12.080> lot<00:05:12.229> of

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:12.349 
immediately they describe a lot of

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:15.060 
immediately they describe a lot of
comfort<00:05:12.830> and<00:05:12.979> it's<00:05:13.910> a<00:05:13.970> very<00:05:14.000> soothing

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
comfort and it's a very soothing

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.100 
comfort and it's a very soothing
treatment<00:05:16.070> that<00:05:16.220> we're<00:05:16.340> able<00:05:16.520> to<00:05:16.700> offer

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
treatment that we're able to offer

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.540 
treatment that we're able to offer
further<00:05:18.110> down<00:05:18.380> the<00:05:18.530> road<00:05:18.710> we<00:05:19.039> noticed<00:05:19.430> that

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
further down the road we noticed that

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.940 
further down the road we noticed that
the<00:05:20.150> time<00:05:20.870> to<00:05:21.139> healing<00:05:21.560> the<00:05:21.680> amount<00:05:21.889> of

the time to healing the amount of

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.650 
the time to healing the amount of
bruising<00:05:22.460> in<00:05:22.550> our<00:05:22.669> surgical<00:05:22.880> patient<00:05:23.539> has

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
bruising in our surgical patient has

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.740 
bruising in our surgical patient has
been<00:05:23.930> significantly<00:05:24.590> reduced<00:05:25.039> after<00:05:25.750> the

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
been significantly reduced after the

been significantly reduced after the

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
fractional resurfacing using the Aqua

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.020 
fractional resurfacing using the Aqua
cool<00:05:29.479> our<00:05:29.990> patient<00:05:30.680> immediately<00:05:30.889> said<00:05:31.610> that

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
cool our patient immediately said that

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.330 
cool our patient immediately said that
the<00:05:32.210> intense<00:05:32.599> feeling<00:05:33.200> of<00:05:33.289> heat<00:05:33.620> and<00:05:33.770> burning

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
the intense feeling of heat and burning

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.330 
the intense feeling of heat and burning
was<00:05:35.000> subsiding<00:05:35.539> as<00:05:36.229> soon<00:05:36.560> as<00:05:36.680> we<00:05:36.770> put<00:05:36.979> the<00:05:37.099> mask

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
was subsiding as soon as we put the mask

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:42.909 
was subsiding as soon as we put the mask
on<00:05:39.099> well<00:05:40.099> we<00:05:40.220> know<00:05:40.400> using<00:05:40.849> a<00:05:40.910> cooling<00:05:41.919> therapy

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 
on well we know using a cooling therapy

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:45.430 
on well we know using a cooling therapy
during<00:05:43.220> a<00:05:43.400> healing<00:05:43.910> process<00:05:44.289> minimizes<00:05:45.289> the

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
during a healing process minimizes the

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.460 
during a healing process minimizes the
inflammatory<00:05:45.950> response<00:05:46.630> so<00:05:47.630> we<00:05:47.870> will<00:05:48.020> expect

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
inflammatory response so we will expect

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.670 
inflammatory response so we will expect
significantly<00:05:49.340> less<00:05:49.610> swelling

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
significantly less swelling

significantly less swelling
significantly<00:05:51.680> less<00:05:51.919> pain<00:05:52.370> and<00:05:52.760> a<00:05:53.539> faster

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
significantly less pain and a faster

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.469 
significantly less pain and a faster
time<00:05:54.229> to<00:05:54.260> healing<00:05:55.120> we've<00:05:56.120> been<00:05:56.210> very<00:05:56.270> happy

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
time to healing we've been very happy

with the Aqua cool device
our<00:05:58.759> patients<00:05:59.599> are<00:05:59.750> quite<00:06:00.050> comfortable<00:06:00.620> it's

Aqua cool in that the comfort and
cooling<00:06:40.520> that<00:06:40.639> it<00:06:40.729> provides<00:06:42.039> I'd<00:06:43.039> recommend

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:43.490 
cooling that it provides I'd recommend

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.700 
cooling that it provides I'd recommend
other<00:06:43.789> doctors<00:06:44.270> take<00:06:44.569> a<00:06:44.750> serious<00:06:45.289> look<00:06:45.379> at<00:06:45.620> the

other doctors take a serious look at the

other doctors take a serious look at the

00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:47.629 
Aqua cool because of the comfort that it

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:49.570 
Aqua cool because of the comfort that it
provides<00:06:48.020> the<00:06:48.259> patient<00:06:48.620> immediately<00:06:48.830> after

either a surgical or laser resurfacing
procedure<00:06:52.729> I<00:06:53.029> think<00:06:54.020> that<00:06:54.229> the<00:06:54.409> amount<00:06:54.710> of

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 
procedure I think that the amount of

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.140 
procedure I think that the amount of
downtime<00:06:55.430> that<00:06:55.789> it<00:06:56.740> decreases<00:06:57.969> during<00:06:58.969> the

00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.150 
downtime that it decreases during the

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.570 
downtime that it decreases during the
healing<00:06:59.300> process<00:06:59.569> is<00:07:00.080> significant<00:07:00.710> and<00:07:00.860> it's

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:01.580 
healing process is significant and it's

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.180
