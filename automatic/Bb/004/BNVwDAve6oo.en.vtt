00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.800 
it was unfiltered air but over there
they<00:02:49.720> decided<00:02:50.049> that<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.590> big<00:02:51.459> pipe<00:02:51.760> along<00:02:52.660> the

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
housing was a bad idea so they added you

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
goes into the air filter housing if you

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.709 
goes into the air filter housing if you

have one that does not if you have a car
that<00:03:30.750> did<00:03:31.079> not<00:03:31.200> have<00:03:31.379> the<00:03:31.409> recall<00:03:31.829> done<00:03:32.129> to<00:03:32.340> it

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
that did not have the recall done to it

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.319 
that did not have the recall done to it
it's<00:03:33.599> gonna<00:03:33.719> have<00:03:33.930> a<00:03:33.959> very<00:03:34.049> jagged<00:03:35.329> angle

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
it's gonna have a very jagged angle

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:40.670 
it's gonna have a very jagged angle
right<00:03:36.689> about<00:03:37.290> here<00:03:37.769> in<00:03:37.920> this<00:03:38.040> area<00:03:38.459> I<00:03:39.319> mean<00:03:40.319> it

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
right about here in this area I mean it

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.830 
right about here in this area I mean it
just<00:03:40.859> almost<00:03:41.069> takes<00:03:41.489> a<00:03:41.640> 90-degree<00:03:42.209> Bend<00:03:42.510> and

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
just almost takes a 90-degree Bend and

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.119 
just almost takes a 90-degree Bend and
then<00:03:43.590> comes<00:03:44.129> over<00:03:44.700> again<00:03:45.530> and<00:03:46.530> that's<00:03:46.829> about

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
then comes over again and that's about

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.610 
then comes over again and that's about
it<00:03:47.340> I<00:03:47.639> think<00:03:48.139> hopefully<00:03:49.139> that<00:03:49.290> will<00:03:49.470> answer

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
it I think hopefully that will answer

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.020 
it I think hopefully that will answer
your<00:03:49.799> question<00:03:50.220> that<00:03:50.250> you<00:03:50.489> keep<00:03:50.849> talking
