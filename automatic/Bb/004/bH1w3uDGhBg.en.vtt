on what happens if your text looks like

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.919 
on what happens if your text looks like
this<00:00:06.270> um<00:00:08.360> it's<00:00:09.360> uh<00:00:11.420> it<00:00:12.420> doesn't<00:00:12.660> look<00:00:12.900> very

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
this um it's uh it doesn't look very

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.900 
this um it's uh it doesn't look very
pretty<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:13.769> in<00:00:14.160> fact<00:00:14.400> in<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.759> original

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
pretty and in fact in the original

pretty and in fact in the original
ocarina<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.540> time<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.960> believe<00:00:16.260> there<00:00:16.440> is<00:00:16.650> a

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
ocarina of time and believe there is a

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.480 
ocarina of time and believe there is a
coding<00:00:18.119> error<00:00:18.240> in<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.380> one<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.369> Guru

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
coding error in the and one of the Guru

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.359 
coding error in the and one of the Guru
toes<00:00:20.789> if<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.420> speak<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.869> them<00:00:22.100> for<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.189> first

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
toes if you speak to them for the first

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.429 
toes if you speak to them for the first
time<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:23.850> what<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.150> looks<00:00:24.990> like<00:00:25.170> well

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
time this is what it looks like well

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.220 
time this is what it looks like well
this<00:00:25.710> particular<00:00:26.359> setup<00:00:27.359> doesn't<00:00:27.660> look<00:00:28.019> like

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
this particular setup doesn't look like

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.019 
this particular setup doesn't look like
that<00:00:28.260> but<00:00:28.680> like<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.099> some<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.640> words<00:00:29.820> go

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
that but like it some of the words go

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.030 
that but like it some of the words go
off<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.359> screen<00:00:30.599> at<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.779> bottom<00:00:30.890> so<00:00:31.890> what

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
off the screen at the bottom so what

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.560 
off the screen at the bottom so what
you're<00:00:32.189> going<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.340> do<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:33.120> have<00:00:33.270> your<00:00:33.420> hex

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
you're going to do is you have your hex

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.720 
you're going to do is you have your hex
editor<00:00:33.930> open<00:00:34.230> here<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:37.010> this<00:00:38.010> obviously<00:00:38.280> this

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
editor open here and this obviously this

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.180 
editor open here and this obviously this
is<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.000> problem<00:00:39.420> right<00:00:40.079> here<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.620> I've

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
is the problem right here and I've

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.459 
is the problem right here and I've
highlighted<00:00:41.520> both<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.149> look<00:00:42.390> for<00:00:42.660> new

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
highlighted both that you look for new

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.209 
highlighted both that you look for new
and<00:00:43.910> right<00:00:44.910> after<00:00:45.030> New<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.989> space<00:00:46.379> well<00:00:47.100> in

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
and right after New is a space well in

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.880 
and right after New is a space well in
the<00:00:47.309> coding<00:00:47.550> there's<00:00:47.879> an<00:00:47.969> 01<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.660> no<00:00:49.590> one<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:51.890> the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
the coding there's an 01 a no one in the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.040 
the coding there's an 01 a no one in the
hex<00:00:53.070> editor<00:00:53.430> means<00:00:53.760> like<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.180> line<00:00:54.480> break<00:00:54.750> kind

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
hex editor means like a line break kind

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.450 
hex editor means like a line break kind
of<00:00:55.110> like<00:00:55.199> pressing<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.649> enter<00:00:55.770> key<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.160> a

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
of like pressing the enter key and a

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.540 
of like pressing the enter key and a
word<00:00:56.670> pad<00:00:56.910> that's<00:00:57.660> what<00:00:57.930> I've<00:00:58.340> figured<00:00:59.340> out<00:00:59.809> so

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
word pad that's what I've figured out so

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:08.210 
word pad that's what I've figured out so
see<00:01:02.809> these<00:01:03.809> spaces<00:01:04.309> these<00:01:05.309> are<00:01:06.650> these<00:01:07.650> are<00:01:07.710> 20s

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
see these spaces these are these are 20s

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:16.609 
see these spaces these are these are 20s
like<00:01:08.610> new<00:01:10.130> actually<00:01:11.130> uh<00:01:13.490> huh<00:01:15.409> why<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.470> that

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
like new actually uh huh why is that

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.870 
like new actually uh huh why is that
okay<00:01:17.369> yeah<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:19.040> any<00:01:20.040> space<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.610> see<00:01:20.640> is

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
okay yeah so any space you see is

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.020 
okay yeah so any space you see is
usually<00:01:21.060> going<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.390> be<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.570> 20<00:01:22.580> so<00:01:23.580> let's<00:01:23.790> uh

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
usually going to be a 20 so let's uh

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.300 
usually going to be a 20 so let's uh
let's<00:01:24.210> edit<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:24.750> out<00:01:24.960> see<00:01:25.500> what<00:01:25.650> see<00:01:26.100> what<00:01:26.250> it

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
let's edit this out see what see what it

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.679 
let's edit this out see what see what it
looks<00:01:26.430> like<00:01:26.549> when<00:01:26.700> we<00:01:26.820> fix<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.979> just<00:01:28.979> want<00:01:29.280> to

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
looks like when we fix it I just want to

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.319 
looks like when we fix it I just want to
do<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:31.250> press<00:01:32.250> space<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.759> know<00:01:32.880> do<00:01:33.150> your

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
do that press space you know do your

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.390 
do that press space you know do your
little<00:01:33.750> 20<00:01:35.750> okay<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:37.229> was<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.380> line<00:01:38.130> break

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
little 20 okay that was a line break

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:46.910 
little 20 okay that was a line break
before<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:39.470> so<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:41.340> then<00:01:42.119> hit<00:01:42.540> save<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:45.920> go

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
before that so and then hit save and go

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.530 
before that so and then hit save and go
to<00:01:46.979> file<00:01:47.579> open<00:01:48.090> rom<00:01:49.759> you<00:01:50.759> can't<00:01:51.000> just<00:01:51.149> reset

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
to file open rom you can't just reset

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.510 
to file open rom you can't just reset
the<00:01:51.659> system<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.290> have<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.619> actually<00:01:55.520> reset

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
the system you have to actually reset

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.370 
the system you have to actually reset
the<00:01:56.640> whole<00:01:56.790> thing<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.299> it's<00:01:57.869> on<00:01:57.990> speed<00:01:58.229> up

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
the whole thing and it's on speed up

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.830 
the whole thing and it's on speed up
because<00:01:58.649> it's<00:01:58.829> just<00:01:59.009> easier<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.850> test<00:02:00.600> things

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
because it's just easier to test things

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.330 
because it's just easier to test things
that<00:02:01.140> way<00:02:01.820> so<00:02:03.140> let's<00:02:04.140> see<00:02:04.350> what<00:02:04.890> our<00:02:04.920> text

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
that way so let's see what our text

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.730 
that way so let's see what our text
looks<00:02:05.549> like<00:02:05.759> see<00:02:06.390> if<00:02:06.570> we<00:02:06.689> got<00:02:06.810> everything

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
looks like see if we got everything

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.499 
looks like see if we got everything
right

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
right

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.089 
right
it's<00:02:09.810> just<00:02:09.989> little<00:02:10.289> things<00:02:10.590> like<00:02:10.769> that<00:02:10.890> that

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
it's just little things like that that

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.280 
it's just little things like that that
can<00:02:11.370> mess<00:02:11.670> things<00:02:11.879> up<00:02:12.180> so<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.659> really<00:02:13.110> have<00:02:13.140> to

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
can mess things up so you really have to

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.780 
can mess things up so you really have to
watch<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:16.099> wasn't<00:02:17.099> that<00:02:17.159> long<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.459> do<00:02:17.579> as<00:02:17.670> you

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
watch it wasn't that long to do as you

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.920 
watch it wasn't that long to do as you
know<00:02:17.909> I<00:02:17.939> don't<00:02:18.150> think<00:02:18.329> any<00:02:18.480> news<00:02:18.629> that<00:02:18.780> there

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
know I don't think any news that there

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.199 
know I don't think any news that there
you<00:02:18.989> go<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.640> now<00:02:20.640> your<00:02:20.849> text<00:02:21.239> is<00:02:21.480> fixed<00:02:22.170> and

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
you go and now your text is fixed and

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.940 
you go and now your text is fixed and
that's<00:02:24.209> that's<00:02:24.659> why<00:02:24.930> if<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.319> have<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.530> weird

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
that's that's why if you have a weird

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.339 
that's that's why if you have a weird
