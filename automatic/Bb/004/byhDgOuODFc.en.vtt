00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.000
 home 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.580
 time of day with you andrey boss today 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.270
 we were a little distant by that 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.480
 consider such a topic as clean 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:30.890
 RAM and speed up 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:35.540
 computer for this next steps 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.540
 open a new text file 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:57.440
 opened a new text file and here 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.440
 We will take the code 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:16.590
 equals space and value we enter 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:28.430
 because the greater the importance for 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:29.770
 more memory clearing now next 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.470
 step 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.080
 save this file on your desktop with 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:46.040
 text work with text extension not 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:50.690
 save as stop but save save 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:02:01.270
 with text extending drying under 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:02:01.270
 Aram hear Cleaner 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:19.400
 there is an extension of bbc and without and without 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:22.519
 so save that we get it 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.970
 close we get this 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.970
 file 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:33.049
 what kind of use are we now just if 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:38.120
 we use many programs which you know 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:41.810
 that is, the speed of the computer we have 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:46.459
 I mean slowing 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:49.200
 constantly spent our 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:56.959
 ram memory that when the knight is just 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:03:01.920
 double click on this file we clear 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:04.620
 our ram well and you can 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.690
 edit the code in a block for example for 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.349
 more memory cleaning 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:14.360
 need to replace the above code 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:22.069
 on the following values ​​ie 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:26.220
 increase about 128 million 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:33.329
 or rather, even 128 thousand years ago 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:39.720
 eight hundred thousand 128 and not from a chair with 8 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:44.220
 a million beaten system so here 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:48.480
 Now do increase 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.970
 the performance of your computer I'm with 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.500
 I say goodbye to all the best to the new 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.500
 meetings yet
