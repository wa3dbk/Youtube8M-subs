00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.790
 that is one in situations that were 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.099
 being generated from very early in favor 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.170
 of the fringed team here we're going to see the 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.360
 first goal the center to the right is 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.769
 of python and very good but not to lower 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.320
 that ball to the middle because I already 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.640
 I had seen there more to post because 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.710
 was more to cote there because olympics 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.180
 I just had a free kick in favor 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.760
 from which he tried to leave 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.580
 carapeguá when python and retrieves this 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.830
 ball to put it inside the area and 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.240
 there in these two touches 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.059
 Olimpia manages to solve the situation 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.600
 to take advantage at 16 minutes 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.329
 of the first stage already at that height of 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.340
 party there was a notorious difference to 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.379
 favor of the fringed team the times that 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.180
 He tried to stretch himself forward 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.489
 carapeguá team showed a lot 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.210
 limitations much will on the part of 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.129
 ayala louse 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.469
 and also from richard lugo some 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.870
 wooden runs but really very 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.640
 little so that it does think for 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.129
 disturbing a defensive sector that is not 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.949
 the headline but that is led by 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.540
 manzur today olimpia captain another 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.330
 python center and this time from the side 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.250
 right with two possible receivers the 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.440
 first it was prone the ball happens 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.540
 slightly above and there is left 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.899
 beaver that puts the head but it is not 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.149
 where the ball hits but that's a 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.520
 detail because finally the ball is 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.590
 propelled towards the arch between the hip 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.380
 to the thigh there is a touch that makes the 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.560
 ball goes towards the goal 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.170
 while the cardoso goalkeeper was trying 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.350
 seek to his right toward which 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.270
 goes away and fails to put an obstacle to 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.009
 this second conquest five minutes 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.289
 after that is at 21 minutes 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.229
 olimpia was winning 2 to 0 after there's 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.929
 a shot to the left post of the lolo to 20 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:50.050
 who did a very good first half until 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.970
 that a tragedy was really injured 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.509
 for him because he was playing the the 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.880
 match of his life let's see where 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:01.020
 hit the ball they gave us a piece of information that 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.020
 it could have been the arm 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.180
 or is the hip and the arm are they 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.710
 good for me hip hip or 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.390
 the left thigh and there sticks the ball 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.010
 the arm was very close there is no need 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.340
 discard any contact with that arm 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.720
 left but anyway the goal is 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.390
 valid it seems to me that there is no 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.010
 irregularity and we said the abente 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.330
 I was playing an extraordinary game 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.830
 recovering a bunch of balls for 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.330
 who knew that by the characteristics 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.010
 of the men who are in the middle 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.650
 olympic court spoke specifically 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.020
 of ortemán and guzmán there are not many 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.240
 ball cysts between them maybe 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.800
 piston and collaborate a little more then 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.780
 the lolo multiplied and really 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.000
 fulfilled an extraordinary task until 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.340
 that in a ball stuck with Emilio 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.440
 Garcete there is a knee twist in 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.200
 this moment is injured was 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.940
 replaced and we will have to see what is the 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.520
 diagnosis that is made surely 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.700
 morning of this situation that deprived him of 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.070
 ball for pérez touches new orteman 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.910
 captain and he goes by right more limits him 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.910
 hit more to cote 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.850
 heart 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:38.170
 how do you get national goals hiding 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:41.770
 the speaker's clothes or here with the body and 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:44.500
 I have a crossed and powerful were me 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:49.600
 definition we the two stoppages day that 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:53.290
 no olimpia 3 for I have 0 arrived 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:56.190
 the really extraordinary and could not 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.190
 miss n 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.890
 6 hit him head 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:16.910
 it is foolish the foal seemed toranzo a 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:19.760
 Esteban Ramírez's center closed 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.410
 run over to gustavo toranzo 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.950
 anticipating the action of the mutiny to 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:28.140
 Carancho in this way discounts for 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.260
 carapeguá a center by esteban ramírez 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:34.710
 the party is 3 to 1 jumping on 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:37.020
 table toranzo applies a header with a 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.070
 ball that goes directly to the body of 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.070
 Hermosilla is passing
