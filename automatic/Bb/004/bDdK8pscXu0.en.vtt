forgot anyway let's jump straight into
it<00:00:07.259> so<00:00:07.649> she<00:00:08.130> pressed<00:00:08.309> her<00:00:08.370> free<00:00:08.610> now<00:00:08.820> you<00:00:09.150> can

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
it so she pressed her free now you can

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.730 
it so she pressed her free now you can
get<00:00:09.480> this<00:00:09.599> finger<00:00:09.870> top<00:00:10.080> right<00:00:10.260> which<00:00:10.530> is<00:00:10.559> I

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
get this finger top right which is I

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.259 
get this finger top right which is I
block<00:00:10.980> of<00:00:11.130> iron<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.490> you<00:00:11.610> get<00:00:11.730> back<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:12.059> gold

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
block of iron and you get back of gold

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.030 
block of iron and you get back of gold
which<00:00:12.420> is<00:00:12.450> I<00:00:12.630> think<00:00:12.660> pretty<00:00:12.990> cool<00:00:13.290> there's

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
which is I think pretty cool there's

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.410 
which is I think pretty cool there's
also<00:00:14.160> one<00:00:14.429> as<00:00:14.610> well<00:00:14.730> where<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:14.969> go<00:00:15.059> grassy

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
also one as well where you go grassy

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.420 
also one as well where you go grassy
block<00:00:15.630> consists<00:00:16.080> noe<00:00:16.260> false<00:00:16.590> I've<00:00:17.130> had<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.310> look

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
block consists noe false I've had a look

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.730 
block consists noe false I've had a look
around<00:00:17.580> on<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.880> live<00:00:18.630> ones<00:00:18.840> doesn't<00:00:19.500> seem<00:00:19.650> to

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
around on the live ones doesn't seem to

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.410 
around on the live ones doesn't seem to
show<00:00:19.890> anything<00:00:20.130> else<00:00:20.340> really<00:00:20.520> just<00:00:21.240> says

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
show anything else really just says

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.420 
show anything else really just says
snowy<00:00:21.990> falls<00:00:22.289> also<00:00:23.010> when<00:00:23.130> you<00:00:23.189> hover<00:00:23.310> over

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
snowy falls also when you hover over

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.300 
snowy falls also when you hover over
redstone<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.990> tells<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.320> what<00:00:25.350> side<00:00:25.769> leads<00:00:26.160> to

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
redstone it tells you what side leads to

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.800 
redstone it tells you what side leads to
another<00:00:26.490> one<00:00:26.730> like<00:00:26.970> for<00:00:27.060> example<00:00:27.119> East<00:00:27.570> which

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
another one like for example East which

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.439 
another one like for example East which
is<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.320> side<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:29.429> says<00:00:29.609> none<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.269> says

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
is this side it says none and it says

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.120 
is this side it says none and it says
how<00:00:30.599> much<00:00:30.720> power<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.140> in<00:00:31.260> each<00:00:31.380> one<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.740> 15

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
how much power is in each one to 15

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.100 
how much power is in each one to 15
because<00:00:32.340> 1x<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:32.940> one<00:00:33.120> these<00:00:33.630> all<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.989> way

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
because 1x that one these all the way

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.319 
because 1x that one these all the way
down<00:00:34.380> until<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:35.040> get<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.370> zero<00:00:35.640> which<00:00:36.120> you're

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
down until you get to zero which you're

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.970 
down until you get to zero which you're
quick<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.570> think<00:00:36.870> it's<00:00:36.960> quite<00:00:37.050> cool<00:00:37.380> if<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.890> go

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
quick I think it's quite cool if you go

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.290 
quick I think it's quite cool if you go
over<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.190> one<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.460> says<00:00:38.579> side<00:00:38.820> obviously<00:00:39.030> on

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
over this one it says side obviously on

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.360 
over this one it says side obviously on
this<00:00:39.450> side<00:00:39.660> or<00:00:40.079> non<00:00:40.530> pop<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.010> that's<00:00:41.129> like<00:00:41.250> you

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
this side or non pop and that's like you

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.799 
this side or non pop and that's like you
know<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.520> get<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.760> idea<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:42.210> think<00:00:42.629> that's

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
know you get the idea I think that's

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.840 
know you get the idea I think that's
pretty<00:00:42.899> cool<00:00:43.160> another<00:00:44.160> thing<00:00:44.280> as<00:00:44.399> well<00:00:44.430> is

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
pretty cool another thing as well is

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.700 
pretty cool another thing as well is
that<00:00:44.969> I'm<00:00:45.329> gonna<00:00:45.690> quickly<00:00:45.989> we<00:00:46.230> make<00:00:46.440> all<00:00:46.620> this

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
that I'm gonna quickly we make all this

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.270 
that I'm gonna quickly we make all this
now<00:00:47.510> my<00:00:48.510> karts<00:00:48.780> have<00:00:48.960> been<00:00:49.110> sought<00:00:49.379> as<00:00:49.649> have

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
now my karts have been sought as have

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.880 
now my karts have been sought as have
been<00:00:50.430> changed<00:00:50.910> my<00:00:51.750> car<00:00:51.989> physics<00:00:52.410> even<00:00:52.559> and

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
been changed my car physics even and

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.340 
been changed my car physics even and
made<00:00:53.219> furnace<00:00:53.610> my<00:00:53.789> car<00:00:54.000> actually<00:00:54.210> useful<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:55.320> I

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
made furnace my car actually useful so I

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.990 
made furnace my car actually useful so I
need<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.620> get<00:00:55.739> another<00:00:55.860> one<00:00:56.280> if<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.730> bear<00:00:56.969> with

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
need to get another one if you bear with

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.459 
need to get another one if you bear with
me<00:00:57.739> minecart<00:00:58.739> furnace<00:00:59.460> here<00:00:59.640> we<00:00:59.760> go<00:01:00.469> now

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
me minecart furnace here we go now

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.779 
me minecart furnace here we go now
that's<00:01:01.620> Harper<00:01:01.980> great<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.460> i'm<00:01:02.520> off<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.760> a

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
that's Harper great that i'm off to a

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.329 
that's Harper great that i'm off to a
roll<00:01:03.030> but<00:01:03.989> i<00:01:04.260> think<00:01:04.470> if<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:05.070> train<00:01:05.250> is

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
roll but i think if the the train is

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.770 
roll but i think if the the train is
pretty<00:01:05.519> good<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.850> be<00:01:05.939> honest<00:01:06.210> there's<00:01:06.720> a

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
pretty good to be honest there's a

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.510 
pretty good to be honest there's a
certain<00:01:06.960> speed<00:01:07.470> limit<00:01:07.770> all<00:01:07.890> go<00:01:08.040> out<00:01:08.189> now<00:01:08.369> it

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
certain speed limit all go out now it

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.760 
certain speed limit all go out now it
won't<00:01:08.850> actually<00:01:09.570> like<00:01:09.990> go<00:01:10.020> any<00:01:10.320> faster<00:01:10.740> than

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
won't actually like go any faster than

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.100 
won't actually like go any faster than
that<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.340> thought<00:01:11.790> then<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.299> get<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> new<00:01:12.750> one<00:01:12.930> to

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
that I thought then I get a new one to

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.899 
that I thought then I get a new one to
show<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.470> like<00:01:13.590> Oh<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.830> basic<00:01:14.520> minecart

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
show you it like Oh a basic minecart

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.910 
show you it like Oh a basic minecart
will<00:01:15.000> just<00:01:15.150> go<00:01:15.240> around<00:01:15.360> risen<00:01:16.020> risen<00:01:16.229> go

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
will just go around risen risen go

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.980 
will just go around risen risen go
really<00:01:17.100> fast<00:01:17.369> wasn't<00:01:17.759> blown<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.090> whereas<00:01:18.689> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
really fast wasn't blown it whereas the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.749 
really fast wasn't blown it whereas the
minecart<00:01:19.439> their<00:01:19.770> furnace<00:01:20.159> Michael<00:01:20.490> seem<00:01:20.670> to

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
minecart their furnace Michael seem to

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.070 
minecart their furnace Michael seem to
have<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.909> certain<00:01:21.180> speed<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.780> can<00:01:21.960> see<00:01:22.049> that

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
have a certain speed so you can see that

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.929 
have a certain speed so you can see that
one<00:01:22.290> goes<00:01:22.500> off<00:01:22.710> if<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.369> goes<00:01:23.460> past<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.790> certain

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
one goes off if it goes past a certain

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.280 
one goes off if it goes past a certain
speed<00:01:24.299> it'll<00:01:24.479> kind<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.750> like<00:01:24.840> fly<00:01:25.080> off

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
speed it'll kind of like fly off

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.020 
speed it'll kind of like fly off

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
same speed going up here as well it

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.679 
same speed going up here as well it
won't<00:01:43.500> go<00:01:43.619> any<00:01:43.649> faster<00:01:44.250> likessee<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.509> I'll
