okay<00:00:06.010> this<00:00:06.220> is<00:00:06.779> comparison<00:00:07.779> between<00:00:08.100> 4,300<00:00:09.120> K

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.120 
okay this is comparison between 4,300 K

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:16.109 
okay this is comparison between 4,300 K
and<00:00:10.710> 6000k<00:00:11.710> HIDs<00:00:12.340> they're<00:00:13.059> both<00:00:13.269> 35<00:00:13.750> watt<00:00:15.119> okay

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:16.119 
and 6000k HIDs they're both 35 watt okay

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:22.260 
and 6000k HIDs they're both 35 watt okay
the<00:00:16.330> difference<00:00:16.540> on<00:00:16.990> the<00:00:17.320> right<00:00:17.560> is<00:00:18.420> 4300<00:00:19.420> k<00:00:21.270> 35

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.270 
the difference on the right is 4300 k 35

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.830 
the difference on the right is 4300 k 35
watts<00:00:22.830> on<00:00:23.830> the<00:00:23.949> left<00:00:24.190> is<00:00:24.400> a<00:00:24.460> 6000<00:00:25.330> you<00:00:25.390> can<00:00:25.570> see

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
watts on the left is a 6000 you can see

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.400 
watts on the left is a 6000 you can see
that<00:00:26.080> on<00:00:26.260> the<00:00:27.010> left<00:00:27.220> is<00:00:27.430> a<00:00:27.609> lot<00:00:28.000> bluer<00:00:28.810> than<00:00:29.350> the

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
that on the left is a lot bluer than the

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.800 
that on the left is a lot bluer than the
right<00:00:29.820> there's<00:00:30.820> a<00:00:30.939> lot<00:00:31.119> more<00:00:31.330> light<00:00:31.539> on<00:00:31.660> the

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
right there's a lot more light on the

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.219 
right there's a lot more light on the
right<00:00:32.670> one<00:00:33.670> again<00:00:33.910> in<00:00:34.030> front<00:00:34.390> of<00:00:34.600> the<00:00:34.989> car

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:35.229 
right one again in front of the car

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:37.950 
right one again in front of the car
again<00:00:35.890> you<00:00:36.010> can<00:00:36.159> see<00:00:36.280> on<00:00:36.339> the<00:00:36.400> left<00:00:36.809> it's<00:00:37.809> just

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
again you can see on the left it's just

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.899 
again you can see on the left it's just
white<00:00:38.440> and<00:00:38.680> on<00:00:38.739> the<00:00:39.150> right<00:00:40.150> it's<00:00:40.449> just<00:00:40.920> blue

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:44.909 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:50.490 

okay<00:00:45.909> this<00:00:46.150> is<00:00:46.360> a<00:00:46.650> shot<00:00:47.650> of<00:00:47.680> a<00:00:48.040> 4300<00:00:48.970> k<00:00:49.500> from

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
okay this is a shot of a 4300 k from

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.570 
okay this is a shot of a 4300 k from
outside<00:00:51.600> ball<00:00:52.600> from<00:00:52.809> inside<00:00:53.280> how<00:00:54.280> they<00:00:54.339> look

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
outside ball from inside how they look

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.990 
outside ball from inside how they look
outside<00:00:54.940> and<00:00:55.180> if<00:00:55.299> I<00:00:55.420> step<00:00:55.659> out<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:57.610> can<00:00:57.790> see

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
outside and if I step out you can see

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.410 
outside and if I step out you can see
that<00:00:58.210> well<00:00:58.629> there<00:01:00.000> it's<00:01:01.000> kind<00:01:01.180> of<00:01:01.210> hard<00:01:01.360> to

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
that well there it's kind of hard to

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.740 
that well there it's kind of hard to
tell<00:01:01.720> from<00:01:02.019> the<00:01:02.309> camera<00:01:03.309> but<00:01:03.489> they're<00:01:03.750> they're

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
tell from the camera but they're they're

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.719 
tell from the camera but they're they're
really<00:01:05.080> bright<00:01:05.290> and<00:01:05.590> I<00:01:05.710> don't<00:01:05.890> have<00:01:06.070> xenon<00:01:06.490> so

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
really bright and I don't have xenon so

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.460 
really bright and I don't have xenon so
they<00:01:06.850> don't<00:01:07.090> get<00:01:07.299> projected<00:01:08.340> evenly

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.000 

but<00:01:11.860> they're<00:01:12.070> still<00:01:12.310> very<00:01:12.930> there<00:01:13.980> they're<00:01:14.980> not

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
but they're still very there they're not

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.030 
but they're still very there they're not
they're<00:01:15.520> legal<00:01:15.940> but<00:01:16.720> they're<00:01:17.170> there's<00:01:17.770> a<00:01:17.830> lot

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
they're legal but they're there's a lot

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.220 
they're legal but they're there's a lot
of<00:01:18.190> light<00:01:18.490> and<00:01:18.820> because<00:01:19.540> there's<00:01:19.750> a<00:01:19.810> lot<00:01:20.020> less

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.230 
of light and because there's a lot less

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.580 
of light and because there's a lot less
color<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.610> you<00:01:21.700> see<00:01:22.030> really<00:01:22.300> well<00:01:22.630> if<00:01:22.900> I<00:01:23.440> go

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
color so you see really well if I go

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.840 
color so you see really well if I go
high<00:01:23.770> beam<00:01:24.010> there's<00:01:24.280> like<00:01:24.460> barely<00:01:24.670> any

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
high beam there's like barely any

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.490 
high beam there's like barely any
difference<00:01:25.360> high<00:01:25.990> beam<00:01:26.320> off<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.780> then<00:01:29.380> the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
difference high beam off and then the

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.860 
difference high beam off and then the
camera<00:01:29.830> looks<00:01:30.070> a<00:01:30.190> bit<00:01:30.450> bluer<00:01:31.450> than<00:01:31.720> it

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
camera looks a bit bluer than it

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.850 
camera looks a bit bluer than it
actually<00:01:32.110> is<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:33.460> real<00:01:33.670> life<00:01:34.500> all<00:01:35.500> right<00:01:35.560> this

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
actually is in real life all right this

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.970 
actually is in real life all right this
is<00:01:35.980> a<00:01:36.010> shot<00:01:36.370> of<00:01:36.550> the<00:01:36.760> 6000k<00:01:37.660> in<00:01:38.050> my<00:01:38.380> van<00:01:38.650> which

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 
is a shot of the 6000k in my van which

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.800 
is a shot of the 6000k in my van which
is<00:01:39.100> actually<00:01:39.400> much<00:01:39.460> easier<00:01:39.520> no<00:01:40.240> because<00:01:40.630> it's

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
is actually much easier no because it's

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.060 
is actually much easier no because it's
not<00:01:40.900> a<00:01:41.200> stick<00:01:41.410> shift<00:01:42.720> yeah<00:01:43.720> die<00:01:44.230> this<00:01:44.770> is<00:01:44.800> how

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
not a stick shift yeah die this is how

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.820 
not a stick shift yeah die this is how
it<00:01:45.190> looks<00:01:45.460> at<00:01:45.760> night<00:01:46.210> it's<00:01:46.510> blue<00:01:47.700> very<00:01:48.700> blue

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
it looks at night it's blue very blue

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.440 
it looks at night it's blue very blue
when<00:01:50.830> I<00:01:50.860> turn<00:01:52.020> up<00:01:53.020> you<00:01:53.230> get<00:01:53.350> a<00:01:53.410> better<00:01:54.330> see<00:01:55.330> of

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
when I turn up you get a better see of

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.530 
when I turn up you get a better see of
things<00:01:55.750> it's<00:01:56.350> um<00:01:56.860> it's<00:01:57.550> nice<00:01:57.880> to<00:01:58.120> look<00:01:58.270> at<00:01:58.479> but

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
things it's um it's nice to look at but

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.900 
things it's um it's nice to look at but
it's<00:01:58.900> it's<00:01:59.590> really<00:01:59.680> it's<00:01:59.979> just<00:02:00.100> really<00:02:00.400> blue
