flush<00:00:25.019> toilets<00:00:25.470> now<00:00:25.849> wall<00:00:26.849> mount<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.330> the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
flush toilets now wall mount and the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.870 
flush toilets now wall mount and the
bolts<00:00:28.619> matched<00:00:28.890> up<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.369> we<00:00:29.460> didn't<00:00:29.609> have<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.789> do

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
bolts matched up so we didn't have to do

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.550 
bolts matched up so we didn't have to do
nothing<00:00:30.119> with<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.330> carriers<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:31.199> we<00:00:31.320> went<00:00:31.529> to

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
nothing with the carriers so we went to

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.810 
nothing with the carriers so we went to
leave<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:32.120> how<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.149> was<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:34.430> all<00:00:35.430> we<00:00:35.610> had<00:00:35.700> to

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
leave it how it was so all we had to

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.680 
leave it how it was so all we had to
adjust<00:00:36.090> was<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.750> depth<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:38.059> these<00:00:39.059> bolts<00:00:39.510> here

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
adjust was the depth of these bolts here

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.410 
adjust was the depth of these bolts here
and<00:00:40.460> how<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.489> figure<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:41.820> out<00:00:42.149> as<00:00:42.300> you

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
and how you figure that out as you

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.150 
and how you figure that out as you
measure<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:43.079> it's<00:00:43.680> about<00:00:43.829> inch<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
measure this it's about inch in the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.040 
measure this it's about inch in the
corner<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.670> then<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.690> measure<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.989> bolt

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
corner and then you measure the bolt

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.630 
corner and then you measure the bolt
which<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.170> about<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.350> half<00:00:49.590> inch<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.370> want

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
which is about a half inch so you want

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.049 
which is about a half inch so you want
to<00:00:50.700> be<00:00:50.789> sticking<00:00:51.030> out<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:52.340> half<00:00:53.340> inch<00:00:53.579> once<00:00:53.850> the

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
to be sticking out a half inch once the

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.790 
to be sticking out a half inch once the
bolt<00:00:54.270> comes<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:54.840> porcelain<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.500> want<00:00:55.710> to

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
bolt comes to this porcelain you want to

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.270 
bolt comes to this porcelain you want to
be<00:00:55.860> staking<00:00:56.070> out<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> half<00:00:56.489> inch<00:00:57.350> now<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.980> adjust

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
be staking out a half inch now to adjust

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.880 
be staking out a half inch now to adjust
those<00:00:59.520> there's<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.300> big<00:01:00.480> nut<00:01:00.719> back<00:01:01.289> inside<00:01:01.649> as

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
those there's a big nut back inside as

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.070 
those there's a big nut back inside as
you<00:01:01.980> can<00:01:02.100> see<00:01:02.219> right<00:01:02.430> there<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.960> tightens<00:01:03.960> it

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
you can see right there that tightens it

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.810 
you can see right there that tightens it
to<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.290> carrier<00:01:04.710> there's<00:01:05.189> actually<00:01:05.519> double

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
to the carrier there's actually double

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.399 
to the carrier there's actually double
nut<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.150> gotta<00:01:06.270> loosen<00:01:06.420> one<00:01:06.689> up<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.080> then

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
nut so you gotta loosen one up and then

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.350 
nut so you gotta loosen one up and then
there's<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.890> other<00:01:08.010> one<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.400> can<00:01:08.580> adjust

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
it and you could tighten back on and

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.600 
it and you could tighten back on and
I've<00:01:12.810> already<00:01:12.990> just<00:01:13.830> stood<00:01:13.979> them<00:01:14.070> two<00:01:14.280> inch

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
I've already just stood them two inch

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.580 
I've already just stood them two inch

when<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.799> slide<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.430> toilet<00:01:17.759> on<00:01:18.290> they'll<00:01:19.290> be

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
when I slide the toilet on they'll be

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.109 
when I slide the toilet on they'll be
sticking<00:01:19.710> out<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.860> half<00:01:20.100> inch<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.580> just<00:01:20.880> enough

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
sticking out a half inch and just enough

for that not to fit on there and

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.679 
for that not to fit on there and
tightening<00:01:24.720> tight<00:01:25.729> and<00:01:26.729> then<00:01:26.880> we<00:01:27.509> have<00:01:27.659> a

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.210 
gasket then seals against this cast-iron
horn<00:01:43.340> so<00:01:44.340> we'll<00:01:45.619> stick<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:46.829> there<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.100> see

horn so we'll stick it on there and see
how<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.399> goes

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.999 

then<00:01:50.909> when<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.060> push<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.390> on<00:01:51.680> you<00:01:52.680> want<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.950> put

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.170 
way I don't have to hold it no more and
the<00:02:09.330> leverage<00:02:09.800> pushes<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.950> bottom

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
the leverage pushes the bottom

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.979 
the leverage pushes the bottom
tighter<00:02:12.959> against<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.439> wall<00:02:13.620> also<00:02:14.430> these<00:02:14.989> you

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
tighter against the wall also these you

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.059 
tighter against the wall also these you
want<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.230> put<00:02:16.349> this<00:02:16.470> rubber<00:02:16.650> or<00:02:17.040> plastic

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
want to put this rubber or plastic

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.630 
want to put this rubber or plastic
gasket<00:02:18.000> in<00:02:18.329> between<00:02:18.829> the<00:02:19.829> porcelain<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.579> the

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
gasket in between the porcelain and the

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.509 
gasket in between the porcelain and the
brass<00:02:21.060> not<00:02:21.989> because<00:02:22.590> if<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.159> just<00:02:23.310> put<00:02:23.459> the

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
breast now it may crack the porcelain

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:46.250 
breast now it may crack the porcelain
and<00:02:28.650> damage<00:02:29.099> it<00:02:29.750> get<00:02:30.750> her<00:02:30.840> nice<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.200> snug<00:02:45.260> you

and damage it get her nice and snug you

00:02:46.260 --> 00:03:04.720 
and damage it get her nice and snug you
can<00:02:46.530> supply<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:59.959> your<00:03:00.959> toilet<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.409> rocker

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:11.800 

they're<00:03:05.630> still<00:03:07.330> not<00:03:08.440> rocket<00:03:09.440> science
