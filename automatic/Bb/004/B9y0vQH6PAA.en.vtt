00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.690 
it's really really not hard and once
you've<00:02:47.170> done<00:02:47.200> it<00:02:47.380> once<00:02:47.500> or<00:02:47.740> twice<00:02:47.800> you'll

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
you've done it once or twice you'll

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.020 
you've done it once or twice you'll
remember<00:02:49.030> it<00:02:49.300> forever<00:02:50.850> essentially<00:02:51.850> though

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
remember it forever essentially though

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.130 
remember it forever essentially though
it's<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:54.700> stab<00:02:54.940> this<00:02:55.120> into<00:02:55.510> your<00:02:55.630> material

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
it's you stab this into your material

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.949 
it's you stab this into your material
you<00:02:56.890> can<00:02:57.070> pull<00:02:57.940> out<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.240> does<00:02:58.420> required

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
you can pull out the does required

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.440 
you can pull out the does required
length<00:02:59.230> to<00:02:59.530> do<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.800> stitch<00:03:00.070> and<00:03:01.000> you<00:03:01.120> pull<00:03:01.330> it

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
length to do the stitch and you pull it

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.350 
length to do the stitch and you pull it
back<00:03:02.250> then<00:03:03.250> poke<00:03:03.550> it<00:03:03.700> through<00:03:03.730> another<00:03:04.150> hole

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
back then poke it through another hole

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.740 
back then poke it through another hole
and<00:03:04.720> then<00:03:04.900> thread<00:03:04.930> that<00:03:05.260> through

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
and then thread that through

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.230 
and then thread that through
yeah<00:03:07.750> but<00:03:08.170> I<00:03:08.200> there's<00:03:08.680> a<00:03:08.740> lot<00:03:08.770> better

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
yeah but I there's a lot better

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.560 
yeah but I there's a lot better
explanation<00:03:10.240> of<00:03:10.390> that<00:03:10.600> on<00:03:10.959> another<00:03:11.260> video

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
explanation of that on another video

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.590 
explanation of that on another video
this<00:03:13.570> design<00:03:14.020> I<00:03:14.350> believe<00:03:14.910> what<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:16.240> company

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
this design I believe what the company

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.750 
this design I believe what the company
has<00:03:16.690> been<00:03:16.840> producing<00:03:17.380> ly<00:03:17.560> since<00:03:17.830> 1908

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
has been producing ly since 1908

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.660 
has been producing ly since 1908
I<00:03:19.030> don't<00:03:19.900> looking<00:03:20.320> at<00:03:20.500> this<00:03:20.650> design<00:03:20.830> I<00:03:21.340> don't

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
I don't looking at this design I don't

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.220 
I don't looking at this design I don't
think<00:03:21.940> it's<00:03:22.120> probably<00:03:22.390> changed<00:03:22.870> much<00:03:23.019> over

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
think it's probably changed much over

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.270 
think it's probably changed much over
the<00:03:23.380> years<00:03:25.110> but<00:03:26.110> it<00:03:26.260> probably<00:03:26.560> hasn't<00:03:26.860> needed

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
the years but it probably hasn't needed

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.180 
the years but it probably hasn't needed
to<00:03:27.459> because<00:03:28.090> it<00:03:28.750> just<00:03:29.200> works<00:03:29.410> and<00:03:29.769> does<00:03:29.920> what

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
to because it just works and does what

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.030 
to because it just works and does what
it<00:03:30.340> needs<00:03:30.370> to<00:03:30.880> do<00:03:31.320> and<00:03:32.320> does<00:03:32.590> a<00:03:32.620> very<00:03:32.709> good<00:03:32.980> job

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
it needs to do and does a very good job

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.120 
it needs to do and does a very good job
of<00:03:33.190> it<00:03:33.370> so<00:03:33.580> yeah<00:03:34.120> that's<00:03:34.330> the<00:03:34.570> Stuart's<00:03:35.200> speedy

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
of it so yeah that's the Stuart's speedy

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.300 
of it so yeah that's the Stuart's speedy
stitcher<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:37.890> items<00:03:38.890> worth<00:03:39.070> about<00:03:39.600> $30

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
stitcher the items worth about $30

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.280 
stitcher the items worth about $30
Australian<00:03:42.310> I'm<00:03:42.850> not<00:03:43.239> sure<00:03:43.510> if<00:03:43.870> you<00:03:44.019> can<00:03:44.140> get

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
Australian I'm not sure if you can get

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.900 
Australian I'm not sure if you can get
it<00:03:44.410> much<00:03:44.560> cheaper<00:03:45.010> over<00:03:45.220> there<00:03:45.370> I<00:03:45.400> think<00:03:45.700> it

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
it much cheaper over there I think it

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.560 
it much cheaper over there I think it
was<00:03:46.090> about<00:03:46.209> $30<00:03:46.989> US<00:03:47.350> as<00:03:47.590> well<00:03:47.800> I<00:03:48.390> might<00:03:49.390> be

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
was about $30 US as well I might be

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.680 
was about $30 US as well I might be
wrong<00:03:49.780> on<00:03:49.959> that<00:03:50.040> don't<00:03:51.040> ever<00:03:51.280> look<00:03:51.690> prices
