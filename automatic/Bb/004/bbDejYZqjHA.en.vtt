00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.029
 good afternoon dear friends live 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.260
 Larisa clip of what today I want 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.429
 to acquaint you with the walking foot and in 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.370
 134 Aurora firms 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:18.410
 presser courtesy of the store 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.330
 sewing equipment and accessories this club 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.609
 got its name foot for 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.130
 returnable forward 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.740
 up and down movements 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.679
 resembling steps to be precise 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.320
 the upper movement is not made by the foot itself 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.860
 a toothed foot comb made of durable 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.809
 the plastic combs sink down into that 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.629
 the moment when it is necessary to advance 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.090
 the material is the result of the layers of fabric 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.190
 clamped between lower rack 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.100
 conveyor and notched 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.160
 foot combs it contributes 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.739
 the best way to advance your material layers 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.870
 material they shift don't stretch 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:03.090
 and do not sit foot attached to 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.159
 the rod with a screw and cotton 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.229
 the holder 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.720
 the walking foot forks must be worn 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.760
 on the needle holder screw so as in the child 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.479
 make movements in strict dependence 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.250
 from needle movement 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.670
 walking foot due to additional 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.070
 clamping and double advancement facilitates 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.250
 working with various kinds of complex 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.159
 materials such as velvet 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.619
 Satin leather material with film 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.140
 coated material with a nap with a smooth 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.170
 slippery or sticky 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.170
 surface 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.720
 for clarity, I suggest to look 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.850
 result 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.520
 used walking legs for 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.520
 we grind details from is named 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:03.210
 material advancement is easy and 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.210
 at ease without shifting and landing 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.709
 and now in order to feel 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.300
 difference we download the same fur with 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.300
 using the usual foot 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.510
 as a result, the layers shifted 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:32.750
 material and landing the bottom layer on 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.260
 plot length of 18 centimeters lower 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.530
 layer on a whole centimeter 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.060
 as we see the difference is obvious when 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.440
 joining fur parts with 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.390
 walking legs there was no landing 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.910
 steps still love very good to use 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.040
 for quilting cloths there that she 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:56.390
 helps to easily cope with any 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.310
 thick walking foot well 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.000
 use take away i will meet them 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.910
 materials for example need to hem edge 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:12.590
 we bend the edge of the material laid under 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:15.079
 foot and perform the line as we see 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.530
 credit they absolutely did not stretch out 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:21.079
 perfectly preserved its shape and if 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.299
 we used the universal foot then 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.129
 the edge of the part would become wavy 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.650
 get rid of that would have to 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:28.819
 here's his help 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.829
 walking foot is very simple in 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.290
 use in mastering any 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:35.720
 difficulties when working with it does not arise 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.450
 but it makes it very easy 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.510
 working with complex materials so i 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.510
 I can safely recommend her for 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.510
 of use 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:51.380
 walking foot at 134 is very similar to 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:53.810
 foot upper conveyor and at 118 and if 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.419
 honestly, i didn't understand why manufacturers 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.760
 created two almost identical legs 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:01.010
 and why they called them differently one 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.970
 upper conveyor and another walking 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.560
 the paw of these paws is the same structure 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.260
 the same working principle is different 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.599
 they unless material from which 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.069
 a toothed comb wide 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:16.479
 very trays and width 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:19.650
 the needle hole at the walking legs and at 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:22.229
 134 holes for one family 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.750
 Herbs and the rest of these legs 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:27.810
 almost the same and can 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:31.259
 used for sewing the same 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.720
 materials for work at home you can have 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:35.370
 one of these paws and this is quite 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.800
 enough 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.430
 but I hope that you like this 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.760
 foot 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.630
 and I say goodbye to you until the next lesson 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.630
 good luck
