00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 and once with the one of the once 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.750
 the homeland of home once you are 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.820
 of course that can happen, though 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.150
 that the ob times every now and then 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.150
 it continues 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.010
 Hello 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.580
 Well and then the sample guilty correctly 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.800
 how should it be then what will work 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.120
 when it gets serious 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.820
 Welcome to the big tip 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.930
 roll fall spectacle as stupid as 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.860
 the title of this show is also the 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.830
 broadcast yourself 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.809
 it is certainly an interesting idea 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.000
 trigger gigantic chain reaction 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.410
 We know that from nature beats 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.390
 somewhere sweet in the world 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.670
 Butterfly with the reins can do this 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.210
 Shortly afterwards somewhere else unpleasant 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.210
 have follow 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.079
 so far at least the theory is pure 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.229
 theoretically, it would be possible 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.450
 been that big flap knock 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.549
 Spectacle actually works though 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.540
 that was just theory instead 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.220
 the spectator experiences one 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.530
 juxtaposition of glitches 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.240
 which can be entertaining at first 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.500
 but sometime in the bumbling 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.420
 drifting then should actually the 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.430
 chain of rules respectively 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.789
 umbrellas go but already 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.080
 the first big question has this bullet 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:32.050
 neatly triggered here 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.550
 or is she still in the corridor otherwise? 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.460
 we would have the first time the clock 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:39.720
 stop them and now it goes 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.460
 first umbrella on google starts 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.420
 the last school you are from the year 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.189
 2000 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.409
 6 and we all know what happens in 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:49.409
 semi-final of the show 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.710
 Routes and just over 50 seconds 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:58.440
 it does not stay like our chain 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.690
 So now we're off 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.520
 Overall, a single ball only has to 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.130
 the chain will arrive at the bottom 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.320
 but there is also a lot of tension in it 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.910
 the us stopped yes and very funny 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.600
 It's better to go here after a fire 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.120
 searched 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.480
 small white ball of skin against the 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.480
 golf club 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.010
 it is not the cared for 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.770
 I'll probably do that 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.510
 the project had been made then 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.350
 gets cold again and is not 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.720
 continued to run 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.250
 luckily, less than a minute 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.950
 Expired therefore will be here now 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.910
 brought and the lime sandstone children 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.440
 continues 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.120
 but as good as the beginning 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.460
 I once wanted to remember 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.970
 Have a total of 5000 bottles here 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:44.220
 installed and stand up slightly at an angle 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.560
 woods including crayons on small 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.090
 round wood otherwise the would 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.070
 not fallen by itself at all 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.660
 and every little gap that exists or 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.920
 maybe to help through the wind 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.570
 through the rain if any 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.010
 irregularities have come 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.290
 Of course, they do it completely 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.440
 confused the list no 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.760
 disturbing factors again the clock goes up 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.350
 zero 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.360
 and then it goes straight into the hall 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.070
 hope there 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.750
 Everything stayed so constant during the construction 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.560
 must be rehearsed before was such a 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.390
 a bit scared 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.130
 It even comes in thought and bled the 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.340
 to let beer bottle out to them against 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.850
 limestone but replaced 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:28.070
 instead worked perfectly the 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.750
 Just a beer bottles on the risk 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.090
 in that moment you see them all 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.950
 not necessarily paid yourself 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.670
 Has 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:41.599
 my full who sold a bit 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.650
 maybe we would care so far 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.819
 Of course you have to in times of 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.590
 Economic crisis also here 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:45.980
 TV productions a bit on 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.810
 budget 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.489
 we are a bit out of the count 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.600
 come through as constant but like 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:55.990
 a lot of that still as a transition 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.360
 the mountain watch to men over 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:01.180
 the curious much now here soon 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.580
 estrogen meets testosterone because the 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.470
 games for this chain to be equal 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.140
 let the men's world die for 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.180
 cheerleaders of goldfire house need the 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.640
 We have a lot of boys with us 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.700
 they learn to work out of chains 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.080
 still come to work 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.760
 while counted how many times I would have been here 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.680
 outside with the beer bottles must stand 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.800
 the whole is best for yourself 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.050
 want to keep closed at all 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.949
 but of course it works in the 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.759
 broadcast does not work and that's why 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.539
 here the clock again 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:34.389
 required 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:36.800
 but these are two different things 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:38.150
 can happen when the 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.639
 temperature is remembered when the 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.430
 Humidity changes its role 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:45.200
 plays the kind changes gaal where stop his 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.390
 plays the role 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.460
 These should actually be against 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.800
 single chambers to happiness like that 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.440
 a back door installed because of the 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.510
 but still turns further and behind 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.890
 the part has to be a bit longer 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.280
 so here against the 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:04.110
 Tires against is there but has not 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.120
 enough to pass on the impulse 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.620
 that the mature we roll the red 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.160
 need us a little 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:15.280
 booking start just improvise times 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.680
 with a plastic tube actually 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.490
 here the chain 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.490
 Our animals 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.550
 free so 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.880
 the human component is here 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:30.580
 actually can not be beat and 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.229
 Overweight then familiar 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.490
 actually the friends goes down 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:36.639
 of course, the students want theirs 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:39.160
 excessive parties not observed 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:40.690
 are often negative then the 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.410
 citizens will affect before 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.410
 means 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:49.229
 There just has to be more in there 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.660
 that has very very often 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:53.250
 test works when a trial in the 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.229
 supposedly everything is so much better 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.990
 then works but finished at the next 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:06:00.510
 just the sample we have to 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.450
 make here has expanded 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.740
 not done anymore now against 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.310
 the black Peter j 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.310
 go then
