00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
people have actually been staying out

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.570 
people have actually been staying out
the<00:00:28.680> mountains<00:00:29.130> going<00:00:29.369> rock<00:00:29.550> climbing

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
the mountains going rock climbing

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.410 
the mountains going rock climbing
lowdown<00:00:30.420> drinking<00:00:31.349> plenty<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.679> coffee<00:00:31.890> and

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:32.420

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
send out the mountains which is quite

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.560 
send out the mountains which is quite
ironic<00:00:35.640> given<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:36.000> we've<00:00:36.120> waited<00:00:36.450> all

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
ironic given that we've waited all

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.200 
ironic given that we've waited all
winter<00:00:36.690> for<00:00:36.930> some<00:00:37.320> Sun<00:00:37.800> but<00:00:38.280> as<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.879> can<00:00:39.000> see

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
winter for some Sun but as you can see

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.119 
winter for some Sun but as you can see
around<00:00:39.300> me<00:00:39.570> we're<00:00:39.780> here<00:00:39.930> at<00:00:40.079> guy<00:00:40.260> on<00:00:40.469> it's

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
around me we're here at guy on it's

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.650 
around me we're here at guy on it's
actually<00:00:41.460> too<00:00:41.640> hot<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.000> rock<00:00:42.180> climb<00:00:42.360> we've

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
actually too hot to rock climb we've

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.200 
actually too hot to rock climb we've
done<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> couple<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.140> routes<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.920> just<00:00:44.760> sweated

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
done a couple of routes and just sweated

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.299 
done a couple of routes and just sweated
often<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.350> think<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.590> might<00:00:46.710> be<00:00:46.739> coffee<00:00:47.039> time

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
often so I think it might be coffee time

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.450 
often so I think it might be coffee time
for<00:00:47.520> us<00:00:47.640> as<00:00:47.760> well<00:00:48.110> the<00:00:49.110> bad<00:00:49.770> weather<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.340> coming

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
for us as well the bad weather is coming

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.520 
for us as well the bad weather is coming
back<00:00:50.879> probably<00:00:51.449> on<00:00:51.539> Friday<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.199> looks<00:00:52.379> like

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
back probably on Friday it looks like

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.840 
back probably on Friday it looks like
it's<00:00:52.680> actually<00:00:52.920> going<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.129> snow<00:00:53.309> quite<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.610> lot

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850

to<00:00:54.120> quite<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.899> low<00:00:55.320> altitude<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.699> could<00:00:56.910> be

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
to quite a low altitude so it could be

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.119 
to quite a low altitude so it could be
ski<00:00:57.270> season<00:00:57.600> again<00:00:57.809> pretty<00:00:58.020> soon<00:00:58.109> we<00:00:58.920> just
