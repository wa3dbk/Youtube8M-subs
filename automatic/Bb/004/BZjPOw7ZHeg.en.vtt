 good afternoon dear channel subscribers 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.810

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.759
 here are girls 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:14.420
 flash drive from the company liv you ask it 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.820
 same flash drive that can not be especially 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:20.100
 really ordinary flash drive true 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:23.310
 We got inserted a flash drive for 16 gigs 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.430
 computer everything is great yusbi 20 and so 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.970
 further but it is actually not easy 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.679
 flash drive and worth it turns out the details and 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.210
 just and actually flip and we 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.879
 see that this flash drive is nothing more than 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.340
 smartphone accessory accessories this 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.730
 same flash drive for any 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.879
 android-smartphone support 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:51.300
 supporting 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:53.910
 o t r so again say on nexus 5 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.710
 there is no such way on 0 4 is also not 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.600
 This well, you can actually run 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.850
 anything and i'm not really 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.199
 I am sure that in nexus 5 it is not there then everything is there 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.110
 really confused with this 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.360
 but I can connect the flash drive 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.350
 show you how but first let's talk 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:14.159
 flash card cage of conventional capacitance 16 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.290
 in my since 16 gigabytes 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.950
 finishing 60 four 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.000
 actually very pleasant to the touch and 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:27.010
 The only thing I did not like very much 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.620
 it is too tight this one but on 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.690
 covered up if i just put plain 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.120
 cute flash drive can be on the keys 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.280
 hang and so on but most importantly not 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.770
 then and most importantly we must 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.420
 see how to connect it to ours 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.020
 niksu 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.740
 Here I have one nexus and now we 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.650
 try 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:55.890
 and in fact everything is done simply and 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:55.890
 so we push we insert micro yusbi 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:03.110
 we have glass from determines press ok and 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:06.530
 let's go now I will tell more in detail 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.509
 In general, how can I insert a USB flash drive into nexus 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.210
 5 to make it work but it concerns 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.160
 only we do not know again how in the fourth 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.750
 I personally did not have it therefore 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.020
 I will not speak on this subject and 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.440

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.900

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.209

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.130
