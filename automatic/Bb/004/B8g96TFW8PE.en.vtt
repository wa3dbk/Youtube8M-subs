00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.310
 ever 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:16.160
 the bunny are very welcome 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.890
 you love to the very very latest 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.160
 pb changes resp 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.529
 You'll get to know her at ptv 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.210
 will soon meet the liveserver 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:31.490
 and indeed we have two reworks both 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.980
 I feel so well within 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.950
 the change but I wonder 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.370
 again and again at such reworks why 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.320
 red and that was renger the 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.620
 has been known for some time and now has 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.750
 we also grass grakas a champion 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.450
 The often played is a lot of fun 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.160
 makes absolutely with his hurt what 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.260
 is changed with his as always 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.980
 has drunk nicely and that has fit 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:01.520
 to carry this fat fat almost in 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.590
 peace so in the end yes I understand 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.570
 not quite why did I do that 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.250
 read me in forums even from riad 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.400
 co-workers who wrote yes 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.109
 we do not change the champions 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.450
 is about the winrace is going around 

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:17.119
 the parade is about us being one 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.899
 champion fulfills his role of being 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.939
 child fits that he also with the kit 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.969
 history reasonably connects so 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.520
 in all honesty I must say that a grass 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:32.210
 thick barrel with wine wears and then 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.579
 runs that fits for me 200 percent 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.259
 however, the scaling is changed 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.729
 go away a bit people you see 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.990
 pretty much a change 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.799
 I hope you can do it all 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.170
 read through 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.659
 I'll go through it a bit 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:49.609
 So in the case of grassers, that is ultimately 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:53.240
 crucial that his crew a 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:55.850
 a little less range and a bit 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.469
 less damage is given that is 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.780
 this barrel what so really the 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.670
 so that was the main castle with that 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.560
 a bit withdrawn too from the 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.630
 range in general I think that to 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.690
 very good example 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:11.270
 oslo is back on top and decisive 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.300
 where is that w where where very easy 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.950
 has drunk where he can get back cream 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.299
 So he does not have something like that anymore 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.610
 since no longer the samana 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.290
 get back 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.060
 getting the passive back with life 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.560
 he has even when a capacity 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.930
 but it hurts what we have there 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.030
 reviews damage so the damage is only 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.890
 another 30, three seconds 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.260
 reduced instead of 20 what he right 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.490
 was brutal 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.660
 otherwise we just have it now 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:43.870
 this ability causes an authority 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.780
 boost quasi so the next car tech 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.810
 makes a lot of damage as well 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.290
 actually we have better with plus 0 3 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.570
 escalate from plus to level 5 12 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.730
 percent of the maximum lives so 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.709
 pretty blatant burst though if it is 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.040
 an authoritarian will not do it all 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:06.030
 be more than possible but the whole 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.400
 will then run on a single target 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.350
 then we have a strong one 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.010
 the abbreviated cool down is clear because of it 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:18.760
 yes also an active attack balls too 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.310
 say otherwise we have on the e 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.290
 the body slam that remains however 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.110
 he does not scale with ade 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.450
 and it's not anymore that the opponents 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.239
 are the lot but they are for a 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.190
 Seconds admitted when grass meets 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.920
 actually okay I think 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.840
 overall the changes okay too 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.130
 the ultra will scale a bit 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.459
 and a bit better down 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.040
 took 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.510
 changes okay but people completely in the 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.920
 serious why so many thoughts 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.140
 make a champion of the 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.360
 the fun works 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.640
 makes and where would have occurred to anyone 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.680
 that you have to change the kit yes and 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.690
 that's exactly how we have singers there 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.010
 times any thought that a change 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.420
 comes and actually you would have 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.080
 yes it can be said there was enough 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.209
 a bit annoying surf fun considerably 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.070
 Now fits in well Venga is off 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.630
 and to play renger is a lot of fun 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.000
 but I have the new race already 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.220
 played if you do not know us 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.230
 works again or respectively 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.670
 you do not not pay at the numbers here 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.989
 one hundred percent can make a picture 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.380
 then definitely look in mine 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:23.470
 playlist entwines and normans I have 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.690
 him in there live from pb and yes how 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.610
 It looks like his crew will stay 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.039
 course know the main 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.080
 But you will not 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:34.469
 improved kyu so that without for city 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.189
 completely taken out of the everyday speed 

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:38.379
 It's a pity 

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:41.139
 that was fun always so always the 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:43.449
 annoying opponents that you can not 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.780
 only a lot of damage out skin but has 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:48.759
 still such a direct one view 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.099
 Get it everyday with boost and thereby 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:52.479
 Of course it is also better to trade 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:55.330
 just not so a few 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:57.639
 tokio still has it 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.319
 we still have that 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.800
 bellowed always with damage always 

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:04.090
 still with life to be regenerated 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.590
 Overall, the skills remain very high 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.750
 similar to the biggest change 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.610
 actually at his wallach 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.900
 strike it was always so you could 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.889
 click on the opponent and he has the 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.990
 thrown directly on it 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:18.400
 it was not a skills schott now it is 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:21.099
 a much wider range even stood 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:24.789
 a little bit longer if it is 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:26.020
 whole ending is so i have it myself 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:27.849
 I played him in the jungle 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.129
 played and I have that feeling he 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:31.990
 Works quite well on the internet 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:33.699
 Fall cow as the main of the match 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.199
 By the way, I would only have that too 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:37.210
 smell money because everyone else 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:41.650
 skills can not be lower 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:43.150
 cooldown get more and the q has one 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.099
 can be a bit shorter and more accommodating 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.680
 it is better to clear camps and through this 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:50.110
 you can even have a nice range 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:53.500
 So think a little bit better 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.909
 very interesting and at the multi first 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.849
 sometimes it gets invisible 

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:59.620
 little speed boost 7 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:01.419
 invisible for a very long time 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.060
 long and then another five seconds 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:06.610
 renker is faster for a long time and only then 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.949
 builds this for city so every one 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.199
 second a frosty so he maximum 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:12.639
 have five can read the whole in 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:16.240
 Rest by I am now for the 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:18.339
 single envelope passed by singer 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.839
 guest this is the change thank you 

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:22.360
 People to look at I am yours 

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:24.699
 Password page live with me from the baby 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.210
 the latest until next time 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:27.210
 people look
