from Shane and he asks i accidentally
refrigerated<00:00:36.340> my<00:00:36.460> retina<00:00:36.850> gel<00:00:37.120> I<00:00:37.330> realized<00:00:38.080> it

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
refrigerated my retina gel I realized it

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.020 
refrigerated my retina gel I realized it
was<00:00:38.380> colder<00:00:38.950> than<00:00:38.980> the<00:00:39.460> storage<00:00:39.790> temperature

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
was colder than the storage temperature

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.299 
was colder than the storage temperature
recommended<00:00:40.870> by<00:00:40.989> the<00:00:41.050> manufacturer<00:00:41.620> so<00:00:42.250> I'm

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
recommended by the manufacturer so I'm

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.400 
recommended by the manufacturer so I'm
concerned<00:00:42.760> has<00:00:43.030> the<00:00:43.210> product<00:00:43.570> been<00:00:43.960> weakened

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
concerned has the product been weakened

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.890 
concerned has the product been weakened
by<00:00:44.440> any<00:00:44.739> means<00:00:45.040> the<00:00:45.580> texture<00:00:46.030> and<00:00:46.150> color<00:00:46.360> still

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
by any means the texture and color still

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.630 
by any means the texture and color still
looked<00:00:47.080> the<00:00:47.170> same<00:00:47.260> shame<00:00:48.190> that's<00:00:48.400> a<00:00:48.460> very

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
looked the same shame that's a very

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.920 
looked the same shame that's a very
important<00:00:49.090> observation<00:00:49.690> that<00:00:49.720> the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
important observation that the

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.689 
important observation that the
temperature<00:00:50.230> and<00:00:50.530> texture<00:00:51.190> look<00:00:51.340> the<00:00:51.489> same

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
temperature and texture look the same

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:53.580 
temperature and texture look the same
because<00:00:52.330> that<00:00:52.510> means<00:00:52.690> it<00:00:52.900> probably<00:00:52.930> was<00:00:53.559> not

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
because that means it probably was not

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.770 
because that means it probably was not
spoiled<00:00:54.090> usually<00:00:55.090> when<00:00:55.330> something<00:00:55.540> is

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
spoiled usually when something is

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.020 
spoiled usually when something is
spoiled<00:00:56.199> the<00:00:56.590> different<00:00:56.920> phases<00:00:57.160> separate

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
spoiled the different phases separate

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.090 
spoiled the different phases separate
out<00:00:58.210> so<00:00:58.660> you<00:00:58.720> see<00:00:58.960> a<00:00:58.989> liquid<00:00:59.440> and<00:00:59.559> a<00:00:59.650> cream<00:00:59.920> on

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
out so you see a liquid and a cream on

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.770 
out so you see a liquid and a cream on
two<00:01:00.250> different<00:01:00.460> sides<00:01:00.610> or<00:01:01.239> it<00:01:01.390> just<00:01:01.420> doesn't

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
two different sides or it just doesn't

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.869 
two different sides or it just doesn't
look<00:01:02.170> right<00:01:02.229> or<00:01:02.589> in<00:01:02.890> fact<00:01:03.070> the<00:01:03.370> color<00:01:03.580> does

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
look right or in fact the color does

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.780 
look right or in fact the color does
change<00:01:04.420> significantly<00:01:04.720> and<00:01:05.409> by<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:06.130> way<00:01:06.340> this

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
change significantly and by the way this

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.330 
change significantly and by the way this
also<00:01:07.060> applies<00:01:07.600> to<00:01:07.630> questions<00:01:08.409> about<00:01:08.680> has<00:01:09.070> my

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
also applies to questions about has my

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.120 
also applies to questions about has my
product<00:01:09.790> expired<00:01:10.270> because<00:01:10.900> it's<00:01:11.350> beyond<00:01:11.979> the

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
product expired because it's beyond the

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.100 
product expired because it's beyond the
expiration<00:01:12.580> date<00:01:12.790> how<00:01:13.420> do<00:01:13.479> I<00:01:13.630> know<00:01:13.690> if<00:01:13.960> it's

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
expiration date how do I know if it's

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.710 
expiration date how do I know if it's
still<00:01:14.290> good<00:01:14.560> again<00:01:15.369> if<00:01:15.580> the<00:01:15.940> phases<00:01:16.360> haven't

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
still good again if the phases haven't

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.600 
still good again if the phases haven't
separated<00:01:16.900> out<00:01:17.409> then<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:18.010> product<00:01:18.460> is

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
separated out then the product is

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.539 
separated out then the product is
probably<00:01:19.180> still<00:01:19.540> good<00:01:19.780> so<00:01:20.350> in<00:01:21.070> this<00:01:21.340> case

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
probably still good so in this case

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.160 
probably still good so in this case
Shane<00:01:22.030> I<00:01:22.270> would<00:01:22.690> think<00:01:22.900> that<00:01:22.930> you're<00:01:23.140> the

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
Shane I would think that you're the

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.149 
Shane I would think that you're the
retina<00:01:23.710> gel<00:01:23.950> is<00:01:24.130> still<00:01:24.340> going<00:01:24.490> to<00:01:24.549> work

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
retina gel is still going to work

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.859 
retina gel is still going to work
Natalie<00:01:27.159> asks<00:01:27.520> i<00:01:27.700> recently<00:01:28.299> read<00:01:28.570> that<00:01:28.780> you

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:56.949 
that that in large pore is permanent

00:05:56.949 --> 00:05:59.040 
that that in large pore is permanent
just<00:05:57.280> because<00:05:57.580> of<00:05:57.699> how<00:05:57.849> long<00:05:58.120> the<00:05:58.570> clog<00:05:58.810> has

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
just because of how long the clog has

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.350 
just because of how long the clog has
been<00:05:59.229> there<00:05:59.440> so<00:06:00.340> the<00:06:00.849> point<00:06:01.030> that<00:06:01.210> I'm<00:06:01.330> trying

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
been there so the point that I'm trying

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.930 
been there so the point that I'm trying
to<00:06:01.750> make<00:06:01.930> is<00:06:02.110> that<00:06:02.500> one<00:06:03.370> of<00:06:03.400> the<00:06:03.550> reasons<00:06:03.880> that

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
to make is that one of the reasons that

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.330 
to make is that one of the reasons that
we<00:06:04.210> tell<00:06:04.449> people<00:06:04.900> get<00:06:05.470> these<00:06:05.680> things<00:06:05.949> cleaned

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
we tell people get these things cleaned

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.310 
we tell people get these things cleaned
out<00:06:06.520> don't<00:06:06.970> leave<00:06:07.210> cysts<00:06:07.630> for<00:06:07.840> a<00:06:07.870> long<00:06:08.080> time

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320 
out don't leave cysts for a long time

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.110 
out don't leave cysts for a long time
don't<00:06:08.740> leave<00:06:08.949> blackheads<00:06:09.490> for<00:06:09.669> a<00:06:09.699> long<00:06:09.880> time

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
don't leave blackheads for a long time

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.570 
don't leave blackheads for a long time
is<00:06:10.330> because<00:06:10.900> they<00:06:11.020> can<00:06:11.409> permanently<00:06:12.099> stretch

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
is because they can permanently stretch

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.879 
is because they can permanently stretch
out<00:06:12.820> the<00:06:12.970> pores<00:06:13.270> and<00:06:13.479> that's<00:06:14.169> another<00:06:14.590> reason

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:14.889 
out the pores and that's another reason

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:17.850 
out the pores and that's another reason
why<00:06:15.310> you<00:06:15.580> want<00:06:15.909> to<00:06:16.030> exfoliate<00:06:16.360> regularly<00:06:16.860> to

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860 
why you want to exfoliate regularly to

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.330 
why you want to exfoliate regularly to
help<00:06:18.340> prevent<00:06:18.940> these<00:06:19.570> enlarged<00:06:20.199> pores<00:06:20.620> and<00:06:20.830> to

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
help prevent these enlarged pores and to

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.850 
help prevent these enlarged pores and to
clean<00:06:21.580> them<00:06:21.759> out<00:06:21.849> faster<00:06:22.419> and<00:06:22.599> you<00:06:23.409> guessed<00:06:23.680> it

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 
clean them out faster and you guessed it

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.310 
clean them out faster and you guessed it
I<00:06:24.070> believe<00:06:24.849> that<00:06:25.060> glycolic<00:06:25.720> is<00:06:25.840> the<00:06:26.020> gold

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.320 
I believe that glycolic is the gold

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.740 
I believe that glycolic is the gold
standard<00:06:26.470> in<00:06:27.070> exfoliants<00:06:27.729> to<00:06:28.120> help<00:06:28.330> with

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
standard in exfoliants to help with

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.320 
standard in exfoliants to help with
large<00:06:29.110> pores<00:06:29.500> blackheads<00:06:30.280> whiteheads<00:06:30.430> and<00:06:31.000> so

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330 
large pores blackheads whiteheads and so

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.920 
large pores blackheads whiteheads and so
