pretty small files of a big file what
actually<00:00:47.460> happens<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.059> huge<00:00:48.390> file<00:00:48.570> is

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
actually happens is that a huge file is

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.319 
actually happens is that a huge file is
broken<00:00:49.440> down<00:00:49.649> into<00:00:49.980> smaller<00:00:50.370> pieces<00:00:50.730> or<00:00:50.940> bits

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
broken down into smaller pieces or bits

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.450 
broken down into smaller pieces or bits
and<00:00:51.570> these<00:00:52.079> bits<00:00:52.350> are<00:00:52.530> then<00:00:52.800> uploaded<00:00:53.250> all<00:00:53.430> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
and these bits are then uploaded all the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.979 
and these bits are then uploaded all the
cross<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.850> world<00:00:54.000> that's<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.600> reason<00:00:54.870> why

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
cross the world that's the reason why

then you open that small bit file by

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.810 
then you open that small bit file by
using<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.560> torrent<00:01:13.860> client<00:01:14.189> people<00:01:14.729> are

utorrent and that cracker file contains
the<00:01:19.200> addresses<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:20.040> where<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.670> small<00:01:20.909> files

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
the addresses of where the small files

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.030 
the addresses of where the small files
are<00:01:21.270> located<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.229> what<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.590> client<00:01:22.710> does

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
are located so to what the client does

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.890 
are located so to what the client does
is<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.490> client<00:01:23.820> then<00:01:23.970> pulls<00:01:24.330> all<00:01:24.659> these

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
is that the client then pulls all these

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.990 
is that the client then pulls all these
small<00:01:25.170> bits<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.560> files<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.460> stitches<00:01:26.850> them

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
small bits of files and it stitches them

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.359 
small bits of files and it stitches them
together<00:01:27.119> into<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.990> huge<00:01:28.259> torrent<00:01:28.950> file<00:01:29.130> so

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
together into a huge torrent file so

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.859

between the default download location it

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.350 
between the default download location it
could<00:05:15.280> be<00:05:15.400> an<00:05:15.520> internal<00:05:15.790> memory<00:05:16.120> or<00:05:16.300> the

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
could be an internal memory or the

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.930 
could be an internal memory or the
external<00:05:16.660> memory<00:05:17.160> and<00:05:18.160> the<00:05:18.460> other<00:05:18.670> cool

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
external memory and the other cool

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.910 
external memory and the other cool
switch<00:05:19.180> over<00:05:19.420> here<00:05:19.480> is<00:05:19.870> that<00:05:20.050> it<00:05:20.170> can<00:05:20.290> move<00:05:20.710> the

memory or vice versa after the download
is<00:05:25.060> completed<00:05:25.450> so<00:05:26.200> if<00:05:26.470> the<00:05:26.710> copy<00:05:27.340> rates<00:05:27.640> of

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
is completed so if the copy rates of

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.180 
is completed so if the copy rates of
your<00:05:28.180> external<00:05:28.690> memory<00:05:28.960> is<00:05:29.050> not<00:05:29.260> fast<00:05:29.530> you<00:05:30.040> can

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
your external memory is not fast you can

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.090 
your external memory is not fast you can
download<00:05:30.400> the<00:05:30.700> file<00:05:30.910> into<00:05:31.180> internal<00:05:31.479> memory

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
download the file into internal memory

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.860 
download the file into internal memory
and<00:05:32.190> then<00:05:32.520> it<00:05:32.640> will<00:05:32.700> automatically<00:05:33.270> copy<00:05:33.540> to

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
and then it will automatically copy to

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.240 
and then it will automatically copy to
extra<00:05:34.140> memory<00:05:34.440> after<00:05:34.680> the<00:05:34.800> download<00:05:35.160> is

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
extra memory after the download is
