00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
crack you got to go individually with

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.020 
crack you got to go individually with
every<00:00:51.899> single<00:00:52.079> crack<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.680> do<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.829> brush<00:00:53.129> so

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
every single crack and do a brush so

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.020 
every single crack and do a brush so
that<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.239> paint<00:00:54.770> overlaps<00:00:55.770> down<00:00:56.640> into<00:00:56.940> the

that the paint overlaps down into the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.020 
that the paint overlaps down into the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
corner and then that into the crack and

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.349 
corner and then that into the crack and
that<00:01:00.120> makes<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.899> won't<00:01:01.050> peel<00:01:01.289> up<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:03.030> we
