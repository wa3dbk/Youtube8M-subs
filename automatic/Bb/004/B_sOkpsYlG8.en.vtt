00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
there but to turn it around this way and

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.850 
there but to turn it around this way and
have<00:01:58.729> a<00:01:58.759> little<00:01:58.880> look

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.180 

I<00:02:03.230> mean<00:02:04.230> I<00:02:04.320> see<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:04.950> clearly<00:02:05.690> without<00:02:06.800> foul<00:02:07.800> a

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
I mean I see a is clearly without foul a

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:17.450

UFO<00:02:09.000> in<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.210> sea<00:02:13.100> so<00:02:14.100> I<00:02:15.110> think<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.560> anyone

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
UFO in the sea so I think that anyone

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.480 
UFO in the sea so I think that anyone
who<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.120> out<00:02:18.330> they<00:02:18.540> actually<00:02:18.870> looking<00:02:19.400> for<00:02:20.400> the
