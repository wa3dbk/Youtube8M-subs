that kind of overused genre that we've

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.850 
that kind of overused genre that we've
seen<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.790> especially<00:00:39.270> like<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.350> backlit

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
so this one because of the beats kind of

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.850 
so this one because of the beats kind of
color<00:00:44.640> branding<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.420> red<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.379> does<00:00:46.620> two

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
color branding is red and that does two

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.590

things for you a lot of the backlit
keyboards<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.260> I've<00:00:49.320> seen<00:00:49.559> are<00:00:49.739> just<00:00:49.920> too

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
keyboards that I've seen are just too

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.170 
keyboards that I've seen are just too
bright<00:00:50.340> if<00:00:50.550> you're<00:00:50.670> especially<00:00:50.820> if<00:00:51.090> you're

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
bright if you're especially if you're

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.670 
bright if you're especially if you're
using<00:00:51.300> them<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.629> dark<00:00:51.809> room<00:00:52.140> it's<00:00:52.410> just<00:00:52.590> a

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
using them in a dark room it's just a

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.459 
using them in a dark room it's just a
little<00:00:52.890> bit<00:00:52.980> overpowering<00:00:53.840> so<00:00:54.840> here<00:00:55.199> in<00:00:55.320> this

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
little bit overpowering so here in this

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.139 
little bit overpowering so here in this
case<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.070> red<00:00:56.280> light<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.640> almost<00:00:56.820> like<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
case the red light is almost like the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.240 
case the red light is almost like the
red<00:00:57.300> light<00:00:57.449> in<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.660> dark<00:00:57.960> room<00:00:58.140> it's<00:00:58.320> muted<00:00:58.829> so

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
red light in a dark room it's muted so

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.770 
red light in a dark room it's muted so
even<00:00:59.579> if<00:00:59.670> it's<00:00:59.820> a<00:01:00.000> dark<00:01:00.210> room<00:01:00.420> while<00:01:00.570> you're

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
even if it's a dark room while you're

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.389 
even if it's a dark room while you're
watching<00:01:00.930> TV<00:01:01.170> or<00:01:01.500> something<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.890> can<00:01:02.039> turn<00:01:02.250> on

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
watching TV or something you can turn on

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.070 
watching TV or something you can turn on
the<00:01:02.609> laptop<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.270> use<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.539> backlit<00:01:03.840> keyboard

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080
