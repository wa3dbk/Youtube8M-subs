00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:26.719 
a Catholic I was generally the most

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:28.450 
a Catholic I was generally the most
difficult<00:01:27.229> thing<00:01:27.409> about<00:01:27.619> doing<00:01:27.950> any<00:01:28.130> kind<00:01:28.369> of

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
difficult thing about doing any kind of

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.209 
difficult thing about doing any kind of
costuming<00:01:29.000> is<00:01:29.179> getting<00:01:29.659> inside<00:01:30.219> characters

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:31.219 
costuming is getting inside characters

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:34.270 
costuming is getting inside characters
heads<00:01:31.610> that<00:01:32.329> you<00:01:32.539> don't<00:01:32.750> naturally<00:01:33.679> connect

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
heads that you don't naturally connect

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.399 
heads that you don't naturally connect
with<00:01:34.460> for<00:01:34.670> whatever<00:01:34.850> reason<00:01:35.569> I<00:01:35.750> think<00:01:36.020> Daisy

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
with for whatever reason I think Daisy

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.919 
with for whatever reason I think Daisy
is<00:01:36.860> a<00:01:36.890> very<00:01:37.429> interesting<00:01:37.789> character<00:01:38.270> that

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
is a very interesting character that

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:41.020 
is a very interesting character that
Carey<00:01:39.439> Mulligan<00:01:39.679> brought<00:01:40.250> to<00:01:40.459> life<00:01:40.640> so

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
Carey Mulligan brought to life so

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.880 
Carey Mulligan brought to life so
brilliantly<00:01:41.600> and<00:01:41.959> I<00:01:42.170> think<00:01:42.439> in<00:01:42.590> this<00:01:42.679> instance

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
brilliantly and I think in this instance

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.539 
brilliantly and I think in this instance
it's<00:01:43.459> really<00:01:44.030> a<00:01:44.060> case<00:01:44.420> of<00:01:44.479> an<00:01:44.959> actress<00:01:45.549> helping

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
it's really a case of an actress helping

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.109 
it's really a case of an actress helping
you<00:01:46.880> to<00:01:47.270> discover<00:01:47.829> what<00:01:48.829> this<00:01:49.159> woman<00:01:49.700> would

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
you to discover what this woman would

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.809 
you to discover what this woman would
