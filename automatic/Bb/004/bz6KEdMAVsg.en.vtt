skills and you might have seen these
before

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:15.099 
before

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:17.850 
before
there<00:00:15.549> are<00:00:16.059> beads<00:00:16.330> I'll<00:00:17.110> show<00:00:17.260> you<00:00:17.320> that<00:00:17.410> bring

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860 
there are beads I'll show you that bring

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.349 
there are beads I'll show you that bring
this<00:00:17.950> up<00:00:18.130> to<00:00:18.310> you<00:00:19.619> they<00:00:20.619> are<00:00:20.769> beads<00:00:21.359> before

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:22.359 
this up to you they are beads before

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:26.970 
this up to you they are beads before
previously<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:24.160> were<00:00:24.779> really<00:00:25.779> teeny<00:00:26.140> teeny

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
previously that were really teeny teeny

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.820 
previously that were really teeny teeny
teeny<00:00:27.340> beads<00:00:27.699> and<00:00:28.150> they<00:00:28.570> go<00:00:28.720> on<00:00:28.869> these<00:00:29.050> peg

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
teeny beads and they go on these peg

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.249 
teeny beads and they go on these peg
boards<00:00:30.339> and<00:00:30.609> then<00:00:31.060> you<00:00:31.210> would<00:00:31.359> iron<00:00:31.599> them<00:00:31.990> and

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
boards and then you would iron them and

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.870 
boards and then you would iron them and
then<00:00:32.349> flip<00:00:32.590> them<00:00:32.770> over<00:00:32.950> once<00:00:33.580> you<00:00:33.670> take<00:00:33.790> them

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:33.880 
then flip them over once you take them

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.130 
then flip them over once you take them
off<00:00:33.940> the<00:00:34.060> peg<00:00:34.180> board<00:00:34.330> and<00:00:34.570> iron<00:00:34.750> them<00:00:34.870> and<00:00:35.050> then

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
off the peg board and iron them and then

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.020 
off the peg board and iron them and then
the<00:00:35.260> beads<00:00:35.470> would<00:00:35.650> fuse<00:00:35.950> together<00:00:36.160> but<00:00:36.940> the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
the beads would fuse together but the

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.610 
the beads would fuse together but the
beads<00:00:37.360> the<00:00:37.420> problem<00:00:37.660> with<00:00:37.750> that<00:00:37.780> was<00:00:38.170> that<00:00:38.530> the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
beads the problem with that was that the

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.920 
beads the problem with that was that the
beads<00:00:38.830> are<00:00:38.980> really<00:00:39.010> small<00:00:39.730> now<00:00:40.540> they've<00:00:40.720> come

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
beads are really small now they've come

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.530 
beads are really small now they've come
out<00:00:40.990> with<00:00:41.140> something<00:00:41.710> and<00:00:42.640> these<00:00:43.210> are<00:00:43.390> called

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540 
out with something and these are called

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.900 
out with something and these are called
biggy<00:00:43.990> beads<00:00:44.230> and<00:00:44.590> the<00:00:45.370> children<00:00:45.730> can<00:00:45.820> make

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
biggy beads and the children can make

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.210 
biggy beads and the children can make
all<00:00:46.090> kinds<00:00:46.480> of<00:00:46.540> patterns<00:00:46.780> with<00:00:47.200> these<00:00:47.410> and<00:00:47.890> you

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
all kinds of patterns with these and you

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.730 
all kinds of patterns with these and you
don't<00:00:48.610> have<00:00:48.730> to<00:00:48.910> iron<00:00:49.090> them<00:00:49.450> and<00:00:49.750> all<00:00:50.380> this<00:00:50.560> can

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:50.740 
don't have to iron them and all this can

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.620 
don't have to iron them and all this can
just<00:00:50.860> be<00:00:50.950> used<00:00:51.190> as<00:00:51.520> fine<00:00:52.120> motor<00:00:52.330> skills

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630 
just be used as fine motor skills

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.900 
just be used as fine motor skills
development<00:00:52.930> activity<00:00:53.440> and<00:00:53.800> you<00:00:54.610> can<00:00:54.760> also

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
development activity and you can also

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.510 
development activity and you can also
get<00:00:55.240> these<00:00:55.740> plates<00:00:56.740> right<00:00:56.980> here<00:00:57.040> for<00:00:57.430> the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
get these plates right here for the

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.010 
get these plates right here for the
children<00:00:57.730> to<00:00:58.000> put<00:00:58.180> the<00:00:58.300> beads<00:00:58.480> on<00:00:58.780> these

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
children to put the beads on these

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.480 
children to put the beads on these
square<00:00:59.320> things<00:00:59.710> and<00:00:59.920> they<00:00:59.980> have<00:01:00.160> an<00:01:00.310> edge<00:01:00.460> here

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:00.490 
square things and they have an edge here

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.730 
square things and they have an edge here
and<00:01:00.970> an<00:01:01.480> edge<00:01:01.630> here<00:01:01.660> in<00:01:02.080> case<00:01:02.290> you<00:01:02.440> wanted<00:01:02.650> to

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:02.740 
and an edge here in case you wanted to

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.490 
and an edge here in case you wanted to
build<00:01:02.980> a<00:01:03.250> large<00:01:03.780> plate<00:01:04.780> for<00:01:04.989> them<00:01:05.110> to<00:01:05.199> put<00:01:05.379> them

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
build a large plate for them to put them

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.609 
build a large plate for them to put them
on<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.939> these<00:01:07.810> beads<00:01:08.049> are<00:01:08.229> certainly<00:01:08.500> big

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
on and these beads are certainly big

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:09.899 
on and these beads are certainly big
enough<00:01:08.679> for<00:01:08.950> the<00:01:09.039> children<00:01:09.219> to<00:01:09.460> pick<00:01:09.579> up<00:01:09.759> by

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
enough for the children to pick up by

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:11.459 
enough for the children to pick up by
themselves<00:01:10.450> and<00:01:10.570> place<00:01:10.719> on<00:01:10.929> there<00:01:11.170> was<00:01:11.259> part

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:11.469 
themselves and place on there was part

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:12.779 
themselves and place on there was part
of<00:01:11.500> the<00:01:11.590> problems<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:11.979> smaller<00:01:12.280> beads<00:01:12.549> is

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789 
of the problems the smaller beads is

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:15.149 
of the problems the smaller beads is
that<00:01:12.909> they<00:01:13.000> were<00:01:13.060> so<00:01:13.359> small<00:01:13.979> children<00:01:14.979> became

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
that they were so small children became

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.190 
that they were so small children became
frustrated<00:01:15.490> when<00:01:15.909> they<00:01:15.939> try<00:01:16.179> to<00:01:16.210> put<00:01:16.329> beads

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
frustrated when they try to put beads

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.419 
frustrated when they try to put beads
next<00:01:17.380> to<00:01:17.560> each<00:01:17.649> other<00:01:17.770> because<00:01:18.039> they<00:01:18.280> would

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:18.429 
next to each other because they would

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:20.609 
next to each other because they would
knock<00:01:18.640> over<00:01:19.149> or<00:01:19.749> they<00:01:19.899> couldn't<00:01:20.200> get<00:01:20.320> them<00:01:20.469> on

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
knock over or they couldn't get them on

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.169 
knock over or they couldn't get them on
the<00:01:20.770> little<00:01:20.950> pegs<00:01:21.189> on<00:01:21.399> the<00:01:21.520> pegboard

00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:22.179 
the little pegs on the pegboard

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:25.980 
the little pegs on the pegboard
and<00:01:23.189> became<00:01:24.189> frustrating<00:01:24.789> for<00:01:24.969> them<00:01:25.119> the<00:01:25.869> age

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
and became frustrating for them the age

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.440 
and became frustrating for them the age
our<00:01:26.409> recommendation<00:01:27.070> on<00:01:27.159> here<00:01:27.399> is<00:01:27.609> for<00:01:27.939> A+<00:01:28.119> but

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
our recommendation on here is for A+ but

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.760 
our recommendation on here is for A+ but
I<00:01:28.539> use<00:01:28.719> these<00:01:28.960> with<00:01:29.200> three-year-olds<00:01:29.679> you

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
I use these with three-year-olds you

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.249 
I use these with three-year-olds you
have<00:01:29.950> to<00:01:30.100> use<00:01:30.479> supervision<00:01:31.479> these<00:01:31.719> are<00:01:31.899> small

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
have to use supervision these are small

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:33.510 
have to use supervision these are small
beads<00:01:32.469> but<00:01:32.740> they're<00:01:32.859> not<00:01:32.950> small<00:01:33.249> it's<00:01:33.429> a

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
beads but they're not small it's a

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.749 
beads but they're not small it's a
regular<00:01:34.380> fusion<00:01:35.380> beads<00:01:35.710> but<00:01:36.039> still<00:01:36.399> you<00:01:36.549> want

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
regular fusion beads but still you want

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.309 
regular fusion beads but still you want
to<00:01:36.850> use<00:01:36.969> close<00:01:37.270> supervision<00:01:37.509> especially

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:38.319 
to use close supervision especially

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:40.020 
to use close supervision especially
children<00:01:38.649> 3<00:01:38.920> and<00:01:39.039> under<00:01:39.159> and<00:01:39.460> children<00:01:39.789> still

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
children 3 and under and children still

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.160 
children 3 and under and children still
the<00:01:40.119> stages<00:01:40.509> of<00:01:40.600> putting<00:01:40.719> them<00:01:40.929> in<00:01:41.049> their

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
the stages of putting them in their

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.260 
the stages of putting them in their
mouths<00:01:41.350> but<00:01:42.249> this<00:01:42.399> is<00:01:42.520> just<00:01:42.640> a<00:01:42.759> great<00:01:42.939> activity

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
mouths but this is just a great activity

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.999 
mouths but this is just a great activity
children<00:01:43.840> make<00:01:43.990> any<00:01:44.170> kind<00:01:44.319> of<00:01:44.409> design<00:01:44.710> they

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
children make any kind of design they

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.520 
children make any kind of design they
can<00:01:45.130> fill<00:01:45.310> up<00:01:45.399> the<00:01:45.549> whole<00:01:45.789> board<00:01:46.179> if<00:01:46.569> they<00:01:47.289> want

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
can fill up the whole board if they want

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.129 
can fill up the whole board if they want
and<00:01:47.920> there<00:01:48.700> are<00:01:48.880> special<00:01:49.359> tweezers<00:01:49.719> available

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:50.139 
and there are special tweezers available

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:52.109 
and there are special tweezers available
I<00:01:50.170> think<00:01:50.380> this<00:01:50.499> is<00:01:50.649> just<00:01:50.859> I<00:01:51.130> may<00:01:51.490> be<00:01:51.549> made<00:01:51.819> for

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
I think this is just I may be made for

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.090 
I think this is just I may be made for
the<00:01:52.329> the<00:01:52.689> small<00:01:52.990> beads<00:01:53.259> these<00:01:53.710> definitely

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
the the small beads these definitely

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.160 
the the small beads these definitely
help<00:01:54.369> but<00:01:55.359> they<00:01:55.509> can<00:01:55.689> be<00:01:55.780> used<00:01:55.929> for<00:01:56.049> these

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
help but they can be used for these

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.379 
help but they can be used for these
sides<00:01:56.439> be<00:01:56.649> size<00:01:57.130> beads<00:01:57.460> as<00:01:57.579> well<00:01:57.609> children<00:01:58.240> can

00:01:58.379 --> 00:01:58.389 
sides be size beads as well children can

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:01.190 
sides be size beads as well children can
pinch<00:01:58.899> the<00:01:59.079> beads<00:01:59.350> together<00:01:59.560> and<00:02:00.159> put<00:02:00.759> them<00:02:00.909> on

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
pinch the beads together and put them on

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.809 
pinch the beads together and put them on
the<00:02:02.200> pegs<00:02:02.439> on<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:02.950> board<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.829> may<00:02:06.459> be<00:02:06.520> easier

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819 
the pegs on the board and may be easier

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:08.309 
the pegs on the board and may be easier
just<00:02:06.939> to<00:02:07.060> stick<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.389> tweezer<00:02:07.630> inside<00:02:08.170> the

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
just to stick the tweezer inside the

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.310 
just to stick the tweezer inside the
hole<00:02:08.500> and<00:02:08.890> then<00:02:09.069> drop<00:02:09.310> it<00:02:09.490> on<00:02:09.869> but<00:02:10.869> again<00:02:11.140> they

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
hole and then drop it on but again they

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.810 
hole and then drop it on but again they
can<00:02:11.470> self-select<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:12.100> cars<00:02:12.310> that<00:02:12.460> they<00:02:12.580> want

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
can self-select the cars that they want

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.900 
can self-select the cars that they want
to<00:02:12.970> you<00:02:13.150> is<00:02:13.420> foot<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.900> whole<00:02:14.080> board

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
to you is foot the whole board

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.550 
to you is foot the whole board
and<00:02:16.000> it's<00:02:16.570> just<00:02:16.690> really<00:02:16.870> great<00:02:17.080> for

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
and it's just really great for

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.590 
and it's just really great for
developing<00:02:18.100> fine<00:02:18.340> motor<00:02:18.370> skills<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.150> a<00:02:19.300> hand

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
developing fine motor skills and a hand

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.890 
developing fine motor skills and a hand
coordination<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:22.060> can<00:02:22.210> kind<00:02:22.570> of<00:02:22.600> see<00:02:22.750> how<00:02:22.870> it

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
coordination you can kind of see how it

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.680 
coordination you can kind of see how it
goes<00:02:23.110> here<00:02:23.440> and<00:02:23.850> I<00:02:24.850> haven't<00:02:25.210> visited<00:02:25.390> the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
and suppose you can get patterns of

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.590 
and suppose you can get patterns of
different<00:02:29.890> kind<00:02:30.220> of<00:02:30.310> things<00:02:30.550> to<00:02:30.880> make<00:02:31.030> I<00:02:31.300> like
