00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:10.690
 called my project I was developing 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:12.370
 tetris for mobile platforms of this which 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:19.210
 use technologies at all 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:21.930
 used kamnev from read html 5 plus 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.460
 to all this box2d 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.130
 how do you design for this 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.530
 the platform is not much different 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:33.070
 what I do at work 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:38.680
 web developer i made html page 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:42.900
 I prepare a drought in the application and you can 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.900
 show how it looks now ferries 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:51.770

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:54.870
 figures are counted and hits right 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.910
 canvas and destroy the same numbers 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.560
 such a prototype can actually 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.340
 realize a lot more interesting about 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.290
 stone there is not much time that you can 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.720
 advise future participants on the very 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.130
 really advised to stay and do 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.590
 only junior and put your this 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:16.410
 interesting until the end probably as 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.540
 called your project the project is called 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:23.010
 hocca points for new and 100 ma . 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.530

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.710
 actually and 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.730
 how did you like the platform 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.610
 convenient and fast development 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:43.330
 and let's see what it looks like on denyuzhka 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:46.630
 the app will help part now he's in 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.930
 accelerated growing can feed 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.930
 him 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.820
 you can clean up after him 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.109
 you can overfeed him 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.599
 and almost all models are so cool 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.760

 project name let's go out 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.840
 such a game application which 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.130
 takes advantage of opportunities 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.620

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.920
 Well, fucking wanted to tell us familiar 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.519
 we quickly do let's try 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:12.590

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:14.790
 we are connected to the phone and watch clock 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.540
 another watch on another phone 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:23.010
 her own 3 mutual blows 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:25.980
 virtual phones you can see the most 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:29.209
 bounce I would advise participants 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.790
 hackathon treat everything just 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.950
 come up with something 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.140
 preferably not to drag this working draft 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.450
 or something else 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.040
 shoot something new interesting and 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.540
 most likely it will turn out that the remark 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.560
 Yes, we must take the most incredible idea 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.240
 just in a short amount of time 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.180

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.200
 try 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.270
 and here it is possible to come and try 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.700
 immediately get support from people 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:02.530
 which he understands experts and 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.530
 do something and continued
