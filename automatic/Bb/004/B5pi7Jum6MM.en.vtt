00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.740
 hello youtube friends welcome to 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:08.530
 another video of super kraft for minecraft 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:12.340
 in this new occasion I am going to show you 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:15.890
 How to install your first minecraft mode 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:19.510
 here I went 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.510
 the two folders of today's tutorial 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.099
 It is pacma animal that is the folder where 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.529
 is the module installed that basically 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.680
 It serves to mount animals I can 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.960
 transport us with animals and the other one 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.360
 call module to see what it's worth to load 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.449
 the modes if we do not have the durable mode 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.150
 it's like it does not work if we 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:44.390
 we started the minecraft is with the mod 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:47.430
 without the ader module it would give us an error and 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:51.800
 minecraft would come out 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.800
 and this is two separate folders 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.670
 in the description I will upload at noon 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:01.559
 to dropbox 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.559
 foxx and physical measure I will upload 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.699
 let us begin 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.420
 to start good started searching 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.280
 programs and let's 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:17.710
 percentage to data percentage 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.500
 enter 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.890
 and we're going to knit the biggest point 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.820
 minecraft we have the folder 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.090
 Minecraft 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.539
 and we are going to bing 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:35.399
 and here in we started minecraft in 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.399
 April with winter 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.630
 good 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.630
 to see and now 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.130
 with this rare rare open we go to the 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.799
 mother folder 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.270
 and we tighten control and select 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.270
 all the files and we copy it 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.710
 rather we drag them to not 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.000
 complicate us a lot and we drag all 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.330
 these files and we put them in more 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.330
 points 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:14.409
 now we put it I will have installed 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.500
 let's leave minecraft dot heart 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:20.069
 winrar open and let's animate bites 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.069
 mods 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.770
 we select 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.990
 the three folders and the archives and os 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.990
 we drag like we did 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.390
 with the der sar model we hope that 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.390
 update the file 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.350
 Y 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:50.630
 you would have to appear a 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.630
 folder that says goal ins 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.160
 and that folder removes it for you 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.310
 can freely install the texts 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.140
 etc so that we do not have problems with 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.530
 installation 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:08.420
 already with this installed 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:10.760
 with this the video is finished 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.880
 simple the video and I hope you have 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.880
 served 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:22.290
