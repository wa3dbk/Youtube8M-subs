00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
it truly is underwater flight I mean

it truly is underwater flight I mean
this<00:00:06.029> is<00:00:06.270> this<00:00:06.720> is<00:00:06.870> what<00:00:07.109> we're<00:00:07.259> pioneering<00:00:07.859> is

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
this is this is what we're pioneering is

this is this is what we're pioneering is
it's<00:00:08.460> really<00:00:08.820> quite<00:00:09.059> different<00:00:09.300> you're<00:00:09.990> not
