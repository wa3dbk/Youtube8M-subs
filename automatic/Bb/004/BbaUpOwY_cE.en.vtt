00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:12.360 
alright i'm going to show you guys how
to<00:00:03.000> make<00:00:04.580> David<00:00:05.580> Wiese<00:00:06.589> his<00:00:07.589> pencil<00:00:08.400> one

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:12.370 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.810 

now<00:00:13.370> it's<00:00:13.610> nothing<00:00:13.790> too<00:00:14.240> fancy

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:23.810 

but<00:00:17.449> it<00:00:17.660> spins<00:00:18.520> actually<00:00:19.520> pretty<00:00:19.760> good<00:00:20.890> wait

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
but it spins actually pretty good wait

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.310 
but it spins actually pretty good wait
compared<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:26.449> the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
compared to the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.340 
compared to the
momentum<00:00:29.220> MX<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:30.570> earth<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.380> NX

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
momentum MX to earth the NX

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:42.860 
momentum MX to earth the NX
is

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.639 

this<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.590> twelve<00:00:43.890> point<00:00:44.160> three<00:00:44.250> grams<00:00:47.390> this<00:00:48.390> is

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
this is twelve point three grams this is

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:57.060 
this is twelve point three grams this is
13.6<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:50.610> it's<00:00:50.730> not<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.210> much<00:00:51.239> different

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.729 

I<00:00:57.160> like<00:00:57.880> I'm<00:00:58.180> great<00:00:58.450> I'm<00:00:59.050> going<00:00:59.350> to<00:00:59.410> stick<00:00:59.680> with

and this is to give it a little bit more

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.340 
and this is to give it a little bit more
weight<00:02:01.330> and

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.490 

increase<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.520> diameter<00:02:07.700> of<00:02:08.149> it<00:02:08.420> all<00:02:09.319> right

to five another good thing about this
mod<00:04:00.629> is<00:04:00.659> that<00:04:01.140> if<00:04:01.409> you're<00:04:01.620> so<00:04:01.799> used<00:04:02.040> to<00:04:02.280> katie's

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
mod is that if you're so used to katie's

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:08.690 
mod is that if you're so used to katie's
and<00:04:03.329> like<00:04:03.359> that<00:04:04.430> it's<00:04:05.430> easy<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:07.700> bring

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
and like that it's easy to bring

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.229 
and like that it's easy to bring
your<00:04:08.879> weight<00:04:09.120> down<00:04:09.200> and<00:04:10.400> how<00:04:11.400> you<00:04:11.459> use<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:12.000> pen

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
your weight down and how you use the pen

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.880 
your weight down and how you use the pen
because

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.009 

yeah<00:04:16.579> you<00:04:16.640> could<00:04:16.940> just<00:04:17.060> start<00:04:17.359> taking<00:04:17.510> strips

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
yeah you could just start taking strips

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:24.710 
yeah you could just start taking strips
off<00:04:20.470> all<00:04:21.470> right

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:36.640 

this<00:04:25.200> is<00:04:25.350> a<00:04:25.380> confusing<00:04:25.950> part

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:46.129 

 tape

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.730 

are<00:04:47.139> good<00:04:48.099> enough<00:04:48.810> so<00:04:49.810> you<00:04:49.900> just<00:04:50.050> put<00:04:50.139> them<00:04:50.560> on

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
are good enough so you just put them on

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.999 
are good enough so you just put them on
the<00:04:50.919> ends

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:54.009 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:55.810 

and<00:04:54.249> then

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
and then

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.390 
and then
I'm<00:04:56.360> going<00:04:56.540> to<00:04:56.660> wrap<00:04:56.810> this<00:04:57.080> one<00:04:57.490> for

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
I'm going to wrap this one for

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.810 
I'm going to wrap this one for
or<00:05:00.080> are<00:05:01.080> up<00:05:01.350> this<00:05:01.530> 15<00:05:01.979> times<00:05:02.009> in<00:05:02.520> the<00:05:02.669> other

two

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:12.849 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:31.999 

five

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:32.009 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:33.900 

two

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
but I just threw this in

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.490 
but I just threw this in
four<00:05:53.030> or<00:05:53.180> five<00:05:53.210> minutes<00:05:53.810> so

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.320 

and<00:05:58.040> it's<00:05:58.310> Ben's<00:05:58.690> pretty<00:05:59.690> damn<00:05:59.930> nice<00:06:00.140> for<00:06:00.710> a

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
and it's Ben's pretty damn nice for a

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:14.200 
and it's Ben's pretty damn nice for a
pencil

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210
