going<00:06:00.580> to<00:06:00.670> need<00:06:00.760> a<00:06:00.790> big<00:06:01.000> spoon<00:06:01.360> because<00:06:01.750> this

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:02.140 
going to need a big spoon because this

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.700 
going to need a big spoon because this
takes<00:06:02.410> a<00:06:02.590> little<00:06:02.710> bit<00:06:02.890> of<00:06:02.950> arm<00:06:03.450> arm<00:06:04.450> power<00:06:04.810> once
