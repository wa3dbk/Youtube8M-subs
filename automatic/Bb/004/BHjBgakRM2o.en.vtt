the horse behind me is a horse skeleton
that<00:00:22.920> is<00:00:22.980> almost<00:00:23.610> totally<00:00:23.820> complete<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.600> will

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:24.780 
that is almost totally complete I will

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.320 
that is almost totally complete I will
show<00:00:25.020> you<00:00:25.080> which<00:00:25.470> bone<00:00:26.040> is<00:00:26.370> missing<00:00:27.000> from<00:00:27.150> the

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
show you which bone is missing from the

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.270 
show you which bone is missing from the
skeleton<00:00:27.840> but<00:00:28.050> we're<00:00:28.170> very<00:00:28.320> lucky<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.860> have<00:00:29.010> an

entire<00:00:29.580> skeleton<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.390> horse<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:31.440> we<00:00:31.560> can

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
entire skeleton of the horse so we can

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.260

general divisions of the horse skeleton
one<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.460> called<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.909> axial<00:01:09.360> skeleton<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:10.140> like

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
one is called the axial skeleton I like

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.560 
one is called the axial skeleton I like
to<00:01:10.710> break<00:01:10.920> down<00:01:11.130> big<00:01:11.520> things<00:01:11.820> like<00:01:12.120> two

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
to break down big things like two

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.330

to a breast bone or a sternum that's the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.789 
to a breast bone or a sternum that's the
one<00:01:37.890> bone<00:01:38.130> that's<00:01:38.400> missing<00:01:38.790> from<00:01:38.939> this<00:01:39.030> body

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
one bone that's missing from this body

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.590 
one bone that's missing from this body
because<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.010> cartilage<00:01:41.330> disintegrates<00:01:42.330> when

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
because the cartilage disintegrates when

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.480 
because the cartilage disintegrates when
these<00:01:42.720> bones<00:01:43.020> were<00:01:43.140> processed<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.890> actually

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
these bones were processed to actually

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.280 
these bones were processed to actually
construct<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.240> skeleton<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:45.869> there<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.259> a

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
construct the skeleton so there is a

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.280 
construct the skeleton so there is a
breast<00:01:46.650> bone<00:01:46.860> just<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.310> we<00:01:47.490> have<00:01:48.020> but<00:01:49.020> it's

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
breast bone just like we have but it's

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.740 
breast bone just like we have but it's
not<00:01:49.500> on<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.770> skeleton<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.630> continuing<00:01:51.630> with

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
not on the skeleton so continuing with

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.780 
not on the skeleton so continuing with
the<00:01:51.869> axial<00:01:52.290> skeleton<00:01:52.799> here's<00:01:53.400> the<00:01:53.549> thoracic

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
the axial skeleton here's the thoracic

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.859 
the axial skeleton here's the thoracic
vertebrae<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:55.530> lumbar<00:01:55.950> vertebrae<00:01:56.780> there's<00:01:57.780> a

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
vertebrae the lumbar vertebrae there's a

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.530 
vertebrae the lumbar vertebrae there's a
fused<00:01:58.409> set<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.070> five<00:01:59.310> bones<00:01:59.610> back<00:01:59.939> here<00:02:00.270> called

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
fused set of five bones back here called

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.289 
fused set of five bones back here called
the<00:02:00.630> sacrum<00:02:01.170> these<00:02:02.100> are<00:02:02.280> fused<00:02:02.670> together<00:02:02.850> and

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
the sacrum these are fused together and

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.810 
the sacrum these are fused together and
then<00:02:04.079> obviously<00:02:04.259> in<00:02:04.619> horses<00:02:05.070> you've<00:02:05.310> got<00:02:05.520> the

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
then obviously in horses you've got the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.280 
then obviously in horses you've got the
tail<00:02:06.030> vertebrae<00:02:06.570> those<00:02:06.900> are<00:02:07.049> called

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
most people call this the knee and

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.319 
most people call this the knee and
that's<00:03:03.140> lay<00:03:03.470> terminology<00:03:04.250> which<00:03:04.459> is<00:03:04.489> fine<00:03:05.030> as

that's lay terminology which is fine as

a<00:04:19.400> fibula<00:04:19.880> which<00:04:20.239> is<00:04:21.200> on<00:04:21.460> the<00:04:22.460> outside<00:04:22.880> or<00:04:23.060> the

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
a fibula which is on the outside or the

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.360 
a fibula which is on the outside or the
lateral<00:04:23.599> side<00:04:23.870> of<00:04:24.169> our<00:04:24.650> leg

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
lateral side of our leg

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.820 
lateral side of our leg
those<00:04:25.940> bones<00:04:26.180> are<00:04:26.360> fused<00:04:26.690> in<00:04:26.900> the<00:04:26.990> horse<00:04:27.230> so

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
those bones are fused in the horse so

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.200 
those bones are fused in the horse so
they<00:04:27.949> don't<00:04:28.100> have<00:04:28.310> two<00:04:28.520> bones<00:04:28.760> here<00:04:29.030> they<00:04:29.180> just

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
they don't have two bones here they just

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.020 
they don't have two bones here they just
have<00:04:29.600> one<00:04:29.840> and<00:04:30.190> then<00:04:31.190> you<00:04:31.370> have<00:04:31.639> the

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
have one and then you have the

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.360 
have one and then you have the
equivalent<00:04:32.480> of<00:04:32.570> our<00:04:32.690> ankle<00:04:33.199> with<00:04:34.040> the<00:04:34.070> hock

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
equivalent of our ankle with the hock

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.120 
equivalent of our ankle with the hock
hock<00:04:34.699> bones<00:04:35.180> here<00:04:35.570> and<00:04:35.780> then<00:04:36.530> again<00:04:36.650> we'll<00:04:36.979> go

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
hock bones here and then again we'll go

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.909 
hock bones here and then again we'll go
into<00:04:37.280> more<00:04:37.520> detail<00:04:37.940> later<00:04:38.870> on<00:04:39.139> with<00:04:39.590> the

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
into more detail later on with the

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.580 
into more detail later on with the
cannon<00:04:40.729> bone<00:04:40.850> or<00:04:41.210> the<00:04:41.270> third<00:04:41.600> metatarsal<00:04:42.410> bone

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
cannon bone or the third metatarsal bone

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.909 
cannon bone or the third metatarsal bone
and<00:04:42.919> then<00:04:43.639> the<00:04:43.790> long<00:04:44.570> pastern<00:04:45.110> bone<00:04:45.320> the<00:04:45.650> short

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
and then the long pastern bone the short

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.210 
and then the long pastern bone the short
pastern<00:04:46.370> bone<00:04:46.610> and<00:04:46.910> the<00:04:47.300> coffin<00:04:47.660> bone<00:04:48.220> so

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
pastern bone and the coffin bone so

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.629 
pastern bone and the coffin bone so
that's<00:04:50.150> just<00:04:50.330> a<00:04:50.449> general<00:04:50.500> overview<00:04:51.500> of<00:04:51.710> the
