I<00:00:04.520> just<00:00:05.520> wanted<00:00:05.940> to<00:00:06.000> make<00:00:06.240> this<00:00:07.309> video<00:00:08.450> real

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
I just wanted to make this video real

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.749 
I just wanted to make this video real
quick<00:00:09.480> because<00:00:09.830> someone<00:00:10.830> requested<00:00:11.400> that<00:00:11.700> I

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
quick because someone requested that I

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.799 
quick because someone requested that I
show<00:00:12.120> step<00:00:12.599> by<00:00:12.630> step<00:00:13.170> how<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:14.150> got<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.360> guitar

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
show step by step how I got the guitar

going<00:00:19.890> through<00:00:21.380> my<00:00:22.380> Juneau<00:00:22.769> gene<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.400> it's

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
going through my Juneau gene and it's

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.040 
going through my Juneau gene and it's
really<00:00:24.240> easy<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.480> do

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
really easy to do

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.870 
really easy to do
you<00:00:25.320> could<00:00:25.500> be<00:00:25.800> in<00:00:25.920> either<00:00:26.010> patch<00:00:26.640> or

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
you could be in either patch or

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.269 
you could be in either patch or
performance<00:00:27.449> mode<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:28.019> guess<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.920> easier<00:00:29.130> way

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
performance mode I guess the easier way

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.550 
performance mode I guess the easier way
to<00:00:29.310> do<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.760> right<00:00:29.939> now<00:00:30.000> would<00:00:30.359> be<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.570> just<00:00:31.230> go

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
to do it right now would be a just go

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.620 
to do it right now would be a just go
ahead<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.890> be<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.099> patch<00:00:32.340> mode<00:00:35.000> so<00:00:36.000> in<00:00:36.450> the

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
recorder section up all the way up and

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.469 
recorder section up all the way up and
that's<00:01:35.220> going<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.490> take<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.119> screen

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
that's going to take you to the screen

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.370 
that's going to take you to the screen
that<00:01:36.780> says<00:01:37.140> audio<00:01:37.350> input<00:01:38.070> settings<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:39.990> this

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
that says audio input settings and this

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.210 
that says audio input settings and this
is<00:01:40.590> where<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.890> choose<00:01:41.159> line<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:42.090> left<00:01:42.540> as

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
is where you choose line in left as

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.289 
is where you choose line in left as
obviously<00:01:44.220> that's<00:01:44.460> where<00:01:44.640> we<00:01:44.759> plugged<00:01:45.060> in

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
obviously that's where we plugged in

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.060 
obviously that's where we plugged in
right<00:01:47.299> you<00:01:48.299> can<00:01:48.479> also<00:01:48.659> choose<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.380> multi

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
right you can also choose the multi

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.179 
right you can also choose the multi
effects<00:01:50.490> here<00:01:50.820> now<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:52.170> trick<00:01:52.470> here<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.070> I

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
effects here now the trick here and I

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.679 
effects here now the trick here and I
think<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:53.729> where<00:01:53.909> most<00:01:54.119> people<00:01:54.210> forget

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
think this is where most people forget

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.760 
think this is where most people forget
is<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.670> obviously<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:57.299> have<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.810> have<00:01:58.590> your

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
is that obviously you have to have your

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.859 
is that obviously you have to have your
audio<00:01:59.159> input<00:01:59.460> level<00:01:59.759> all<00:01:59.939> the<00:01:59.969> way<00:02:00.060> up<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.570> to

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
audio input level all the way up and to

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.380 
audio input level all the way up and to
do<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.649> just<00:02:01.680> choose<00:02:02.670> down<00:02:03.000> go<00:02:03.360> down

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
do that you just choose down go down

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.709 
do that you just choose down go down
right<00:02:03.990> arrows<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.850> like<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.360> hold<00:02:06.570> the

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
right arrows and I like to hold the

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:07.980 
right arrows and I like to hold the
shift<00:02:06.990> button<00:02:07.110> here

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
shift button here

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.130 
shift button here
and<00:02:08.080> then<00:02:08.759> as<00:02:09.759> I'm<00:02:10.090> holding<00:02:10.450> shift<00:02:10.479> I<00:02:10.869> pushed

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
and then as I'm holding shift I pushed

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.050 
and then as I'm holding shift I pushed
the<00:02:11.230> increase<00:02:11.650> button<00:02:11.980> and<00:02:12.099> that<00:02:12.250> takes<00:02:12.760> me<00:02:12.970> up

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
the increase button and that takes me up

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.930 
the increase button and that takes me up
in<00:02:13.239> ratios<00:02:13.599> of<00:02:13.630> 10<00:02:14.050> so<00:02:14.890> that's<00:02:15.280> much<00:02:15.580> quicker

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
in ratios of 10 so that's much quicker

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.630 
in ratios of 10 so that's much quicker
there<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.599> do<00:02:16.780> that<00:02:17.099> or<00:02:18.099> you<00:02:18.220> can<00:02:18.370> use<00:02:18.489> the

but<00:03:44.920> anyway<00:03:45.420> get<00:03:46.420> back<00:03:46.629> to<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:46.930> point<00:03:47.230> that's

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:48.189 
but anyway get back to the point that's

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:52.800 
but anyway get back to the point that's
basically<00:03:48.730> how<00:03:49.000> you<00:03:49.030> do<00:03:49.329> it<00:03:50.129> but<00:03:51.129> I<00:03:51.700> guess<00:03:52.389> you

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
basically how you do it but I guess you

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.069 
basically how you do it but I guess you
know<00:03:52.989> once<00:03:53.499> you<00:03:53.650> know<00:03:53.980> it's<00:03:54.280> pretty<00:03:54.519> easy<00:03:55.079> but

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
know once you know it's pretty easy but

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:00.030 
know once you know it's pretty easy but
discovering<00:03:56.919> it<00:03:57.129> is<00:03:57.780> always<00:03:58.859> you<00:03:59.859> know

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
discovering it is always you know

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.750
