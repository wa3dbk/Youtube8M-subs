is a boot that you'll be able to take

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.400 
is a boot that you'll be able to take

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.010

Nike<00:03:49.349> magista<00:03:49.650> obrah<00:03:50.220> this<00:03:50.520> is<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.730> boot<00:03:50.880> that

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
Nike magista obrah this is the boot that

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.640 
Nike magista obrah this is the boot that
I<00:03:51.209> wouldn't<00:03:51.450> necessarily<00:03:51.870> call<00:03:52.230> a<00:03:52.290> revolution

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
I wouldn't necessarily call a revolution

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.010 
I wouldn't necessarily call a revolution
in<00:03:53.280> terms<00:03:53.459> of<00:03:53.670> performance<00:03:54.209> but<00:03:54.599> more<00:03:54.750> so<00:03:54.989> a

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
in terms of performance but more so a

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.350 
in terms of performance but more so a
revolution<00:03:55.860> when<00:03:56.040> it<00:03:56.160> comes<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:56.610> fit<00:03:56.940> the

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
revolution when it comes to fit the

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.470 
revolution when it comes to fit the
Flyknit<00:03:57.900> upper<00:03:58.080> works<00:03:58.860> so<00:03:59.310> well<00:03:59.580> on<00:03:59.849> a<00:04:00.180> soccer

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
Flyknit upper works so well on a soccer

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.210 
Flyknit upper works so well on a soccer
shoe<00:04:00.840> platform<00:04:01.530> and<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:01.800> way<00:04:01.920> that<00:04:02.069> they've

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
shoe platform and the way that they've

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.949 
shoe platform and the way that they've
designed<00:04:02.430> this<00:04:02.849> you<00:04:03.269> can<00:04:03.450> tell<00:04:03.630> it<00:04:03.810> was<00:04:03.930> very

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
designed this you can tell it was very

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.500 
designed this you can tell it was very
well<00:04:04.470> thought<00:04:04.800> out<00:04:04.830> and<00:04:05.310> it<00:04:05.670> shows<00:04:05.970> in<00:04:06.269> how<00:04:06.450> the

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
well thought out and it shows in how the

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.140 
well thought out and it shows in how the
shoe<00:04:06.780> fits<00:04:07.140> feels<00:04:07.590> and<00:04:07.890> performs<00:04:08.400> as<00:04:08.730> a<00:04:08.760> whole

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
shoe fits feels and performs as a whole

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.120 
shoe fits feels and performs as a whole
this<00:04:09.630> is<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:09.870> shoe<00:04:10.080> that<00:04:10.290> is<00:04:10.349> great<00:04:10.830> when<00:04:11.040> it

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
this is the shoe that is great when it

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.710 
this is the shoe that is great when it
comes<00:04:11.310> to<00:04:11.430> overall<00:04:11.700> performance<00:04:12.090> but

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
comes to overall performance but

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.750 
comes to overall performance but
certainly<00:04:13.200> isn't<00:04:13.380> for<00:04:13.560> everybody<00:04:13.950> if<00:04:14.340> you're

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
certainly isn't for everybody if you're

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.580 
certainly isn't for everybody if you're
intrigued<00:04:15.239> by<00:04:15.360> the<00:04:15.480> concept<00:04:16.079> you<00:04:16.139> really<00:04:16.410> want

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
intrigued by the concept you really want

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.259 
intrigued by the concept you really want
to<00:04:16.650> try<00:04:16.799> out<00:04:16.889> the<00:04:17.010> fly<00:04:17.220> in<00:04:17.280> an<00:04:17.400> upper<00:04:17.700> and<00:04:17.820> the

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
to try out the fly in an upper and the

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.569 
to try out the fly in an upper and the
mid<00:04:18.419> cut<00:04:18.600> design<00:04:18.930> I<00:04:19.200> would<00:04:19.470> say<00:04:19.709> absolutely<00:04:19.919> go

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
mid cut design I would say absolutely go

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.760 
mid cut design I would say absolutely go
for<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:20.940> magista<00:04:21.209> obrah<00:04:21.780> whereas<00:04:22.440> if<00:04:22.650> you're

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
for the magista obrah whereas if you're

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.200 
for the magista obrah whereas if you're
not<00:04:22.919> a<00:04:22.950> fan<00:04:23.280> of<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.639> looks<00:04:23.820> of<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.030> shoe

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
not a fan of the looks of the shoe

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.940 
not a fan of the looks of the shoe
you're<00:04:24.419> not<00:04:24.540> too<00:04:24.750> crazy<00:04:25.020> about<00:04:25.200> the<00:04:25.530> mid<00:04:25.740> cut

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
you're not too crazy about the mid cut

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.100 
you're not too crazy about the mid cut
design<00:04:26.280> I<00:04:26.550> would<00:04:27.030> probably<00:04:27.300> stay<00:04:27.810> away<00:04:27.840> so

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
design I would probably stay away so

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.960 
design I would probably stay away so
again<00:04:28.410> it's<00:04:28.830> not<00:04:29.010> for<00:04:29.250> everybody<00:04:29.490> but<00:04:29.729> if

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
again it's not for everybody but if

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.400
