00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.670 
you can see here he can go ahead and
sight<00:04:09.760> in<00:04:09.940> on<00:04:10.090> a<00:04:10.120> target<00:04:10.390> and<00:04:10.720> still<00:04:11.410> get<00:04:11.650> that

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
sight in on a target and still get that

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.130 
sight in on a target and still get that
ever<00:04:12.070> crucial<00:04:12.580> cheek<00:04:12.970> weld<00:04:13.210> when<00:04:13.690> when<00:04:14.050> the

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
ever crucial cheek weld when when the

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.380 
ever crucial cheek weld when when the
time<00:04:14.380> for<00:04:14.560> precision<00:04:15.100> marksmanship<00:04:15.550> is<00:04:15.940> more

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
time for precision marksmanship is more

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.210 
time for precision marksmanship is more
important<00:04:16.900> than<00:04:17.200> than<00:04:17.590> something<00:04:17.950> like<00:04:18.070> a

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
important than than something like a

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.670 
important than than something like a
crew-served<00:04:18.549> weapon<00:04:19.320> so<00:04:20.320> there's

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
crew-served weapon so there's

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.680 
crew-served weapon so there's
flexibility<00:04:21.400> in<00:04:21.489> it<00:04:21.700> but<00:04:22.300> there's<00:04:22.480> actually

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
flexibility in it but there's actually

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.710 
flexibility in it but there's actually
some<00:04:23.140> support<00:04:23.920> built<00:04:24.640> into<00:04:24.940> this<00:04:25.060> mask<00:04:25.420> that

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
some support built into this mask that

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.890 
some support built into this mask that
helps<00:04:26.680> it<00:04:26.800> keep<00:04:26.980> its<00:04:27.220> rigidity<00:04:27.760> and<00:04:28.150> help<00:04:28.690> keep

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
helps it keep its rigidity and help keep

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.680 
helps it keep its rigidity and help keep
its<00:04:29.080> form<00:04:29.350> so<00:04:30.040> it's<00:04:30.220> not<00:04:30.370> just<00:04:30.430> a<00:04:30.910> solid<00:04:31.510> piece

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
its form so it's not just a solid piece

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.810 
its form so it's not just a solid piece
of<00:04:32.230> soft<00:04:32.500> armor<00:04:32.890> and<00:04:33.130> it's<00:04:33.250> not<00:04:33.400> a<00:04:33.430> totally

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
of soft armor and it's not a totally

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.370 
of soft armor and it's not a totally
flexible<00:04:34.090> piece<00:04:34.510> of<00:04:34.690> soft<00:04:34.900> armor<00:04:35.200> there's

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
flexible piece of soft armor there's

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.200 
flexible piece of soft armor there's
something<00:04:35.770> there's<00:04:35.950> pieces<00:04:36.220> in<00:04:36.520> there<00:04:36.730> that

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
something there's pieces in there that

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.690 
something there's pieces in there that
that<00:04:37.540> make<00:04:37.780> it<00:04:37.930> hold<00:04:38.200> true<00:04:38.650> to<00:04:38.800> its<00:04:38.950> form<00:04:39.250> but

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
that make it hold true to its form but

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.850 
that make it hold true to its form but
it<00:04:39.790> is<00:04:39.910> flexible<00:04:40.360> enough<00:04:40.600> that<00:04:41.470> you<00:04:41.620> can<00:04:41.740> go

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
it is flexible enough that you can go

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.980 
it is flexible enough that you can go
ahead<00:04:41.980> and<00:04:42.070> acquire<00:04:42.490> a<00:04:42.820> cheek<00:04:43.090> weld<00:04:43.330> and<00:04:43.570> get

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
ahead and acquire a cheek weld and get

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.600 
ahead and acquire a cheek weld and get
that<00:04:44.110> good<00:04:44.350> sight<00:04:44.590> picture<00:04:44.770> side<00:04:45.160> alignment

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
that good sight picture side alignment

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:46.650 
that good sight picture side alignment
when<00:04:45.700> you're<00:04:45.850> trying<00:04:45.970> to<00:04:46.060> do<00:04:46.210> any<00:04:46.360> kind<00:04:46.630> of

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
when you're trying to do any kind of

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.530 
when you're trying to do any kind of
