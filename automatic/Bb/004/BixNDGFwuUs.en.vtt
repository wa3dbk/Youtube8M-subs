00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
it's going to improve his accuracy stock

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.679 
it's going to improve his accuracy stock
that<00:01:05.670> way<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.850> can<00:01:06.000> move<00:01:06.150> quicker<00:01:06.450> while

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
that way you can move quicker while

using<00:01:30.930> toughness<00:01:31.380> which<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.770> gonna<00:01:31.950> allow<00:01:32.189> him

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
using toughness which is gonna allow him

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.520

less flinched when shot at while aiming
down<00:01:34.740> sights<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.280> that's<00:01:35.430> very<00:01:35.640> good<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.000> if

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
down sights so that's very good so if

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.819 
down sights so that's very good so if
he's<00:01:36.299> in<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.509> gunfight<00:01:36.720> with<00:01:36.960> an<00:01:37.110> enemy<00:01:37.259> it's

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
gonna allow him to be more accurate so

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.030 
gonna allow him to be more accurate so
he's<00:01:39.780> just<00:01:39.810> running<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.170> perf<00:01:40.439> 3<00:01:40.680> greed

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
he's just running the perf 3 greed

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.590 
he's just running the perf 3 greed
wildcard<00:01:41.310> allowing<00:01:42.060> him<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.270> take<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.450> long

off<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.570> radar<00:01:45.810> while<00:01:46.020> using<00:01:46.229> XO<00:01:46.619> movements

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
off the radar while using XO movements

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.319 
off the radar while using XO movements
cuz<00:01:47.100> if<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.310> don't<00:01:47.520> have<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.790> perk<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.180> you

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
cuz if you don't have that perk on you

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.210 
cuz if you don't have that perk on you
will<00:01:48.540> be<00:01:48.689> shown<00:01:48.869> on<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.170> radar<00:01:49.439> one<00:01:49.710> using<00:01:49.979> XO

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
will be shown on the radar one using XO

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.319 
will be shown on the radar one using XO
movements<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.700> think<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.210> most

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
movements and I think this is the most

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.850

important<00:01:51.750> perk<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.079> game<00:01:52.290> his<00:01:52.560> EXO

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
important perk in the game his EXO

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.319 
important perk in the game his EXO
abilities<00:01:52.890> gonna<00:01:53.340> be<00:01:53.430> XO<00:01:53.640> overclock<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.240> we

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
abilities gonna be XO overclock that we

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.060 
abilities gonna be XO overclock that we
get<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.630> quick<00:01:54.840> boost<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.320> speed<00:01:55.500> get<00:01:55.860> out<00:01:55.950> of

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
get a quick boost of speed get out of

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.039 
get a quick boost of speed get out of
gunfights<00:01:56.520> if<00:01:56.700> he's<00:01:56.880> like<00:01:57.149> maybe<00:01:57.450> overwhelmed

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
gunfights if he's like maybe overwhelmed

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.420 
gunfights if he's like maybe overwhelmed
by<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.229> amount<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.590> enemies<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.040> get<00:01:59.219> around

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
by the amount of enemies you get around

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.399 
by the amount of enemies you get around
the<00:01:59.520> corner<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.000> set<00:02:00.540> up<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.869> get<00:02:01.020> them<00:02:01.259> maybe

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
the corner and set up to get them maybe

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.870 
the corner and set up to get them maybe
double<00:02:01.799> or<00:02:01.860> triple<00:02:02.040> kill<00:02:02.369> when<00:02:02.579> they<00:02:02.700> come

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
double or triple kill when they come

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.580 
double or triple kill when they come
running<00:02:03.000> around<00:02:03.329> corner<00:02:03.630> looking<00:02:03.840> for<00:02:04.020> him<00:02:04.140> so

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
running around corner looking for him so

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.020 
running around corner looking for him so
obviously<00:02:04.860> that's<00:02:05.100> very<00:02:05.399> good<00:02:05.579> as<00:02:05.700> well<00:02:05.729> as<00:02:05.909> to

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
obviously that's very good as well as to

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.819 
obviously that's very good as well as to
move<00:02:06.180> between<00:02:06.299> objectives<00:02:06.990> quicker<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.350> mean<00:02:07.649> I

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
move between objectives quicker I mean I

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.800 
move between objectives quicker I mean I
personally<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:08.459> use<00:02:08.550> XO<00:02:09.030> overclock<00:02:09.420> on<00:02:09.569> all<00:02:09.690> my

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
personally I use XO overclock on all my

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.089 
personally I use XO overclock on all my
classes<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.319> can<00:02:10.440> just<00:02:10.649> be<00:02:10.709> insanely

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
classes that can just be insanely

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.860 
classes that can just be insanely
helpful<00:02:11.520> so<00:02:12.060> that's<00:02:12.209> what<00:02:12.390> he's<00:02:12.480> using<00:02:12.750> than

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
helpful so that's what he's using than

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.220 
helpful so that's what he's using than
that

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
that

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.350

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.640 
system hack with two extra time modules
equipped<00:02:42.599> that<00:02:42.720> way<00:02:42.989> you<00:02:43.049> can<00:02:43.230> annoy<00:02:43.500> the

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
equipped that way you can annoy the

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.650 
equipped that way you can annoy the
enemies<00:02:44.010> for<00:02:44.190> that<00:02:44.310> much<00:02:44.519> longer<00:02:44.549> I<00:02:45.239> think

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
enemies for that much longer I think

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.699 
enemies for that much longer I think
system<00:02:45.930> hack<00:02:46.079> is<00:02:46.200> probably<00:02:46.440> one<00:02:46.560> of<00:02:46.590> the

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
system hack is probably one of the

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.740 
system hack is probably one of the
better<00:02:46.829> um<00:02:47.129> score<00:02:47.910> streaks<00:02:48.150> in<00:02:48.269> the<00:02:48.360> game<00:02:48.540> as

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
better um score streaks in the game as

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.720 
better um score streaks in the game as
well<00:02:49.200> as<00:02:49.349> he's<00:02:49.500> using<00:02:49.799> the<00:02:49.829> XO<00:02:50.220> disabled

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
well as he's using the XO disabled

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.490 
well as he's using the XO disabled
module<00:02:51.480> which<00:02:51.690> is<00:02:51.840> not<00:02:52.049> going<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.319> allow<00:02:52.440> the

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
module which is not going to allow the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.259 
module which is not going to allow the
enemies<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.129> like<00:02:53.280> boost<00:02:53.579> jump<00:02:53.819> and<00:02:54.090> boost

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
enemies to like boost jump and boost

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:55.940 
enemies to like boost jump and boost
around<00:02:54.599> and<00:02:54.750> stuff<00:02:54.900> like<00:02:55.019> that<00:02:55.079> so<00:02:55.590> obviously

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
around and stuff like that so obviously

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.440 
around and stuff like that so obviously
this<00:02:56.129> is<00:02:56.280> a<00:02:56.340> very<00:02:56.519> very<00:02:56.670> helpful<00:02:56.879> score<00:02:57.269> streak

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
this is a very very helpful score streak

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.300 
this is a very very helpful score streak
so<00:02:57.540> anyway<00:02:57.810> that<00:02:58.230> is<00:02:58.349> the<00:02:58.500> AE<00:02:58.680> for<00:02:59.069> class

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
so anyway that is the AE for class

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.680 
so anyway that is the AE for class
