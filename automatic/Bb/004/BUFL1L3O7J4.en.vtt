Hi All. I'am today on tour again. Nothing special just to sleep in the woods.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:38.000
If you see this video than I have a workung PC with working with working hardware and software. Do not be surprised now when I upload older videos.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I'm sitting here and wait for the food.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It's a beautiful place. I will show you tomorrow because the light was to bad.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
There are lots of animals around here. Beautiful.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Right now the deers are barking.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Good Morning. That was a beautiful night. I show you the overnight setup.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:13.000
You can already see it's a hammock. The tarp is setup "quick and dirty" with bungee cord.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Among the items are wrapped in a Poncho - the backpack and stuff.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Here the sleeping bag.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000
It is very good hidden. It is not easy to see.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:09.000
It is not easy to see. Only the reflection of the tarp. It is well hidden.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:24.000
From the trail you can see nothing. Who has it yet?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:50.000
In fact, it is behind this tree.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Now it is time for breakfast with young spruce tea.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Young spruce needles are not so oily, so here are a just few grease drops. But it tastes well too.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:40.000
I have two more things to the setup.I have checked for fallingbranches. It was windy.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And tree health... Here is a good example. You can see the furrow. They are deer brown. That means tree is growing and is in a good condition.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Guys, that's it. Just a short video. I hope you enjoy it. Bye.
