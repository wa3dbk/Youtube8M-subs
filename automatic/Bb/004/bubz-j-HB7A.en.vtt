in this tutorial we're not going to be
looking<00:00:16.189> at<00:00:16.400> types<00:00:16.670> of<00:00:16.880> guitar<00:00:17.240> but<00:00:17.960> more<00:00:18.230> the

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
looking at types of guitar but more the

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.929 
looking at types of guitar but more the
potential<00:00:18.890> problems<00:00:19.340> you<00:00:19.460> can<00:00:19.640> come<00:00:19.820> across

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
potential problems you can come across

potential problems you can come across
when<00:00:20.330> looking<00:00:20.599> for<00:00:20.750> a<00:00:20.840> guitar<00:00:21.400> these<00:00:22.400> problems

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
when looking for a guitar these problems

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.640 
when looking for a guitar these problems
are<00:00:23.060> more<00:00:23.180> likely<00:00:23.420> to<00:00:23.570> rise<00:00:23.869> with<00:00:24.140> second-hand

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
are more likely to rise with second-hand

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.710 
are more likely to rise with second-hand
guitars<00:00:25.070> however<00:00:25.699> they<00:00:25.880> can<00:00:26.090> occur<00:00:26.360> with<00:00:26.570> new

guitars however they can occur with new

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.930 
guitars however they can occur with new
guitars<00:00:27.110> so<00:00:27.619> look<00:00:27.860> carefully<00:00:28.070> before<00:00:28.520> buying

playability of the guitar the first
thing<00:01:03.260> to<00:01:03.410> look<00:01:03.530> at<00:01:03.710> when<00:01:04.009> inspecting<00:01:04.640> guitars

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
thing to look at when inspecting guitars

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.660 
thing to look at when inspecting guitars
would<00:01:05.390> be<00:01:05.539> the<00:01:05.660> neck<00:01:05.930> this<00:01:06.830> is<00:01:07.039> because<00:01:07.399> the

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
would be the neck this is because the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.340 
would be the neck this is because the
neck<00:01:07.850> is<00:01:08.060> the<00:01:08.090> most<00:01:08.479> likely<00:01:08.899> thing<00:01:09.080> to<00:01:09.229> be

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
neck is the most likely thing to be

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.170 
neck is the most likely thing to be
damaged<00:01:09.740> or<00:01:09.979> to<00:01:10.130> affect<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:10.610> play<00:01:10.850> or<00:01:11.119> the

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
damaged or to affect the play or the

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.570 
damaged or to affect the play or the
sound<00:01:11.539> of<00:01:11.660> the<00:01:11.780> guitar<00:01:11.899> so<00:01:12.740> look<00:01:13.009> at<00:01:13.160> this<00:01:13.310> in

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
sound of the guitar so look at this in

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.260 
sound of the guitar so look at this in
great<00:01:13.910> detail<00:01:13.940> and<00:01:14.660> we<00:01:14.780> gray<00:01:15.020> care<00:01:16.000> the<00:01:17.000> first

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
great detail and we gray care the first

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.210 
great detail and we gray care the first
thing<00:01:17.479> to<00:01:17.630> look<00:01:17.780> for<00:01:18.020> on<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.289> neck<00:01:18.470> is<00:01:18.740> obvious

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
thing to look for on the neck is obvious

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.240 
thing to look for on the neck is obvious
bends<00:01:19.550> and<00:01:19.910> the<00:01:20.840> way<00:01:20.959> to<00:01:21.020> do<00:01:21.289> this<00:01:21.530> is<00:01:21.830> to<00:01:22.100> look

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
bends and the way to do this is to look

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.940 
bends and the way to do this is to look
down<00:01:22.610> the<00:01:22.819> neck<00:01:23.030> from<00:01:23.630> either<00:01:23.869> the<00:01:24.200> body<00:01:24.410> by

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
down the neck from either the body by

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.419 
down the neck from either the body by
the<00:01:25.009> hole<00:01:25.340> or<00:01:25.929> from<00:01:26.929> the<00:01:27.080> headstock<00:01:27.590> looking

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:28.429 
the hole or from the headstock looking

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:31.089 
the hole or from the headstock looking
towards<00:01:28.789> the<00:01:28.970> body<00:01:29.349> looking<00:01:30.349> down<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:30.890> neck

00:01:31.089 --> 00:01:31.099 
towards the body looking down the neck

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:33.249 
towards the body looking down the neck
from<00:01:31.399> either<00:01:31.640> of<00:01:31.880> these<00:01:32.060> angles<00:01:32.509> should<00:01:33.020> make

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
from either of these angles should make

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.160 
from either of these angles should make
a<00:01:33.289> bend<00:01:33.619> fairly<00:01:34.130> clear<00:01:34.429> but<00:01:34.670> if<00:01:35.630> you<00:01:35.780> struggle

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
a bend fairly clear but if you struggle

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.870 
a bend fairly clear but if you struggle
to<00:01:36.200> see<00:01:36.530> if<00:01:36.649> the<00:01:36.800> neck<00:01:37.009> is<00:01:37.039> straight<00:01:37.490> or<00:01:37.670> not

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
to see if the neck is straight or not

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.940 
to see if the neck is straight or not
you<00:01:38.390> can<00:01:38.599> use<00:01:38.630> a<00:01:38.780> straight<00:01:39.170> edge<00:01:39.410> or<00:01:39.590> a<00:01:39.619> ruler

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
you can use a straight edge or a ruler

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.180 
you can use a straight edge or a ruler
to<00:01:40.340> help<00:01:40.550> you<00:01:40.959> slight<00:01:41.959> bends<00:01:42.380> in<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:42.590> neck<00:01:42.800> can

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
to help you slight bends in the neck can

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.249 
to help you slight bends in the neck can
usually<00:01:43.429> be<00:01:43.729> fixed<00:01:44.149> however<00:01:44.720> if<00:01:45.080> you're<00:01:45.229> not

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
usually be fixed however if you're not

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.419 
usually be fixed however if you're not
sure<00:01:45.649> avoid<00:01:46.369> a<00:01:46.399> guitar<00:01:46.940> with<00:01:47.149> a<00:01:47.179> bent<00:01:47.420> neck

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
sure avoid a guitar with a bent neck

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.770 
sure avoid a guitar with a bent neck
another<00:01:49.429> thing<00:01:49.729> to<00:01:49.880> look<00:01:50.000> for<00:01:50.240> at<00:01:50.450> this<00:01:50.660> point

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
another thing to look for at this point

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.669 
another thing to look for at this point
would<00:01:51.349> be<00:01:51.410> a<00:01:51.619> twisted<00:01:52.190> neck<00:01:52.810> now<00:01:53.810> a<00:01:53.840> twist<00:01:54.410> is

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
would be a twisted neck now a twist is

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:57.370 
would be a twisted neck now a twist is
nearly<00:01:55.069> impossible<00:01:55.340> to<00:01:55.819> fix<00:01:56.030> so<00:01:56.810> if<00:01:57.080> you<00:01:57.200> have

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
nearly impossible to fix so if you have

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.660 
nearly impossible to fix so if you have
a<00:01:57.410> guitar<00:01:57.830> with<00:01:58.009> the<00:01:58.039> twisted<00:01:58.489> neck

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
a guitar with the twisted neck

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.339 
a guitar with the twisted neck
definitely<00:01:59.660> avoid<00:01:59.929> it

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:00.349 
definitely avoid it

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:03.249 
definitely avoid it
the<00:02:01.099> way<00:02:01.220> to<00:02:01.280> recognize<00:02:01.759> a<00:02:02.179> twisted<00:02:02.720> neck<00:02:02.959> is

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
the way to recognize a twisted neck is

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.320 
the way to recognize a twisted neck is
to<00:02:03.470> look<00:02:03.649> at<00:02:03.800> the<00:02:03.920> first<00:02:04.099> fret<00:02:04.489> and<00:02:04.789> the<00:02:05.090> last

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
to look at the first fret and the last

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.770 
to look at the first fret and the last
fret<00:02:05.630> or<00:02:05.899> the<00:02:06.590> nut<00:02:06.830> and<00:02:07.069> the<00:02:07.250> last<00:02:07.459> fret<00:02:07.780> if

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
fret or the nut and the last fret if

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.389 
fret or the nut and the last fret if
they<00:02:09.020> aren't<00:02:09.170> parallel<00:02:09.739> with<00:02:09.920> one<00:02:10.099> another

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
they aren't parallel with one another

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.990 
they aren't parallel with one another
then<00:02:10.789> the<00:02:10.910> neck<00:02:11.120> is<00:02:11.300> twisted<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:12.849> next<00:02:13.849> thing

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
then the neck is twisted the next thing

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.179 
then the neck is twisted the next thing
you<00:02:14.120> need<00:02:14.239> to<00:02:14.300> look<00:02:14.510> for<00:02:14.810> is<00:02:14.989> hairline<00:02:15.770> cracks

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:16.189 
you need to look for is hairline cracks

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:19.330 
you need to look for is hairline cracks
in<00:02:16.519> the<00:02:16.879> bindings<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.629> joints<00:02:18.079> you'll<00:02:19.010> find

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
in the bindings and joints you'll find

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.050 
in the bindings and joints you'll find
where<00:02:19.579> the<00:02:19.730> neck<00:02:20.000> joins<00:02:20.480> on<00:02:20.689> to<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:20.959> body

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
where the neck joins on to the body

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.880 
where the neck joins on to the body
and<00:02:22.180> where<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.599> bindings<00:02:23.140> join<00:02:23.470> onto<00:02:23.680> the

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
and where the bindings join onto the

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.949 
and where the bindings join onto the
body<00:02:24.099> these<00:02:24.670> are<00:02:24.910> places<00:02:25.150> where<00:02:25.510> they<00:02:25.690> crack

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
body these are places where they crack

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.650 
body these are places where they crack
commonly<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:26.739> it's<00:02:27.250> not<00:02:27.459> obvious<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:27.910> see<00:02:28.270> you

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
commonly and it's not obvious to see you

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.270 
commonly and it's not obvious to see you
have<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:28.840> look<00:02:29.050> very<00:02:29.319> carefully<00:02:29.590> along<00:02:30.040> all

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
have to look very carefully along all

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.910 
have to look very carefully along all
the<00:02:30.459> bindings<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.810> bindings<00:02:32.200> also<00:02:32.380> go<00:02:32.800> around

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
the bindings the bindings also go around

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.070 
the bindings the bindings also go around
the<00:02:33.310> body<00:02:33.489> so<00:02:34.090> you<00:02:34.150> need<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.569> look<00:02:34.720> there<00:02:34.930> as

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
the body so you need to look there as

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.220 
the body so you need to look there as
well<00:02:35.430> another<00:02:36.430> place<00:02:36.730> is<00:02:36.970> normal<00:02:37.569> joints<00:02:38.050> on

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
well another place is normal joints on

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.740 
well another place is normal joints on
an<00:02:39.069> older<00:02:39.370> guitar<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.880> glue<00:02:40.150> can<00:02:40.390> become

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
an older guitar the glue can become

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.839 
an older guitar the glue can become
brittle<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.380> you<00:02:41.800> get<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.010> hairline<00:02:42.489> cracks

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
brittle and you get a hairline cracks

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.880 
brittle and you get a hairline cracks
along<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.330> joints<00:02:43.690> these<00:02:44.260> can<00:02:44.530> be<00:02:44.620> very

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
along the joints these can be very

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.800 
along the joints these can be very
difficult<00:02:45.160> to<00:02:45.430> repair<00:02:45.849> so<00:02:46.390> they're<00:02:46.630> worth

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
difficult to repair so they're worth

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
strings out of the way so you can see

the frets clearly and then you get a

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.110 
the frets clearly and then you get a
better<00:03:44.739> idea<00:03:44.920> of<00:03:45.310> what<00:03:45.459> sort<00:03:45.790> of<00:03:45.880> condition

they're<00:03:46.510> in<00:03:47.519> you<00:03:48.519> can<00:03:48.700> get<00:03:48.850> a<00:03:48.880> good<00:03:49.120> idea<00:03:49.180> of

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
they're in you can get a good idea of

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.690 
they're in you can get a good idea of
the<00:03:49.810> playability<00:03:50.290> and<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:51.040> condition<00:03:51.459> of<00:03:51.579> the

can<00:05:42.010> have<00:05:42.190> a<00:05:42.220> severe<00:05:42.670> impacts<00:05:43.120> on<00:05:43.330> the<00:05:43.450> way<00:05:43.570> the

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
can have a severe impacts on the way the

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.870 
can have a severe impacts on the way the
guitar<00:05:43.810> plays<00:05:44.350> it<00:05:45.220> will<00:05:45.430> affect<00:05:45.760> the

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
guitar plays it will affect the

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.990 
guitar plays it will affect the
intonation<00:05:46.210> and<00:05:46.750> the<00:05:46.930> action<00:05:47.260> of<00:05:47.380> the<00:05:47.470> strings

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
intonation and the action of the strings

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.730 
intonation and the action of the strings
to<00:05:49.000> recognize<00:05:49.510> this<00:05:49.690> problem<00:05:49.900> what<00:05:50.380> you're

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
to recognize this problem what you're

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.440 
to recognize this problem what you're
looking<00:05:51.040> for<00:05:51.250> is<00:05:51.460> evidence<00:05:51.970> of<00:05:52.090> the<00:05:52.240> body

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
looking for is evidence of the body

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.550 
looking for is evidence of the body
distorting<00:05:53.410> and<00:05:53.650> warping<00:05:54.130> around<00:05:54.610> the<00:05:54.760> bridge

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
distorting and warping around the bridge

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.140 
distorting and warping around the bridge
usually<00:05:56.560> the<00:05:57.040> body<00:05:57.250> should<00:05:57.370> be<00:05:57.550> completely

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
usually the body should be completely

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.990 
usually the body should be completely
flat<00:05:58.270> at<00:05:58.570> this<00:05:58.720> point<00:05:59.020> on<00:05:59.230> the<00:05:59.470> soundboard

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
flat at this point on the soundboard

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.630 
flat at this point on the soundboard
however<00:06:01.000> if<00:06:01.330> it<00:06:01.720> sinks<00:06:02.140> in<00:06:02.320> usually<00:06:03.190> this<00:06:03.460> is

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
however if it sinks in usually this is

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.900 
however if it sinks in usually this is
evidence<00:06:04.120> of<00:06:04.300> subsidence<00:06:04.750> on<00:06:05.170> the<00:06:05.350> bridge<00:06:05.910> you

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:06.910 
evidence of subsidence on the bridge you

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.880 
evidence of subsidence on the bridge you
can<00:06:07.090> see<00:06:07.270> in<00:06:07.390> this<00:06:07.510> bridge<00:06:07.780> pictured<00:06:08.290> the<00:06:08.680> body

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890 
can see in this bridge pictured the body

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.800 
can see in this bridge pictured the body
is<00:06:09.070> completely<00:06:09.610> flat<00:06:09.820> and<00:06:10.150> therefore<00:06:10.660> it's

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
is completely flat and therefore it's

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.710 
is completely flat and therefore it's
alright<00:06:11.580> the<00:06:12.580> other<00:06:12.610> components<00:06:13.420> on<00:06:13.570> the

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
alright the other components on the

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.330 
alright the other components on the
tailpiece<00:06:14.200> are<00:06:14.650> the<00:06:15.310> pegs<00:06:15.610> and<00:06:15.940> the<00:06:16.000> bridge

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
tailpiece are the pegs and the bridge

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.710 
tailpiece are the pegs and the bridge
these<00:06:18.340> are<00:06:18.520> pretty<00:06:18.730> straightforward<00:06:18.970> and

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
these are pretty straightforward and

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.360 
these are pretty straightforward and
usually<00:06:20.140> made<00:06:20.290> of<00:06:20.440> plastic<00:06:20.950> or<00:06:21.130> something

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
usually made of plastic or something

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.090 
usually made of plastic or something
similar<00:06:21.940> so<00:06:22.150> you<00:06:22.540> can<00:06:22.930> see<00:06:23.140> it<00:06:23.290> is<00:06:23.440> any<00:06:23.620> splits

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:24.100 
similar so you can see it is any splits

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.320 
similar so you can see it is any splits
or<00:06:24.370> cracks<00:06:24.910> or<00:06:25.260> pieces<00:06:26.260> missing<00:06:27.150> one<00:06:28.150> of<00:06:28.180> the

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
or cracks or pieces missing one of the

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.000 
or cracks or pieces missing one of the
things<00:06:28.570> you<00:06:28.750> tend<00:06:29.020> to<00:06:29.080> find<00:06:29.350> with<00:06:29.740> older

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.010 
things you tend to find with older

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.310 
things you tend to find with older
guitars<00:06:30.400> is<00:06:30.640> that<00:06:31.120> the<00:06:31.240> pegs<00:06:31.510> either<00:06:31.930> have

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.320 
guitars is that the pegs either have

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.370 
guitars is that the pegs either have
damaged<00:06:33.160> one<00:06:33.880> or<00:06:34.060> two<00:06:34.240> missing<00:06:34.570> or<00:06:34.900> they're

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:35.380 
damaged one or two missing or they're

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.370 
damaged one or two missing or they're
just<00:06:35.590> not<00:06:35.830> a<00:06:35.890> matching<00:06:36.400> set<00:06:36.900> this<00:06:37.900> isn't<00:06:38.260> an

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:38.380 
just not a matching set this isn't an

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.010 
just not a matching set this isn't an
issue<00:06:38.560> because<00:06:39.100> a<00:06:39.190> complete<00:06:39.760> set<00:06:40.180> of<00:06:40.210> pegs<00:06:40.720> is

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 
issue because a complete set of pegs is

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.260 
issue because a complete set of pegs is
only<00:06:41.410> very<00:06:41.650> cheap<00:06:42.100> and<00:06:42.310> you<00:06:42.970> can<00:06:43.120> easily

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.270 
only very cheap and you can easily

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.130 
only very cheap and you can easily
replace<00:06:43.720> them<00:06:44.110> when<00:06:44.410> replacing<00:06:44.710> the<00:06:44.980> strings

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:46.140 
replace them when replacing the strings

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.920 
replace them when replacing the strings
by<00:06:46.710> far<00:06:47.010> the<00:06:47.310> best<00:06:47.550> way<00:06:47.730> to<00:06:47.760> judge<00:06:48.150> if<00:06:48.420> a<00:06:48.540> guitar

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:48.930 
by far the best way to judge if a guitar

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.050 
by far the best way to judge if a guitar
is<00:06:49.140> any<00:06:49.320> good<00:06:49.590> or<00:06:49.770> not<00:06:49.800> is<00:06:50.130> to<00:06:50.430> actually<00:06:50.580> play

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 
is any good or not is to actually play

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.750 
is any good or not is to actually play
it<00:06:51.240> and<00:06:51.420> get<00:06:51.900> a<00:06:51.930> feel<00:06:52.200> for<00:06:52.230> it<00:06:52.680> and<00:06:52.770> get<00:06:53.460> used<00:06:53.670> to

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:53.760 
it and get a feel for it and get used to

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.240 
it and get a feel for it and get used to
the<00:06:53.820> sound<00:06:54.210> if<00:06:55.170> you<00:06:55.230> can't<00:06:55.560> play<00:06:55.830> it<00:06:56.010> because

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.250 
the sound if you can't play it because

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.790 
the sound if you can't play it because
it's<00:06:56.430> got<00:06:56.610> no<00:06:56.640> strings<00:06:57.060> or<00:06:57.300> broken<00:06:57.750> strings<00:06:58.080> it

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 
it's got no strings or broken strings it

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.710 
it's got no strings or broken strings it
really<00:06:59.340> is<00:06:59.490> a<00:06:59.520> risk<00:06:59.880> whether<00:07:00.180> you<00:07:00.330> should<00:07:00.390> buy

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 
really is a risk whether you should buy

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.890 
really is a risk whether you should buy
it<00:07:00.750> or<00:07:01.050> not<00:07:01.850> however<00:07:02.850> if<00:07:03.090> it<00:07:03.210> is<00:07:03.360> possible<00:07:03.600> to

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900 
it or not however if it is possible to

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.900 
it or not however if it is possible to

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:05.910 
play the guitar look over it thoroughly

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.930 
play the guitar look over it thoroughly
and<00:07:06.330> then<00:07:06.780> play<00:07:07.020> for<00:07:07.350> awhile<00:07:07.520> by<00:07:08.520> this<00:07:08.580> time

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:08.940
