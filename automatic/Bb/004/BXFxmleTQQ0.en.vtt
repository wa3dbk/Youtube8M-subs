 Martin's room we had 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.900
 idea of ​​what was happening touched the 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.279
 Martino door opened then no 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.990

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:45.970
 been all they are simply 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:48.100
 residents of the property understands me 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.690
 then the property has three floors 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.600
 if I'm not mistaken they live in one of 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:57.040
 the plants mister martín belaunde was 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:01.320
 another one of the plants so the 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:04.960
 Peru 's government has arranged to 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.600
 interpol peru does not reiterate the validity of 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.750
 the international search order and 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.530
 capture in border areas and at the 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.530
 international 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:21.780
 the warning mechanisms have been activated 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.920
 to interpol the red lord to make it 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.110
 learned anywhere that 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.460
 find is a Peruvian citizen and for 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.979
 of course all the mechanisms that 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.979
 correspond to the public prosecutor 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.810
 as dense as it would have been 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.760
 I start expelling Martin Belaunde as 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.979
 was done at the time for example as 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.979
 orellana and in colombia and they gave us notice 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.469
 I love 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:01.280
 we have pending 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.350
 it's a disorienting tactic from 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.450
 your information towards public opinion 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.739
 it's not true I thought that at the time 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:13.330
 that has escaped to that has gotten worse 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.330
 well your situation and doubts 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.550
 friends very good night that's the 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.629
 face of martín belaunde at the moment 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.680
 in which he has been captured in the 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.110
 municipality of Magdalena 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.300
 Beni photographs 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.459
 have been taken by their captors by 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.410
 the police themselves at the time of 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.870
 show that it obviously happened with 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.480
 the most wanted man by the peru 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.980
 and that he had been declared a fugitive 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.879
 of justice for that country as well as 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:06.099
 also escaped in national territory 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:08.260
 photographs where the police complied 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:10.120
 thoroughness with the mandate of the president 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.310
 evo morals indicated and by the own 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.810
 government minister and that demonstrates 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.940
 also the effectiveness with which the 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.709
 police had to find this person 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.870
 the armed forces guarded the 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.400
 border and prevented that martín belaunde 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.650
 escape from national territory and 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.140
 lead to another country your goal seemed 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.090
 be brazil now we can show these 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.129
 photographs and confirm that 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.030
