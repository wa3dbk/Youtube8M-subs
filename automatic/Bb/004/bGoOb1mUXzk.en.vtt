00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.210
 do not 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:17.060
 it's about a good way because this 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:18.650
 mode is the animal mode as 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.180
 they could see in the title of the video and 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.550
 Well, as you can see, we are from 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.610
 animals apologize if these animals are 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:29.540
 come with textures as well as bullads is 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:32.809
 because when loading it again it is that in 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:35.239
 his being is with green figures and good 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.399
 because that is where the error occurs and how 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.870
 you can see here are all spa 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.190
 although later I'm going to teach I do not know 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:46.090
 find in a survival 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.620
 in Asia and creative appear alone or 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.050
 that is to say in the world with will appear 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.519
 naturally but if you want them 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.280
 can grab the creative as I am 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:56.350
 doing right now this cake does not want 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.129
 go out here, well, this one of the 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.510
 turtle will see there there we are as 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.699
 can see in the opening I thought 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:08.009
 pretty good and here is someone ant and 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:10.630
 in front of the turtle and this variety of 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:13.570
 what would be animals and well then 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.780
 also as men of the cave 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.729
 Iceman like this is pretty 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.420
 complete as you see is the fish and how 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:24.700
 we can find here the blocks of 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.280
 heifers here we will be able to find 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.890
 I work like a lot of spams 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.659
 as you can see the mont crocodile ski 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:37.360
 the turtle the fish the cockroach the 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.460
 woman and then estrada also brings birds 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.940
 It can be said that there was no way 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.290
 brought like some butterflies or bees and 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.770
 as you can see here is the chicken 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.080
 in this is a snake let's see her 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.270
 As you can see, it's quite created, it's good 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.680
 created the snake we had never 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.680
 had a snake in huancas little of 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.630
 said then this man here is going to 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.490
 put the other snake that is this 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.930
 green color and good clear for 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.930
 attack them we will kill you 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.590
 a butterfly 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.340
 there it goes flying is well created and 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.730
 Well, we are going to join many 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.980
 animals in the world this is the spider in 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.010
 the ant's throat and this is the 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.010
 cockroach are quite similar 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.410
 as they run a little bit more and good 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.940
 so let's put the last ones that are 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.480
 here 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:42.640
 the other leaves me let's see why 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.440
 we are in the giraffe 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.810
 and the giraffe are going to put that I like 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.580
 I was quite a bit I'm going to teach 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.430
 the legs but good as they see the 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.590
 height is igualito could say it was 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.180
 Real is that because the cow is venturo 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.850
 charge again the new world of entering 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.550
 again to the world is configured what 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:04.180
 would be the textures and go back to as 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.709
 do or it gets damaged then that 's where 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.580
 you have to fix it but how can 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.580
 to know
