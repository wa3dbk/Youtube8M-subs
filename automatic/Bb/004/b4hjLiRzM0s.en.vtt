00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.779
 take the easy way is already more than 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.510
 forgotten by the path of life I 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.820
 I'm walking many I chose two 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.119
 simple instructor I won this 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.640
 race which winner horse of the small 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.340
 I liked to fly like a peter to play 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.829
 in evil hours and afraid to go back to 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.559
 stumble over the same stone when you stop 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.739
 dream and have that nothing was real to 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.140
 wake up I get out of bed without a 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.680
 new in the portfolio I shit on the bitch 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.590
 this shit despair waits for the bus in 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.440
 the back stop and you'll say you do not have 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.690
 nothing and you will not enter I have a minute this 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.300
 I'll tell you again if I do not 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.270
 you understand bud I can sum it up 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.550
 writing a shit I do this 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.640
 so for you to listen to it and what 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.860
 can you feel looking at me in the mirror 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.369
 I have found again looking at the 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.590
 eyes not knowing what to do this time I was 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.960
 waiting to see me again 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.810
 she is the chosen one that does not release her 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.689
 It tells me the truth is impossible to believe 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.390
 that in a few years your rap will be 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:26.060
 invisible also told me that I would be 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.119
 invincible but I 'm at that time 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.490
 that's really amazing I take a flight 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.409
 towards the past that has passed the past 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.319
 closest is the one that has not yet happened 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.689
 the past in the end wanting to go back to 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:40.759
 gone but they say that I'm dumb by 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.250
 say what I have thought and take the 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.430
 lost path is more than forgotten by 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.800
 the meaning of life 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.830
 I am walking many that I have held 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.020
 and without sweat I win is in the race which 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.880
 winner horse 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.880
 I do not like to talk like 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:05.350
 to stumble over the same stone stops 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.270
 dream and have very real when waking up 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.300
 the alarm clock is the time to 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.660
 get up all this has been a dream or 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.750
 what did you think this is empty and I've done 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.720
 a disaster has breakfast dressing and 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.990
 combing in the mind of a child all 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.090
 sounds easy care can be broken that 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.760
 it is very fragile to say things that are cool 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.620
 It was never difficult and now it will come 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.620
 criticize me some imbecile
