 how to restore nails after gel polish 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.860
 First we remove the unnecessary length and 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.130
 grind the nail plate do it 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.529

 put this procedure on the first item 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.510
 I recommend nail care 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.730
 use a ceramic file because 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.730
 she least and injure her nails

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.590

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.770
