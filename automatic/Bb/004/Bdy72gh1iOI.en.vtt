00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
to tell when something's fake unless

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.540

it's<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.320> super<00:00:37.620> fake<00:00:37.860> but<00:00:38.219> that's<00:00:38.910> why<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.090> had<00:00:39.329> a

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
it's a super fake but that's why I had a
