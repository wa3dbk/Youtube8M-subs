 Let's start by taking this little 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.410
 fabric that will be the pattern of 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.390
 required 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.980
 we understand with a continent that 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.980
 we passed a straight seam 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.790
 This model is very simple, we are going 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.190
 for the cypher we then position the people 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.440
 turned up and surrender we put in the 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.530
 book and then the fabric of the print 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.890
 right with the right and there we put 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.170
 pins and aligned and your machine 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.790
 with the common cause is the 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.729
 time to play for the decisive match 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:32.080
 as it is very simple gives only raised the 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:37.090
 van had and put is ready 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.470
 we passed a culture well people are 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.409
 ready the first part 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.390
 now we will do the same thing but it is 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.850
 It's always good that you open 12 to see if 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.290
 it's okay and now we'll make the 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.590
 same thing 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:57.390
 Viper lining and stamping 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.390
 we aligned and culture 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.890
 we draw and we will turn this 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:11.030
 part and stamp this stamp of a 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.840
 son we are going to turn it looks like it already 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.840
 it's cute 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.350
 before you turn i forgot to talk 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.450
 but it's good for you to spend a 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.990
 each side to look pretty cute 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.990
 rendered 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.860
 Now, we're going to turn around. 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.959
 lining 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.510
 Let's get it right for you. 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.130
 do not get any down from the place 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.200
 Let's spend a line culture in 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.480
 sides and an inch or so 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.270
 but you can calculate how you order forests 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.610
 and in addition to letting the zipper open up 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.610
 half will not forget this time 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:11.580
 we are going to report a process 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.010
 that we will open it so that it stays 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.160
 for one of the same as I am doing in the 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.520
 video and we're going to kill I scored two 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.950
 centimeters and I became legally 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.070
 Flemish know much less are having the 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.450
 Straight company seen in the 4 continuous 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.180
 this will make her with more 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.700
 more gang and this is the 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.800
 The end result is that nowadays 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.750
 You 're new to the channel or new to the world. 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.160
