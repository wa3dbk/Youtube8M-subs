00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.280
 beginners are getting younger and younger 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.980
 they're getting more and more 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.420
 at least at the university bonn therefore gives 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.910
 it is now almost all 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.490
 study courses preliminary courses that are first 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.310
 exercises information and tasks 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.380
 the beginning of the semester time ago what 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.720
 Courses in all study subjects 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.000
 explains studies manager vera heckel 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.220
 no matter if in mathematics focus chemistry 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.510
 pre-course or a writing workshop the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.309
 freshmen can do theirs 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.410
 different levels of knowledge 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.640
 level 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.770
 you already have the opportunity 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.540
 to orientate in advance at the university 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.530
 and an impression of university 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.690
 to live 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.760
 and important to us also that even 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.559
 Social contacts take place among the young 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.360
 people can get to know each other first 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.760
 All of this creates a whole 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.530
 familiar atmosphere and makes it easier 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.899
 transition from school or education 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.879
 Add study for some subjects like that 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.829
 Chemistry and economics 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.850
 Medicine has been around before courses 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.160
 some years 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.170
 We tried this focus program 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.610
 also in cooperation actually with 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.229
 to shape the subjects and there 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.920
 can then out that's actually one 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.960
 wide range of compartments is the one at the 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.930
 university such preliminary courses for 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.939
 necessary to keep the learning climate is from 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.820
 small groups of coined tutors and 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.689
 tutors are even students from the same 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.939
 these subjects 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.439
 they know exactly what is important 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.970
 i was studying last year 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.710
 started and I had those too 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.939
 possibility to attend courses 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.680
 I have to say chemistry has me very much 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.970
 brought a lot and that was for me too 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.110
 the decision-relevant would mean 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.000
 like to pass on and then in 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.040
 coming year itself will be there yes 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.840
 which I really totally second now 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.070
 Great is when I am here on the 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.390
 the first day I have really sit down 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.710
 do not even trust the tasks 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.090
 really to go it alone and 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.860
 you yourself to try a bill 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.360
 then really in a few days 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.740
 In the situation the tasks are independent 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.939
 to work out then really on the 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.049
 I have to get the right results 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.060
 say that is really great 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.110
 feeling as a tutor when you see how much 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.060
 you really in the short time 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.860
 can reach the fresh in the people 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.899
 enrolled bachelor students are 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.290
 Glad to visit before heading to 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.780
 can 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.030
 before that was actually pretty 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.950
 I would say confusion and so on 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.050
 a little bit one stands out from the big nothing 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.540
 and now it's better if you do 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.380
 just a little bit of insight 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.700
 which comes to one at all and 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.160
 what you are studying at all so 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.780
 must adjust and also more security 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.000
 How to handle texts at all 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.440
 in the meantime, many of them are new students 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.690
 Specialties in the middle of studies 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.690
 arrived you already notice the effect 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.720
 the preliminary courses yes we have in many 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.490
 Courses are being made senate women around 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.670
 in the sense of saying one 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.230
 quality control and those the 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.300
 these courses were searched 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.510
 actually very satisfied 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.510
 in order to
