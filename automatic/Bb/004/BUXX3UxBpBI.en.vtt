00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210

 aubin on others for a new video 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.870
 resale purchase 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.790
 good already I would like you a little bit 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.380
 apologize for the lack of videos in this 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.610
 series 1 it's a bit because of them we're going 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.500
 to finally say I put the blame you laughed 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.359
 but good because of bahia more 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.980
 web applications of the coup it becomes 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.300
 really very complicated to do the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.939
 sales flesh and I really struggled 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.230
 with the console so that's it 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.449
 just to tell you what it is 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.710
 really boring and then it disturbs me 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.670
 a little bit since I'm not used to it 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.060
 to make the insured sale on the 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.099
 console 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.260
 I'm I'm more on 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.370
 the web application what dombasle in all 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.690
 case we will simply continue in 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.070
 this work this adventure 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.800
 we continue with the same technique with 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.239
 from the diane's nmdc you will see that I have 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.219
 that I also bought a lot of 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.410
 players fit and players 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.870
 team of the season so we have for example 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.410
 still a henrik who in defensive 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.780
 central 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.160
 that day I had never changed 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.840
 in fact they were he is in the middle 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.860
 central is actually he had no in 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.329
 central defensive middle 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.010
 I told myself that but we will try a 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.230
 we are going to buy omc 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.789
 then we will buy the card mcm deaths 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.280
 oval transform we'll see we'll see 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.990
 if he will sell in milk in 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.979
 the previous episode here sold I'm 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.030
 I am told we will do what we share 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.250
 how also simply and we 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.950
 will see if these two other enrique 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.270
 is worth going then we have a winner or 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.509
 a vibrator I do not really know how 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.159
 said that I got 5100 credit so 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.930
 I checked his price it was worth about 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.759
 1.8 credit so I'll try 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.590
 to sell them to 7500 credit if I 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.630
 not deceive here we are what will do 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.070
 is going to say 2000 criticizes profits to little 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.750
 near so what is pretty good and 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.939
 then we have a great deal that I have 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.140
 chopped while the locks that is 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.329
 unlocked a little bit you know when 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.049
 there is a maintenance and servers that he 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.030
 close 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.130
 and ben if you bet on a 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.750
 player and ben can bet 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.009
 on your behalf since the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.420
 servers they are they are closed 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.750
 so that's the way it is 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.220
 I had on this arm tons to 1100 credit 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.020
 and you will see that I could have 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.579
 sell to one just say on the market 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.560
 cost about 15,000 credit I could have 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.409
 sell it at around 13000 14000 credit 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.299
 but to be sure of milk sold at 11000 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.590
 credit if I'm not mistaken as the 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.229
 see on the screen I was trying to actually 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.579
 find out how much it's going to serve that 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.810
 to nothing because the waiters he was 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.250
 really disgusting was really 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.020
 it was really 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.720
 boring to look for the players it's this 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.100
 hallucinating to see duty to see this to 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.140
 What the server like this that only works 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.120
 is not anything that is more 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.350
 it's annoying it's boring and then that 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.520
 it blocks me we'll say a little bit the 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.780
 series and then that's it for that 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.460
 Besides, I did not leave 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.590
 a lot of videos in his shots and I 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.850
 I wanted to apologize so here we are 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.860
 still aching a very good deal 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.870
 with this braaten 1100 credit we're going 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.870
 resell at 11,000 credit if I'm wrong 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.730
 not so at first I see there I tried 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.800
 to know at what price they were 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.720
 even in the final Thursday sold to millas 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.340
 11000 credit so good it's still 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.690
 ten thousand profit credit has like 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.070
 you see it he went straight 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.739
 I could have put a little more expensive 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.700
 so here we end with 32 me of 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.170
 credit we still have a lot of 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.790
 players to spare hope that the 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.140
 most will sell themselves especially the tos 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.910
 and you will see that they have 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.940
 heard we come back a little bit more 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.140
 late there as usual a gc to catch 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.660
 another braathen unfortunately he is 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.980
 gone to 9300 credit good me I got 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.450
 said it was not worth it saw that a 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.590
 moment has cost about ten thousand 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.930
 credit since they had dropped to 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.970
 price level the sail has resold no2 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.830
 hendrick mdc we still did not 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.550
 wrong to create profits lived with 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.700
 his two enrique 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.680
 we also sold cresswell so 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.980
 cresswell who is we had bought I 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.200
 believe in 40000 credit coin so we have a 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.239
 returned to 46500 credit which is rather 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.739
 not bad I kept about after the 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.060
 after the tax, I saw that we have to count 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.709
 the tax does not remind you to count 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.540
 the tax is important touax did 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.280
 about 4000 credit of profits if I 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.600
 do not deceive me so it's pretty good 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.730
 I want to tell you the jirs 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.470
 such a small arm and I left 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.390
 also search once you are the 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.829
 days after that I went to get 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.510
 on the market unfortunately as you 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.840
 know the low market is that of the 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.340
 shit 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.709
 in addition I think I will not 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.000
 to make profits on sun on this 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.040
 Braathen that I caught in mcr 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.959
 normally he in mdc unfortunately 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.760
 with all the teams of 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.840
 season coming out on Wednesdays all 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.519
 the new packs all the new ones 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.040
 special pack on the part of tickets all 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.600
 it's not all prisons drop all where 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.970
 the prices I lost a lot a lot of 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.170
 credits even on my main account the 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.489
 convent so here I will try to 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.290
 resell at 14,000 credit but hey you 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.850
 worry it will not sell again and 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.980
 there as I wanted to say when the 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.970
 servers are there they are they are and this is 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.980
 are closed they left in 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.169
 maintenance balls chopped in excellent 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.669
 an excellent deal with with secret either 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.239
 she that I beat 14000 credit while 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.310
 on the market 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.830
 it was worth about 40 miles 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.919
 it's about that I'm not wrong 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.720
 maybe maybe 25,000 credit of 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.370
 benefits pretty much so that's really 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.690
 huge here it's really not bad what 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.580
 will allow us to arrive virtually 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.200
 to 100 thousand Christians 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.120
 yeah almost 100 miles credible 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.160
 we are at 78 credit so I'm going 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.180
 try to resell so you'll see 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.980
 the v6 to resell it a first time 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.600
 so it was a little weird 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.270
 I had seen a 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.669
 cresswell with shadow style at 39.8 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.930
 credit with 1 with four years he was going 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.820
 leave to try a pile credit of the coup 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.500
 I mine I loved him 30000 credit he 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.139
 was not going away so I put them a 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:58.500
 second time this time to 35000's 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.760
 departure and 40000 of immediate purchase price 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.590
 and you will see who it is a sold 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.000
 directly to 40000 credit what was 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.490
 a little weird I want you 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.229
 to tell him who had not gone to 38 38 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.970
 thousand credit he left to 40000 creed 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.020
 good I was a little bit weird ago 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.940
 days like that as a child 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.490
 finally short so here we go 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:19.200
 continue in alex nmdc that i have been to 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:20.580
 650 credit and this little roméo that I have 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.190
 unfortunately makes a big mistake 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.690
 to buy it during 100000 packs 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.300
 convent credit the album cost about 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.880
 10000 credit from below no 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.140
 profits but to love malice I am 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.960
 not if it's said I pass he said like 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.400
 that we will lose a lot of credit from 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.229
 blow it's going to delay us a little bit 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.030
 east on 1000 credits what's all 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:39.660
 simply finally we'll end up 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.580
 very soon 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.870

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.000

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.490
 charente on the console any case 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.229
