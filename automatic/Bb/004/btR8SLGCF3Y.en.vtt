00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.360 

okay<00:00:01.079> let<00:00:01.410> me<00:00:01.680> continue<00:00:02.310> with<00:00:02.970> my<00:00:03.360> point<00:00:04.370> the

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
okay let me continue with my point the

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.209 
okay let me continue with my point the
technology<00:00:06.240> has<00:00:06.270> developed<00:00:07.309> into<00:00:08.309> such<00:00:09.179> state

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:10.219 
technology has developed into such state

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:16.010 
technology has developed into such state
that<00:00:11.219> there<00:00:11.700> is<00:00:11.880> less<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.990> less<00:00:13.889> demand<00:00:15.020> for

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
that there is less and less demand for

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.540 
that there is less and less demand for
workers<00:00:17.390> for<00:00:18.390> human<00:00:19.580> labor<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:22.220> you<00:00:23.220> see

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
workers for human labor and you see

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.790 
workers for human labor and you see
there<00:00:25.519> there<00:00:26.519> are<00:00:26.730> machines<00:00:27.029> can<00:00:27.720> do<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.470> many

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
there there are machines can do so many

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:36.319 
there there are machines can do so many
things<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:33.290> after<00:00:34.290> all<00:00:34.559> what<00:00:35.550> we<00:00:35.880> are<00:00:36.030> trying

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
things and after all what we are trying

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:45.860 
things and after all what we are trying
to<00:00:36.600> do<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:38.219> make<00:00:40.670> less<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.000> less<00:00:44.870> human

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
to do is to make less and less human

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.270 
to do is to make less and less human
labor<00:00:47.120> right<00:00:48.120> we<00:00:48.600> developed<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.950> cash

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
labor right we developed the cash

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.520 
labor right we developed the cash
machine<00:00:51.500> so<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:53.840> you<00:00:54.840> do<00:00:54.989> not<00:00:55.020> need<00:00:55.469> to

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
machine so that you do not need to

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:04.870 
machine so that you do not need to
calculate<00:00:56.870> and<00:01:01.820> and<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.000> vending<00:01:03.449> machine

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
calculate and and the vending machine

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:13.880 
calculate and and the vending machine
anyway<00:01:06.140> I<00:01:08.720> cannot<00:01:09.720> name<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.590> lot<00:01:10.890> but<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:13.500> fact

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
anyway I cannot name a lot but the fact

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:22.219 
anyway I cannot name a lot but the fact
is<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:16.580> we<00:01:17.580> are<00:01:17.610> no<00:01:18.210> longer<00:01:19.040> needed<00:01:20.930> we<00:01:21.930> are

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
is that we are no longer needed we are

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:30.080 
is that we are no longer needed we are
no<00:01:22.860> longer<00:01:24.380> in<00:01:25.380> demand<00:01:27.950> this<00:01:28.950> word<00:01:29.310> does<00:01:30.060> not

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
no longer in demand this word does not

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.760 
no longer in demand this word does not
need<00:01:30.720> us<00:01:31.820> to<00:01:33.380> survive<00:01:35.060> this<00:01:36.060> word<00:01:36.420> can<00:01:37.409> very

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
need us to survive this word can very

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.510 
need us to survive this word can very
well<00:01:37.979> leave<00:01:38.930> very<00:01:39.930> good<00:01:41.060> without<00:01:42.060> us<00:01:43.369> it<00:01:44.369> is

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
well leave very good without us it is

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.570 
well leave very good without us it is
hard<00:01:44.880> to

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:02:01.590 

it<00:01:51.120> is<00:01:51.360> hard<00:01:51.690> to<00:01:52.700> swallow<00:01:53.750> this<00:01:54.750> but

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.980 

such<00:02:02.290> is<00:02:02.320> life<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:06.759> is<00:02:06.939> not<00:02:07.210> symmetric

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
such is life this is not symmetric

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:20.920 
such is life this is not symmetric
cutter

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:03:39.809 

I'm<00:02:21.469> sorry<00:02:21.980> lost<00:02:22.760> my

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819
