so<00:00:09.900> this<00:00:10.139> is<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.260> typical<00:00:10.410> bell<00:00:10.800> siphon<00:00:11.040> except

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
so this is a typical bell siphon except

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.919 
so this is a typical bell siphon except
everything<00:00:11.880> is<00:00:11.969> clear<00:00:12.300> in<00:00:12.480> order<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.750> see

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
everything is clear in order to see

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.299 
everything is clear in order to see
what's<00:00:13.080> going<00:00:13.290> on<00:00:13.440> when<00:00:13.860> you're<00:00:13.920> looking<00:00:14.160> at<00:00:14.280> a

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
what's going on when you're looking at a

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.310 
what's going on when you're looking at a
clear<00:00:14.610> bell<00:00:14.849> pipe<00:00:15.089> with<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.330> white<00:00:15.599> PVC<00:00:15.929> stamp

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
clear bell pipe with a white PVC stamp

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.680 
clear bell pipe with a white PVC stamp
I've<00:00:16.500> incited<00:00:17.070> as<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:17.910> can<00:00:17.970> see<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.480> flow

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
I've incited as you can see the flow

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.420 
I've incited as you can see the flow
going<00:00:18.900> into<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.199> reservoir<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.619> quite<00:00:19.890> low<00:00:20.160> so

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
going into the reservoir is quite low so

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.090 
going into the reservoir is quite low so
the<00:00:20.820> water<00:00:21.090> level<00:00:21.390> rises<00:00:21.810> slowly<00:00:22.100> eventually

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
the water level rises slowly eventually

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.410 
the water level rises slowly eventually
when<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.279> water<00:00:23.460> level<00:00:23.670> gets<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:23.939> top<00:00:24.210> the

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
when the water level gets to the top the

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.240 
when the water level gets to the top the
standpipe<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.260> water<00:00:25.470> trickles<00:00:25.890> over<00:00:26.010> and

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
standpipe the water trickles over and

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.890 
standpipe the water trickles over and
cannot<00:00:26.580> start<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.939> siphon<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:27.810> the

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
cannot start the siphon this is the

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.080 
cannot start the siphon this is the
first<00:00:28.199> failure<00:00:28.529> mode<00:00:28.830> of<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.460> typical<00:00:29.880> bell

during<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.590> failure<00:00:37.860> mode<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.160> siphon

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
during this failure mode the siphon

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.370 
during this failure mode the siphon

here<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.130> video<00:00:41.400> the<00:00:41.520> Simon<00:00:41.820> has<00:00:41.910> already

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
here the video the Simon has already

bottom areas able to get into the bell

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.360 
bottom areas able to get into the bell
pipe<00:00:47.970> but<00:00:48.450> because<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.809> continuous<00:00:49.410> fast<00:00:50.010> flow

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.670 
pipe but because of continuous fast flow
in<00:00:50.580> it<00:00:50.790> cannot<00:00:51.180> break<00:00:51.450> this<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.230> second

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
in it cannot break this is the second

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:05.960 
in it cannot break this is the second
failing<00:00:52.950> mode<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.280> classic<00:00:53.880> Bell<00:00:54.090> cycles<00:01:04.970> so

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
failing mode of classic Bell cycles so

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.880 
failing mode of classic Bell cycles so
the<00:01:06.090> tipper<00:01:06.330> works<00:01:06.600> by<00:01:06.780> changing<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:07.320> constant

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
the tipper works by changing a constant

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.100 
the tipper works by changing a constant
flow<00:01:08.130> into<00:01:08.550> an<00:01:08.640> intermittent<00:01:09.210> flow<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.570> this

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
flow into an intermittent flow in this

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.170 
flow into an intermittent flow in this
helps<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.650> both<00:01:10.800> starting<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.520> stopping<00:01:11.880> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
helps of both starting and stopping the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.760 
helps of both starting and stopping the
bell<00:01:12.360> siphon<00:01:17.509> so<00:01:18.509> here<00:01:18.780> we<00:01:18.900> use<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.170> same<00:01:19.470> low

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
bell siphon so here we use the same low

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.469 
bell siphon so here we use the same low
flow<00:01:20.100> rate<00:01:20.369> into<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.790> reservoir<00:01:21.180> except

added<00:01:21.900> our<00:01:22.020> tipper<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.650> Bell<00:01:22.860> cycle

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
added our tipper to the Bell cycle

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.460 
added our tipper to the Bell cycle

does<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.170> dumps<00:01:28.440> a<00:01:28.500> large<00:01:28.800> volume<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.430> water

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
does it dumps a large volume of water

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.790 
does it dumps a large volume of water
which<00:01:29.880> immediately<00:01:30.240> starts<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.840> siphon<00:01:31.259> the

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
which immediately starts to siphon the

which immediately starts to siphon the
siphon<00:01:32.130> drains<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.550> reservoir<00:01:32.940> as<00:01:33.090> normal

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
siphon drains the reservoir as normal

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.480 
siphon drains the reservoir as normal
until<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.930> water<00:01:34.170> level<00:01:34.470> reaches<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.100> bottom

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
until the water level reaches the bottom

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.609 
until the water level reaches the bottom

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
breaks the siphon as you see here

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:48.030 
breaks the siphon as you see here
effectively<00:01:39.990> solving<00:01:40.440> the<00:01:40.500> first<00:01:40.800> failure

in<00:01:49.040> this<00:01:49.280> demonstration<00:01:49.580> we<00:01:50.090> use<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:50.390> same

in this demonstration we use the same
