Kate Spade I'm using the one at the back

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.310 
Kate Spade I'm using the one at the back
to<00:03:44.130> store<00:03:44.370> some<00:03:44.640> of<00:03:44.670> my<00:03:45.060> makeup<00:03:45.330> brushes<00:03:45.750> and

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
the other two I'm not sure what I'm

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.930 
the other two I'm not sure what I'm
going<00:03:48.540> to<00:03:48.660> use<00:03:48.780> them<00:03:49.080> for<00:03:49.350> yet<00:03:49.650> if<00:03:50.010> you<00:03:50.580> flip

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
going to use them for yet if you flip

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.430

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.700 
pumpkins but I thought they were nice
because<00:03:54.390> you<00:03:54.510> could<00:03:54.690> use<00:03:54.870> them<00:03:55.080> year-round<00:03:55.320> if

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
because you could use them year-round if

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.150 
because you could use them year-round if
you<00:03:55.800> just<00:03:55.980> flip<00:03:56.280> them<00:03:56.430> around<00:03:57.650> also<00:03:58.650> from

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
you just flip them around also from

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.190

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
pumpkins there are two of each one in

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.770 
pumpkins there are two of each one in
the<00:04:04.020> pack<00:04:04.310> these<00:04:05.310> were<00:04:05.520> six<00:04:05.850> dollars<00:04:06.300> and<00:04:06.630> then

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
the pack these were six dollars and then

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.440 
the pack these were six dollars and then
I<00:04:06.810> also<00:04:07.110> used<00:04:07.500> that<00:04:07.620> 20%<00:04:08.160> off<00:04:08.640> Target<00:04:09.120> coupon

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.300 
I also used that 20% off Target coupon
on<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:09.720> cartwheel<00:04:10.350> app<00:04:10.620> so<00:04:10.920> I<00:04:10.950> think<00:04:11.040> these

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
on the cartwheel app so I think these

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.250 
on the cartwheel app so I think these
worked<00:04:11.580> out<00:04:11.760> to<00:04:12.030> around<00:04:12.270> 60<00:04:12.840> cents<00:04:13.080> apiece

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
worked out to around 60 cents apiece

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.300 
worked out to around 60 cents apiece
which<00:04:13.709> I<00:04:13.860> thought<00:04:14.070> was<00:04:14.250> a<00:04:14.280> good<00:04:14.490> deal

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310
