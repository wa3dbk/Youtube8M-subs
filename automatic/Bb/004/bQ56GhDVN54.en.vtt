 the in the region of photo it 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.760
 distinctive character of the crowds 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.230
 early bakery is that we ate 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.540
 compared to other industrial 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.190
 bakeries have sought antiquity 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.630
 putting a product on the market 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.040

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.720
 craft quality 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.940
 de I can translate into loosely baked 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.830

 have beautiful effects in addition 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.780
 our products generally milk 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.640
 balls 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.190
 milk dots in this case and others 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.020
 initial bakery often use water 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.330
 bill or later dots and why 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.030
 we use the milk on our products 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.340
 it therefore has a longer shelf life 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.590
 longer fresh and it gives better 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.140

 story in the hospitality industry and then I talk 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.410

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.930
 the hospitality industry remains the difference between 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.180
 our bakery and the bakery around the corner 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.760
 are not in the quality and the 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.500
 product the difference is purely in the 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.180
 continuity of the products and the 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.890
