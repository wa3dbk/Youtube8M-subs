00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.240
 hello to all today we will do 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.410
 a little tutorial video for you 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.910
 explain a little bit how things work 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.590
 controls in the world of bill world 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.230
 so to a control what is it 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.269
 it's basically an effect that allows you to 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.660
 alter the ability of an enemy to you 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:30.939
 attack so either by projecting it to 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.470
 perpetrate either in turns 10 years in 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.750
 being good in attack are doing it 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.540
 run away with fear she's really a 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.890
 lots of controls in this game so we're going 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.739
 quickly see how it's done 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.570
 walking so there are different types of 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.829
 moments in guild wars 2 you see that 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.270
 it's a basic mob 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.680
 so I can do him so much 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.840
 controls that I there is no concern 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.370
 thereupon 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.750
 this is but we are going to come a bridge that is 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.489
 in fact really more interesting is 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.020
 that many people forget in this 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.660
 game these are the bosses all that is 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.010
 legendary champions etc 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.170
 this furniture actually has a beef 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.509
 we're going to have very soon is called the 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.039
 rebel so the beef immunizes them 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:09.240
 temporarily to everything that is made of 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:11.500
 control you're going to actually see it get 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.540
 outside the form of stack 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.799
 so every time when a player goes 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.630
 relaunch a control effect on the 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.860
 boss it dropped by 20 stack each 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:23.619
 a small demonstration in pictures 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.000
 so here we are in front of a champion so 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.340
 the champion with two oxen what are 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.439
 these oxen leboeuf grieco see it's the 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.450
 beef is called unshakable so it's 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.130
 in fact what will give him the stages of 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.259
 rebels as soon as they would suffer a 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.170
 control jurisdiction and the estac de 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.240
 rebels who are so orange and 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.820
 white it's pretty much the same icon on 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.560
 can not go wrong 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.790
 so those following the bumps actually 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.189
 according to the number of people who are 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.040
 present next next saw the level 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:52.930
 how fractal the enemies have more or 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.259
 less rebel stack that really 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.820
 it changes quite regularly so the 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.259
 rebel you see whenever 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.400
 I use a control skill have 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:06.570
 who should have interrupted 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.740
 the stun etc. well it takes off a stack as soon 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.509
 that the boss does not have any stock of 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.310
 rebels the next skills they 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.560
 inflict a controlling effect is going 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.110
 simply walk 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.310
 so there is reduced in reduced is like that 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.470
 the guardian can put him a big 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.690
 blow of hammer in the face that's it 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.070
 works very well right now some 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.970
 something that is very important to remember 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.000
 in some fights 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.050
 it can really save your life 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.730
 that in general people do not 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.440
 watch out for this beef there and that's 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.430
 really a shame because it's the 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.280
 notebook of some even quite 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.830
 interesting it will save your life 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.420
 in a lot of fights like ascalon if 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.550
 you're looking for it knows nothing else it does 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.739
 very badly so if you interrupt at 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.470
 moment when he pushes his scream ben you 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.100
 will be quiet without me a case 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.870
 of timing 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.550
 it's after it's something that is 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.100
 quite difficult to pick up 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.739
 money not necessarily when to use 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.260
 their control skills so there 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.850
 down I'm going to use laced ice 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.650
 surely raises something super 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.000
 practice you will see the skill 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.410
 in 5 freezes the enemy during 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.769
 several seconds it gives you when 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.269
 even a respite to its enormous we will finish 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.370
 this video by a small explanation 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:16.590
 on what stability is and what 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:18.299
 are its main utility let's say the 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.620
 stability is a beef that protects you 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.320
 in fact against all the effects of 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.670
 control of which I spoke to you before so 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.980
 actually make it a little and that's enough 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.930
 simple because linen and only places 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.540
 have a skill that applies to you 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.760
 an effect to control yourself is the 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.079
 too physical case puts you down so 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.250
 there I will put stability of 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.200
 I will simply launch an attack 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.290
 which sums up putting down and in fact one 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.670
 saw I do not move at all 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.079
 simply 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.060
 so you have stability will you 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.530
 are potentially insensitive to all 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.110
 the effects like that you can not be 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.519
 interrupted you can not be summoned 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.590
 you can not be projected here you are 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.140
 are really insensitive to all this 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.850
 really super convenient but do 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.440
 be careful though because there are some 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.700
 effects like rocket boots that you 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.750
 projects backwards but that does not work 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.130
 not if you are under the effect of 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.350
 stability so really does very 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.910
 attention to that also know that the 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.890
 stability will allow you to move on to 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.770
 through guardian bubbles 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.120
 of their rings or hammer also passes 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.440
 through the students ' cages a 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.700
 really you can do what you 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.100
 want when you are under stability 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.959
 people will take us that way 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.549
 also to complete people in pvp without 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.340
 to be interrupted which is really very 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.110
 very convenient 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.300
 here it is this concludes this little tutorial 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.820
 I hope you have more than that 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.330
 will help tremendously the future here I am you 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.250
 say so 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.090
 see you soon for new videos and 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.090
 Hello everyone
