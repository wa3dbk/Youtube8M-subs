00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.010
 In this video we will talk about the functions of the nerve cell, 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.242
 which look a little like the pistol. 

00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:09.700
 We will talk about the functions of the neuron 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.740
 in much more detail in subsequent videos. 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:12.490
 But in this video 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.120
 we will get a general idea of ​​them. 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.910
 The task of the neurons is to process and conduct 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.010
 information. 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.030
 If they are not in the process of receiving information, most neurons have a stable difference 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.250
 in the electric charge on both sides of the cell membrane. 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.770
 The inner side is more negative, 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.170
 and the outside - more positive. 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.250
 We call this difference in the potential of rest. 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.860
 Potential of rest. 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.740
 Thanks to this potential of peace 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.110
 the neuron can be excited and yes 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.570
 receive a signal. 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.040
 For me it's the same as charging 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.010
 a bullet pistol. 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.190
 Neurons can receive excitatory or inhibitory signals 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.090
 from other cells or from physical stimuli, 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.530
 for example aromatic molecules in the nose. 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.050
 Signals are usually received through dendrites. 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.640
 Rarely, this happens through the neuron or the body 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.740
 through the axon. 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.550
 The signal information is transmitted 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.290
 through the dendrites or the body to the axon, 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.000
 this is accompanied by changes in membrane potential, called local responses. 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.120
 Local responses are changes 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.980
 in the potential of rest, 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.160
 which are small and short, 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.680
 they are not distant. 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.070
 The magnitude and duration of these potential changes 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.070
 are proportional to the size and duration of the irritation. 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.670
 If all the excitatory and inhibitory local responses 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.710
 are gathering at a time, 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.490
 this usually happens in the axonal hill 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.130
 right here. 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.020
 This collection of local responses 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.440
 is the way neurons process information about irritation. 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.250
 If the membrane potential in the axon initial segment 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.940
 pass a threshold, 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.500
 the information will be transmitted down the axon. 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.380
 I think of this process as a collection of 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.620
 excitatory and inhibitory potentials 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.910
 like the trigger of a gun. 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.361
 like the trigger of a gun. 

00:02:19.361 --> 00:02:22.200
 Local potentials are like 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.580
 the finger of the trigger that pushes harder or harder 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.690
 weaker. 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.820
 But once the trigger is pulled 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.280
 to a certain position, 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.610
 the bullet will be fired, 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.860
 as well as the membrane potential in the initial segment of the axon, 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.170
 if he passes a certain threshold, the information 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.800
 is transmitted on the axon. 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.590
 The information is transmitted on the axon 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.480
 through change 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.040
 in the membrane potential, called action potential. 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.980
 The potential is large and short. 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.220
 But it is usually transmitted along the entire length of the axon, 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.790
 no matter how long it is. 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.440
 It can travel long distances, 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.207
 just as the bullet goes smoothly out of the barrel of the gun. 

00:03:06.207 --> 00:03:08.540
 Like a bullet that moves through the barrel of the gun, 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.440
 the action potential is also moving very fast 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.770
 along the axon. 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.510
 Action potentials are different from local responses, 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.550
 because in most cases they are of the same size and duration 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.480
 for each neuron. While local responses 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.250
 have a size and duration that, 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.940
 depends on the duration of the irritation. 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.860
 Action potentials are moving faster 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.160
 by axons of larger diameter 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.580
 and axons that have a myelin sheath, 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.820
 in the figure it is marked with yellow. 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.770
 When the action potential reaches the axonal endings 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.690
 at the end of the axon, 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.480
 information crosses the synapse slit 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.250
 and reaches the next neuron. 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.960
 In most synapses this is done through 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.990
 releasing molecules called neurotransmitters 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.690
 at the point where the axonal terminus is contacted with the effector cell. 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.540
 The neurotransmitter binds to receptors on the effector cell, 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.370
 which may change its behavior. 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.820
 The neurotransmitter is then removed from the synapse. 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.300
 In this way, he can start transmitting information again. 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.490
 - 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.560
 - 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.890
 The information for the stimulus was "encoded" 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.380
 by the magnitude and duration of local responses 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.709
 and then turned into action potential with a certain 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.950
 temporal activation characteristic. 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.720
 This information then turned 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.050
 in the release of a given amount of neurotransmitter 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.590
 with a certain temporal characteristic. 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.800
 These steps show us how neurons transmit information, 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.490
 often over long distances. 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.510
 This is the most common way neurons work. 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.200
 But there are other functional types of neurons. 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.330
 Let's look at some of them. 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.480
 Here I have painted several different neurons, 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.820
 their bodies are in red, the axons in green, 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.310
 and the dendrites in blue. 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.710
 I have drawn this line to separate 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.190
 central nervous system (CNS) 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.230
 of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). 

00:05:02.364 --> 00:05:03.780
 We can categorize neurons 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.400
 according to their functions in many different ways. 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.110
 The first way is according to the direction in which information flows 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.230
 between the CNS and the PNS. 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.110
 If a neuron like this pseudo-unexploded neuron 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.980
 brings information from the periphery 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.480
 to the central nervous system, 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.320
 we call it an affiliate. 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.070
 An affiliate means it carries information 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.020
 to the central nervous system. 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.940
 We can call this neuron and 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.970
 sensible, as the information it carries 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.520
 to the central nervous system 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.870
 is for an irritant. 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.610
 Irritation can 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.970
 to come from the internal or external environment, 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.950
 may be something inside the body 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.680
 or something outside the body. 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.140
 Neurons that carry information 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.930
 from the central nervous system to the periphery 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.065
 are called efferent. 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.320
 And these are the two major types of efferent neurons. 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.600
 The first are called motor neurons. 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.830
 They are related to movement. 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:25.640
 These are efferent neurons that control skeletal muscles, 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.500
 this is the main type of muscles, 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.095
 which are attached to the bones and help us to move. 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.080
 These neurons can be called 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.470
 somatomotor neurons. 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.120
 The other type of efferent neurons 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.960
 are the autonomic neurons. 

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.440
 These neurons control smooth muscles, 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.500
 such as those in blood vessel composition, 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:07.890
 the heart muscle that builds up the heart, and the glandular cells, 

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.285
 which secrete hormones 

00:07:10.285 --> 00:07:11.160
 in the bloodstream. 

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:18.290
 These autonomic neurons 

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.800
 are also called visceromotor neurons of the autonomic nervous system. 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.730
 Most neurons in the central nervous system 

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:24.990
 there are none of these species. 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.940
 They are like this neuron here, 

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.980
 they connect other neurons between them. 

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.060
 These are interneurons, 

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.485
 neurons between neurons. 

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.150
 There are many interneurons in the central nervous system, 

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.700
 which form complex networks through which information travels. 

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.450
 While the single neuron 

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.870
 integrate and transmit information, 

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.070
 these complex networks of neurons 

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:53.590
 in the central nervous system 

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:55.810
 perform even more sophisticated information processing, integration 

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.180
 and transmission.
