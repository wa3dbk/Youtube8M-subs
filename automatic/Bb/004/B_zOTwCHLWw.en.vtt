 well this is a new video for 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.910
 comment on new ideas modified 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.190
 for gta 4 so finally a video of how 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.530
 install the truth that I did not find 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.230
 none stir and everywhere and 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.670
 well a designated guy can they can 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.360
 any kind of cinema more can 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.740
 download 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.390
 that I will show you next 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.390
 how and for example 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.230
 good is a kind of mermaid so you can 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.140
 download any kind of sirens and 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.030
 so be it so be it anyone if that 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.000
 what are you going to do, you are going to download 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.070
 you and good as long as you 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.430
 subscribe yes so that they were served there 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.430
 now they press little sign there they see 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.550
 click click subscribe hand up all 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.520
 that you already know 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.350
 and I do not want to tell you that this is the 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.690
 one I think it's the first video in 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.670
 Spanish is more I think it's the first of 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.350
 the first ones because I did not find any 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:35.840
 they are all in gta san andreas and all that 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:39.460
 but nothing important and good now 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.929
 if I install in the video and I'll show you 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.009
 one thing the layer and they subscribe 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.290
 because I 'm doing everything for the 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:49.680
 people who do not understand how to install it 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:54.300
 that is, there are no videos, there is no explanation 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:57.270
 neither in forums nor in pages or anything if 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.360
 only exists to san andreas and estimating is 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.580
 the same yes good in the description go 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.200
 to see two things the program that we have 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.630
 I will need the spark that we already are 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.610
 previously to install cars and 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.190
 other modifications in this case the 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.470
 wench to modify the sound is a 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:18.530
 specific sound that is the siren 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:21.530
 of games itself and another folder that 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.540
 also included is the mermaid 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.640
 that I looked for a pair of sirens like 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:31.100
 to do tests and see if it works in 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:34.250
 reality and it worked and I far away to mermaids 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.170
 so that more or less if they do not want 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.000
 download had them modified 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.260
 but to download more you can go to 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.570
 the page they have left in the 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.180
 description the dgt assange and that already 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.550
 use it again because it is very 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.080
 recommended this page and once it 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.490
 they go to who were here for the 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.740
 part that says 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.260
 protection mod 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.299
 they click 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.189
 I'm doing for people who want 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.680
 download the sound that you like that already 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:04.459
 it depends on you and according to the second to last 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.459
 what he says are 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.120
 and well here are all the sounds that 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.510
 we are going to look for is the mermaid 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.730
 I wanted turbo air siren and all that but 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.739
 that 's nothing to see 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.950
 For example, we are going to meet with a 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.950
 time 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:27.790
 good for example here in the chain 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:30.040
 mermaid without accessing the final heading that is 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.069
 A type of siren ends up in the video 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.630
 they listen and they want to make them 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.940
 like that you are going to do 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.860
 you obvious the mermaid who likes the 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.130
 equal download in the description told 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.830
 I think 45 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.420
 for 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.510
 so if you do not have to win download 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.390
 well there they have those and good the 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.960
 program that we're going to start the spark what 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.500
 decompress weighs almost nothing and the other 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:00.140
 folder that are the sirens 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.380
 completely fine what we go first 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.680
 it's the spark 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.140
 let's execute it 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.569
 they run 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.000
 and let's look if you see if it appears 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.260
 this let's find where it is installed 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.040
 the gta san andreas 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.130
 in my case luck in winning by 86 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.130
 rockstar games 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.070
 and they keep it within the race the 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.070
 novel 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.199
 read once open and running the 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.960
 program they give to where the 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:46.289
 first icon that appears browser 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.289
 if he pulls him a little and tells him not to 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.970
 if when executing the program they put proust 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.560
 and tells him it's not working, wait 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.110
 if they do not take it out, do not touch anything 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.419
 wait until he responds to the program 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:01.090
 After opening program icon 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:04.270
 proust go to the bar is and they will put 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:07.780
 where it says s fx that would be all 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:10.289
 sounds there you click once you 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:13.430
 click is open on this side 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:18.180
 let's find one that says one says 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:21.990
 newly reside r pf h 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:24.300
 if you give two clicks and good here when 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.270
 do this if it is the first thing in this 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.189
 program the perdÃ©s will offer it like that and not 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.139
 you are going to put that yes yes 

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:32.939
 they want to modify if they give yes 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:34.649
 because if they put that no no no no no what 

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:37.350
 they will be able to do you once 

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:40.050
 they just put 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.120
 one that they put a ration and they open this 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.610
 you will see a poster of a casino in 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.470
 the options are going to choose the one that says yes 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.170
 when they argue that if it's going to look like 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.260
 this and lion where it says click here where 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.260
 He says 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.740
 and now we are going to give imports to 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:58.990
 icon this 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.370
 and well here we are going to look for the siren 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.010
 what 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.830
 we have already loaded on any page that 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:08.729
 is unloaded in the siren is going to come 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:11.500
 come on now let's go to the folder 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:13.690
 the one of the sirens that I left 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.820
 in these we have three options and four 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:19.020
 that is one of the Argentine sirens 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.020
 it would be this one that is 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:25.440
 every time you download a type of 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:28.849
 mermaid the dwarf file with the name 11 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.319
 and under that point and under 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:33.050
 so now what we do has still 

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:34.939
 downloaded once you have a siren 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.589
 who like the loading version 

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:38.589
 from the east have been wherever 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:45.290
 one that the person just still imports 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:50.379
 let's go now we 're going to look for where 

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:52.179
 are the sirens in the signals that are 

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:54.879
 more created in this case install this 

00:06:52.179 --> 00:06:57.179
 to open one that they are going to open they are going to 

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:57.179
 6 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:04.040
 Yang now accepts if they can take it out and 

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:07.610
 if they want to launch and the saga 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:10.790
 Now let's repeat so that you understood 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:13.430
 that now in the spark program read to 

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:18.050
 proust analyze it to brussels 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:20.690
 sf x one that the s fx and the appeared this 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:23.050
 from this side of the stick we look at the part 

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.050
 what does it say 

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.099
 newly 

00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:30.019
 open we just do not appreciate a sign of 

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:34.189
 but land what if after we go 

00:07:30.019 --> 00:07:38.509
 thanking plan imports and looking for 

00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:43.539
 last search for the mermaid file that 

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:43.539
 they are downloaded they give to accept 6 

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:50.120
 well here if you want to make it be more 

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:52.190
 sure and close and nothing is that this is 

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.900
 a fool what you have to do but 

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:56.270
 well it seems that no one cared 

00:07:53.900 --> 00:08:00.050
 make a demonstration of how it is 

00:07:56.270 --> 00:08:03.510
 carlos since I did not know and touching either 

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:08.480
 touching I discovered and well now we go 

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:08.480
 to see what works really and chau
