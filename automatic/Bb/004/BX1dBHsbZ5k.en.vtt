so<00:01:46.619> what<00:01:46.770> we<00:01:46.860> find<00:01:47.070> here<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.640> there

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
so what we find here is that there

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.819 
so what we find here is that there
eventually<00:01:48.420> comes<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.930> point<00:01:49.110> whereby<00:01:49.380> it

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
eventually comes a point whereby it

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.770 
eventually comes a point whereby it
seems<00:01:50.399> as<00:01:50.579> though<00:01:50.670> nothing<00:01:51.119> can<00:01:51.240> be<00:01:51.420> done<00:01:51.630> that

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
seems as though nothing can be done that

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.170 
seems as though nothing can be done that
too<00:01:51.990> much<00:01:52.140> time<00:01:52.439> has<00:01:52.619> passed<00:01:52.649> it's<00:01:53.220> impossible

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
too much time has passed it's impossible

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.330 
too much time has passed it's impossible
to<00:01:54.299> destroy<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.500> earthly<00:01:55.950> ultimate

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
to destroy the the earthly ultimate

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.069 
to destroy the the earthly ultimate
universe<00:01:56.700> without<00:01:57.119> destroying<00:01:57.630> both<00:01:57.810> earths

universe without destroying both earths

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.749

or if the main earth was destroyed it

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.980 
or if the main earth was destroyed it
would<00:02:05.670> simply<00:02:05.939> just<00:02:06.000> blow<00:02:06.270> up<00:02:06.299> both<00:02:06.659> of<00:02:06.689> them

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
would simply just blow up both of them

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.419 
would simply just blow up both of them
just<00:02:07.200> due<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.560> fact<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.950> explosion

just due to the fact that the explosion

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.449 
just due to the fact that the explosion
would<00:02:08.520> be<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:08.849> extreme<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.950> so<00:02:10.950> what<00:02:11.099> happens

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
would be so extreme and so what happens

would be so extreme and so what happens

ten people are the only ones for the

ten people are the only ones for the

the Fantastic Four's Children is ripped

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.520 
the Fantastic Four's Children is ripped
away<00:03:25.370> and<00:03:25.790> so<00:03:26.330> what<00:03:26.570> happens<00:03:27.050> is<00:03:27.260> Reed

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
away and so what happens is Reed

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.470 
away and so what happens is Reed
Richards<00:03:27.860> tries<00:03:28.190> to<00:03:28.400> launch<00:03:28.610> this<00:03:28.880> kind<00:03:29.240> of

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
Richards tries to launch this kind of

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.510 
Richards tries to launch this kind of
rescue<00:03:29.930> attempt<00:03:30.350> in<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.560> sense<00:03:30.800> that<00:03:30.890> he

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
rescue attempt in the sense that he

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.370 
rescue attempt in the sense that he
tells<00:03:31.790> T'Challa<00:03:32.240> to<00:03:32.450> lower<00:03:32.630> the<00:03:32.840> shield's<00:03:33.260> now

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
tells T'Challa to lower the shield's now

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.080 
tells T'Challa to lower the shield's now
initially<00:03:33.800> to<00:03:33.920> tell<00:03:34.130> it<00:03:34.220> doesn't<00:03:34.459> want<00:03:34.640> to<00:03:34.790> and

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
initially to tell it doesn't want to and

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.480 
initially to tell it doesn't want to and
the<00:03:35.390> reason<00:03:35.660> being<00:03:35.810> because<00:03:35.930> if<00:03:36.470> they<00:03:36.650> did<00:03:37.040> it

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
the reason being because if they did it

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.430 
the reason being because if they did it
might<00:03:37.760> cause<00:03:38.000> some<00:03:38.030> kind<00:03:38.630> of<00:03:38.870> an<00:03:39.020> instability

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
might cause some kind of an instability

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.690 
might cause some kind of an instability
within<00:03:39.800> the<00:03:40.010> ship<00:03:40.070> and<00:03:40.400> it<00:03:40.459> would<00:03:40.580> end<00:03:40.670> up

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
within the ship and it would end up

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.400 
within the ship and it would end up
destroying<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.390> multiversal<00:03:41.959> life<00:03:42.110> raft

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
destroying the multiversal life raft

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.500 
destroying the multiversal life raft
entirely<00:03:42.830> and<00:03:43.220> so<00:03:43.670> what<00:03:43.880> he<00:03:43.970> says<00:03:44.209> is<00:03:44.240> that

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
entirely and so what he says is that

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.330 
entirely and so what he says is that
he'll<00:03:44.660> be<00:03:44.810> able<00:03:44.959> to<00:03:45.050> lower<00:03:45.230> it<00:03:45.410> down<00:03:45.440> for<00:03:46.100> five

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
he'll be able to lower it down for five

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.340 
he'll be able to lower it down for five
seconds<00:03:46.880> but<00:03:47.300> after<00:03:47.540> that<00:03:47.630> five<00:03:47.840> seconds<00:03:48.260> is

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
seconds but after that five seconds is

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.470 
seconds but after that five seconds is
up<00:03:48.590> if<00:03:48.830> the<00:03:48.980> integrity<00:03:49.700> of<00:03:49.790> the<00:03:50.000> ship<00:03:50.240> goes

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
up if the integrity of the ship goes

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.600 
up if the integrity of the ship goes
below<00:03:50.780> 90%<00:03:51.140> then<00:03:51.890> he's<00:03:52.010> going<00:03:52.250> to<00:03:52.310> have<00:03:52.459> to

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
below 90% then he's going to have to

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.610 
below 90% then he's going to have to
raise<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:52.940> shield<00:03:53.200> regardless<00:03:54.200> of<00:03:54.380> what's

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
raise the shield regardless of what's

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.610 
raise the shield regardless of what's
happened<00:03:55.160> and<00:03:55.340> so<00:03:56.020> once<00:03:57.020> the<00:03:57.200> shield<00:03:57.350> goes

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
happened and so once the shield goes

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.220 
happened and so once the shield goes
down<00:03:57.950> Reed<00:03:58.550> Richards<00:03:58.910> tries<00:03:59.240> to<00:03:59.480> reach<00:03:59.690> out<00:03:59.959> to

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
down Reed Richards tries to reach out to

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.560 
down Reed Richards tries to reach out to
Susan<00:04:00.709> storm<00:04:00.980> and<00:04:01.370> to<00:04:01.520> grab<00:04:01.880> that<00:04:02.060> section<00:04:02.450> of

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
Susan storm and to grab that section of

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.780 
Susan storm and to grab that section of
the<00:04:02.600> ship<00:04:02.720> but<00:04:03.410> right<00:04:03.650> before<00:04:03.860> he<00:04:04.250> gets<00:04:04.490> there

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
the ship but right before he gets there

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.520 
the ship but right before he gets there
that<00:04:05.300> section<00:04:05.600> of<00:04:05.720> the<00:04:05.750> ship<00:04:05.840> disintegrates

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
that section of the ship disintegrates

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.190 
that section of the ship disintegrates
entirely<00:04:07.040> and<00:04:07.459> so<00:04:07.640> basically<00:04:08.060> Reed<00:04:08.780> Richards

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
entirely and so basically Reed Richards

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.080 
entirely and so basically Reed Richards
is<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:09.590> only<00:04:09.770> member<00:04:10.130> of<00:04:10.340> the<00:04:10.459> Fantastic<00:04:10.640> Four

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
is the only member of the Fantastic Four

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.240 
is the only member of the Fantastic Four
left<00:04:11.510> everybody<00:04:12.140> else<00:04:12.530> has<00:04:12.709> been<00:04:12.830> completely

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
left everybody else has been completely

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.360 
left everybody else has been completely
annihilated<00:04:13.670> and<00:04:14.300> so<00:04:14.480> what<00:04:15.470> we<00:04:15.620> find<00:04:15.920> is<00:04:16.310> that

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
annihilated and so what we find is that

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.610 
annihilated and so what we find is that
as<00:04:16.730> everything<00:04:17.270> seems<00:04:17.540> to<00:04:17.630> come<00:04:17.720> to<00:04:17.900> an<00:04:18.169> end<00:04:18.350> as

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
as everything seems to come to an end as

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.560 
as everything seems to come to an end as
this<00:04:18.890> entire<00:04:19.310> multiverse<00:04:19.640> begins<00:04:20.390> to

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
this entire multiverse begins to

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.570 
this entire multiverse begins to
collapse<00:04:20.989> and<00:04:21.260> to<00:04:21.590> basically<00:04:21.890> be<00:04:22.160> destroyed

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
collapse and to basically be destroyed

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.850 
collapse and to basically be destroyed
that<00:04:22.850> we<00:04:23.390> see<00:04:23.630> that<00:04:23.840> this<00:04:23.990> multiversal<00:04:24.680> life

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
that we see that this multiversal life

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.510 
that we see that this multiversal life
raft<00:04:25.190> seems<00:04:25.490> to<00:04:25.729> land

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
raft seems to land

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.219 
raft seems to land
on<00:04:26.580> what<00:04:26.789> this<00:04:26.940> new<00:04:27.120> battle<00:04:27.330> world<00:04:27.599> is<00:04:27.870> I<00:04:28.080> guess

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
on what this new battle world is I guess

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:29.570 
on what this new battle world is I guess
on<00:04:28.410> the<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:28.949> formation<00:04:29.460> of<00:04:29.490> the

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
on the the formation of the

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.640 
on the the formation of the
conglomeration<00:04:30.150> of<00:04:30.449> all<00:04:30.990> these<00:04:31.199> different

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
conglomeration of all these different

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.409 
conglomeration of all these different
realities<00:04:32.250> that<00:04:32.310> have<00:04:32.460> been<00:04:32.550> merged<00:04:32.759> on<00:04:33.060> to

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
realities that have been merged on to

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:34.909 
realities that have been merged on to
what<00:04:33.629> battle<00:04:33.960> world<00:04:34.110> is<00:04:34.259> going<00:04:34.500> to<00:04:34.530> be<00:04:34.770> but

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
what battle world is going to be but

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.100 
what battle world is going to be but
again<00:04:35.190> this<00:04:35.789> is<00:04:36.000> what<00:04:36.030> we<00:04:36.270> get<00:04:36.479> we<00:04:36.990> don't

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
again this is what we get we don't

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.570 
again this is what we get we don't
really<00:04:37.319> know<00:04:37.560> what's<00:04:37.740> going<00:04:37.919> to<00:04:38.039> happen<00:04:38.400> next

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
really know what's going to happen next

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.520 
really know what's going to happen next
the<00:04:38.849> only<00:04:39.090> indication<00:04:39.659> we<00:04:39.780> have<00:04:40.050> is<00:04:40.259> from<00:04:40.379> what

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
the only indication we have is from what

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.809 
the only indication we have is from what
Marvel<00:04:40.800> has<00:04:40.889> told<00:04:41.159> us<00:04:41.280> through<00:04:41.520> various

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:41.819 
Marvel has told us through various

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:43.700 
Marvel has told us through various
interviews<00:04:42.180> and<00:04:42.360> so<00:04:42.509> on<00:04:42.690> that<00:04:43.259> Secret<00:04:43.590> Wars

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
interviews and so on that Secret Wars

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.129 
interviews and so on that Secret Wars
issue<00:04:43.979> number<00:04:44.280> two<00:04:44.520> is<00:04:44.819> going<00:04:45.300> to<00:04:45.419> cover<00:04:45.750> all

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
issue number two is going to cover all

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:47.990 
issue number two is going to cover all
these<00:04:46.409> different<00:04:46.740> realities<00:04:47.220> but<00:04:47.729> the<00:04:47.789> fact

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
these different realities but the fact

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.820 
these different realities but the fact
remains<00:04:48.389> in<00:04:48.659> terms<00:04:48.930> of<00:04:49.110> the<00:04:49.229> earth-616

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
remains in terms of the earth-616

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.100

the portion of battle world that's going
to<00:04:53.879> house<00:04:54.150> the<00:04:54.180> characters<00:04:54.870> from<00:04:55.110> that<00:04:55.590> were

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
to house the characters from that were

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.080 
to house the characters from that were
previously<00:04:56.099> part<00:04:56.190> of<00:04:56.550> the<00:04:56.699> earth-616
