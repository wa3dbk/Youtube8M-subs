00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.870
 in the spring when a huge bush blooms 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.880
 rose hips pale pink flowers by 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.030
 it is impossible to pass indifferent 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.160
 in the autumn he gives us bright berries that 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.410
 have a mass of healing properties 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.109
 not for nothing in the people rosehip nicknamed 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.150
 healer of the forest and yes on the site this 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.340
 shrub can bring considerable benefits 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.330
 today briar in the spotlight 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.910
 rubric 6 hectare on the sensor rose hips 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.070
 grow extremely rarely and in vain thanks to 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.530
 for its decorative properties it can 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.809
 become a great hedge which 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.420
 able to protect the site from unwanted 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.550
 guests better than any fence to the same 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.010
 briar unpretentious important time 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.829
 do a haircut to bush and not too 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.090
 rose hips are very 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.710
 unpretentious drought-resistant plant 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.430
 frost-resistant withstands frost up to 40 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.879
 degrees 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.739
 grows on any soil except of course 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:06.120
 marshy but good yield will give on 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.760
 good fertilized fertile soil 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.530
 at the dog rose all the decoction of the leaves is useful 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.140
 used as an antiseptic and 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.730
 pain reliever roots helps 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.790
 for gallstone disease 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.560
 and the berries themselves are real pantry useful 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.330
 substances 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.010
 I must say that some vitamins 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.730
 for example vitamin c 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:31.620
 in dogrose 80 times its content is more 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:34.170
 than in orange and three fruits are enough 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:38.450
 in order to replenish daily 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.450
 human need for vitamin c 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.670
 due to the high content of vitamin c 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.950
 wild rose is simply irreplaceable cold season 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.350
 Well, so that he brought the maximum benefit 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.020
 need to collect it away from the roads and 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.510
 industrial enterprises and necessarily 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.450
 dry weather is the best time to collect 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.360
 end of september beginning of october when 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.240
 berries have not yet despised dried rosehips 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.610
 recommended immediately after collection and more 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.690
 one feature is the shorter the drying time 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.450
 the better preserved vitamin c to dry 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:17.820
 fruits can also be in the oven when 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:20.700
 temperature from 40 to 60 degrees at 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.790
 This should be dried with an open slightly 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.450
 the oven can be dried and 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.900
 temperature 100 degrees only 10-15 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.170
 minutes and then lower the temperature 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.910
 up to 40 degrees and finally it 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.340
 to dry 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.560
 if you mess with the oven never berries 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.170
 can be dried in a dark place decomposed 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.400
 on a paper towel in a single layer or 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.460
 string on a string 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.440
 such beads also decorate dried in the kitchen 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.260
 wild rose is most often used in the form 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.660
 decoction 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.240
 simmer for 10 minutes and 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:01.050
 after that in this pot of theirs 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:04.410
 and leave for two or three hours to drink the broth 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.330
 half a cup a day can be cooked 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.970
 such an infusion in a thermos 2 liters 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.400
 boiling water 2 tablespoons of berries and so much 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.570
 same sugar that's just to insist such 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:18.060
 drink should be at least 12 hours out 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.810
 rose hips even jam make delicious 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.330
 fragrant 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.910
 only it will have to tinker harder 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:27.320
 just clean the berries from seeds and hairs 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.320
 well, then everything is simple 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:37.450
 pour syrup 20 percent that is 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:41.830
 250 grams of sugar per liter of water 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:45.650
 stand 56 minutes after this berry 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:48.040
 choose a skimmer and shift 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.950
 the capacity of which we will make jam 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:55.820
 pour pain to centered hot 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:04:05.990
 syrup per kilo 300 sugar per 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:08.270
 kilogram of berries and cook until done with 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.100
 all the utility of wild rose to get involved in it 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.200
 constantly not worth besides 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.100
 disease for which he does 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:19.340
 contraindicated but that's another topic 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:21.830
 Medical and another interesting fact 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.380
 it turns out under the hips can 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:27.320
 determine the time they are revealed around 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.310
 5am close at about 8pm 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.770
 here is an amazing plant 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.180
 you had a rubric of 6 days and yoala 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.360
 Gorbatenko in the next program 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.780
 let's talk about how to prepare for winter 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.780
 strawberry beds 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.020
 23 September 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.720
 the moon waning in the constellation Virgo 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.449
 neutral sign is not worth that day 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.180
 plant fruit and vegetable crops 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.410
 but you can plant ornamental trees and 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.669
 shrubs 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.720
 strawberries and plant and transplant 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:06.900
 flower perennials 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:10.169
 we carry out sanitary pruning and moisture 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.780
 Charging vy watering orchard are making 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:15.780
 organic fertilizers for perennial 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:19.289
 culture september 24 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:23.250
 new moon in this period all the energy 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:26.070
 plants are concentrated in the roots of crops and 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.660
 landing transplanting and loosening 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.840
 plants near the roots 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:33.660
 not recommended we carry out weeding 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:36.150
 weed sanitary pruning berry 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:39.960
 currant bushes and gooseberries 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:42.949
 and also we swing old and sick 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:47.520
 trees and shrubs

 trees and berry bushes make 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:11.190
 organic fertilizers for perennial
