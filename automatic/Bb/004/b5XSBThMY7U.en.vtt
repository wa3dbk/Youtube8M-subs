to talk to you about is a continuation
of<00:00:11.759> our<00:00:12.440> ideas<00:00:13.440> on<00:00:13.590> stamina<00:00:14.009> building<00:00:14.519> now

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
of our ideas on stamina building now

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.300 
of our ideas on stamina building now
most<00:00:15.780> people<00:00:16.109> wouldn't<00:00:16.410> believe<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:16.830> you

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
most people wouldn't believe that you

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.330 
most people wouldn't believe that you
could<00:00:17.520> stand<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.390> build<00:00:19.320> your<00:00:19.470> stamina<00:00:19.740> but

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
could stand and build your stamina but

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.170 
could stand and build your stamina but
today<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.520> wanna<00:00:20.640> talk<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.880> you<00:00:20.939> about<00:00:21.000> a

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
today I wanna talk to you about a

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.000 
today I wanna talk to you about a
research<00:00:21.539> study<00:00:21.750> that's<00:00:22.410> really<00:00:22.619> about<00:00:22.769> how

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
research study that's really about how

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.160 
research study that's really about how
powerful<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.760> mind<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.390> in<00:00:24.689> building<00:00:25.140> your

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
powerful the mind is in building your

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.929 
powerful the mind is in building your
stamina<00:00:25.529> not<00:00:26.220> only<00:00:26.400> for<00:00:26.550> physical<00:00:26.670> exercise

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
stamina not only for physical exercise

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.599 
stamina not only for physical exercise
but<00:00:27.750> for<00:00:28.019> resilience<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.099> face<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.310> life's

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
but for resilience in the face of life's

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.400 
but for resilience in the face of life's
challenges<00:00:29.720> so<00:00:30.720> let<00:00:30.929> me<00:00:30.990> kind<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.199> set<00:00:31.320> the

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
challenges so let me kind of set the

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.709 
challenges so let me kind of set the
stage<00:00:31.439> for<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.820> number<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.390> years<00:00:33.510> ago

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
stage for you a number of years ago

stage for you a number of years ago
researchers<00:00:34.170> sort<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.680> looking<00:00:34.950> at

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
researchers sort of looking at

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.110

at<00:00:41.160> their<00:00:41.280> brains<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.850> functional<00:00:42.239> MRI<00:00:42.300> to

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
at their brains and a functional MRI to

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.389 
at their brains and a functional MRI to
go<00:00:42.840> hey<00:00:43.020> how<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.710> their<00:00:43.890> brains<00:00:44.190> work

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
go hey how is it that their brains work

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.770 
go hey how is it that their brains work
that's<00:00:44.640> maybe<00:00:44.789> different<00:00:44.910> from<00:00:45.450> an<00:00:45.510> office

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
that's maybe different from an office

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.299 
that's maybe different from an office
worker<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.710> he<00:00:46.770> looked<00:00:46.980> at<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.070> bunch<00:00:47.219> of

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
worker so he looked at a bunch of

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.190 
worker so he looked at a bunch of
different<00:00:47.370> people<00:00:47.700> Navy<00:00:48.270> SEALs<00:00:48.539> triathletes

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
different people Navy SEALs triathletes

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.380 
different people Navy SEALs triathletes
office<00:00:49.530> workers<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.100> basically<00:00:50.940> they<00:00:51.149> put<00:00:51.180> a

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
office workers and basically they put a

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.360 
office workers and basically they put a
little<00:00:51.600> challenge<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.350> them<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.739> they<00:00:53.160> made

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
little challenge to them and they made

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.130 
little challenge to them and they made
them<00:00:53.640> they<00:00:53.910> put<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.090> mask<00:00:54.329> on<00:00:54.570> them<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.050> they

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
them they put a mask on them and they

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.689 
them they put a mask on them and they
told<00:00:55.379> them<00:00:55.559> hey<00:00:55.739> at<00:00:55.860> some<00:00:56.100> point<00:00:56.309> during<00:00:56.489> this

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
told them hey at some point during this

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.490 
told them hey at some point during this
test<00:00:57.030> while<00:00:57.809> we're<00:00:57.960> just<00:00:58.140> while<00:00:58.379> we're

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
test while we're just while we're

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.840 
test while we're just while we're
studying<00:00:58.739> your<00:00:58.859> brain<00:00:59.100> we're<00:00:59.340> gonna<00:00:59.430> cut<00:00:59.760> off

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
studying your brain we're gonna cut off

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.709 
studying your brain we're gonna cut off
the<00:01:00.000> air<00:01:00.120> supply

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
the air supply

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.680 
the air supply
now<00:01:01.530> what<00:01:01.949> started<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.399> happen<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:03.449> what<00:01:03.600> was

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
now what started to happen and what was

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.560 
now what started to happen and what was
very<00:01:03.809> noticeable<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.790> activity<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:05.909> one<00:01:06.150> part

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
very noticeable is activity in one part

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.030 
very noticeable is activity in one part
of<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.840> brain<00:01:07.140> called<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.470> insular<00:01:07.860> cortex

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
of the brain called the insular cortex

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.130 
of the brain called the insular cortex
now<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:09.180> part<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.510> brain<00:01:09.630> basically

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
now the this part of the brain basically

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.230 
now the this part of the brain basically
what<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.470> does<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.430> pays<00:01:11.640> attention<00:01:11.850> to

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
what it does is it pays attention to

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.870 
what it does is it pays attention to
your<00:01:12.450> internal<00:01:13.020> body<00:01:13.170> sensations<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.760> what

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
your internal body sensations so what

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.460 
your internal body sensations so what
would<00:01:14.970> happen<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.540> right<00:01:15.990> when<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.259> with<00:01:16.380> the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
would happen is right when the with the

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.170 
would happen is right when the with the
warning<00:01:16.770> came<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.280> Navy<00:01:17.460> SEALs<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.060> the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
warning came the Navy SEALs and the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.510 
warning came the Navy SEALs and the
triathletes<00:01:18.740> that<00:01:19.740> part<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.100> their<00:01:20.189> brain<00:01:20.400> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
triathletes that part of their brain the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.190 
triathletes that part of their brain the
insular<00:01:20.790> cortex<00:01:20.939> would<00:01:21.360> get<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.540> big<00:01:21.810> burst<00:01:22.080> of

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
insular cortex would get a big burst of

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.109 
insular cortex would get a big burst of
blood<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.710> basically<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.130> said<00:01:23.310> hey<00:01:23.490> what<00:01:24.030> does

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
blood so basically it said hey what does

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.270 
blood so basically it said hey what does
the<00:01:24.180> body<00:01:24.299> feel<00:01:24.509> like<00:01:24.689> right<00:01:24.900> now<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.500> then<00:01:26.130> is

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
the body feel like right now and then is

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.070 
the body feel like right now and then is
there<00:01:26.430> restricted<00:01:26.939> breathing<00:01:27.270> occurred<00:01:27.630> the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
there restricted breathing occurred the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.679 
there restricted breathing occurred the
blood<00:01:28.560> supply<00:01:28.710> decreased<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.790> area<00:01:30.119> so

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
blood supply decreased in that area so

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:31.940 
blood supply decreased in that area so
in<00:01:30.780> essence<00:01:31.049> what<00:01:31.140> we<00:01:31.320> were<00:01:31.409> learning<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.829> that

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
in essence what we were learning is that

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.230 
in essence what we were learning is that
their<00:01:32.100> brain<00:01:32.340> was<00:01:32.520> saying<00:01:32.700> hey<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.030> know

their brain was saying hey I know

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.450 
their brain was saying hey I know
something<00:01:33.390> tough<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.409> coming<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.280> I'm<00:01:35.340> gonna

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
something tough is coming so I'm gonna

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.969 
something tough is coming so I'm gonna
make<00:01:35.670> sure<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.360> don't<00:01:36.710> overthink<00:01:37.710> this

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
make sure that I don't overthink this

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.350 
make sure that I don't overthink this
I'm<00:01:38.189> not<00:01:38.310> gonna<00:01:38.490> get<00:01:38.640> overly<00:01:38.970> emotionally

I'm not gonna get overly emotionally

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.569 
I'm not gonna get overly emotionally
involved<00:01:39.600> in<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:40.100> then<00:01:41.100> they<00:01:41.189> compared<00:01:41.520> that

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
involved in it then they compared that

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.889 
involved in it then they compared that
to<00:01:41.670> office<00:01:42.000> workers<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.540> their<00:01:42.659> brains

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
to office workers and their brains

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.450 
to office workers and their brains
actually<00:01:43.110> works<00:01:43.439> completely<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.009> opposite

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
actually works completely the opposite

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.120 
actually works completely the opposite
way<00:01:44.810> which<00:01:45.810> basically<00:01:46.439> showed<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.950> when

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
way which basically showed that when

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.399 
way which basically showed that when
they<00:01:47.250> were<00:01:47.310> under<00:01:47.549> stress<00:01:47.909> their<00:01:48.630> brain<00:01:49.049> paid

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
they were under stress their brain paid

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.560 
they were under stress their brain paid
even<00:01:49.530> greater<00:01:50.100> attention<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:51.299> what<00:01:51.450> they<00:01:51.540> were

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
even greater attention to what they were

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.810 
even greater attention to what they were
feeling<00:01:51.869> rather<00:01:52.229> than<00:01:52.409> less<00:01:52.590> attention<00:01:53.070> now

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
feeling rather than less attention now

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.580 
feeling rather than less attention now
the<00:01:54.450> other<00:01:54.810> part<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.200> brain<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.380> got

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
the other part of the brain that got

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.469 
the other part of the brain that got
involved<00:01:55.829> in<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.280> called<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.610> ACC<00:01:57.240> and

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
involved in this is called the ACC and

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.880 
involved in this is called the ACC and
basically<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:57.930> deals<00:01:58.229> with<00:01:58.320> emotional

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
basically that deals with emotional

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.709 
basically that deals with emotional
regulation<00:01:59.100> and<00:02:00.060> what<00:02:00.180> they<00:02:00.270> figured<00:02:00.420> out<00:02:00.659> was

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
regulation and what they figured out was

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.749 
regulation and what they figured out was
that<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.350> seals<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:01.950> triathletes<00:02:02.399> were<00:02:02.549> able

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
that the seals and triathletes were able

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.969 
that the seals and triathletes were able
to<00:02:02.790> stay<00:02:03.060> more<00:02:03.270> relaxed<00:02:03.869> in<00:02:03.990> them<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.829> less

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
to stay more relaxed in them and less

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.859 
to stay more relaxed in them and less
emotionally<00:02:05.610> involved<00:02:06.060> in<00:02:06.450> this<00:02:06.630> stress

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
emotionally involved in this stress

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.309 
emotionally involved in this stress
process<00:02:07.320> now<00:02:08.280> they<00:02:08.610> said<00:02:08.819> alright<00:02:09.179> we<00:02:09.899> wonder

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
process now they said alright we wonder

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.470 
process now they said alright we wonder
is<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:11.069> is<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.520> training<00:02:12.000> or<00:02:12.209> is<00:02:12.330> it

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480

what they found was after I believe was

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.540 
what they found was after I believe was
eight<00:02:29.140> weeks<00:02:29.260> of<00:02:29.410> training<00:02:29.680> that<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.280> Marines

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
eight weeks of training that the Marines

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.370 
eight weeks of training that the Marines
brains<00:02:31.000> looked<00:02:31.420> really<00:02:31.810> really<00:02:32.020> similar<00:02:32.230> to

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
brains looked really really similar to

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.680 
brains looked really really similar to
the<00:02:32.530> Navy<00:02:32.800> SEALs<00:02:33.040> when<00:02:33.819> this<00:02:33.970> test<00:02:34.239> occurred

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
and then the further further training

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.420 
and then the further further training
from<00:02:37.930> there<00:02:38.080> they<00:02:38.319> showed<00:02:38.560> actually<00:02:39.069> increase

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
from there they showed actually increase

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.330 
from there they showed actually increase
performance<00:02:39.660> in<00:02:40.660> endurance<00:02:41.050> and<00:02:41.200> efforts<00:02:41.560> now

but<00:03:11.200> in<00:03:11.410> the<00:03:11.560> in<00:03:11.830> the<00:03:11.980> study<00:03:12.160> that<00:03:12.370> was<00:03:12.550> done

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
but in the in the study that was done

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.130 
but in the in the study that was done
they<00:03:12.940> did<00:03:13.090> it<00:03:13.209> standing<00:03:13.600> they'd<00:03:13.750> had<00:03:13.930> the

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
they did it standing they'd had the

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.259 
they did it standing they'd had the
soldiers<00:03:14.830> stand<00:03:15.069> up<00:03:15.250> and<00:03:15.489> they<00:03:15.940> would<00:03:16.090> have

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
soldiers stand up and they would have

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.110 
soldiers stand up and they would have
them<00:03:16.420> spend<00:03:16.720> five<00:03:17.079> to<00:03:17.110> ten<00:03:17.530> minutes<00:03:18.120> focusing

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
them spend five to ten minutes focusing

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.640 
them spend five to ten minutes focusing
on<00:03:19.329> the<00:03:19.450> feeling<00:03:19.870> of<00:03:19.989> their<00:03:20.140> feet<00:03:20.380> on<00:03:20.560> the

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
on the feeling of their feet on the

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.789 
on the feeling of their feet on the
ground<00:03:21.030> that's<00:03:22.030> it<00:03:22.360> now<00:03:22.989> whenever<00:03:23.200> you<00:03:23.410> focus

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
ground that's it now whenever you focus

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.860 
ground that's it now whenever you focus
internally<00:03:24.519> that<00:03:24.730> activates<00:03:25.360> that<00:03:25.600> part<00:03:25.810> of

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
internally that activates that part of

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.900 
internally that activates that part of
the<00:03:25.930> brain<00:03:26.110> called<00:03:26.140> an<00:03:26.440> insular<00:03:26.709> cortex<00:03:26.910> so

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
the brain called an insular cortex so

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.190 
the brain called an insular cortex so
they<00:03:28.000> put<00:03:28.180> a<00:03:28.209> timer<00:03:28.480> on<00:03:28.600> and<00:03:28.750> this<00:03:28.930> is<00:03:28.989> what<00:03:29.110> you

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
they put a timer on and this is what you

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.240 
they put a timer on and this is what you
need<00:03:29.320> to<00:03:29.410> do<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:29.709> I<00:03:29.739> would<00:03:29.860> recommend<00:03:29.980> that

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
need to do and I would recommend that

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.890 
need to do and I would recommend that
you<00:03:30.340> not<00:03:30.489> start<00:03:30.790> with<00:03:30.910> ten<00:03:31.060> minutes<00:03:31.329> but<00:03:31.840> maybe

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
you not start with ten minutes but maybe

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.020 
you not start with ten minutes but maybe
set<00:03:32.260> a<00:03:32.290> timer<00:03:32.530> for<00:03:32.650> one<00:03:32.950> minute<00:03:33.250> stand<00:03:33.610> up<00:03:33.790> and

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
set a timer for one minute stand up and

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.300 
set a timer for one minute stand up and
just<00:03:34.840> notice<00:03:35.320> what<00:03:35.500> your<00:03:35.650> feet<00:03:35.860> feel<00:03:36.040> like<00:03:36.070> on

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
just notice what your feet feel like on

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.259 
just notice what your feet feel like on
the<00:03:36.340> ground<00:03:36.489> and<00:03:36.760> you<00:03:36.820> can<00:03:36.910> almost<00:03:37.120> have<00:03:37.239> a

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
the ground and you can almost have a

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.150 
the ground and you can almost have a
conversation<00:03:37.600> about<00:03:37.989> where<00:03:38.680> do<00:03:38.769> I<00:03:38.829> feel<00:03:39.010> more

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
you're trying to do this in a really

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.390 
you're trying to do this in a really
non-judgmental<00:03:43.959> way<00:03:44.019> just<00:03:44.350> saying<00:03:44.530> what<00:03:45.220> do<00:03:45.340> I

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
feel now once you're able to work up to

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.720 
feel now once you're able to work up to
doing<00:03:49.180> this<00:03:49.450> maybe<00:03:49.720> five<00:03:50.079> to<00:03:50.260> ten<00:03:50.440> minutes<00:03:50.769> you

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
doing this maybe five to ten minutes you

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.699 
doing this maybe five to ten minutes you
then<00:03:51.970> begin<00:03:52.180> shifting<00:03:52.660> back<00:03:53.049> and<00:03:53.260> forth<00:03:53.500> and

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
then begin shifting back and forth and

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.289 
then begin shifting back and forth and
this<00:03:53.799> is<00:03:53.980> actually<00:03:54.280> the<00:03:54.370> real<00:03:54.519> key<00:03:54.760> piece<00:03:55.030> is

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
this is actually the real key piece is

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.599 
this is actually the real key piece is
called<00:03:55.840> attention<00:03:56.380> shuttling<00:03:56.980> my<00:03:57.190> ability<00:03:57.579> to

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
called attention shuttling my ability to

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.699 
called attention shuttling my ability to
focus<00:03:58.060> on<00:03:58.150> my<00:03:58.269> body<00:03:58.420> focus<00:03:59.320> on<00:03:59.440> the<00:03:59.500> world

around me focus back on my body so the

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.900 
around me focus back on my body so the
goal<00:04:02.620> is<00:04:02.859> once<00:04:03.100> you've<00:04:03.250> reached<00:04:03.400> five<00:04:03.640> to<00:04:03.760> ten

minutes of really being able to focus on
your<00:04:05.890> feet<00:04:06.130> you<00:04:06.670> then<00:04:06.880> open<00:04:07.390> your<00:04:07.510> eyes<00:04:07.630> you

eight<00:04:18.640> weeks<00:04:18.880> and<00:04:19.150> you<00:04:19.510> try<00:04:19.690> and<00:04:19.810> do<00:04:19.870> it<00:04:19.989> daily

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
eight weeks and you try and do it daily

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.290 
eight weeks and you try and do it daily
to<00:04:20.470> build<00:04:20.799> this<00:04:21.010> concept<00:04:21.760> into<00:04:21.880> your<00:04:22.060> brain

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
to build this concept into your brain

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.500 
to build this concept into your brain
but<00:04:23.020> what<00:04:23.169> we've<00:04:23.320> learned<00:04:23.560> over<00:04:23.830> time

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
but what we've learned over time

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.660 
but what we've learned over time
that<00:04:24.690> when<00:04:24.840> you<00:04:24.930> do<00:04:25.080> this<00:04:25.170> kind<00:04:25.320> of<00:04:25.440> exercise

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
that when you do this kind of exercise

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.220 
that when you do this kind of exercise
not<00:04:26.670> only<00:04:26.730> does<00:04:27.060> your<00:04:27.090> internal<00:04:27.720> sensation

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
not only does your internal sensation

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.050 
not only does your internal sensation
become<00:04:28.530> more<00:04:28.710> accurate<00:04:29.280> it<00:04:29.730> gives<00:04:29.970> you

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
become more accurate it gives you

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.970 
become more accurate it gives you
greater<00:04:30.330> emotional<00:04:30.870> control<00:04:31.140> so<00:04:31.830> that

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
greater emotional control so that

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:32.930 
greater emotional control so that
whenever<00:04:32.130> you're<00:04:32.340> faced<00:04:32.520> with<00:04:32.550> something

whenever you're faced with something

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.520 
whenever you're faced with something
more<00:04:33.090> difficult<00:04:33.300> rather<00:04:34.110> than<00:04:34.230> having<00:04:34.380> your

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
more difficult rather than having your

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.380 
more difficult rather than having your
brain<00:04:34.740> overreact<00:04:35.400> and<00:04:35.550> freak<00:04:35.730> out<00:04:35.910> and<00:04:36.150> go<00:04:36.210> oh
