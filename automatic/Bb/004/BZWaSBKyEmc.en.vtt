00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.220
 Good afternoon, friends are in touch, Sergey 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.740
 ravens site hands not glitches 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.590
 we keep talking about secrets and 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.080
 tricks and today I 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.170
 tell you about how to do facing 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.699
 tiled exterior corners of bathrooms in 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.670
 one of the previous video tutorials we 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.830
 learned to do the wall cladding master 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.619
 showed us how to lay tiles 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:30.660
 from the inside corner of the room let's 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.850
 look at this fragment again you 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:38.010
 see how the master puts the first 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.530
 tile from the corner and then the second tile 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.540
 here the main thing is to ensure the gap between 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.510
 tiles where then will fit 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.920
 grout 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.280
 what is special about facing 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.050
 angles ask you really approach to 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.899
 facing internal and external corners 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.360
 fundamentally different just so related 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.859
 tiles on the corner do not stick because 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.289
 the angle in this case will be 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.629
 sharp and ugly for outside corners 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.450
 apply the following technique is taken 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.600
 Bulgarian and the edges of each of the adjacent tiles 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.909
 grind at a 45 degree angle then 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.400
 pressed to the corner of each other tiles 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.909
 form a flat tiled angle of 90 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.229
 degrees 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:22.530
 let's see how this is done for 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:28.979
 start you need to moisten the tiles with water in this 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:31.710
 it will be easier to grind off the edges further 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.040
 the master takes the grinder and starts 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.920
 download the tile edge at an angle of 45 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.409
 degrees 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:44.420
 an experienced professional can do this 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.970
 a cut to the eye I will immediately say that the newcomers 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.520
 it will not be easy 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.240
 Therefore, all those who have not done such work 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.119
 spent 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.170
 I recommend to buy some store 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.659
 cheap tiles and as they say 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.820
 practice on them before already 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:08.200
 take up my dear tile 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:12.230
 Well, now you will see the final stage 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:16.130
 the master is doing the final touches now 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:24.320
 the tile will be ready and it will be possible 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:27.490
 stick to the outer corner of the wall and so 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:32.230
 finished tile with glue applied on it 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.230
 glued to the outer corner of the wall 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.580
 Please note that we are addressed as 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:46.160
 times exact at an angle of 45 degrees 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:48.530
 tiles are similarly prepared 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.220
 adjacent tile its edge 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.320
 also grinds at a 45 degree angle 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:03:01.130
 then glue is applied to it and it 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:03.980
 glued to the corner of the wall dear 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.380
 friends in this video lesson we learned with 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.209
 you do facing the outer corner 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.760
 bathroom walls 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.570
 and I say to you, goodbye to you was
