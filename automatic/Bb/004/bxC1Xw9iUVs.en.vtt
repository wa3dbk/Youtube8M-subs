00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.520
 the plastic shock absorbers for 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.160
 to stimulate suppression of overload 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.550
 shown are for non-commercial purposes only. 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.230
 demonstration in the real applications of 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:22.170
 pumps are recommended 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:24.810
 suppressors of metal in the 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.880
 take this device is designed 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.150
 to give a demonstration of a coup 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.160
 which can occur when the 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.780
 valves of a system close too much 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.149
 quickly 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.000
 we are approximately 70 meters from 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.489
 Copper coils are also inch with 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.070
 a relief valve and a valve in the 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.500
 only one suppressor of the pupil. 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.450
 overload at the point of discharge and a 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.579
 suppressor at the point of 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.680
 girl's entrance and moment colors when 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.170
 the liquid moves rapidly through 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:00.390
 plumbing or a system and is 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:04.049
 rapidly decelerating the power if 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.750
 concentrate and may cause pressure risk 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.060
 which can get to be four to eight 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.369
 times greater than the flow pressure 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.350
 normal and let's demonstrate this 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.659
 using a garden hose and 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.600
 tap water allowing the water to 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.770
 flows through this coil to 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.930
 followed by an exhaust pipe 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.990
 everything is normal the pressure down because 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.210
 everything is flowing well when this 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.759
 valve quickly 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.960
 it will be nothing in a fraction of a second 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.420
 because the liquid and will continue sliding 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.049
 through the Coil coil but there will be no 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.299
 no liquid at the top with the 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:47.610
 reverse your direction and return 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.860
 up to hit some and 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.840
 then it will be a peak pressure 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.490
 we have gauges called manometers 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.409
 with two needles 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.290
 none of them will remain at the 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.990
 High depression when the valve off 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.360
 closed 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.579
 now at this point of the well in God 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:12.340
 pulsation dampers are 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:17.769
 solving those of the coil that the speed 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:21.760
 the flow of oppressors does not use now I will 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:24.310
 quickly closing the valve can be seen 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.099
 the collision what has just happened and a 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.470
 small delay since the book had to 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.640
 back to the valve is toward the 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.220
 contrary 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.900
 we reached a pressure peak of 400 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.680
 terrible saw 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.930
 starting from a zero pressure point and 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.360
 in an instant so fast that the eye 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.610
 human being is unable to perceive but 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.610
 we were able to pick up the meter 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:55.480
 demonstrate this again to adjust the 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.640
 take care of the meter again and 0 more. 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.780
 this time I will introduce the 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.780
 system overload 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:10.560
 the valve to allow water to flow 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:13.930
 through the coil as before but now 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.630
 It serves the coil will be able to note with 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:25.239
 a needle of the meter practically does not 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:27.370
 there is no movement at all 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.769
 moment of pressure or possible damage 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.560
 caused to the plumbing system or 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.329
 in case this broke any marriage 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.549
 not even a possible damage caused 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:42.459
 any employee who is found by 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:44.620
 Awesome man kato that this is a 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.829
 container which allows the liquid 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:51.069
 comes back because instead of hatching or 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:54.010
 the fire is directed towards this 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:58.480
 gas overload suppressor 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:00.910
 Brazil where the liquid slowly and 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.880
 decelerates and thus avoiding a peak of 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.579
 pressure is close to the 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.790
 between a man instead of closing the 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:12.430
 Tip Inlet Valve 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.919
 close the discharge valve inside 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:20.260
 we have a shock absorber installed there 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:23.370
 why will it absorb initially? 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.370
 keep in the isolated 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:28.400
 paula was closed 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.040
 and there will be no delay because water 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.680
 will not revert to you but me more 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.170
 can be quickly seen being 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.940
 valuation dell no one we have a meter 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.940
 with my area that will not be allowed 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.530
 observe the reaction 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.480
 As you can see I found the whole 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.060
 device is instantly shaking the 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.910
 sun as soon as we suspend the places 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.900
 for the pressure navel reached 400 feet 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:56.080
 A sufficient pressure again to 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.210
 burst most pipes 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.910
 especially those of the ipvc where plastic and 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.670
 damage the sizes meters 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.650
 accessories and bombarral now open in 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.060
 to speak this is to judge the 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.610
 meter 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:15.040
 this time I bring the suppressor 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:17.990
 sixth system overhead again 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.240
 that the oppressors the market does is 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.150
 allow the liquid that has been 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.710
 accumulate up here and slow down in 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.390
 slowly so that there is no 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.610
 printing error or observe what 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.550
 happens to the system as soon as it 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:35.320
 valve 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.320
 As you can see, nothing happens. 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:41.120
 we managed to protect the working system 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.340
 and the employees preserve the product 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.710
 We leave satisfied the agency 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.450
 environmental protection all thanks to 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.190
 this device which absorbs this 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:53.050
 impact and prevent a peak pressure 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.050
 which could cause so much damage to the system
