aerial<00:00:04.020> awareness<00:00:04.440> is<00:00:04.620> a<00:00:05.130> tricky<00:00:05.490> thing

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:06.170 
aerial awareness is a tricky thing

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.780 
aerial awareness is a tricky thing
it's<00:00:07.170> essential<00:00:07.770> to<00:00:07.799> know<00:00:08.040> exactly<00:00:08.429> where<00:00:08.670> you

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
it's essential to know exactly where you

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.320 
it's essential to know exactly where you
are<00:00:08.820> in<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.179> air<00:00:09.300> you<00:00:10.460> want<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.610> know<00:00:11.730> quickly

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
are in the air you want to know quickly

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.660 
are in the air you want to know quickly
where<00:00:13.049> is<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.290> water<00:00:13.440> where<00:00:13.920> is<00:00:14.009> vertical<00:00:14.490> and

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
where is the water where is vertical and

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.939 
where is the water where is vertical and
that<00:00:14.910> way<00:00:15.030> you<00:00:15.089> can<00:00:15.269> have<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.420> good<00:00:15.570> dive<00:00:18.949> head

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
that way you can have a good dive head

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.800 
that way you can have a good dive head
position<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.820> definitely<00:00:21.300> one<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.689> the

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
position is is definitely one of the

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.929 
position is is definitely one of the
most<00:00:21.960> important<00:00:22.380> things<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:23.550> wouldn't<00:00:23.730> think

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
most important things you wouldn't think

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.130 
most important things you wouldn't think
about<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.300> maybe<00:00:24.449> if<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.720> don't<00:00:24.869> know<00:00:24.990> much

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
about it maybe if you don't know much

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.900 
about it maybe if you don't know much
about<00:00:25.170> diving<00:00:25.590> but<00:00:25.920> if<00:00:26.310> you're<00:00:26.490> in<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.670> sport

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
about diving but if you're in the sport

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.910 
about diving but if you're in the sport
a<00:00:27.000> little<00:00:27.210> bit<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.449> know<00:00:27.480> on<00:00:27.869> takeoff<00:00:28.320> if<00:00:28.740> you

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
a little bit you know on takeoff if you

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.859 
a little bit you know on takeoff if you
get<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.189> up<00:00:29.310> too<00:00:29.519> far<00:00:29.820> it's<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.390> side<00:00:30.599> or

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
get it up too far it's to the side or

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:31.880 
get it up too far it's to the side or
you're<00:00:30.990> looking<00:00:31.320> down<00:00:31.470> it's<00:00:31.679> going<00:00:31.830> to

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
you're looking down it's going to

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.319 
you're looking down it's going to
totally<00:00:32.130> throw<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.610> off<00:00:32.820> throughout<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.239> air

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
totally throw you off throughout the air

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.139 
totally throw you off throughout the air
you<00:00:33.450> can<00:00:33.600> get<00:00:33.750> lost<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.320> won't<00:00:34.469> feel<00:00:34.680> good<00:00:35.149> some

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
you can get lost it won't feel good some

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.180 
you can get lost it won't feel good some
of<00:00:36.270> my<00:00:36.360> coaches<00:00:36.750> actually<00:00:37.110> tell<00:00:37.320> me<00:00:37.410> it's<00:00:37.980> like

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
of my coaches actually tell me it's like

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.889 
of my coaches actually tell me it's like
putting<00:00:38.460> your<00:00:38.550> chin<00:00:38.760> on<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.910> shelf<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.360> you

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
putting your chin on a shelf and you

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.270 
putting your chin on a shelf and you
just<00:00:40.079> don't<00:00:40.290> move<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.770> leave<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.129> right

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
just don't move it you leave it right

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.560 
just don't move it you leave it right
there<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.670> kind<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.910> want<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.120> keep<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.480> a

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
there you kind of want to keep it in a

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.720 
there you kind of want to keep it in a
neutral<00:00:42.809> tight<00:00:43.530> position<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:44.550> know<00:00:44.640> if

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
neutral tight position you know if

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.069 
neutral tight position you know if
you're<00:00:44.850> twisting<00:00:45.239> sometimes<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.719> head<00:00:45.870> can

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
you're twisting sometimes a head can

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.020 
you're twisting sometimes a head can
come<00:00:46.260> around<00:00:46.399> right<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.610> that's<00:00:47.760> going<00:00:47.969> to

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
come around right and that's going to

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.150 
come around right and that's going to
throw<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.480> off<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.750> little<00:00:49.140> bit<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.710> would

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
throw you off a little bit so I would

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.830 
throw you off a little bit so I would
say<00:00:50.280> head<00:00:50.460> position<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:50.910> probably<00:00:51.329> one<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.690> the

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
say head position is probably one of the

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.869 
say head position is probably one of the
most<00:00:51.989> important<00:00:52.440> things<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.710> as<00:00:53.370> divers<00:00:53.760> we

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
most important things that as divers we

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.250 
most important things that as divers we
need<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.059> focus<00:00:54.210> on<00:00:54.449> especially<00:00:54.809> when

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
need to focus on especially when

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.790 
need to focus on especially when
twisting

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.310 

I<00:00:58.860> learned<00:00:59.610> in<00:00:59.790> you<00:01:00.420> know<00:01:00.540> maybe<00:01:00.840> like<00:01:01.110> an

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
I learned in you know maybe like an

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.920 
I learned in you know maybe like an
old-style<00:01:01.980> way<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.760> close<00:01:03.180> my<00:01:03.510> eyes<00:01:03.540> for<00:01:03.780> most

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
old-style way I close my eyes for most

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.560 
old-style way I close my eyes for most
of<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.140> dive<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.530> mean<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.430> see<00:01:05.970> where<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.270> would

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
of the dive I mean I I see where I would

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.120 
of the dive I mean I I see where I would
stretch<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.080> I'm<00:01:07.140> going<00:01:07.409> but<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.800> whole<00:01:07.979> time

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
stretch and I'm going but the whole time

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.410 
stretch and I'm going but the whole time
I'm<00:01:08.280> spinning<00:01:08.640> or<00:01:08.729> twisting<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.060> have<00:01:09.210> my<00:01:09.300> eyes

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
I'm spinning or twisting I have my eyes

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.680 
I'm spinning or twisting I have my eyes
closed<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.530> feel<00:01:10.740> exactly<00:01:11.040> where<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.369> am<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.850> I

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
closed and I feel exactly where I am I I

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.510 
closed and I feel exactly where I am I I
know<00:01:12.990> when<00:01:13.290> I'm<00:01:13.409> upside<00:01:13.740> down<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:13.950> know<00:01:14.250> when

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
know when I'm upside down I know when

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.770 
know when I'm upside down I know when
I'm<00:01:14.610> twisting<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.240> know<00:01:15.300> where<00:01:15.479> his<00:01:15.570> front

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
I'm twisting I know where his front

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.930 
I'm twisting I know where his front
where<00:01:15.900> his<00:01:15.990> back<00:01:16.170> but<00:01:17.100> that's<00:01:17.369> just<00:01:17.700> from

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
where his back but that's just from

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.850 
where his back but that's just from
doing<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.360> 20<00:01:19.229> 25<00:01:19.920> 30<00:01:20.190> years<00:01:21.320> when<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.350> started

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
doing it 20 25 30 years when I started

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.070 
doing it 20 25 30 years when I started
diving<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.460> started<00:01:23.909> learning<00:01:24.060> big<00:01:24.450> moves<00:01:24.750> I

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
diving I started learning big moves I

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.170 
diving I started learning big moves I
used<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.710> close<00:01:25.920> my<00:01:26.159> eyes<00:01:26.340> as<00:01:26.670> soon<00:01:26.850> as<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.060> got

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
used to close my eyes as soon as I got

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.749 
used to close my eyes as soon as I got
into<00:01:27.360> my<00:01:27.540> shape<00:01:27.840> but<00:01:28.710> my<00:01:28.890> coach<00:01:29.130> told<00:01:29.399> me<00:01:29.550> that

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
into my shape but my coach told me that

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.820 
into my shape but my coach told me that
she<00:01:30.119> wouldn't<00:01:30.330> let<00:01:30.540> me<00:01:30.690> learn<00:01:30.899> back<00:01:31.440> three<00:01:31.710> and

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
she wouldn't let me learn back three and

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.010 
she wouldn't let me learn back three and
a<00:01:31.860> half<00:01:32.039> somersaults<00:01:33.060> tucked<00:01:33.270> on<00:01:33.539> ten<00:01:33.780> meter

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
a half somersaults tucked on ten meter

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.710 
a half somersaults tucked on ten meter
unless<00:01:34.830> I<00:01:35.039> looked<00:01:35.610> where<00:01:35.940> I<00:01:35.970> was<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.570> end

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
unless I looked where I was in the end

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.279 
unless I looked where I was in the end
so<00:01:37.050> I<00:01:37.080> had<00:01:37.289> to<00:01:37.470> go<00:01:37.979> back<00:01:38.190> that<00:01:38.490> put<00:01:38.759> me<00:01:39.259> about<00:01:40.259> a

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
so I had to go back that put me about a

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:43.370 
so I had to go back that put me about a
year<00:01:40.880> backwards<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.060> my<00:01:42.090> training<00:01:42.690> to<00:01:42.960> relearn

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
year backwards in my training to relearn

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.880 
year backwards in my training to relearn
all<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.950> my<00:01:44.100> dives<00:01:44.369> with<00:01:44.729> my<00:01:44.880> eyes<00:01:45.060> open<00:01:45.539> and

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
all of my dives with my eyes open and

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.310 
all of my dives with my eyes open and
really<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.910> paid<00:01:48.179> off<00:01:48.210> eventually<00:01:49.140> and

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
really that that paid off eventually and

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.600 
really that that paid off eventually and
so<00:01:49.800> now<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.039> have<00:01:50.220> much<00:01:50.880> better<00:01:51.119> awareness<00:01:52.610> the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
so now I have much better awareness the

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.400 
so now I have much better awareness the
diver<00:01:53.820> when<00:01:54.119> he<00:01:54.240> leaves

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
diver when he leaves

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.389 
diver when he leaves
the<00:01:55.860> clip<00:01:56.460> he<00:01:57.119> needs<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.720> focus<00:01:57.990> on<00:01:58.440> certain

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
the clip he needs to focus on certain

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.650 
the clip he needs to focus on certain
targets<00:02:00.060> once<00:02:00.600> they<00:02:01.429> get<00:02:02.429> lost<00:02:02.819> it's<00:02:03.390> like

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
targets once they get lost it's like

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.240 
targets once they get lost it's like
being<00:02:03.989> in<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:05.090> tumble<00:02:06.090> machine<00:02:06.590> a<00:02:07.590> washing

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
being in a tumble machine a washing

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.600 
being in a tumble machine a washing
machine

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
machine

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.180 
machine
tumbling<00:02:09.090> where<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.509> really<00:02:09.989> become<00:02:10.739> can

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
tumbling where you really become can

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.430 
tumbling where you really become can
become<00:02:11.550> disorientated<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.569> that's<00:02:13.080> where

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
become disorientated and that's where

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.860 
become disorientated and that's where
for<00:02:13.470> a<00:02:14.360> cliff<00:02:15.360> diver

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
for a cliff diver

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.490 
for a cliff diver
it's<00:02:16.080> then<00:02:16.319> left<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.890> their<00:02:17.930> instinct<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.020> the

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
it's then left to their instinct and the

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.839 
it's then left to their instinct and the
fact<00:02:19.770> that<00:02:19.860> they've<00:02:20.130> done<00:02:20.489> that<00:02:21.390> maneuver

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
fact that they've done that maneuver

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.729 
fact that they've done that maneuver
many<00:02:23.849> many<00:02:24.120> times<00:02:24.510> before<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:25.590> it's

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
many many times before and so it's

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.470 
many many times before and so it's
almost<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:26.220> second<00:02:26.640> nature<00:02:26.849> that<00:02:27.180> they're<00:02:27.360> able

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
almost a second nature that they're able

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.300 
almost a second nature that they're able
to<00:02:27.780> complete<00:02:28.260> that<00:02:28.470> dive

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.920 

if<00:02:34.760> you<00:02:35.000> were<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.210> lose<00:02:35.360> where<00:02:35.600> you're<00:02:35.720> at<00:02:35.810> in

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
if you were to lose where you're at in

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.600 
if you were to lose where you're at in
the<00:02:35.960> air<00:02:36.140> that<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.890> biggest<00:02:37.310> thing<00:02:37.490> you<00:02:37.580> can

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.700 
the air that the biggest thing you can
do<00:02:37.880> is<00:02:38.120> not<00:02:38.390> panic<00:02:38.900> you<00:02:38.990> have<00:02:39.140> to<00:02:39.290> absolutely

do is not panic you have to absolutely

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.490 
do is not panic you have to absolutely
stay<00:02:40.220> calm<00:02:40.490> and<00:02:40.790> use<00:02:41.510> whatever<00:02:42.200> your
