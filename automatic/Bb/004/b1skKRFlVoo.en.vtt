00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
then I'm gonna get into trouble so

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.120 
then I'm gonna get into trouble so
because<00:03:45.120> I<00:03:45.150> loved<00:03:45.450> her<00:03:45.630> I<00:03:45.930> learned<00:03:46.410> to<00:03:46.650> keep<00:03:46.830> in

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
because I loved her I learned to keep in

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.730 
because I loved her I learned to keep in
my<00:03:47.910> cries<00:03:48.240> so<00:03:49.050> she<00:03:49.110> wouldn't<00:03:49.500> get<00:03:49.590> into

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
my cries so she wouldn't get into

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.080 
my cries so she wouldn't get into
trouble<00:03:49.800> even<00:03:50.190> though<00:03:50.340> she<00:03:50.460> was<00:03:50.640> beating<00:03:50.970> me

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
trouble even though she was beating me

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.120 
trouble even though she was beating me
with<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.240> broomstick<00:03:51.540> so<00:03:52.410> that's<00:03:52.590> probably<00:03:52.860> why

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
with a broomstick so that's probably why

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.830 
with a broomstick so that's probably why
now<00:03:53.340> that<00:03:53.730> I'm<00:03:53.820> doing<00:03:54.030> this<00:03:54.240> fight<00:03:54.510> thing<00:03:54.690> it

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
now that I'm doing this fight thing it

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.490 
now that I'm doing this fight thing it
doesn't<00:03:54.990> bother<00:03:55.200> me

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
doesn't bother me

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.890 
doesn't bother me
I<00:03:55.620> haven't<00:03:56.010> even<00:03:56.130> raised<00:03:56.400> a<00:03:56.490> heartbeat

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
I haven't even raised a heartbeat

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.320 
I haven't even raised a heartbeat
because<00:03:57.900> I<00:03:58.020> don't<00:03:58.170> think<00:03:58.320> anybody<00:03:59.150> can<00:04:00.150> make

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
because I don't think anybody can make

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.360 
because I don't think anybody can make
me<00:04:00.510> more<00:04:00.690> vulnerable<00:04:01.170> than<00:04:01.680> a<00:04:01.710> three-year-old

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
for the next 25 years just me it's what

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.060 
for the next 25 years just me it's what
if<00:05:01.710> all<00:05:01.890> of<00:05:01.919> us<00:05:02.100> did<00:05:02.310> this<00:05:03.590> on<00:05:04.590> a<00:05:04.620> whole<00:05:04.860> block

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
if all of us did this on a whole block

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.890 
if all of us did this on a whole block
how<00:05:05.580> many<00:05:05.730> thousands<00:05:06.300> of<00:05:06.360> people<00:05:06.600> will<00:05:06.690> get

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
how many thousands of people will get

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.450 
how many thousands of people will get
we'd<00:05:07.110> be<00:05:07.230> able<00:05:07.320> to<00:05:07.440> controvert<00:05:07.860> with<00:05:07.980> a<00:05:08.040> basic

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
we'd be able to controvert with a basic

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.790 
we'd be able to controvert with a basic
need<00:05:08.610> of<00:05:08.790> water<00:05:09.140> so<00:05:10.140> the<00:05:10.260> example<00:05:10.680> I'm<00:05:10.770> trying

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
need of water so the example I'm trying

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.290 
need of water so the example I'm trying
to<00:05:11.070> say<00:05:11.190> is<00:05:11.310> if<00:05:11.430> you<00:05:11.520> have<00:05:11.610> a<00:05:11.669> steady<00:05:11.910> on<00:05:12.120> line

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
to say is if you have a steady on line

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.970 
to say is if you have a steady on line
you<00:05:12.930> can<00:05:12.960> actually<00:05:13.200> reach<00:05:13.530> out<00:05:13.650> to<00:05:13.800> other

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:13.980 
you can actually reach out to other

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:35.850 
you can actually reach out to other
people<00:05:14.250> too

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.330 

that's<00:05:36.730> right<00:05:37.080> one<00:05:38.080> that's<00:05:38.290> fight<00:05:38.470> with

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
that's right one that's fight with

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.010 
that's right one that's fight with
myself

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
myself

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
myself
it's<00:05:41.020> when<00:05:41.140> I'm<00:05:41.260> trying<00:05:41.440> to<00:05:41.500> walk<00:05:41.890> around

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.040 
it's when I'm trying to walk around

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.120 
it's when I'm trying to walk around
tomorrow<00:05:42.460> that's<00:05:42.670> my<00:05:42.790> next<00:05:42.970> fight
