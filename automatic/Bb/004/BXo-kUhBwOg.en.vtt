00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.650
 this is the state park of old village in paraná this conservation unit 

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:07.920
 closed for two years to start a 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.080
 revitalization and control of invasive alien species 

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:16.489
 the old village state park is in the municipality of ponta grossa to 100 

00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:18.599
 kilometers from capital curitiba 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:21.599
 and occupies an area of ​​more than three thousand hectares 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.390
 the park is known to house an archaeological site of 18 kilometers 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.569
 squares 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:33.149
 are impressive rock formations natural sculptures 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.170
 caused by the action of rain and winds over thousands of years 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.610
 every single person in your ford escort for the eternal fight on the copies 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.860
 of the Brazilian flora such as Araucaria araucaria 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.270
 angustifolia 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.150
 we have black cinnamon and other species 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.640
 in the active besides being also a region of difficult oral investigation 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.020
 is one of the general fields' state of Paraná 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.500
 father who, for example, said that he was created to house these 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.530
 remnant important nothing 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.850
 of our flora 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.740
 should like machine guns feature 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.740
 the scenic beauty you have for evangelist 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.960
 in the campaign agenda the predominant biome in the area of ​​the park of 7 9 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.960
 few trees and lots of undergrowth 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.060
 by being an environment and naturally open it becomes more sensitive 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.149
 suffering the constant threat of theses that do not belong to this act the system 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:40.090
 the calls 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.090
 exotic invasive 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.250
 in the specific case of the old village state park 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.730
 the pinus this species of pine has disseminated in such a way the mission of the 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.870
 I love the diversity of the park 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:55.939
 the cocoa tree 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.180
 the growth campinas arrived in Brazil in the 19th century migrant trajectory 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:03.179
 for ornamental purposes and for the production of a 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.250
 but it was the species brought from North America in the 1940s that 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.139
 if best suited to the south of the country 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:14.819
 the worst are the parts that were first introduced for the purpose of 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.209
 wood production 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:27.730
 is that 

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:33.089
 has brought forth problems because of the logic in these ecosystems 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:34.809
 of the paraná 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:38.339
 then it has no problem notion that not only in the park and more in the state of 

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:39.209
 parana 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.589
 the pilot is a problem that is that he 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:45.379
 dc it has a very large capacity of occupying the environment 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.489
 the process of dispersing your seed is also quite 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.569
 quite large and even with this he took unix tricolor started 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:54.699
 shining 

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:57.699
 the place where he that he 5 I also né 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:03.149
 only conclude this eliminates our small local species 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:09.539
 and another problem that has to make me dull to be serious 

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:13.159
 that is the problem of these leaves of it are known as the ones like the 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:17.120
 they fall asleep snow in their composition process releasing tissues and 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.279
 feather commission the chemical composition of the soil 

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:25.029
 promoting environmental change and with that meanwhile suspended 

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:28.219
 not adapted this new environment also ends up being paid 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:31.219
 O 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.809
 in another part of the parana 

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:40.809
 we see a real invasion of the reptilians 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.189
 the fact that it ends in September because it allows expectations with 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:49.530
 federation for fifth 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.190
 the contention when it was bloody insufficient to survive 

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:04.719
 here in the monk's state park we realize how a pilot is a specific 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:08.400
 aggressive invader is not theirs is here we have a real example 

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:10.060
 of biological contamination 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.140
 the pivot has regenerated intensely choking our expense and we have people 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.060
 you can see that they are very close to each other, but the 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.509
 enter a small 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:22.659
 in the middle of these pins 

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:26.830
 we understand when you talk about bleeding, it's not that I hope 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.169
 They can not 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.830
 it happened to live well 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.129
 illness 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:33.400
 the pec will have to break 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.460
 underneath they are copying we can not find any species 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.380
 native survivor did not look for Italy but I find it very difficult now 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.800
 said 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.520
 this is a kind of narrative that is practically 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.710
 suffocated by the foundation and fall of the regime and we 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:54.979
 but would fatally die if there was no withdrawal intervention from them 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:56.300
 I detected in the service 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.849
 but she is a surviving warrior moments and a half exactly she is 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:05.060
 surviving but she will have 30 each vehicle with the attendance in the piece to 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.659
 more and more light 

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:10.259
 and opined from there each time to prevent this this fight 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:13.259
 by pcp cement 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:19.499
 another spectator who proves that plateau impacts system up to the brachiaria 

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:20.620
 who stays 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.400
 that was brought to Brazil for pasture formation 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.789
 and ended up contaminating this natural environment 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:27.960
 the brachiaria 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.870
 she eliminates even made donations she makes a cover 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.330
 to compete 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.990
 are portion of food 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.449
 and expectations are shifting until the team is late. 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:44.110
 injunction in favor of anything completely of the place I saw that many defense that also 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.529
 delicacy studied early 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:50.439
 and I saw what I had done and with this competition then it is the predominance 

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:54.330
 of the pf had a fracture we may have different faith loss 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.420
 many of them and it was not even the mayor's invitation 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.589
 we are talking about the seriousness of the problem of invasive species 

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:05.279
 in a little while you will see how you can control this 

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:08.279
 Curated back already 

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:19.400
 sonic ecology is back 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.629
 and in today's program we are talking about species 

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:25.889
 that out of their habitat threaten the planet's biodiversity 

00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:29.900
 are the invasive species 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.680
 the jackdaw is so unpopular in Brazil that we even think she's from home 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.689
 but it is not 

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:40.080
 the jackfruit originates in India and other Asian countries 

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:44.909
 arrived here in the 19th century and acclimatized in almost the whole country 

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:48.499
 but is an invasive alien species 

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:52.819
 hinders the establishment of other native plants by altering the ecosystem 

00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:57.939
 and already they already start the house well as the lumps it has 

00:06:57.939 --> 00:07:02.580
 when the box that can on the ground each of the seeds that in the case of jackfruit 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:07.149
 are very fertile can generate a new jaqueira in addition to spreading around a 

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:10.409
 substance that does not allow the development of other species 

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:14.979
 the reporter also effective now shows how the program works 

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:17.049
 control of pinus in the south of the country
