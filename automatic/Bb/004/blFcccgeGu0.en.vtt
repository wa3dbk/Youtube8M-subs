and a half inch you don't want it over
tight<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.029> loads<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.510> bearing<00:00:27.869> but

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
tight so the loads of the bearing but

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.419 
tight so the loads of the bearing but
enough<00:00:28.289> that<00:00:28.320> you've<00:00:28.619> got<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.800> little<00:00:28.949> bit<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.279> a

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
enough that you've got a little bit of a

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.089 
enough that you've got a little bit of a
movement<00:00:29.970> still<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:31.320> adjust<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.890> chain

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
movement still to adjust the chain

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.729 
movement still to adjust the chain
there's<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.399> couple<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.759> things<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:33.000> can<00:00:33.180> do<00:00:33.739> if

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
there's a couple of things you can do if

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.560 
there's a couple of things you can do if
it's<00:00:34.950> not<00:00:35.130> out<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.430> adjustment<00:00:35.700> terribly<00:00:36.360> bad

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
it's not out of adjustment terribly bad

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.080 
it's not out of adjustment terribly bad
we<00:00:37.320> take<00:00:38.450> 13<00:00:39.450> millimeter<00:00:40.700> and<00:00:41.700> then<00:00:41.820> should

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
we take 13 millimeter and then should

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.150 
we take 13 millimeter and then should
put<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.360> on<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:42.570> bolt<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.140> on<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.649> backside

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
put it on this bolt and on the backside

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.010 
put it on this bolt and on the backside
here<00:00:44.190> there's<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.670> 14<00:00:45.180> millimeter<00:00:45.390> on<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
here there's a 14 millimeter on the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.229 
here there's a 14 millimeter on the
adjuster<00:00:47.750> back<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:48.989> off<00:00:49.789> you<00:00:50.789> want<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.000> back

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
adjuster back this off you want to back

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.889 
adjuster back this off you want to back
that<00:00:51.270> out<00:00:51.750> enough<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.320> get<00:00:52.469> some<00:00:52.649> play

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.700 

that<00:00:57.899> allows<00:00:58.170> us<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.559> move<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.430> adjuster

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
that allows us to move the adjuster

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.020 
that allows us to move the adjuster
until<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.980> get<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.190> proper<00:01:02.430> turn<00:01:02.760> set<00:01:03.000> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
until you get the proper turn set the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.539 
until you get the proper turn set the
proper<00:01:03.510> adjustment<00:01:04.019> on<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.170> chain<00:01:04.470> we'll<00:01:05.400> go

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
proper adjustment on the chain we'll go

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:23.460 
proper adjustment on the chain we'll go
ahead<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.700> tighten<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.180> back<00:01:06.420> up

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.380 

check<00:01:24.470> to<00:01:24.650> see<00:01:24.680> if<00:01:24.920> it's<00:01:25.040> about<00:01:25.310> right<00:01:25.550> -<00:01:26.300> the

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
check to see if it's about right - the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.969 
check to see if it's about right - the
pairs<00:01:26.630> of<00:01:26.720> ink<00:01:27.020> this<00:01:27.200> side<00:01:27.380> will<00:01:27.530> put<00:01:27.680> a<00:01:27.710> 10

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
pairs of ink this side will put a 10

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.060 
pairs of ink this side will put a 10
millimeter<00:01:28.250> back<00:01:28.640> on<00:01:28.850> here<00:01:29.979> just<00:01:30.979> a<00:01:31.190> lock<00:01:31.430> nut

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
millimeter back on here just a lock nut

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.410 
millimeter back on here just a lock nut
run<00:01:34.070> this<00:01:34.250> nut<00:01:34.580> down<00:01:35.560> so<00:01:36.560> it's<00:01:36.860> just<00:01:37.160> a<00:01:37.420> slight

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
run this nut down so it's just a slight

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.180 
run this nut down so it's just a slight
bit<00:01:38.660> of<00:01:38.690> tension<00:01:40.060> on<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.240> bracket<00:01:42.040> just<00:01:43.040> like

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
bit of tension on the bracket just like

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.640 
bit of tension on the bracket just like
that<00:01:43.510> those<00:01:44.510> two<00:01:44.780> work<00:01:44.960> together<00:01:45.140> to<00:01:45.410> keep<00:01:45.530> it

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
that those two work together to keep it

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.270 
that those two work together to keep it
in<00:01:45.740> place<00:01:46.780> if<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:48.080> chain<00:01:48.500> is<00:01:48.530> too<00:01:48.890> far<00:01:49.160> to

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
in place if the chain is too far to

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.160 
in place if the chain is too far to
adjustment<00:01:49.820> what<00:01:50.030> has<00:01:50.149> happened<00:01:50.570> if<00:01:50.990> the

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
adjustment what has happened if the

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
into the rubber between the engine of

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.780 
into the rubber between the engine of
the<00:02:35.269> mounting<00:02:35.570> plate<00:02:36.340> now<00:02:37.340> that<00:02:37.519> we've<00:02:37.610> got

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
the mounting plate now that we've got

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.160 
the mounting plate now that we've got
the<00:02:37.910> chain<00:02:38.120> adjusted<00:02:38.630> we'll<00:02:38.780> go<00:02:38.930> ahead<00:02:39.049> and

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
the chain adjusted we'll go ahead and

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.460 
the chain adjusted we'll go ahead and
lubricate<00:02:39.680> it<00:02:39.709> it's<00:02:40.370> easiest<00:02:40.940> to<00:02:41.090> use<00:02:41.150> a<00:02:41.269> block

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.569 

so<00:02:45.470> that<00:02:45.560> you<00:02:45.680> can<00:02:45.799> spin<00:02:46.070> the<00:02:46.190> rear<00:02:46.370> wheel

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
so that you can spin the rear wheel

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:51.840 
so that you can spin the rear wheel
freely<00:02:49.690> go<00:02:50.690> ahead<00:02:50.840> and<00:02:50.959> just<00:02:51.049> use<00:02:51.170> common

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
freely go ahead and just use common

00:02:51.850 --> 00:03:10.990 
freely go ahead and just use common
chain<00:02:52.850> lube

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.430 

once<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.150> make<00:03:12.330> a<00:03:12.360> full<00:03:12.660> revolution<00:03:13.319> with

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
once you make a full revolution with

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.390 
once you make a full revolution with
that<00:03:14.360> chain<00:03:15.360> will<00:03:15.510> be<00:03:15.629> moved<00:03:15.870> well<00:03:16.220> you<00:03:17.220> ready

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
that chain will be moved well you ready

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.700 
that chain will be moved well you ready
to<00:03:17.519> go
