you

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.620 

then<00:01:51.720> you're<00:01:51.960> going<00:01:52.050> to<00:01:52.140> use<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:53.210> razor<00:01:54.210> comb

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
shape so then the shortest section of

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.970 
shape so then the shortest section of
the<00:02:02.940> hair<00:02:03.180> will<00:02:03.390> be<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:04.350> middle<00:02:04.560> where<00:02:04.860> your
