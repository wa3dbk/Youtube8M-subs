Sea survey for Cousteau diver program
I've<00:00:39.790> managed<00:00:40.360> to<00:00:40.450> put<00:00:41.140> together<00:00:41.290> this<00:00:41.830> survey

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
I've managed to put together this survey

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.200 
I've managed to put together this survey
which<00:00:43.000> is<00:00:43.390> both<00:00:44.110> simple<00:00:44.500> so<00:00:45.460> anyone<00:00:45.790> can<00:00:45.940> do<00:00:46.090> it

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
which is both simple so anyone can do it

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.190

is of course being entertaining being

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.960 
is of course being entertaining being
fun<00:01:02.980> you're<00:01:03.980> underwater<00:01:04.309> and<00:01:04.640> you're<00:01:04.760> doing

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
fun you're underwater and you're doing

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.340 
fun you're underwater and you're doing
an<00:01:05.059> investigation<00:01:05.660> you're<00:01:05.930> working<00:01:06.230> out

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
an investigation you're working out

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.410 
an investigation you're working out
there<00:01:06.530> some<00:01:06.680> species<00:01:07.160> you're<00:01:07.790> you're<00:01:08.270> really

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
there some species you're you're really

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.200 
there some species you're you're really
becoming<00:01:09.140> an<00:01:09.470> active<00:01:09.770> agent<00:01:09.950> of<00:01:10.370> the

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
conservation of the underwater world so

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.190 
conservation of the underwater world so
a<00:01:14.780> little<00:01:15.080> bit<00:01:15.170> about<00:01:15.290> the<00:01:15.410> survey<00:01:17.200> basically

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
a little bit about the survey basically

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.750 
a little bit about the survey basically
you'll<00:01:18.620> be<00:01:18.770> recording<00:01:19.010> what<00:01:19.340> you<00:01:19.460> see<00:01:19.640> down

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
you'll be recording what you see down

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.400 
you'll be recording what you see down
there<00:01:19.970> so<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.510> kind<00:01:20.750> of<00:01:20.870> environment<00:01:21.350> the

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
there so the kind of environment the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.690 
there so the kind of environment the
kind<00:01:21.590> of<00:01:21.680> geological<00:01:22.190> environment<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:22.640> kind

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
kind of geological environment the kind

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.270 
kind of geological environment the kind
of<00:01:22.850> biological<00:01:23.420> environment<00:01:23.810> some<00:01:24.229> key<00:01:24.979> bio

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
of biological environment some key bio

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.730 
of biological environment some key bio
indicator<00:01:25.820> species<00:01:26.180> so<00:01:26.960> some<00:01:27.170> species<00:01:27.440> when

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
indicator species so some species when

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.840 
indicator species so some species when
you<00:01:27.830> see<00:01:28.009> them<00:01:28.190> they<00:01:28.220> tell<00:01:28.550> you<00:01:28.700> something

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
you see them they tell you something

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.280 
you see them they tell you something
about<00:01:29.119> the<00:01:29.420> health<00:01:29.630> of<00:01:29.750> your<00:01:29.810> dive<00:01:30.050> site

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
about the health of your dive site

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.200 
about the health of your dive site
whatever<00:01:31.070> you<00:01:31.369> see<00:01:31.520> down<00:01:31.670> there<00:01:31.850> basically

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
whatever you see down there basically

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.660 
whatever you see down there basically
you<00:01:32.450> write<00:01:32.630> down<00:01:32.810> it<00:01:33.680> transforms<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:34.520> way<00:01:34.610> you

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
you write down it transforms the way you

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.130 
you write down it transforms the way you
died<00:01:34.880> you<00:01:35.180> become<00:01:35.450> an<00:01:35.570> investigator

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
died you become an investigator

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.930 
died you become an investigator
