00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.649
 Hello everyone and today we will analyze you 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.110
 Here is such a simple elevator for 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:39.320
 I have a beginner guitar tuned suddenly 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:45.040
 c you can configure and suddenly d 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:53.570
 there will not be much difference how it is played 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:57.760
 pinch 3 with one finger this 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.760
 movement do three times here 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:15.900
 the wilderness of his sixth 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:23.700
 play the fourth fourth they are not wilderness 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:35.310
 he is her they are not wilderness he is her well when we are all 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:41.070
 equal to drowning when lost farther 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:46.520
 we are 6 and 4 frets three times in the third 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.520
 then 6 and 4 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.810
 it's just 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:13.000
 not 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:13.000
 I think I can see that 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:39.099
 and the second move is also from 3 frets only 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:39.099
 we will have not 6 and 4 but 8 and 6 that is 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:51.790
 same shorter paradise only here 8 and 6 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.790
 and now all together 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:27.810
 and this I have already added from myself 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:31.700
 nothing to do here, in principle, the whole reef 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.700
 Good luck, guys, bye
