so<00:01:00.129> for<00:01:00.430> example<00:01:00.789> when<00:01:00.910> I<00:01:00.940> was<00:01:01.149> looking<00:01:01.420> at<00:01:01.510> MIT

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
so for example when I was looking at MIT

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:03.930 
so for example when I was looking at MIT
as<00:01:02.020> a<00:01:02.079> school<00:01:02.350> I<00:01:02.620> pictured<00:01:03.520> it<00:01:03.550> as<00:01:03.670> a<00:01:03.699> place

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
as a school I pictured it as a place

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.550 
as a school I pictured it as a place
where<00:01:03.969> people<00:01:04.360> did<00:01:04.539> science<00:01:04.899> and<00:01:05.019> engineering

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
where people did science and engineering

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.980 
where people did science and engineering
all<00:01:05.740> the<00:01:05.979> time<00:01:06.220> and<00:01:06.670> no<00:01:07.330> one<00:01:07.479> really<00:01:07.570> had<00:01:07.810> any

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
all the time and no one really had any

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.350 
all the time and no one really had any
fun<00:01:08.200> or<00:01:08.229> even<00:01:08.740> smiled<00:01:09.039> and<00:01:09.430> really<00:01:10.210> nothing

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
fun or even smiled and really nothing

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.490 
fun or even smiled and really nothing
could<00:01:10.630> be<00:01:10.690> farther<00:01:10.869> from<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:11.229> truth

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
could be farther from the truth

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.499 
could be farther from the truth
so<00:01:11.649> in<00:01:11.770> my<00:01:11.920> tours<00:01:12.250> I<00:01:12.580> really<00:01:13.090> like<00:01:13.240> to<00:01:13.360> show

actually another one of my favorite

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.250

places at MIT and if you've ever been on
MIT<00:03:00.710> website<00:03:01.310> or<00:03:01.610> if<00:03:01.820> you've<00:03:02.000> ever<00:03:02.210> seen<00:03:02.540> a

post<00:03:02.900> part<00:03:03.170> of<00:03:03.260> MIT<00:03:03.470> you've<00:03:04.100> probably<00:03:04.340> seen

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
post part of MIT you've probably seen

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.450 
post part of MIT you've probably seen
this<00:03:05.060> shot<00:03:05.420> so<00:03:06.410> one<00:03:06.530> of<00:03:06.620> my<00:03:06.680> favorite<00:03:06.980> parts<00:03:07.250> of

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
this shot so one of my favorite parts of

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.090 
this shot so one of my favorite parts of
the<00:03:08.120> tour<00:03:08.420> is<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:09.140> ability<00:03:09.590> to<00:03:09.620> sort<00:03:09.830> of<00:03:09.890> tell

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
the tour is the ability to sort of tell

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.860 
the tour is the ability to sort of tell
a<00:03:10.130> few<00:03:10.280> stories<00:03:10.370> about<00:03:10.970> mi<00:03:11.240> t--'s<00:03:11.450> history

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
a few stories about mi t--'s history

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.500 
a few stories about mi t--'s history
whether<00:03:12.080> they<00:03:12.350> be<00:03:12.410> about<00:03:13.400> our<00:03:13.700> campus<00:03:14.150> itself

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
whether they be about our campus itself

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.360 
whether they be about our campus itself
or<00:03:14.840> some<00:03:14.990> of<00:03:15.110> our<00:03:15.200> famous<00:03:15.440> hacks<00:03:15.830> or<00:03:16.160> things

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
or some of our famous hacks or things

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.050 
or some of our famous hacks or things
like<00:03:16.490> that

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
like that

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.550 
like that
I<00:03:17.090> think<00:03:17.570> it<00:03:17.660> adds<00:03:17.840> sort<00:03:18.260> of<00:03:18.350> another

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
I think it adds sort of another

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.290 
I think it adds sort of another
dimension<00:03:18.770> to<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:19.430> tour<00:03:19.640> and<00:03:19.910> really<00:03:20.120> gets

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
dimension to the tour and really gets

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.230 
dimension to the tour and really gets
the<00:03:20.480> group<00:03:21.260> involved<00:03:22.070> with<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:22.550> tour<00:03:22.820> itself

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
the group involved with the tour itself

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.240 
the group involved with the tour itself
and<00:03:23.600> it's<00:03:23.990> not<00:03:24.200> just<00:03:24.500> like<00:03:24.740> you're<00:03:25.070> just

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
and it's not just like you're just

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.430 
and it's not just like you're just
pointing<00:03:25.880> out<00:03:25.940> landmarks<00:03:26.660> and<00:03:26.900> giving<00:03:27.320> out

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
pointing out landmarks and giving out

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.920 
pointing out landmarks and giving out
random<00:03:27.920> trivia<00:03:28.130> it's<00:03:28.550> also<00:03:28.820> you're<00:03:29.600> sort<00:03:29.840> of

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
random trivia it's also you're sort of

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.870 
random trivia it's also you're sort of
involving<00:03:30.440> them<00:03:30.590> in<00:03:30.709> a<00:03:30.770> little<00:03:30.980> piece<00:03:31.280> of<00:03:31.610> V

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
involving them in a little piece of V

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.820 
involving them in a little piece of V

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
great when I can give a tour to somebody

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.960 
great when I can give a tour to somebody
and<00:04:02.150> I<00:04:02.330> can<00:04:02.510> just<00:04:02.660> watch<00:04:02.900> them<00:04:03.260> change<00:04:03.790> like<00:04:04.790> as

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
and I can just watch them change like as

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.540 
and I can just watch them change like as
as<00:04:05.750> I'm<00:04:05.989> talking<00:04:06.200> to<00:04:06.500> them<00:04:06.620> and<00:04:06.890> watch<00:04:07.160> their

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
as I'm talking to them and watch their

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.390 
as I'm talking to them and watch their
self-confidence<00:04:08.239> rise<00:04:08.540> as<00:04:08.900> I<00:04:09.410> tell<00:04:09.680> them<00:04:09.920> you

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
self-confidence rise as I tell them you

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.420 
self-confidence rise as I tell them you
know<00:04:10.840> what<00:04:11.840> I<00:04:12.050> looked<00:04:12.410> like<00:04:12.500> when<00:04:12.800> I<00:04:12.860> was<00:04:13.010> in

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
know what I looked like when I was in

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.810 
know what I looked like when I was in
high<00:04:13.610> school<00:04:13.970> and<00:04:14.560> I<00:04:15.560> really<00:04:15.800> think<00:04:16.370> that

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
high school and I really think that

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.550 
high school and I really think that
that's<00:04:17.060> one<00:04:17.359> of<00:04:17.450> the<00:04:17.510> best<00:04:17.720> parts<00:04:18.169> about<00:04:18.500> being

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
that's one of the best parts about being

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.440 
that's one of the best parts about being
a<00:04:19.070> tour<00:04:19.280> guide<00:04:19.459> is<00:04:19.669> that<00:04:19.700> you<00:04:19.940> really<00:04:20.239> get<00:04:20.330> to

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
a tour guide is that you really get to

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.050 
a tour guide is that you really get to
change<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:21.019> way<00:04:21.169> people<00:04:21.590> see<00:04:21.950> MIT<00:04:22.310> one<00:04:22.910> thing

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
change the way people see MIT one thing

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.490 
change the way people see MIT one thing
that's<00:04:23.210> cool<00:04:23.360> about<00:04:23.419> being<00:04:23.660> a<00:04:23.900> tour<00:04:24.110> guide<00:04:24.290> is

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
that's cool about being a tour guide is

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.620 
that's cool about being a tour guide is
every<00:04:24.919> single<00:04:25.130> tour<00:04:25.490> you<00:04:25.640> give<00:04:25.970> you're<00:04:26.480> going

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
every single tour you give you're going

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.820 
every single tour you give you're going
to<00:04:26.690> be<00:04:26.810> with<00:04:26.960> a<00:04:26.990> different<00:04:27.290> group<00:04:27.350> of<00:04:27.530> people

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
to be with a different group of people

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.860 
to be with a different group of people
so<00:04:28.040> you<00:04:28.070> really<00:04:28.400> get<00:04:28.520> a<00:04:28.580> sense<00:04:28.820> of<00:04:29.030> the<00:04:29.510> number

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
so you really get a sense of the number

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.810 
so you really get a sense of the number
of<00:04:29.900> people<00:04:30.200> who<00:04:30.440> are<00:04:30.500> interested<00:04:30.740> in<00:04:30.979> MIT<00:04:31.340> we

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
of people who are interested in MIT we

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.940 
of people who are interested in MIT we
can<00:04:31.970> literally<00:04:32.270> have<00:04:32.800> 300

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
can literally have 300

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.130 
can literally have 300
signed<00:04:34.430> up<00:04:34.580> for<00:04:34.610> one<00:04:34.910> tour<00:04:35.240> and<00:04:35.480> will<00:04:35.630> fill<00:04:35.960> up

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
signed up for one tour and will fill up

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.620 
signed up for one tour and will fill up
the<00:04:36.530> entire<00:04:36.980> main<00:04:37.280> lobby<00:04:37.580> of<00:04:37.730> MIT<00:04:38.150> and<00:04:38.510> will

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
the entire main lobby of MIT and will

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.780 
the entire main lobby of MIT and will
have<00:04:38.780> 15<00:04:39.470> different<00:04:39.680> tour<00:04:40.070> guides<00:04:40.310> there<00:04:40.610> and

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
have 15 different tour guides there and

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.160 
have 15 different tour guides there and
we'll<00:04:40.880> have<00:04:40.910> to<00:04:41.090> divide<00:04:41.270> up<00:04:41.570> all<00:04:41.720> the<00:04:41.900> group<00:04:42.020> of

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
we'll have to divide up all the group of

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.780 
we'll have to divide up all the group of
people<00:04:42.440> into<00:04:42.680> different<00:04:43.010> ones<00:04:43.160> and<00:04:43.370> organize

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
people into different ones and organize

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.310 
people into different ones and organize
it<00:04:44.030> and<00:04:44.180> it<00:04:44.450> can<00:04:44.570> be<00:04:44.660> a<00:04:44.690> little<00:04:44.990> bit<00:04:45.110> of<00:04:45.200> a

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
it and it can be a little bit of a

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.620 
it and it can be a little bit of a
logistics<00:04:45.950> challenge<00:04:46.460> so<00:04:46.730> it's<00:04:47.180> kind<00:04:47.390> of<00:04:47.450> fun

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
logistics challenge so it's kind of fun

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:48.880 
logistics challenge so it's kind of fun
and<00:04:47.750> it<00:04:47.870> really<00:04:48.020> does<00:04:48.230> give<00:04:48.380> you<00:04:48.410> a<00:04:48.500> sense<00:04:48.740> of

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
and it really does give you a sense of

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.220 
and it really does give you a sense of
mi<00:04:49.100> t--'s<00:04:49.340> place<00:04:49.580> in<00:04:49.760> the<00:04:49.850> world<00:04:50.060> and<00:04:50.420> just<00:04:51.110> how

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
mi t--'s place in the world and just how

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.310 
mi t--'s place in the world and just how
lucky<00:04:51.560> we<00:04:51.710> are<00:04:51.740> to<00:04:51.980> be<00:04:52.010> here
