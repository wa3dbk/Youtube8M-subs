00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:18.100
 dice korpershoek and I myself the way antwerp and the nominees for the 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.159

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:21.510
 carry youth literature prize 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.569
 and talk about it 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:27.499
 and then not home-made, but we don't 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:30.859
 good and we therefore strongly rely on these figures coming up 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.830
 the damage is better than the basket 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.230
 the hague anp the netherlands take the cyclist out of the country for clarity 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.690
 in my head a bit thick the bond 9 i think that's right she goes at that 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.690
 very remarkable incident 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.239
 this is a fictional facebook smash korea 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.579
 But then over ten years it is meant to be left much larger 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.000
 they touched very quickly 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 it becomes a very large number of companies very important 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.940
 voltage and 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.670
 there are two camps in the world the camp that says the open goes way too far 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.430
 with internet and we also just have to see work and not just on the 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.610
 top of it doesn't do everything digitally 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.560
 and privacy la la and there are people who say like mee holland cup the person at 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.640
 the circle 2 everything must be internet 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.100
 and the privacy has been violated everyone must be able to see everything everyone must 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.450
 everything can be better 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.170
 I think that Westerbork camp 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.220
 well me mine 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.680
 I'm not coming anymore 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.790
 that fair fight 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.400
 I haven't fully fought that out myself and in there 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.729
 it may seem very difficult to kill now 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.680
 it had to be written nice both lod reads nice and read very tasty 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.080
 and the whole thing escalates and it is exciting though, of course you really have to 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.080
 well connected 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.870
