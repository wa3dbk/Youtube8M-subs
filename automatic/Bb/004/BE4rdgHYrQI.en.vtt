their sleeves unite these people with a
common<00:02:13.610> purpose<00:02:14.060> common<00:02:14.720> cause<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:15.260> know

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
common purpose common cause you know

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.399 
common purpose common cause you know
let's<00:02:15.560> make<00:02:16.189> water<00:02:16.790> you<00:02:17.480> know<00:02:17.599> the<00:02:17.810> resources

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
let's make water you know the resources

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.240 
let's make water you know the resources
available<00:02:18.439> to<00:02:18.980> people<00:02:19.189> that<00:02:19.430> need<00:02:19.640> it<00:02:19.670> let's

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
available to people that need it let's

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.060 
available to people that need it let's
so<00:02:20.370> use<00:02:21.210> the<00:02:21.480> water<00:02:21.720> as<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:21.990> resource<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:22.980> know

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
so use the water as a resource you know

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.250 
so use the water as a resource you know
properly<00:02:23.730> for<00:02:23.970> farming<00:02:24.450> for<00:02:24.630> agriculture<00:02:25.230> and

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
properly for farming for agriculture and

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.110 
properly for farming for agriculture and
all<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.500> different<00:02:25.830> things<00:02:25.980> we<00:02:26.070> need<00:02:26.430> but

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
all the different things we need but

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.900 
all the different things we need but
let's<00:02:27.420> use<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:27.810> wisely<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.740> so<00:02:29.340> you<00:02:29.400> need<00:02:29.730> an

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
let's use it wisely and so you need an

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.750 
let's use it wisely and so you need an
organization<00:02:30.690> like<00:02:30.720> circle<00:02:31.320> of<00:02:31.440> blue<00:02:31.550> to<00:02:32.550> put

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
organization like circle of blue to put

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.690 
organization like circle of blue to put
all<00:02:32.910> these<00:02:33.270> ideas<00:02:33.930> together<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.830> I<00:02:35.400> guess

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
all these ideas together and I guess

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.550 
all these ideas together and I guess
make<00:02:36.120> all<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.480> people<00:02:36.780> realize<00:02:37.170> we<00:02:37.410> have<00:02:37.500> a

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
make all the people realize we have a

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.560 
make all the people realize we have a
common<00:02:37.980> purpose<00:02:38.250> here<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:38.940> put<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.330> little

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
common purpose here and put the little

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.410 
common purpose here and put the little
differences<00:02:39.959> aside<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.860> work<00:02:40.950> where<00:02:41.880> we<00:02:42.090> we

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
differences aside and work where we we

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.120 
differences aside and work where we we
have<00:02:42.600> common<00:02:42.870> interest<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.620> there's<00:02:43.800> a<00:02:43.860> whole
