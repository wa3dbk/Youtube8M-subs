00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 what it represents is how it is in this 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.250
 extensive also this month of the 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.960
 quickly of something that is causing 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.929
 right now an uproar for the networks 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.990
 social this famous white dress with 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.350
 gold or blue with black all sides is 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.510
 Now it does not matter that you know the dress 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.430
 they already said what color is the dress already 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.619
 it is proven that the dress is 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.600
 blue with black because the owner of the 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.300
 store where they went to take this photo and 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.920
 even published the dress in the in 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.779
 offer so that people buy it well 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.960
 that are with black but beyond 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.430
 that I will explain a little bit 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.920
 scientifically speaking of that treaty 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.170
 because it is that people or 72% of the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.660
 people see white with gold and the other 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.500
 28% of the population sees it blue with black 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.090
 for this I must explain something about 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.950
 of our eyes and I'm going to read it because 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.660
 this is going to be pretty fast 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.640
 the cones are a part of our eyes 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.250
 to help you see colors more details 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.840
 nuances is the appreciation of light for 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.190
 who were never physically or not 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.289
 they presented did not pay attention 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.409
 natural actions or biology classes 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.100
 we have good in this case the 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.900
 multicolored dress when 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.009
 the light of this super explanation 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.110
 problem pay attention when the light 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:16.240
 collides either sunlight which light 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.560
 any look collides with an object of 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.440
 any color 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.850
 the object sheds throws another light that is 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.549
 reflected or better known as 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.100
 wavelengths of light of the actual color 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.680
 of the object in this case these lengths 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.170
 wave view as light rays that 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.930
 they take out all the objects that we 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.710
 we see collide with our retina and pass 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.690
 for a few things called cones these 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.280
 cones react on the nerves that 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.280
 connect to the part of our brain 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.929
 that processes everything visual and that's how 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.869
 each one of us translate the 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.460
 colors there are three types of cones each 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.100
 one of them is sensitive 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.030
 selective in light of or to the length of 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.800
 wave 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.659
 This ray of light is as basic as 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.789
 the basic colors red blue and green 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.429
 there are people who see the dress on 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:08.160
 blue dress with black has retinas u 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:11.700
 high performance eyes is to say the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.160
 cones get enough you perceive them in 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.379
 enough light to see clearly the 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.230
 actual color of the object in this case the 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:21.810
 damn blue multicolored dress with 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.849
 black people who see it white with 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.519
 golden eyes have less sensitive eyes 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.069
 light your brain tries to correct that 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.110
 lack of light they have on their retinas and 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.019
 they do not fully capture and in that process 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.239
 mix everything making you see it white 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.160
 with gold if you were of the people 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.319
 who saw it first in one color and then 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.060
 from another do not be scared you are not bad at 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.519
 actually you have no problem 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.950
 that means that your retinas are 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.599
 normal or are in a standard because 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.400
 at any time you could see the 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.200
 he lacked more light you saw him a way to 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.700
 about light you saw it from another 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.530
 the simple test so that you 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.690
 they can also corroborate it if I do not 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.430
 believe is to put an object of a color in 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.260
 the night any for example turn off 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.870
 the light of your room put an object a 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.340
 ball a blue dress with black 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.250
 people who have a high performance 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.530
 who receive the light very well are going to be able to 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.750
 see the object more easily those that are 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.489
 normal sometimes see it and sometimes not and 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.590
 of plane those that do not perceive anything the light 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.569
 probably do not even see the object 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.569
 they pick up a little bit already what it's about 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.220
 this in conclusion we all know that 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.610
 our brains work differently 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.950
 way 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.720
 so by saying so your brain is 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.670
 doing what he wants and translating the 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.380
 colors differently that's why 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.120
 The internet is going crazy 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.549
 brains of all people are 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.840
 completely different so if you 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.400
 you thought the dress was white 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.319
 condemned then let me tell you that no 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.850
 you will only have to trust the 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:46.910
 pure science or blessed science what 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.290
 it does not solve so many doubts and well this 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.760
 you can also check it because 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.330
 possibly you are of the people who 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.890
 they fall into many optical illusions this 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.960
 type of manipulation that if you do not see the 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.540
 light that's what illusions do 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.190
 pure science optics that's all for today 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.440
 thank you very much for the video and the 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.810
 stupid dress is black business that 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.930
 black groove yes or no or blue planes with 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.930
 black 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.340
 or not 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.340
 ah
