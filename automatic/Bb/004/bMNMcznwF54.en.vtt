00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.440
 Good morning from Berlin I wanted you 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.450
 I'll give you a short interim report 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.980
 lie or not did not love 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.519
 really flat but i got yesterday 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.590
 already noticed that I'm right 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.210
 I 'm game over and I 'm mine too 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.680
 I have temperature and that's why I am 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.510
 not yet with the gym 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.250
 karl is already turning around for Peter 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.260
 what is cold as I try 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.000
 not as long as possible 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.960
 save 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.519
 but I wanted you this one again 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.349
 put things on the way for yarns 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.830
 Nutrition or not, you have to be yours 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.360
 Body does not always pay attention 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.989
 certain performance for granted 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.690
 to evaluate 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.460
 I want it really exaggerated 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.620
 has more and more are getting better and 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.309
 I slept too little and now I have 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.700
 the Salat 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.850
 I hope that day really somehow 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.710
 survive 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.760
 that annoys me so I can you 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.680
 really give that tip now 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:56.039
 almost 38 until today not on the chain 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:57.870
 somehow somehow they were what they were 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.070
 to make sense I have of one 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.770
 extremely into the other 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.159
 so pay attention to you listening to the 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.369
 warning signals yes, so give your body and 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.439
 pay attention to gutowski so afterwards 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.000
 I did not back then when I later 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.000
 Gym rock right up 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.310
 still by marriage 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.300
 that she presented to me here 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.300
 have made themselves 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.830
 some sleep 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.210
 what to know 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.060
 probably 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.060
 the 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.920
 Yes 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.070
 we can not do it on our own 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.230
 we are here today and turn with two 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.590
 great sport 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:23.530
 Katharina and with the bald we turn 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.180
 portraits almost about the performance in the 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.000
 sport and explain that a bit 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.500
 athletic performance and vegan diet 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.140
 not only do not exclude each other 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.480
 but can even be beneficial and 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.910
 the wellbeing ability 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.140
 and so on can increase everything and 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.850
 Of course, we hope so too 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.860
 maybe inspire a few people 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.860
 I can say as much as I possibly can 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.560
 times from near and emmental one says to 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.230
 example i get my muscles up 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.120
 Vegetable then I believe that 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.610
 all believe and katharina stands and 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.049
 shows how fit she got through boxing and 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.549
 thereby still vegan diet 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:01.500
 Nevertheless I saw I always have 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.500
 still this this excuse me 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.140
 then it should be like, for example 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.140
 to take 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.689
 it's so cold in here 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:33.080
 what are you doing now ? 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.950
 in a message 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:47.080
 beginner's mood and his wants 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.080
 and there comes but there is in the sleep 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.819
 I do not have power 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:59.879
 that 's hard 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:11.719
 at least quite complacent , right 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:11.719
 communicated by game minute that 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.569
 I feel my 86th 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.569
 window will be open window but was too 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.419
 expensive 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:29.810
 but 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.810
 at 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.330
 now told 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.800
 He does not think I'm that much at home 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:48.620
 born of the border storm 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.460
 the banker with me can try 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.460
 to hold on 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.750
 the 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.750
 on site 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:30.720
 with real fun I run i may 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.770
 my voice is so that one of the 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.200
 professional career was sick and has it 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.150
 pulled harder than anyone I pulled 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.160
 know the healthy I would have found it before 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.690
 everything bad that I have more 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.590
 the poor ways we have the shoulders 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.470
 hurt 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:48.670
 who stuck right to the skin year 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:50.290
 but so we know for the people when 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:06:04.230
 I once had with her then easy 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:06:04.230
 you do not get this here by yes
