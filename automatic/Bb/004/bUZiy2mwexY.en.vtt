room if you could do that with the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.730 
room if you could do that with the
camera<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.899> would<00:01:49.079> be<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.229> little<00:01:49.560> helpful

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
camera that would be a little helpful

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.760 
camera that would be a little helpful
for<00:01:50.670> us<00:01:50.880> because<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.360> do<00:01:51.540> believe<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:52.229> see<00:01:52.470> what

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
for us because I do believe I see what

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.649 
for us because I do believe I see what
may<00:01:52.979> be<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.460> edge<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.909> wall<00:01:54.090> cloud<00:01:54.360> over

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
may be the edge of the wall cloud over

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.289 
may be the edge of the wall cloud over
there<00:01:54.869> right<00:01:55.710> now<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.280> again<00:01:56.790> we<00:01:56.939> are<00:01:56.969> seeing

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
there right now and again we are seeing

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.359 
there right now and again we are seeing
some<00:01:57.540> rotation<00:01:58.110> there<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.380> can<00:01:58.530> see<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.920> on

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
some rotation there you can see that on

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.280 
some rotation there you can see that on
our<00:01:59.579> radar<00:01:59.969> scope<00:02:00.270> right<00:02:00.540> now<00:02:00.750> that's<00:02:01.020> the

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
our radar scope right now that's the

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.980 
our radar scope right now that's the
area<00:02:01.619> where<00:02:02.610> there<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:02.820> rotation<00:02:03.149> in<00:02:03.810> this

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
area where there is rotation in this

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.440 
area where there is rotation in this
thunderstorm<00:02:04.380> right<00:02:04.829> now<00:02:05.210> with<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.270> little<00:02:06.360> bit

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
thunderstorm right now with a little bit

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.089 
thunderstorm right now with a little bit
about<00:02:06.570> what<00:02:06.840> we<00:02:06.930> call<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.110> hook<00:02:07.350> echo<00:02:07.500> there<00:02:07.890> not

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
about what we call a hook echo there not

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.850 
about what we call a hook echo there not
a<00:02:08.129> dramatic<00:02:08.520> hook<00:02:09.209> by<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.450> way<00:02:09.720> but<00:02:10.590> there<00:02:10.739> is

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
a dramatic hook by the way but there is

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.710 
a dramatic hook by the way but there is
a

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
a

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.120 
a
little<00:02:11.870> bit<00:02:11.990> of<00:02:12.110> a<00:02:12.200> pendant<00:02:12.620> on<00:02:12.710> that<00:02:12.950> well

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
little bit of a pendant on that well

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.860 
little bit of a pendant on that well
that's<00:02:13.310> that<00:02:13.550> area<00:02:13.820> sticking<00:02:14.390> back<00:02:14.540> toward

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
that's that area sticking back toward

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.480 
that's that area sticking back toward
Huntsville<00:02:15.350> there<00:02:15.560> we<00:02:15.710> call<00:02:15.860> that<00:02:15.980> a<00:02:16.040> pendant

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
Huntsville there we call that a pendant

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.550 
Huntsville there we call that a pendant
and<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:17.330> there<00:02:17.510> is<00:02:17.630> some<00:02:17.780> indication<00:02:17.930> here

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
and and there is some indication here

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.190 
and and there is some indication here
that<00:02:18.590> there<00:02:18.950> is<00:02:19.100> some<00:02:19.340> rotation<00:02:20.180> in<00:02:20.900> that

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
that there is some rotation in that

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.860 
that there is some rotation in that
thunderstorm<00:02:21.700> so<00:02:22.700> again<00:02:23.270> there's<00:02:23.570> another

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
thunderstorm so again there's another

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.790 
thunderstorm so again there's another
view<00:02:24.170> of<00:02:24.320> that<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:24.530> yeah<00:02:26.290> there<00:02:27.290> is<00:02:27.440> a<00:02:27.470> wall

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
view of that and yeah there is a wall

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.290 
view of that and yeah there is a wall
cloud<00:02:28.040> there<00:02:28.280> at<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.430> back<00:02:28.610> edge<00:02:28.820> that's<00:02:29.060> that

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
cloud there at the back edge that's that

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.880 
cloud there at the back edge that's that
little<00:02:29.570> gray<00:02:29.840> thing<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:30.350> see<00:02:30.500> kind<00:02:30.800> of

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
little gray thing you see kind of

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.650 
little gray thing you see kind of
hanging<00:02:31.220> down<00:02:31.250> there's<00:02:31.730> some<00:02:31.910> nice<00:02:32.060> lightning

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
hanging down there's some nice lightning

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.020 
hanging down there's some nice lightning
oh<00:02:32.900> oh<00:02:33.380> you<00:02:33.680> see<00:02:33.830> that<00:02:33.860> we<00:02:34.370> just<00:02:34.550> had<00:02:34.730> a<00:02:34.760> power

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
oh oh you see that we just had a power

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.450 
oh oh you see that we just had a power
power<00:02:35.840> flash<00:02:36.230> we<00:02:36.470> may<00:02:36.620> have<00:02:36.740> a<00:02:36.800> tornado<00:02:37.130> on<00:02:37.310> the

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
power flash we may have a tornado on the

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.310 
power flash we may have a tornado on the
ground<00:02:37.580> here<00:02:38.210> we<00:02:38.480> want<00:02:38.660> you<00:02:38.690> to<00:02:38.840> go<00:02:38.960> ahead<00:02:39.080> and

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
ground here we want you to go ahead and

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.960 
ground here we want you to go ahead and
take<00:02:39.470> your<00:02:39.590> tornado<00:02:39.980> precautions<00:02:40.250> that<00:02:40.670> was<00:02:40.940> a

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
take your tornado precautions that was a

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.450 
take your tornado precautions that was a
power<00:02:41.300> flash<00:02:41.690> on<00:02:41.960> the<00:02:42.230> ground<00:02:42.470> and<00:02:42.740> that<00:02:43.280> does

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
power flash on the ground and that does

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.630 
power flash on the ground and that does
indicate<00:02:43.700> that<00:02:43.880> there<00:02:44.150> could<00:02:44.360> be<00:02:45.459> get<00:02:46.459> your

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
indicate that there could be get your

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.640 
indicate that there could be get your
mic<00:02:46.790> back<00:02:47.030> here<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:47.690> almost<00:02:48.020> say<00:02:48.230> that<00:02:48.260> while

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
mic back here and almost say that while

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.620 
mic back here and almost say that while
he's<00:02:48.830> saying<00:02:49.070> that<00:02:49.310> what<00:02:49.760> we<00:02:49.910> just<00:02:50.090> saw<00:02:50.360> there

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
he's saying that what we just saw there

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.570 
he's saying that what we just saw there
is<00:02:50.780> a<00:02:50.810> wall<00:02:51.140> cloud<00:02:51.440> and<00:02:51.709> then<00:02:51.800> a<00:02:51.830> power<00:02:52.160> flash

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
is a wall cloud and then a power flash

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.330 
is a wall cloud and then a power flash
what<00:02:53.300> that<00:02:53.480> tells<00:02:53.780> us<00:02:53.990> is<00:02:54.050> you<00:02:54.530> know<00:02:54.770> tornados

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
what that tells us is you know tornados

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.820 
what that tells us is you know tornados
are<00:02:55.580> wind<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:56.330> not<00:02:56.450> cloud<00:02:56.750> so<00:02:57.320> you<00:02:57.350> may<00:02:57.560> very

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
are wind and not cloud so you may very

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.860 
are wind and not cloud so you may very
well<00:02:58.190> be<00:02:58.490> seeing<00:02:58.760> a<00:02:58.910> tornado<00:02:59.270> here<00:02:59.480> on<00:02:59.690> the

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
well be seeing a tornado here on the

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.930 
well be seeing a tornado here on the
ground<00:03:00.170> doing<00:03:00.920> damage<00:03:01.160> there<00:03:01.520> could<00:03:01.670> just<00:03:01.700> be

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
ground doing damage there could just be

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.520 
ground doing damage there could just be
high<00:03:02.209> winds<00:03:02.540> beneath<00:03:02.810> that<00:03:03.020> wall<00:03:03.200> cloud<00:03:03.500> I

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
high winds beneath that wall cloud I

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.680 
high winds beneath that wall cloud I
don't<00:03:03.890> know<00:03:04.070> but<00:03:04.459> there<00:03:05.270> is<00:03:05.360> a<00:03:05.390> real

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
don't know but there is a real

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.330 
don't know but there is a real
possibility<00:03:05.930> here<00:03:06.620> that<00:03:06.650> we<00:03:06.830> have<00:03:06.950> a<00:03:06.980> tornado

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
possibility here that we have a tornado

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.860 
possibility here that we have a tornado
on<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:07.640> ground<00:03:07.940> when<00:03:08.120> we<00:03:08.180> see<00:03:08.360> that<00:03:08.510> kind<00:03:08.660> of<00:03:08.780> a

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
on the ground when we see that kind of a

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.410 
on the ground when we see that kind of a
power<00:03:09.080> flash<00:03:09.790> underneath<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:10.940> wall<00:03:11.120> cloud

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
power flash underneath the wall cloud

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.510 
power flash underneath the wall cloud
there<00:03:11.660> and<00:03:12.020> that's<00:03:12.140> again<00:03:12.530> East<00:03:12.950> Huntsville

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
there and that's again East Huntsville

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.790
