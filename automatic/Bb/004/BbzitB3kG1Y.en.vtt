00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.439
 [Music] 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.779
 [Music] 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:27.600
 it was not something circumstantial there was a great 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.600
 campus 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:34.090
 so I think it was thought that 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.550
 we could repeat 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.400
 some title we were very close too 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.200
 then this are things that stay longer 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.110
 are embodied throughout life 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.309
 were 12 years earlier or 13 because we put 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:51.250
 champions we also arrived there at a 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.870
 final with necaxa and some semifinals and 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.510
 until it happened because life is like this or 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.610
 be the times and the moments are given and 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.370
 even the players are accommodating 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.650
 of the ior threatened us where they did not find 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.149
 to see because I think they were very good 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.979
 local them then if we go with the 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:11.880
 conviction of winning obvious but we know 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.880
 that we have everything against 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:22.710
 [Applause] 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:26.110
 [Music] 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.610
 and arturo vision or the sample 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.940
 his reason for having had for us 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.720
 to show it but well this one also 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.100
 he leaves it there as for as many as 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.100
 as punishment not because when the ball 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.470
 it goes up I do not lose sight of the 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.660
 played down and I see how the confiscation was 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.070
 throws over the pocket there 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.120
 what to remember was fractured 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.880
 rib or he came in with a corset 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.790
 then in the confiscation it goes over him 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.820
 and knocks him down with a thump on the body 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.890
 not then both fall and from that 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.630
 At the moment I set the penalty, the 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.370
 criminal I was a little open to the 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.010
 left side had the whole panorama 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:10.700
 marked the penalty and here in this in this 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:13.070
 angle speaks to me paco palencia tells me 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.790
 some criminal or something I say dump 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:19.280
 is marked and at that moment that's what 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.680
 I knew later is when the 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.300
 rivet as it were but he did not call me 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.910
 mostly attentive but most 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.850
 important is that nobody noticed 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.840
 that play on the court I still see 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.610
 you keep watching the repetition and I 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.640
 I wonder 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.970
 what would happen through the mind seized by the 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.250
 life of the grassi kick not yes but 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:45.080
 of the relationship he has after the goal 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:47.240
 I said that was already a stock market if he saw it 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.340
 in your house of life of shame truth 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.490
 shame the attitude that you have after 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.770
 not when they were in protests very 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:59.560
 strong among all 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:02.680
 this the choir not because it is a color 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.500
 jarring others shout at us 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.970
 others are desperate seizure told me something 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.730
 as we lost because of you we 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.190
 then he weighed me applauded is very 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.500
 close to the face and then I told him 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.260
 I said if you touch me I'll take care of you 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.080
 go to soccer one year 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.879
 he says it seems to me that very 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.930
 coward that I insult him he never 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.930
 insult in no time 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:34.460
 more more of binner for throwing lemon at 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:37.250
 wound far in 14 years four 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.860
 League Finals Seven Semifinals Eleven 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.660
 quarterfinals to choose in certain 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.030
 occasions a final in liberators other 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.920
 end of the concacaf and good of the 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.920
 better better titles or let's talk 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.370
 I think so 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.940
 in the decade the 75 I also think that 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.769
 It is also loading the amount of 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:04.180
 players who have spent more than 13 years 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.250
 well there is what happened in 14 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.590
 years and look 5 with the bread came to the 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.230
 agile presidency in these 14 years and cross 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.450
 blue has not been champion 65 a president 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.819
 old take when you were rafa 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.130
 so young that Cuba has to fill up 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.350
 distractions to the beast and that does not happen 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.750
 nothing looks at the galacticos of real madrid 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.690
 of Barcelona in all that has changed in 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.630
 our world among so many destiny and the 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:32.979
 degrees follows still not being champion and 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.660
 still without being clear none of the 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:36.520
 parts would have been good too but 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.380
 it was much more complicated I think that 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.979
 will have him talk about that too 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.630
 city â€‹â€‹has been the truth that obviously 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.889
 in this kind of circumstances 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.039
 situations everyone has their version 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:50.860
 is what arturo brizio says and well there 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:52.690
 is the way he saw at that moment 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.699
 everything that happened that we all saw in 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.390
 TV not at that time I remember 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:58.750
 perfectly but there it is 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:06.520
 and we are not going to 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:09.520
 it turns out that with that warrior image of 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.890
 carlos carlos we have been getting up in 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.100
 Bleeding as I said Arturo Brizio 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:17.230
 fracture of a rib being false 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.690
 in front of the ball putting it in and giving it the 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:22.060
 title to the heart life I have an image 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.980
 heroic warrior for a team and a 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.240
 cold chest hobby completely so 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.870
 that at least in the last 14 years 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.480
 historically at least in the 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:34.390
 last 14 years good cold freezing team 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:38.850
 below zero and that precisely worse 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.850
 Nine that has but
