00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.480
 good and at the time of suffering from a hernia 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.849
 of the thyroid vesicle or 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.639
 need to remove nodules from the body 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.940
 nowadays the options are much less 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.980
 invasive that a few years ago the surgeon 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.859
 juan carlos green hash accompanies us to 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.859
 talk about laparoscopy the topic that 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.250
 knows well as chief surgeon of the 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.830
 hospital south miami welcome doctor and 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.040
 some of these procedures that today 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.950
 in day they are not only less invasive but 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.530
 that help a quicker recovery 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.720
 yes good afternoon and good to be here with 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.530
 you and all the viewers 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.630
 laparoscopy is an operation that 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.740
 really a way to do surgery does 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.420
 20 years but in recent times it has 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.750
 seen that patients recover 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.120
 better if we have fewer incisions and 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.730
 then what is new that is being done 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.470
 about looking for how to achieve the 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.270
 operation is for example a technique that 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.850
 I'm doing now that's called spyro 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.740
 Spider in Spanish is a technique in which 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.170
 we can put a special device to 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.810
 through the navel and through that 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.660
 it opens as if it were some kind of 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.950
 umbrella and on the reverse and based on 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.259
 we can do the same surgery that 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.410
 We did three months ago or three years ago 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.759
 years with four cut only by one in 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.440
 what we are seeing that patients 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.060
 first they appreciate it a lot from the point of 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.910
 sight of being able to go to the beach and that's why 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.350
 her bikini but she also appreciates a lot 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.600
 to point of view recovery we are 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.030
 seeing some greater recoveries of 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.710
 better time better and much better 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.810
 appreciated pain point of view and that 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.149
 the patient then before an operation 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.090
 of this type that required an incision 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.700
 of how many points for example in times 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.610
 past was an immense incision of 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.890
 After five or six inches makes 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.159
 it stops by copies towards a cut 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.420
 average and three more in the high abdomen and 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.369
 then now it is being done 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.780
 simply by a little cut inside the 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.240
 navel that you can not see that we had before 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.280
 Carles converter and that is surgery without 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.770
 scar because you really do not see that 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.679
 phenomenal and that other types of 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.569
 conditions can be operated from this 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.250
 way well at this moment we are 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.620
 using this device has been designed 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.450
 specifically with in mind doing the 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.670
 vesicle surgery what we are 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.650
 seeing is also looking at another kind of 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.900
 colon surgeries for example other 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.060
 intra-abdominal surgeries ovaries in 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.819
 ecological and so on through this 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.319
 same system so far this is a 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.030
 process that is evolving because 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.370
 because it is a new device that is being 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.319
 using instrument that is being 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.700
 evolving but it is a way and 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.890
 new method of doing this kind of 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.130
 surgery now the doctor leaves me I think 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.299
 that is not exactly the subject but 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.750
 operations are also being made 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:50.390
 with robots called da vinci that is 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:54.970
 helping a lot in this regard 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:58.670
 how do you fit a doctor with 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.980
 so many machineries to treat a being 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.170
 good human is very interesting because 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.060
 for us today that is part of the 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.680
 process of a doctor to always be 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.300
 learning new things has been 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.530
 turned a very technological world like 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.150
 everyone from work to office has 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.890
 learned in these years that you have to 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.840
 learn to use a computer an ipad 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.459
 all different things for the 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.040
 surgeon has to be aware of 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.410
 all the different machines and with 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.390
 enough support of medical systems 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.800
 of companies we can learn to 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.360
 do all these techniques but 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.739
 really some very big benefit 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.280
 for the patient so he deserves the 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.680
 work in which case the human touch does not 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.530
 It can be replaced by a machine 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.480
 a computer a good robot the part 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.640
 that caring for the patient is the 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.989
 human part what is the technique of 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.450
 do what we are doing where 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.220
 we use all this kind of good doctor 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.800
 Juan Carlos Green leaves a lot 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.239
 thank you so it's fantastic that today in 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.080
 day you can help the patient of this 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.080
 way thank you very much
