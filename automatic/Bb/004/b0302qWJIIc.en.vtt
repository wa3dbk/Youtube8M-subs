00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:25.790

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.340 

Carl<00:01:26.800> it's<00:01:27.070> like<00:01:27.160> a<00:01:27.280> triangle<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.880> then<00:01:31.350> once

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
Carl it's like a triangle and then once

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.390 
Carl it's like a triangle and then once
you<00:01:32.470> get<00:01:32.890> to<00:01:32.920> all<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.220> corners<00:01:33.840> then<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:36.070> send

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
you get to all the corners then you send

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.280 
you get to all the corners then you send
it<00:01:36.490> down<00:01:36.900> or<00:01:37.900> you<00:01:38.440> cut<00:01:38.830> it<00:01:38.980> if<00:01:39.070> your<00:01:39.250> life<00:01:39.550> and

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
then you fill it with mighty putty and

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:53.190 
then you fill it with mighty putty and
then<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:49.410> paint<00:01:50.410> it<00:01:50.650> and<00:01:50.860> any<00:01:51.250> sticker<00:01:52.200> well

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
you're doing the same exact thing for

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.490 
you're doing the same exact thing for
this<00:01:58.710> you're<00:01:59.710> just<00:01:59.920> doing<00:02:00.190> it<00:02:00.280> to<00:02:01.170> four<00:02:02.170> other

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
this you're just doing it to four other

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.330 
this you're just doing it to four other
corners<00:02:03.479> that's<00:02:04.479> half<00:02:04.900> of<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.290> eight<00:02:05.560> corners

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
corners that's half of the eight corners

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.880 
corners that's half of the eight corners
okay<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:13.000> and<00:02:13.300> these<00:02:13.930> are<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.290> corners<00:02:14.709> that

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
okay so and these are the corners that

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:23.490 
okay so and these are the corners that
you<00:02:15.130> want<00:02:15.850> to<00:02:16.800> stand<00:02:17.800> on<00:02:19.470> okay<00:02:21.660> I'll<00:02:22.660> draw<00:02:23.290> your

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
you want to stand on okay I'll draw your

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.370 
you want to stand on okay I'll draw your
lines<00:02:23.709> on<00:02:23.950> so<00:02:24.550> first<00:02:24.880> peel<00:02:25.269> off<00:02:25.420> all<00:02:25.630> your

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
lines on so first peel off all your

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.860 
lines on so first peel off all your
stickers<00:02:26.890> all<00:02:27.250> over<00:02:27.280> your<00:02:28.209> stickers<00:02:29.550> then

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
stickers all over your stickers then

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.470 
stickers all over your stickers then
what<00:02:31.870> you<00:02:31.959> want<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:32.200> do<00:02:32.410> is<00:02:32.620> you<00:02:33.370> want<00:02:33.519> to<00:02:33.700> hold

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
what you want to do is you want to hold

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.690 
what you want to do is you want to hold
your<00:02:34.690> key<00:02:34.959> like<00:02:35.170> this<00:02:36.000> so<00:02:37.290> there's<00:02:38.489> two<00:02:39.489> sides

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
your key like this so there's two sides

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.090 
your key like this so there's two sides
nine<00:02:40.300> three<00:02:40.660> sides<00:02:42.150> going<00:02:43.150> like<00:02:43.570> this<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:44.920> can

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
nine three sides going like this you can

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.949 
nine three sides going like this you can
see<00:02:45.310> all<00:02:45.489> three<00:02:45.790> sides<00:02:46.000> and<00:02:47.220> then<00:02:50.280> pick<00:02:51.280> the

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
see all three sides and then pick the

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.490 
see all three sides and then pick the
corner<00:02:52.959> that's<00:02:53.140> closest<00:02:53.739> to<00:02:53.769> you<00:02:54.040> so<00:02:55.260> this<00:02:56.260> one

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
corner that's closest to you so this one

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.020 
corner that's closest to you so this one
is<00:02:57.040> closest<00:02:57.519> to<00:02:57.549> me<00:02:57.820> so<00:02:58.090> this<00:02:58.660> one<00:02:58.930> and<00:03:00.030> this

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
is closest to me so this one and this

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.270 
is closest to me so this one and this
one<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.780> warns<00:03:02.140> that<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.560> one<00:03:02.950> that<00:03:03.160> is

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
one the warns that the one that is

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.480 
one the warns that the one that is
furthest<00:03:03.730> away<00:03:03.880> from<00:03:03.970> you<00:03:04.330> so

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.990 

and<00:03:07.690> then<00:03:08.690> you<00:03:08.810> want<00:03:08.960> to<00:03:09.050> pick<00:03:09.260> these<00:03:10.220> two<00:03:10.700> side

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
and then you want to pick these two side

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.830 
and then you want to pick these two side
ones<00:03:11.270> so<00:03:11.750> right<00:03:12.200> here<00:03:12.800> these<00:03:13.670> two<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:14.150> these

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
ones so right here these two and these

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.140 
ones so right here these two and these
two<00:03:16.540> basically<00:03:17.540> why<00:03:17.810> you're<00:03:17.990> picking<00:03:18.170> these

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
two basically why you're picking these

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.850 
two basically why you're picking these
corners<00:03:20.150> is<00:03:20.390> these<00:03:21.200> are<00:03:21.350> the<00:03:21.470> corns<00:03:21.740> that

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:51.880 
and then back here and then right here
and<00:03:43.160> then<00:03:43.280> all<00:03:43.550> the<00:03:43.610> way<00:03:43.850> back<00:03:43.940> here<00:03:45.190> okay<00:03:50.890> just

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
and then all the way back here okay just

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.730 
and then all the way back here okay just
turn<00:03:52.220> it<00:03:52.490> all<00:03:52.670> the<00:03:52.730> way<00:03:53.030> around<00:03:53.210> let's<00:03:54.080> go<00:03:54.350> the

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
turn it all the way around let's go the

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.030 
turn it all the way around let's go the
same<00:03:55.040> way<00:03:55.660> we're<00:03:56.660> going<00:03:56.750> to<00:03:56.900> do<00:03:57.050> it<00:03:57.170> here<00:03:57.830> and

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
same way we're going to do it here and

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.850 
same way we're going to do it here and
here<00:03:58.280> and<00:03:58.430> here<00:03:59.210> and<00:03:59.660> here<00:03:59.900> and<00:04:02.470> then<00:04:03.470> once

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
here and here and here and then once

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.100 
here and here and here and then once
you've<00:04:04.010> drawn<00:04:04.580> in<00:04:04.820> ones<00:04:05.090> you<00:04:05.750> basically

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
you've drawn in ones you basically

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.150 
you've drawn in ones you basically
sanded<00:04:06.650> down<00:04:07.360> fill<00:04:08.360> it<00:04:08.570> and<00:04:08.740> paint<00:04:09.740> it<00:04:09.950> the

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
sanded down fill it and paint it the

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.420 
sanded down fill it and paint it the
same<00:04:10.520> exact<00:04:10.850> way<00:04:11.060> that<00:04:11.330> I<00:04:11.660> taught<00:04:11.960> you<00:04:12.200> in<00:04:12.430> here

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
same exact way that I taught you in here

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.610 
same exact way that I taught you in here
octahedron<00:04:14.240> tutorial<00:04:15.460> okay<00:04:17.170> so<00:04:18.170> this<00:04:18.230> is<00:04:18.410> how

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
octahedron tutorial okay so this is how

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:27.100 
octahedron tutorial okay so this is how
to<00:04:18.680> make<00:04:19.570> it<00:04:20.570> to<00:04:21.470> my<00:04:21.650> to<00:04:22.600> octahedron<00:04:23.600> I<00:04:26.110> mean

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
to make it to my to octahedron I mean

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.430 
to make it to my to octahedron I mean
not<00:04:27.140> keep<00:04:27.650> up<00:04:27.740> the<00:04:27.920> heater<00:04:29.290> half-drunk<00:04:30.290> be

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
not keep up the heater half-drunk be

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.770 
not keep up the heater half-drunk be
with<00:04:30.620> you
