00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
we're in a comfortable lead King six and

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.520 
we're in a comfortable lead King six and
my<00:00:49.350> king<00:00:49.620> high<00:00:49.890> holds<00:00:50.309> up<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:51.020> this<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.350> for

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
my king high holds up and this is it for

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.400 
my king high holds up and this is it for
the<00:00:52.710> first<00:00:52.890> game<00:00:53.270> alright<00:00:54.270> next<00:00:54.510> game<00:00:54.780> Queen

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
the first game alright next game Queen

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.380 
the first game alright next game Queen
Jack<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.219> make<00:00:56.430> my<00:00:56.579> standard<00:00:56.910> raise<00:00:57.710> and

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
Jack and I make my standard raise and

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.849 
Jack and I make my standard raise and
this<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> pretty<00:01:00.930> dangerous-looking<00:01:01.379> flop

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
this is a pretty dangerous-looking flop

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.439 
this is a pretty dangerous-looking flop
so<00:01:02.100> even<00:01:02.309> though<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.430> have<00:01:02.609> two<00:01:02.760> over<00:01:02.940> cards

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
so even though I have two over cards

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.980 
so even though I have two over cards
I'll<00:01:04.170> check<00:01:04.500> here<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.510> see<00:01:06.510> what<00:01:06.689> it'll<00:01:06.810> do

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
I'll check here and see what it'll do

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.640 
I'll check here and see what it'll do
after<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.500> turn<00:01:08.540> there<00:01:09.540> comes<00:01:09.810> another<00:01:09.930> six

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
after the turn there comes another six

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.070 
after the turn there comes another six
and<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.820> fact<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.150> he<00:01:12.360> didn't<00:01:12.630> bet<00:01:12.840> here

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
and the fact that he didn't bet here

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.899 
and the fact that he didn't bet here
makes<00:01:13.380> me<00:01:13.470> think<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.830> he<00:01:14.340> didn't<00:01:14.580> connect

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
makes me think that he didn't connect

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.260 
makes me think that he didn't connect
with<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.240> board<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.229> just<00:01:16.880> try<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.939> take<00:01:18.150> it

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
with this board so I just try to take it

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.980 
with this board so I just try to take it
away<00:01:18.330> from<00:01:18.479> him

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
away from him

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:26.690 
away from him
and<00:01:20.119> he<00:01:21.119> hopes<00:01:23.030> eight<00:01:24.030> six<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:25.280> catch<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.400> middle

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
and he hopes eight six I catch a middle

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.679 
and he hopes eight six I catch a middle
pair<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:28.340> in<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.939> beginning<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.479> like

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
pair and in this in the beginning I like

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.649 
pair and in this in the beginning I like
to<00:01:30.930> check<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.890> check<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.220> middle<00:01:32.610> pair<00:01:32.850> just<00:01:33.509> to

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
to check to check a middle pair just to

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.050 
to check to check a middle pair just to
see<00:01:33.840> how<00:01:34.079> aggressive<00:01:34.530> he<00:01:34.829> normally<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:35.579> and

hand in a hyper turbo game so my normal

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.580 
hand in a hyper turbo game so my normal
play<00:02:38.489> is<00:02:38.730> just<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.120> move<00:02:39.599> all<00:02:39.900> in<00:02:39.930> here<00:02:40.440> and

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
play is just to move all in here and

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.170 
play is just to move all in here and
hope<00:02:41.400> he<00:02:41.700> calls<00:02:42.030> me<00:02:42.269> with<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:44.280> weaker<00:02:44.730> ace<00:02:44.910> or

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
hope he calls me with the weaker ace or

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.360 
hope he calls me with the weaker ace or
you<00:02:45.300> know<00:02:45.420> maybe<00:02:46.230> even<00:02:46.940> some<00:02:47.940> weaker<00:02:48.300> hand<00:02:48.569> and

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
you know maybe even some weaker hand and

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.390 
you know maybe even some weaker hand and
the<00:02:50.370> reason<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:51.360> reason<00:02:51.660> that<00:02:51.810> I<00:02:51.900> don't<00:02:51.959> like

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
the reason the reason that I don't like

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.000 
the reason the reason that I don't like
raising<00:02:53.400> here<00:02:53.610> to<00:02:53.849> 120<00:02:54.690> or<00:02:54.810> 140<00:02:55.470> or<00:02:55.739> something

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
raising here to 120 or 140 or something

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.009 
raising here to 120 or 140 or something
like<00:02:56.099> that<00:02:56.160> is<00:02:56.519> because<00:02:57.390> it<00:02:57.540> makes<00:02:57.750> it<00:02:57.900> very

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
like that is because it makes it very

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.430 
like that is because it makes it very
hard<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:59.159> play<00:02:59.690> after<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.840> flop<00:03:01.080> because

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
hard to play after the flop because

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.070 
hard to play after the flop because
you're<00:03:01.590> out<00:03:01.739> of<00:03:01.769> position<00:03:01.980> so<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:03.300> just<00:03:03.540> shove

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
you're out of position so I just shove

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.160 
you're out of position so I just shove
it<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.800> know<00:03:04.920> hope<00:03:05.099> for<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.370> best

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
it and you know hope for the best

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.800 
it and you know hope for the best
he<00:03:07.170> called<00:03:07.409> me<00:03:07.560> with<00:03:07.709> king<00:03:08.190> queen<00:03:08.459> but<00:03:09.269> makes<00:03:09.629> a

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
he called me with king queen but makes a

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.680 
he called me with king queen but makes a
straight<00:03:10.260> by<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.640> mean<00:03:11.640> I<00:03:11.730> think<00:03:11.849> I<00:03:12.000> just<00:03:12.269> came

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
straight by the mean I think I just came

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.770 
straight by the mean I think I just came
and<00:03:12.900> makes<00:03:13.050> it<00:03:13.170> straight<00:03:13.379> by<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.620> river<00:03:14.150> so<00:03:15.150> he

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
and makes it straight by the river so he

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.910 
and makes it straight by the river so he
wins<00:03:16.349> the<00:03:16.470> pot<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:16.980> leaves<00:03:17.310> me<00:03:17.519> pretty<00:03:17.879> weak

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
wins the pot and leaves me pretty weak

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.460 
wins the pot and leaves me pretty weak

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:01.300 
with the reason for doing so is because

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.240 
with the reason for doing so is because
there<00:07:01.479> is<00:07:01.509> a<00:07:01.599> broad<00:07:01.930> spectrum<00:07:02.139> of<00:07:02.560> slobs<00:07:02.949> that
