quite a while to do some new within R
comes<00:00:52.290> with<00:00:52.740> 2009<00:00:53.700> we<00:00:54.330> have<00:00:54.450> the<00:00:54.570> ability<00:00:55.020> to

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
comes with 2009 we have the ability to

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.180 
comes with 2009 we have the ability to
export<00:00:56.220> whatever<00:00:57.180> we<00:00:57.420> see<00:00:57.720> within<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.830> 3d

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
export whatever we see within the 3d

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
view as a PDF file advantage to PDF file

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.450 
view as a PDF file advantage to PDF file
is<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.509> it<00:01:06.720> can<00:01:06.960> be<00:01:07.049> saved<00:01:07.290> as<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.619> secure<00:01:08.100> file

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
is that it can be saved as a secure file

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.670 
is that it can be saved as a secure file
type<00:01:08.850> now<00:01:09.810> we're<00:01:09.930> going<00:01:10.050> to<00:01:10.110> go<00:01:10.230> through<00:01:10.470> both

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
type now we're going to go through both

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.750 
type now we're going to go through both
ways<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.370> producing<00:01:11.730> a<00:01:12.210> PDF<00:01:13.170> file<00:01:13.670> so<00:01:14.670> the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
ways of producing a PDF file so the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.600 
ways of producing a PDF file so the
first<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.300> easiest<00:01:15.420> one<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.870> do<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:17.190> if<00:01:17.400> you're

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
first and easiest one to do is if you're

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.880 
first and easiest one to do is if you're
working<00:01:17.880> within<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.360> model<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.650> have<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
working within a model so you have the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.850 
working within a model so you have the
ability<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.340> go<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.640> windows<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.900> save<00:01:22.290> 3d

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
ability to go to windows and save 3d

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.740 
ability to go to windows and save 3d
image<00:01:23.900> we<00:01:24.900> can<00:01:25.020> just<00:01:25.140> save<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.500> as<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.770> 3d<00:01:26.250> PDF

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
image we can just save this as a 3d PDF

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:34.730 
image we can just save this as a 3d PDF
we're<00:01:27.750> going<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.050> save<00:01:28.260> this<00:01:28.500> as<00:01:29.030> horse

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.649 

and<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.790> can<00:01:35.970> see<00:01:36.120> we<00:01:36.210> have<00:01:36.330> our<00:01:36.360> standard

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
and you can see we have our standard

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.200 
and you can see we have our standard
bitmap<00:01:37.200> TIFF<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.830> JPEG<00:01:37.920> files<00:01:38.790> here<00:01:39.000> we're

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
bitmap TIFF and JPEG files here we're

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.530 
bitmap TIFF and JPEG files here we're
just<00:01:39.240> going<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.570> save<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:39.750> as<00:01:40.080> the<00:01:40.229> 3d<00:01:40.470> PDF

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.300 

okay<00:01:45.540> as<00:01:45.690> you<00:01:45.840> can<00:01:45.869> see<00:01:46.200> now<00:01:46.890> we<00:01:46.950> have<00:01:47.190> the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
okay as you can see now we have the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.910 
okay as you can see now we have the
ability<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.970> use<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.509> password<00:01:49.050> if<00:01:49.259> we<00:01:49.470> acquire

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
ability to use a password if we acquire

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.100 
ability to use a password if we acquire
the<00:01:50.700> advantage<00:01:51.060> staff<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.450> password<00:01:51.659> is

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
the advantage staff and a password is

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.930 
the advantage staff and a password is
that's<00:01:52.440> only<00:01:52.800> your<00:01:53.220> client<00:01:53.670> or<00:01:53.790> customer

then it will carry on producing my 3d

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.960 
then it will carry on producing my 3d
PDF<00:02:16.860> file<00:02:20.840> here<00:02:21.840> is<00:02:21.989> told<00:02:22.230> us<00:02:22.350> that<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.590> PDF

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
PDF file here is told us that the PDF

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.460 
PDF file here is told us that the PDF
file<00:02:23.970> has<00:02:24.269> been<00:02:24.300> saved

file has been saved

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.590 
file has been saved
so<00:02:26.250> we'll<00:02:26.340> just<00:02:26.459> open<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:27.060> up<00:02:27.239> and<00:02:27.390> take<00:02:27.540> a

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
so we'll just open that up and take a

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.650 
so we'll just open that up and take a
look<00:02:27.810> at<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.080> file<00:02:28.580> so<00:02:29.580> just<00:02:29.610> open<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.239> PDF

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
look at the file so just open the PDF

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.259 
look at the file so just open the PDF
file<00:02:30.930> up<00:02:31.519> as<00:02:32.519> you<00:02:32.730> can<00:02:32.819> see<00:02:34.640> your<00:02:35.640> customer<00:02:36.150> or

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
file up as you can see your customer or

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.370 
file up as you can see your customer or
client<00:02:36.390> would<00:02:36.840> have<00:02:36.870> complete<00:02:37.380> control<00:02:37.500> over

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
client would have complete control over

around now this is one of the ways which

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.590 
around now this is one of the ways which

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
we can create a 3d PDF from the safe

we can create a 3d PDF from the safe
view<00:02:54.930> option<00:02:55.440> close<00:02:56.160> this<00:02:56.400> down<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:56.730> we'll

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
take a look at the other option if we

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.920 
take a look at the other option if we
wanted<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.440> what<00:03:01.440> we<00:03:01.530> could<00:03:01.709> do<00:03:01.920> is<00:03:02.400> we<00:03:02.430> could

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
wanted to what we could do is we could

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.069 
wanted to what we could do is we could
add<00:03:03.930> this<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.620> project<00:03:05.100> file<00:03:06.079> so

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
add this to the project file so

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.860 
add this to the project file so
currently<00:03:07.440> in<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.799> project<00:03:08.220> file<00:03:08.690> we<00:03:09.690> have

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
currently in the project file we have

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.759 
currently in the project file we have
the<00:03:10.709> full<00:03:10.980> horse<00:03:11.310> itself<00:03:12.140> but<00:03:13.140> we<00:03:13.500> may<00:03:13.620> not

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
the full horse itself but we may not

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.430 
the full horse itself but we may not
want<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.010> show<00:03:14.510> customer<00:03:15.510> list<00:03:15.690> you<00:03:16.019> may<00:03:16.200> want

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
want to show customer list you may want

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.220 
want to show customer list you may want
to<00:03:16.560> show<00:03:16.799> them<00:03:17.989> this<00:03:18.989> file<00:03:19.320> here<00:03:20.900> so<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:21.989> first

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
to show them this file here so the first

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.810 
to show them this file here so the first
thing<00:03:22.440> to<00:03:22.560> do<00:03:22.709> is<00:03:22.859> to<00:03:23.010> add<00:03:23.160> this<00:03:23.459> to<00:03:23.700> the

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
thing to do is to add this to the

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.990 
thing to do is to add this to the
project<00:03:24.590> so<00:03:25.590> go<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:25.829> the<00:03:26.040> create<00:03:26.459> triangular

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
project so go to the create triangular

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.470 
project so go to the create triangular
mesh<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.950> we<00:03:28.950> could<00:03:29.220> if<00:03:29.459> we<00:03:29.519> wanted<00:03:29.940> to<00:03:30.120> close

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
mesh and we could if we wanted to close

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.910 
mesh and we could if we wanted to close
it<00:03:30.660> with<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.810> flat<00:03:31.109> plane<00:03:31.410> so<00:03:31.620> it's<00:03:31.769> got<00:03:31.890> a

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
it with the flat plane so it's got a

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.640 
it with the flat plane so it's got a
flat<00:03:32.070> back<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.670> it<00:03:32.959> it<00:03:33.959> could<00:03:34.079> be<00:03:34.200> used<00:03:34.410> for<00:03:34.530> a

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
flat back to it it could be used for a

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.590 
flat back to it it could be used for a
pendant

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.390 

so<00:03:38.600> we're<00:03:38.690> selected<00:03:39.320> close<00:03:39.530> to<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:39.770> flat

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
so we're selected close to the flat

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.870 
so we're selected close to the flat
plane<00:03:40.670> we're<00:03:41.630> just<00:03:42.040> creating<00:03:43.040> the<00:03:43.340> triangles

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
plane we're just creating the triangles

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.980 
plane we're just creating the triangles
and<00:03:44.000> we're<00:03:44.090> going<00:03:44.210> to<00:03:44.240> add<00:03:44.420> them<00:03:44.630> to<00:03:44.870> the

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
and we're going to add them to the

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:53.610 
and we're going to add them to the
project<00:03:46.210> see<00:03:47.210> here<00:03:47.390> we<00:03:47.510> have<00:03:47.660> a<00:03:49.570> flat<00:03:50.570> back

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.050 

just<00:03:54.620> going<00:03:54.740> to<00:03:54.830> add<00:03:54.980> these<00:03:55.190> to<00:03:55.430> the<00:03:55.460> project

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
just going to add these to the project

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.200 
just going to add these to the project
and<00:03:57.310> then<00:03:58.310> if<00:03:58.430> we<00:03:58.550> come<00:03:58.700> across<00:03:58.730> to<00:03:59.120> the

00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.210 
and then if we come across to the

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.170 
and then if we come across to the
project<00:03:59.630> tab<00:03:59.930> and<00:04:00.290> just<00:04:01.280> close<00:04:01.520> this<00:04:01.790> down<00:04:02.120> and

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
project tab and just close this down and

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.860 
project tab and just close this down and
update<00:04:03.130> this<00:04:04.130> or<00:04:04.310> just<00:04:04.340> save<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:05.630> horse

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
update this or just save the horse

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.870 
update this or just save the horse
within<00:04:06.230> the<00:04:06.380> model<00:04:06.560> fat<00:04:06.890> any<00:04:07.160> changes<00:04:07.730> we've

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
within the model fat any changes we've

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.630 
within the model fat any changes we've
made<00:04:08.110> and<00:04:09.370> now<00:04:10.370> what<00:04:10.550> we're<00:04:10.700> going<00:04:10.850> to<00:04:10.940> do<00:04:12.640> so

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
made and now what we're going to do so

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.240 
made and now what we're going to do so
we<00:04:13.700> can<00:04:13.880> see<00:04:14.350> is<00:04:15.350> we're<00:04:15.620> going<00:04:15.800> to<00:04:16.419> select<00:04:17.419> on

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
we can see is we're going to select on

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:24.730 
we can see is we're going to select on
to<00:04:19.250> the<00:04:19.340> project<00:04:19.579> and<00:04:20.090> export<00:04:20.870> this<00:04:21.160> as<00:04:23.050> a<00:04:24.050> 3d

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
to the project and export this as a 3d

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:32.260 
to the project and export this as a 3d
PDF<00:04:25.100> file<00:04:26.500> so<00:04:27.500> again<00:04:28.750> we'll<00:04:29.750> call<00:04:29.990> this<00:04:31.270> a

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
PDF file so again we'll call this a

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:41.930 
PDF file so again we'll call this a
horse<00:04:32.980> we'll<00:04:33.980> call<00:04:34.190> it<00:04:34.340> horse<00:04:34.580> one<00:04:34.850> this<00:04:35.090> time

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.630 

again<00:04:42.690> as<00:04:42.810> you<00:04:42.930> can<00:04:42.960> see<00:04:43.080> have<00:04:44.070> the<00:04:44.280> ability<00:04:44.610> to

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
again as you can see have the ability to

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:54.700 
again as you can see have the ability to
put<00:04:44.910> in<00:04:45.030> a<00:04:45.120> password<00:04:45.950> again<00:04:46.950> we<00:04:47.520> won't

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.740 

and<00:04:55.220> again<00:04:55.400> it<00:04:55.520> saved<00:04:55.789> it<00:04:56.060> so<00:04:56.539> we're<00:04:56.630> gonna

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
and again it saved it so we're gonna

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:04.330 
and again it saved it so we're gonna
open<00:04:56.960> it<00:04:57.169> from<00:04:57.350> the<00:04:57.470> desktop<00:05:02.770> we<00:05:03.770> can<00:05:03.919> see<00:05:04.070> our

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
open it from the desktop we can see our

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.270 
open it from the desktop we can see our
horse<00:05:05.860> with<00:05:06.860> a<00:05:06.889> solid<00:05:07.340> back<00:05:07.930> to<00:05:08.930> it<00:05:09.080> to<00:05:09.889> quietly
