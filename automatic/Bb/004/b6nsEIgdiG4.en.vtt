00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:12.770
 the knot with the car but because in death 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.510
 who missed 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:21.949
 calm down, cry in the championship 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:23.599
 Spanish will not explode in the slightest 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:27.740
 boiled should have a problem in the 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:31.249
 cooling system 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:34.100
 cooling system is that the 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:37.280
 cooling is composed of radiator 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.129
 water pump hose valves keep 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.280
 tactical temperature and vessel sensors 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.230
 expander cooling system is 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.899
 responsible for temperature control 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:52.699
 engine is the one that causes the exchange of 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:55.370
 engine's heat with the environment is 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:58.460
 always a young man who had no 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.140
 punishment is or is not punishment not the reasons 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.149
 they can be many 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.280
 several causes can lead to 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.950
 overheating of the engine as 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.220
 Radiator defects leaky hose 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.770
 block seal and valve bored head 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.430
 thermostatic locked pot lid 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.650
 damaged expander looks most 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.940
 Sometimes the problem is due to lack of 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:25.040
 preventive maintenance and if the 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.200
 problem is related to the pump 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.330
 water may leak from the 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.380
 coolant through seal 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:36.050
 that's it looks nobody deserves the taste 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.910
 showed the good reality so that 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.560
 this does not happen anymore 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.560
 I recommend some care 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.860
 cracked the money goes personal pros that 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.950
 I heard you never fail 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.799
 good let's look is always necessary to 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.229
 cleaning of the cooling system and 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.909
 use of an additive as 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.610
 carmaker's recommendation 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.329
 this practice should be repeated once 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.340
 per year 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:12.120
 so bad luck that resists actually go 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:16.980
 go to found the game show is the hero was 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:19.519
 that's what I 'm doing 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.519
 my work
