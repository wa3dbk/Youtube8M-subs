00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.090
 hello and welcome tracking tram 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.360
 today I'm going to introduce you to a device that has been eagerly awaited by 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.369
 camera enthusiasts 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:12.349
 the world title enix 10 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.980
 if they are spoiled instead of leaving the classic reflex segment 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.239
 to enter the dance initiated by olympus it is at the ceni 

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:22.589
 and offers in turn a compact device has no goals 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:23.989
 interchangeable 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:27.470
 and which interested actors 14 million pixels 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.520
 let's see 6 e mx 10h38 all its own 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.670
 regarding the presence of a port 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.789
 the device is just superb 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:38.970
 aesthetically economically 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.080
 tapping the rigorous symbian devices 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.360
 same song decided not to break totally with the texas citizens 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.740
 since it offers a small holding handle 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.070
 to the inverted edf taxes or the lowest 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.870
 for example also pleasure 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.870
 noticeable difference the bmx will offer visitors 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.539
 3% 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.000
 I ascend the throne 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.920
 which is nonsense an excellent idea since this gives the choice of 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.610
 use it 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.250
 indeed if indeed the lady had neglected their qualities 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.210
 I will come back a little further 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.320
 nothing can replace the stability that the viewfinder provides 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.430
 elbow against the procession device modeled on the cheek 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.750
 especially for the beginning 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.720
 moreover the number of shortcuts is important 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.720
 if many keys give access to the main features 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.290
 in France anyway 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.050
 it is not possible to be pointed by a touch of personalization on 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.990
 callback function too 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.490
 the employment coating instituted virginia pleasant to the touch 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.670
 the set holds well in hand 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.460
 annoying details however the face be a little too careful at the back 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.520
 gets stuck sometimes so you can quickly remove it from your pocket 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.090
 the 3-inch screen of an Olympian calm is a small wonder and certainly 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.800
 not the best on the market 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.830
 the contrast is much higher than the classic rcd 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.590
 it is no longer as is often the case with the need to shade with its 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.590
 hand to see what's happening on the screen 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.909
 the viewing angles are much wider without however flipped a screen 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:18.299
 mounted on patella of course 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.889
 on the top of the device and after we find level of presets 7 me 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:26.459
 the tariffs m all auto mode by smartphone phone 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.659
 and the video mode 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.079
 the mode all of everything works well 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.349
 but I noticed a white balance that pulled a little too often we'll see 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.469
 the day in artificial light 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:40.180
 on the other hand, as for the other modes 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.189
 and especially 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:45.259
 we have a selection wheel on the top of the device at the level of 

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:46.259
 index 

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:49.259
 to manage you the speed is there 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:52.509
 the opening of the diaphragm 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:54.959
 short and very fast to his loved ones 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.949
 gerard missed the target especially in broad daylight 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:00.399
 in low light it was difficult 

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:03.489
 the arrest of a tuna boat against sometimes 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.569
 it remains less efficient than the system by small sections of faladié to 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:08.839
 classic fact 

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:10.089
 but at least 

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:13.089
 at the same level as its main competitor the dg fr 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:15.989
 image quality 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.219
 p she includes you 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:23.060
 up to 800 m from the extended dynamic range rendering factor images 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:25.889
 maybe a little too much sometimes 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.129
 and the grand véfour 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:32.299
 from 10 years up to 1600 iso the web then becomes more 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.379
 present 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.209
 it is not very embarrassing 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.749
 but the default setting by February while mark 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.749
 August 2006 to the network and this becomes more rude 

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:48.279
 small note in passing it does not a priori not possible to adjust the 

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:49.900
 inventory you shared 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.529
 whole a fervent 

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:55.779
 while all the local competitors for a long time and that it pays fortis 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.139
 a question I live 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.169
 why have you opted for such a definition 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:07.709
 frankly I find that 14 million pixels for his troops 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.969
 way too much for this type of device 

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:12.969
 it does not raise to distil a market on which the users 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:15.969
 can easily race to pixels 

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:20.199
 I hope that the builders will definitely stop this 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:21.379
 type of gathering 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:25.499
 we also mention all the cameras offering prostheses 

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:29.439
 it is not necessary on this segment to exceed 12 or even 10 million 

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:32.610
 pixels 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.010
 when they are very simple to use 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.010
 purified 110 endless of any record 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.650
 the knicks have actually been studying for the general public and 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.379
 private 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:45.630
 station however 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.440
 to miss out on a demanding branch of photographers susceptible 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.440
 wearing to put the price 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.249
 another big tennis video and rather successful 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:05:02.359
 it allows to film ban finishes at 1280 by 720 p the qualities of 30 

00:05:02.359 --> 00:05:03.270
 second images 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.270
 or not so we have to speed up when he wants it mpk 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:11.449
 handmade after a summer of the complete fracture play with the opening of this 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:13.719
 last in the sleeve how 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:18.129
 I found that the letter additionally the bearing to the purchase which had 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:19.800
 precisely the focus 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.510
 the fit is not very talented or rather no or in command or that the m 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:26.710
 searcher 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.169
 and for sure for me that I hope 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:33.199
 so I preferred the sky manual focus is very very 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:35.589
 easily 

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:36.740
 however, m 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.129
 we are very proud to do it 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:42.379
 do it 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:45.360
 to conclude the afternoon 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.969
 it is in superb camera or music only in the configuration that 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:51.499
 I read with volume 7 30 

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:52.749
 % 

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:54.400
 will you die 2 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.710
 it's a jewel 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.589
 it fits in the vein of gsma hybrids and the ground 

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:04.629
 but it's above in terms more image quality especially thanks to its 

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:08.019
 ability even bigger actor the team aps 

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:11.969
 they aim to humiliate is also very very successful 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:15.629
 remains to be known and Saturday's strategy highlights on this segment 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.510
 why did you choose 14 million pixels at the expense of it was not 

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:21.449
 planned 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:22.499
 and finally 

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:25.889
 a profession of the durability of the pbx system at the optical level 

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:31.990
 we wish in any case a great career to this superb device despite 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.689
 some details an accent should be largely corrected by a 

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:37.589
 firmware update 

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:39.630
 in any case it is an object of other words 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.809
 by sowing recommendable especially reward 

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:44.699
 see you soon on the extreme for a new test
