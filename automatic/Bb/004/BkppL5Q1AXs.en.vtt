00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 and saturday where in a matter of weeks 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.220
 after the winter Olympics in Sochi again about 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.109
 figure skating in japan passes 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.069
 first post olympic world championship 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.469
 where alone confirm qualifications 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.780
 others catch up 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.910
 here now about men here on our ice 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.440
 new hope 18-year-old maxim kovtun 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.270
 which was so much talk after 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.640
 memorable outcome victories from 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.160
 sochi or not plushenko in the icon in japan 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.109
 Kafka itself and 4 immediately and offensive 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.180
 reassuringly after making the top five 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.250
 best maxims whether Rasik provided now 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.619
 in 2 skaters in the next championship 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.270
 means the horizon is now wider well and 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.550
 Recall that in the championship in the site 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.040
 Our team has already acquired medals to 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.809
 This silver won couple Xenia 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.910
 Pillar and Fedor Klimov 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.230
 thus they repeat the achievement of sochi 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.239
 and allowed to leave the big sport 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.950
 Germany is presented to Lena Savchenko and 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.210
 Roberto silk in the rank of 5 multiples 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.340
 world champions so they 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.530
 compensated for the lack of gold in Sochi 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.960
 where they were defeated by a pair of hairs trunks 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.079
 they in Japan were onlookers took now 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.449
 pause to rest, but this afternoon performed 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.730
 girls and of course all attention to Julia and 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.870
 birds in lipnitskaya from japan our 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.810

 Mingazhev tickets for the last day 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.260
 World Championships in the site was not 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.060
 reach mid february 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.760
 the main intrigue is not even that 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.619
 first and who will get silver is not 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.990
 nothing unusual that the Japanese are sick for 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.270
 their little Assad's universal favorite 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.520
 but the Russian tricolor is in the hands of the Japanese 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.640
 there was no such fan here 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.490
 from the time of Eugene Plushenko and Lipnitskaya 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.600
 very strong figure skater I am her fan 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.060
 she has exceptional flexibility 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.159
 magnificent jumps especially impressive 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.840
 how she does the rotation she is very 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.590
 formidable rival even for Japanese 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.590
 skaters 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.250
 on the results of the short program Julia 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:50.210
 Lipnitskaya 3 herself she called her trainer 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.940
 this is the best rolled performance in 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.100
 closing 4 championship groups this 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.630
 wrestling best seychelles beehive winch 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.780
 their 15 years probation 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.740
 first order star 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.659
 wonder Girl 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.520
 and no choirs Japanese commentators 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.909
 Julia represent when she goes to 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.040
 ice 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.020
 today she came out after her main 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.150
 rival in the fight for gold is not enough 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.130
 Sada failed to win a medal on 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.760
 Olympiad in Sochi performed at home 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.760
 flawlessly 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.720
 psychological pressure especially for 15 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.220
 colossal years in such a situation 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.860
 jump from third to second 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.480
 in his first life world championships for 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.549
 Yuli is undoubted success. 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.090
 but she also seems to take time to 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.090
 realize it 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.880
 it was clear what my rivals understand me 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.620
 where is the championship so it was necessary 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.690
 for the top three fight well here and so 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.880
 It turned out because I have so much 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.470
 experienced this year I probably so much 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.210
 in my 15 years did not live how much 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.860
 this year so i don't know me just 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.540
 the impression is already if I remember 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.580
 probably I don’t know I’ll spend another year on it 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.540
 even more thought that this is all 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:04.510
 so much shock for me everything is new everything 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.010
 There are so many things that I do n’t even know I 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.210
 I even want to rejoice at the fact that 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.750
 i can relax and i can't even 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.900
 because I even think I'm tired 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:17.650
 happy i understand we understood that we 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.760
 We are going to Japan and I understood that the mass is up 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.280
 after the Olympics 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.230
 I will not give my own therefore probably in this 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.140
 the maximum position for which we rode 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.880
 but I would probably get a cathode for 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.070
 little is the last championship 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.600
 and Julia after the summer break will begin 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.750
 prepare for the new season 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.510
 and even the wear Julia 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:41.520
 oh of course still very young and in front of her 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.520
 great future I am very happy for her 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.320
 the next championships will be held in Shanghai 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.720
 in a year russia will perform on it 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.490
 enhanced composition including missed 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.420
