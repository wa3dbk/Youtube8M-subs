any<00:02:51.680> sense<00:02:51.890> but<00:02:52.160> we'll<00:02:52.370> run<00:02:52.520> it<00:02:52.610> one<00:02:52.730> more<00:02:52.850> time

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.250 

Elsie<00:02:59.240> um<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:01.400> a<00:03:01.430> gamble<00:03:01.940> to<00:03:01.970> work<00:03:02.180> but<00:03:02.959> he<00:03:02.990> got

was that you got blocked so sometimes

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.979 
was that you got blocked so sometimes
that<00:03:10.010> will<00:03:10.340> happen<00:03:12.550> makes<00:03:13.550> sense<00:03:13.910> but<00:03:14.239> yeah

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
that will happen makes sense but yeah

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.979 
that will happen makes sense but yeah

literally<00:05:03.650> just<00:05:03.919> got<00:05:04.099> on<00:05:04.310> so<00:05:04.689> may<00:05:05.689> I<00:05:05.719> see<00:05:06.020> three

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
literally just got on so may I see three

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.080 
literally just got on so may I see three
yellows<00:05:06.979> yeah<00:05:07.219> well<00:05:07.370> that<00:05:07.490> doesn't<00:05:07.789> cover<00:05:08.000> the

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
yellows yeah well that doesn't cover the

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.320 
yellows yeah well that doesn't cover the
sideline<00:05:08.569> so<00:05:08.870> what<00:05:08.990> I<00:05:09.020> like<00:05:09.229> to<00:05:09.259> do<00:05:09.529> is<00:05:10.150> curl<00:05:11.150> to

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
sideline so what I like to do is curl to

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.920 
sideline so what I like to do is curl to
fly<00:05:11.650> and<00:05:12.650> since<00:05:13.279> his<00:05:13.460> safety<00:05:13.849> is<00:05:14.210> a<00:05:14.240> baseline

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
fly and since his safety is a baseline

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.719 
fly and since his safety is a baseline
there<00:05:15.169> it's<00:05:15.740> all<00:05:15.949> the<00:05:16.099> way<00:05:16.129> up<00:05:16.250> there<00:05:16.400> I<00:05:16.460> like

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:16.729 
there it's all the way up there I like

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.929 
there it's all the way up there I like
to<00:05:16.879> put<00:05:17.029> him<00:05:17.120> in<00:05:17.210> a<00:05:17.270> flight<00:05:18.490> that<00:05:19.490> way<00:05:19.699> if

00:05:19.929 --> 00:05:19.939 
to put him in a flight that way if

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:22.269 
to put him in a flight that way if
there's<00:05:20.479> them<00:05:20.749> if<00:05:20.990> they're<00:05:21.169> doing<00:05:21.319> a<00:05:21.439> corner

00:05:22.269 --> 00:05:22.279 
there's them if they're doing a corner

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:25.600 
there's them if they're doing a corner
out<00:05:22.490> or<00:05:22.819> I'll<00:05:23.479> route<00:05:23.779> a<00:05:24.110> while<00:05:24.889> he's<00:05:25.250> coming

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
out or I'll route a while he's coming

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.110 
out or I'll route a while he's coming
down<00:05:25.729> he'll<00:05:26.000> pick<00:05:26.180> it<00:05:26.300> off<00:05:26.449> so<00:05:27.699> they<00:05:28.699> even<00:05:28.939> back

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
down he'll pick it off so they even back

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.260 
down he'll pick it off so they even back
up<00:05:29.360> there<00:05:29.629> and<00:05:30.250> I<00:05:31.250> would<00:05:31.520> usually<00:05:31.669> use<00:05:32.120> her

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
up there and I would usually use her

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.879 
up there and I would usually use her
this<00:05:32.449> middle<00:05:32.810> linebacker<00:05:33.199> right<00:05:33.439> here<00:05:33.620> in<00:05:33.740> the

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 
this middle linebacker right here in the

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.129 
this middle linebacker right here in the
hook<00:05:34.039> zone<00:05:34.250> so<00:05:35.150> what<00:05:35.300> I<00:05:35.330> would<00:05:35.449> do<00:05:35.719> is<00:05:35.900> I'll

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:36.139 
hook zone so what I would do is I'll

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:39.760 
hook zone so what I would do is I'll
bring<00:05:36.620> him<00:05:36.830> down<00:05:37.089> switch<00:05:38.089> over<00:05:38.509> and<00:05:38.719> let<00:05:39.649> the

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
bring him down switch over and let the

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.579 
bring him down switch over and let the
play<00:05:39.979> run<00:05:40.279> and<00:05:40.310> there<00:05:40.789> you<00:05:40.939> go<00:05:41.199> look<00:05:42.199> how<00:05:42.379> look

00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:42.589 
play run and there you go look how look

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:45.339
