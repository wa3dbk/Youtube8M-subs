00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.290
 day may be ranking on the ground 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:18.180
 But as we are, let's talk about 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:21.210
 sleep too, do not sleep 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.070
 to represent the channel is the 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.910
 Marriage has already been now have to hold 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:32.340

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.809
 ask a lot like I do my 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.590
 sleepy hair 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:45.360
 I just woke up and just woke up 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:49.200
 crack of dawn is not anything too little cold 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:57.360
 because I have suffered enough already 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:58.649
 unable to wash the hair every 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.890
 days 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:16.530
 This is the third day of hair without 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:19.650
 wash the two nights very much with you guys 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.420
 are parts have to be separated at the time 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:28.290
 hairstyle part identifies 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:30.890
 malleable part of the haircut also 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.890
 it 's no different 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:40.979
 also is no different is the pair of 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:44.600
 loose hair always works sometimes 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.369
 braid he got crumpled looser 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.130
 I'll put the garden link 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:02:00.350
 new for you to see how my hair is 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:02:00.350
 when I slept in traffic yesterday 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.340
 I get the original text him he 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.410
 have the slightly larger bunches will come already 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.810
 in the new videos I wash my hair 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.630
 for the first time changed accordingly 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:18.280
 in my care are the two I's 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.030
 totally washed hair is and with rates 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.490
 larger 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.670
 but when i leave when the df was 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.640
 the first or second is and stays in the 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:32.190
 box of one more small dog 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.190
 but set my shirt 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.250
 so come on, I was in the middle yesterday 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.560
 Rebel time that I arrived I wanted 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.650
 record yesterday was very loud 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.370
 yesterday in the rebellious middle that I did I caught 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:51.100
 the cream that is not really what it is 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.900
 in this store can be an exercise when 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.640
 you have dry hair to pass cani 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.630
 fine textures 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:04.870
 Yesterday I picked up the hair. 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:10.140
 way I always make part of the 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:13.120
 cut and put cream and went passing 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.830
 never found it can not leave it can not 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.989
 do in traditional root domain 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.940
 wet hair but no problem 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.720
 passes the length 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.570
 It's okay that you can not leave here either. 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:30.760
 will not let alone who makes 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:32.980
 evil is bad for the world cup in the capital 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.980
 so how do I say this is a cream 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.110
 thin and if the pantene r mach3 grows 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.820
 with known water win I always leave 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:45.070
 my bag for emergency that is 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:48.730
 Occasional sure just know that he stayed 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.220
 half wet, and I sleep turning the 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.220
 Hair I do not move 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.720
 So I think this makes it easier, but I do not 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.370
 I'm kidding the world. 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:04.650
 well okay that is effective becomes smoother 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:07.140
 it has no way I should so I have 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.500
 I told you once we did a 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:13.650
 quick video ford date to explain one 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.530
 little better understood then that part 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:20.310
 that a mass because she's always to 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:25.890
 Forever forever turned and is with 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:31.260
 cream sometimes in the morning 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:32.390
 Today I would not do anything, just in the middle of 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:42.290
 River 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:44.940
 still, put a little bit 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:50.130
 So that's it, folks, I hope you 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:05:00.470
 understand in the morning 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:05:03.330
 today would not do anything but when it comes and 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:16.890
 only I do holding the first thing that 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:22.140
 I will and I will pass the cream and when it is 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:25.229
 a day with water or fine thin 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:31.700
 which will pick up on very 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:36.450
 specific hair in strands of 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:38.900
 hair even today from tata but we are there 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:41.780
 huh 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.970
 We're rolling it's up our 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.070
 relationship 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.979
 so this is what I hope you have 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:51.110
 I like having a new line, the video makes me 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:54.860

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:57.580
