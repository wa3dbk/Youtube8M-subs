at<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.710> basic<00:00:14.040> construction<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.580> gear<00:00:14.759> box<00:00:14.969> so

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
at the basic construction of gear box so

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.439 
at the basic construction of gear box so
there<00:00:16.230> we<00:00:16.289> go<00:00:16.350> some<00:00:16.980> simple<00:00:17.640> gear<00:00:17.850> pack<00:00:18.090> gears

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
there we go some simple gear pack gears

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.670 
there we go some simple gear pack gears
but<00:00:18.779> this<00:00:18.900> will<00:00:19.020> also<00:00:19.109> work<00:00:19.230> with<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.529> big

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
but this will also work with a big

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.340 
but this will also work with a big

me<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.170> pronounce<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.650> so<00:00:26.240> this<00:00:27.240> point<00:00:27.480> again

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
me to pronounce it so this point again

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.370 
me to pronounce it so this point again
is<00:00:29.269> now<00:00:30.269> we<00:00:30.689> change<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.019> weight<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.289> this

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
is now we change the weight of this

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.319 
is now we change the weight of this
quick<00:00:33.140> so<00:00:34.140> spawning<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.920> go<00:00:35.309> down<00:00:35.520> in<00:00:35.700> size<00:00:35.940> so

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
quick so spawning is go down in size so

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.750 
quick so spawning is go down in size so

it's<00:02:09.160> really<00:02:09.340> rather<00:02:09.520> floppy<00:02:11.760> it's<00:02:12.760> not

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
it's really rather floppy it's not

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.370 
it's really rather floppy it's not
really<00:02:13.240> going<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:13.390> transmit<00:02:13.840> a<00:02:13.930> lot<00:02:13.959> of<00:02:14.140> power

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
really going to transmit a lot of power

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.020 
really going to transmit a lot of power
also<00:02:14.830> you've<00:02:14.950> put<00:02:15.069> a<00:02:15.100> lot<00:02:15.190> of<00:02:15.400> stress<00:02:15.640> on<00:02:15.760> each

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
also you've put a lot of stress on each

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.220 
also you've put a lot of stress on each
gear<00:02:16.330> up<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.660> chain

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
gear up the chain

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.510 
gear up the chain
it's<00:02:17.920> freeze<00:02:18.160> them<00:02:18.310> all<00:02:18.400> up<00:02:20.250> move<00:02:21.250> all<00:02:21.400> the

it's freeze them all up move all the

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.770 
it's freeze them all up move all the
axis<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:23.430> then<00:02:24.430> remake<00:02:24.940> them<00:02:25.239> from<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.630> main

basic<00:05:27.190> build<00:05:27.370> of<00:05:27.520> an<00:05:27.580> athlete<00:05:27.849> genes<00:05:28.410> only

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
basic build of an athlete genes only

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.170 
basic build of an athlete genes only
problem<00:05:29.740> is<00:05:29.800> this<00:05:30.009> gears<00:05:30.340> up<00:05:30.520> on<00:05:30.699> two<00:05:30.880> gears

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
problem is this gears up on two gears

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.960 
problem is this gears up on two gears
which<00:05:31.360> isn't<00:05:31.750> really<00:05:31.900> worth<00:05:32.199> doing<00:05:32.819> so<00:05:33.819> what

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
which isn't really worth doing so what

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.600 
which isn't really worth doing so what
you<00:05:34.090> can<00:05:34.360> do<00:05:34.690> I<00:05:34.900> shall<00:05:35.380> build<00:05:35.860> it<00:05:36.099> for<00:05:36.310> you<00:05:36.460> it'd

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
you can do I shall build it for you it'd

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.939 
you can do I shall build it for you it'd
be<00:05:36.639> much<00:05:36.880> simpler<00:05:39.060> no<00:05:40.060> sudden<00:05:40.569> choke<00:05:40.949> I'll

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:41.949 
be much simpler no sudden choke I'll

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:46.070 
be much simpler no sudden choke I'll
head<00:05:42.190> back<00:05:42.220> over<00:05:42.699> to<00:05:43.090> these<00:05:43.300> simple<00:05:43.900> gears

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080
