00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:26.750
 here we have our jewel gm with 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:30.500
 voice function that goes very well on 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:34.580
 everything for people with problems of 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:37.530
 vision or those that we have little view as 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.410
 I for example 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.390
 I'm going to make a chicken that's already a chicken 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.090
 the tail but well it will not be able to be 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.829
 because I do not have a tail then it will be a 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.370
 improvised chicken I'll better put beer 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.260
 well I will use the program to 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.010
 what do you see 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.010
 landis 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.040
 it reaches me so you can see 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.320
 caballé 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.840
 I'm going to put less time 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.140
 well I will use legumes and then 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.140
 so later I do not do well 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:40.720
 the chicken is good because it's frying ok 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.830
 and then I 'll put 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.830
 the vegetables 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.390
 or the onion 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.390
 and 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.150
 depending on what garlic I will put 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.830
 two 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.130
 the loves of these are cooled with force 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.350
 I fed them 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.010
 look, I have an onion cut one 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.060
 whole family and good teeth 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:28.319
 garlic with skin and I make a couple of cuts 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.810
 do the following in pots 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:35.510
 I was staying very nice 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:39.250
 when watching on this side too 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.250
 we will add even if there is not below 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.870
 so 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.680
 tomato to small pieces that then not 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.680
 you will notice almost 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.360
 richard 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.030

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.270

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.970
 let's go salty 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:40.230
 and I'm going to throw it out of water because 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.230
 will release the chicken the vegetables 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.260
 cancel this menu 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.980
 and I'm going to put myself in a chicken meat 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.400
 I'm going to lower it 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.560
 and we let it go 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.560
 to remove 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.739
