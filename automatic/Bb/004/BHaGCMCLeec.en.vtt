just<00:00:07.830> a<00:00:07.919> simple<00:00:08.220> clamp<00:00:08.580> doesn't<00:00:09.240> even<00:00:09.330> require

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
just a simple clamp doesn't even require

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.230 
just a simple clamp doesn't even require
any<00:00:09.960> gluing<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.500> such<00:00:10.710> that<00:00:11.400> you<00:00:11.730> that<00:00:12.179> you

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
any gluing and such that you that you

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.230 
any gluing and such that you that you
use<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:13.559> end<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:13.980> it's<00:00:14.429> just<00:00:14.700> basically<00:00:15.089> a

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
use to to end it it's just basically a

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.660 
use to to end it it's just basically a
plastic<00:00:15.809> figure<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.440> you<00:00:17.130> bend<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.490> hose

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
plastic figure a and you bend the hose

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.849 
plastic figure a and you bend the hose
over<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.720> you<00:00:19.050> shove<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.380> back<00:00:19.529> in<00:00:19.590> and

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
over and you shove it back in and

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.050 
over and you shove it back in and
believe<00:00:20.039> that<00:00:20.070> or<00:00:20.310> not<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.670> looks<00:00:20.820> like<00:00:20.939> a

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
believe that or not it looks like a

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.910 
believe that or not it looks like a
goofy<00:00:21.810> design<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.439> think<00:00:22.680> all<00:00:22.800> that

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
goofy design and you think all that

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.250 
goofy design and you think all that
would<00:00:23.070> never<00:00:23.220> stop<00:00:23.519> water<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:24.960> remember

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
would never stop water that you remember

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.779 
would never stop water that you remember
from<00:00:25.289> playing<00:00:25.650> with<00:00:25.830> hoses<00:00:26.070> when<00:00:26.400> we're<00:00:26.519> kids

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
from playing with hoses when we're kids

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.670 
from playing with hoses when we're kids
and<00:00:26.970> such<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.570> actually<00:00:28.050> does<00:00:28.230> stop

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
and such that that actually does stop

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.429 
and such that that actually does stop
the<00:00:28.830> water<00:00:29.039> off<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.599> I've<00:00:30.599> yet<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.869> ever<00:00:31.109> see

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
where this tree and this tree here you'd

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.600 
where this tree and this tree here you'd
have<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> pretty<00:01:11.360> sad<00:01:12.710> year<00:01:13.710> as<00:01:13.890> far<00:01:14.189> as<00:01:14.280> fruit

here<00:01:32.400> alright<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.630> tree<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.350> isn't<00:01:35.220> dead

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
here alright this tree is is isn't dead

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.550 
here alright this tree is is isn't dead
I've<00:01:35.759> scraped<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.180> bark<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.509> little<00:01:36.630> bit<00:01:36.900> but

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
I've scraped the bark a little bit but

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.560 
I've scraped the bark a little bit but
it<00:01:37.829> probably<00:01:38.280> won't<00:01:38.430> do<00:01:38.700> much<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:39.119> year<00:01:39.180> and

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
it probably won't do much this year and

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.179 
it probably won't do much this year and
it's<00:01:39.900> been<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.290> ground<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.619> couple<00:01:40.920> years

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
it's been in the ground a couple years

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.899 
it's been in the ground a couple years
so<00:01:42.119> again<00:01:42.560> there<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.829> certain<00:01:44.399> quality

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
so again there is a certain quality

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.539 
so again there is a certain quality
about<00:01:45.720> quantity<00:01:46.409> here's<00:01:47.399> another<00:01:47.520> fig

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
about quantity here's another fig

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:55.010 
about quantity here's another fig
roughly<00:01:50.549> three<00:01:50.790> years<00:01:51.000> old
