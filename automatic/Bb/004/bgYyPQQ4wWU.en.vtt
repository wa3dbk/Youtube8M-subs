00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.090 
everyone today I will show you how to do

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.330 
everyone today I will show you how to do
a<00:00:11.120> 3d<00:00:11.540> copy<00:00:11.750> of<00:00:11.960> an<00:00:12.080> object<00:00:12.500> first<00:00:12.860> we<00:00:13.160> will

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
a 3d copy of an object first we will

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.430 
a 3d copy of an object first we will
scan<00:00:13.850> an<00:00:13.970> original<00:00:14.450> object<00:00:14.900> and<00:00:15.110> then<00:00:15.230> make<00:00:15.410> a

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
scan an original object and then make a

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.620 
scan an original object and then make a
plastic<00:00:15.950> copy<00:00:16.160> out<00:00:16.340> of<00:00:16.369> it<00:00:16.670> and<00:00:16.850> all<00:00:17.300> you<00:00:17.420> have

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
plastic copy out of it and all you have

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.570 
plastic copy out of it and all you have
to<00:00:17.660> do<00:00:17.900> is<00:00:18.050> pressing<00:00:18.590> the<00:00:18.619> copy<00:00:18.890> button<00:00:19.160> on<00:00:19.490> the

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
to do is pressing the copy button on the

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.060 
to do is pressing the copy button on the
Seuss<00:00:19.910> machine<00:00:20.300> however<00:00:21.290> if<00:00:21.619> you<00:00:21.740> like<00:00:21.890> to

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
Seuss machine however if you like to

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.220 
Seuss machine however if you like to
modify<00:00:22.490> this<00:00:22.550> original<00:00:23.150> object<00:00:23.570> and<00:00:23.720> for

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
modify this original object and for

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.640 
modify this original object and for
example<00:00:24.440> scale<00:00:24.950> it<00:00:25.100> up<00:00:25.190> scale<00:00:25.910> it<00:00:26.060> down<00:00:26.090> or

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
example scale it up scale it down or

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.770 
example scale it up scale it down or
rotate<00:00:27.650> it<00:00:27.860> then<00:00:28.430> you<00:00:29.030> have<00:00:29.180> to<00:00:29.330> do<00:00:29.420> the<00:00:29.570> copy

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:29.780 
rotate it then you have to do the copy

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.200 
rotate it then you have to do the copy
process<00:00:30.020> manually<00:00:30.800> and<00:00:31.039> you<00:00:31.670> have<00:00:31.789> to<00:00:31.940> start

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
process manually and you have to start

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.780 
process manually and you have to start
with<00:00:32.540> a<00:00:32.599> scanning<00:00:33.080> process<00:00:33.129> then<00:00:34.129> modify<00:00:34.730> it

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
with a scanning process then modify it

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.030 
with a scanning process then modify it
and<00:00:35.120> then<00:00:35.660> later<00:00:35.870> print<00:00:36.260> out<00:00:36.410> the<00:00:36.590> object

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
and then later print out the object

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.580 
and then later print out the object

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
swiping four times over the object what

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.710 
swiping four times over the object what
the<00:01:32.390> object<00:01:32.750> is<00:01:32.920> rotating<00:01:34.030> 360<00:01:35.030> degrees<00:01:35.330> and

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
the object is rotating 360 degrees and

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.260 
the object is rotating 360 degrees and
here<00:01:35.900> you<00:01:35.990> can<00:01:36.170> see<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:36.530> life<00:01:36.710> update<00:01:37.040> in<00:01:37.520> the

automatically stitch together these four

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.770 
automatically stitch together these four
individual<00:01:50.570> scans<00:01:50.960> and<00:01:51.430> merge<00:01:52.430> them<00:01:52.790> to<00:01:53.180> one

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
individual scans and merge them to one

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.870 
individual scans and merge them to one
point<00:01:54.110> cloud

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.359 

you<00:01:59.659> can<00:01:59.869> look<00:02:00.229> at<00:02:00.380> this<00:02:00.530> point<00:02:00.770> cloud<00:02:01.100> from

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
you can look at this point cloud from

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.969 
you can look at this point cloud from
all<00:02:01.520> kinds<00:02:01.880> of<00:02:01.909> angles<00:02:03.340> and<00:02:05.469> in<00:02:06.469> the<00:02:06.560> next<00:02:06.740> step

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
all kinds of angles and in the next step

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.550 
all kinds of angles and in the next step
this<00:02:07.909> point<00:02:08.179> cloud<00:02:08.390> will<00:02:08.630> automatically<00:02:09.410> be

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
this point cloud will automatically be

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.030 
this point cloud will automatically be
converted<00:02:09.769> into<00:02:10.369> an<00:02:10.700> STL<00:02:11.269> file<00:02:11.599> into<00:02:12.200> a<00:02:12.230> 3d

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.690 
model and before you print this 3d model
you<00:02:21.290> have<00:02:21.440> to<00:02:21.560> remove<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:22.069> original<00:02:22.160> object

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
you have to remove the original object

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.180 
you have to remove the original object
from<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.330> suit's<00:02:23.540> machine<00:02:26.620> now<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:27.680> have<00:02:28.010> to

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
from the suit's machine now you have to

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.259 
from the suit's machine now you have to
set<00:02:28.940> their<00:02:29.300> settings<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.980> density<00:02:31.760> as<00:02:32.030> well

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
set their settings the density as well

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.930 
set their settings the density as well
as<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.569> layer<00:02:32.780> height<00:02:33.140> of<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.950> object<00:02:34.519> which

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
as the layer height of the object which

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.570 
as the layer height of the object which
is<00:02:35.120> pretty<00:02:35.330> much<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.660> resolution<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.580> then

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
is pretty much the resolution and then

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.300 
is pretty much the resolution and then
you<00:02:37.760> press<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.030> slice<00:02:38.510> button<00:02:38.959> and<00:02:39.200> here<00:02:40.190> is

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
you press the slice button and here is
