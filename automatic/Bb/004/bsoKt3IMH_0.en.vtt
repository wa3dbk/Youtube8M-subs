loop<00:03:00.489> a<00:03:00.700> little<00:03:01.000> bit<00:03:01.329> smaller<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.989> third

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
loop a little bit smaller and the third

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.680 
loop a little bit smaller and the third
loop<00:03:05.560> a<00:03:05.860> little<00:03:06.370> bit<00:03:06.640> smaller<00:03:06.970> than<00:03:07.090> that<00:03:09.690> then

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
loop a little bit smaller than that then

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.600 
loop a little bit smaller than that then
you<00:03:10.870> want<00:03:10.989> to<00:03:11.110> take<00:03:11.200> a<00:03:11.349> thinner<00:03:11.769> piece<00:03:12.129> for<00:03:12.489> the

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
you want to take a thinner piece for the

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:22.789 
you want to take a thinner piece for the
next<00:03:13.379> hair<00:03:14.880> curl<00:03:15.880> it<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.870> after<00:03:20.829> you<00:03:20.980> curl<00:03:21.280> it

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
next hair curl it and after you curl it

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.809 
next hair curl it and after you curl it
you<00:03:23.799> loop<00:03:24.069> and<00:03:24.280> pin<00:03:25.950> so<00:03:26.950> see<00:03:27.190> how<00:03:27.340> it's<00:03:27.549> thinner

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
you loop and pin so see how it's thinner

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:35.220 
you loop and pin so see how it's thinner
than<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.209> first<00:03:28.480> piece<00:03:33.599> I'm<00:03:34.599> going<00:03:34.870> to<00:03:34.989> loop

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
than the first piece I'm going to loop

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.229 
than the first piece I'm going to loop
that<00:03:35.500> one<00:03:35.680> a<00:03:35.709> little<00:03:36.010> bit<00:03:36.250> smaller<00:03:36.609> than<00:03:36.760> I<00:03:36.940> did

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
that one a little bit smaller than I did

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.199 
that one a little bit smaller than I did
the<00:03:37.450> first<00:03:37.480> piece<00:03:38.489> don't<00:03:39.489> worry<00:03:39.700> about<00:03:39.970> the

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
the first piece don't worry about the

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:47.670 
the first piece don't worry about the
alfalfa<00:03:41.109> hair<00:03:41.560> going<00:03:41.769> on<00:03:46.230> I'm<00:03:47.230> just<00:03:47.349> going<00:03:47.620> to

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
alfalfa hair going on I'm just going to

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.580 
alfalfa hair going on I'm just going to
pin<00:03:48.489> some<00:03:48.849> smaller<00:03:49.329> loops<00:03:49.690> in<00:03:49.900> front<00:03:50.260> of<00:03:50.380> the

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
pin some smaller loops in front of the

00:03:50.590 --> 00:04:05.309 
pin some smaller loops in front of the
very<00:03:50.889> first<00:03:51.220> loop<00:03:51.519> that<00:03:51.790> I<00:03:51.819> did

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.739 

and<00:04:05.980> I'm<00:04:06.189> just<00:04:06.370> going<00:04:06.609> to<00:04:06.640> start<00:04:06.969> building

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:07.749 
and I'm just going to start building

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:14.789 
and I'm just going to start building
this<00:04:08.170> whole<00:04:08.499> hairpiece<00:04:12.959> make<00:04:13.959> sure<00:04:13.989> that<00:04:14.290> you

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
this whole hairpiece make sure that you

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:20.270 
this whole hairpiece make sure that you
loop<00:04:16.139> different<00:04:17.139> thicknesses<00:04:17.739> of<00:04:17.799> hair<00:04:18.310> and

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
loop different thicknesses of hair and

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.820 
loop different thicknesses of hair and
loop<00:04:21.280> them<00:04:21.519> smaller<00:04:22.090> and<00:04:22.240> bigger<00:04:22.599> and<00:04:23.050> it's

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
loop them smaller and bigger and it's

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.490 
loop them smaller and bigger and it's
okay<00:04:24.220> see<00:04:24.280> how<00:04:24.490> the<00:04:24.669> end<00:04:24.970> isn't<00:04:25.180> pinned<00:04:26.020> that's

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
okay see how the end isn't pinned that's

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:36.800 
okay see how the end isn't pinned that's
fine<00:04:26.949> oh<00:04:27.840> I'm<00:04:28.840> easily<00:04:29.500> amused<00:04:29.680> oh<00:04:31.470> hello<00:04:32.470> hey

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.260 

and<00:04:37.810> I'm<00:04:38.740> just<00:04:38.919> going<00:04:39.009> to<00:04:39.099> keep<00:04:39.370> continuing<00:04:40.000> to

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
and I'm just going to keep continuing to

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:52.420 
and I'm just going to keep continuing to
build<00:04:40.539> the<00:04:40.840> front<00:04:41.169> part<00:04:41.590> of<00:04:41.710> this<00:04:42.220> hairpiece

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.880 

I<00:04:52.520> want<00:04:53.000> this<00:04:53.120> one<00:04:53.180> really<00:04:53.600> defined<00:04:54.140> so<00:04:54.500> I<00:04:54.530> held

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
I want this one really defined so I held

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:56.920 
I want this one really defined so I held
it<00:04:55.040> there<00:04:55.190> a<00:04:55.250> little<00:04:55.340> bit<00:04:55.670> longer<00:04:55.880> and<00:04:56.270> I'm

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
it there a little bit longer and I'm

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.810 
it there a little bit longer and I'm
going<00:04:57.110> to<00:04:57.140> make<00:04:57.230> very<00:04:57.800> little<00:04:57.920> loops<00:04:58.430> out<00:04:58.670> of

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
going to make very little loops out of

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.960 
going to make very little loops out of
these<00:04:59.950> because<00:05:00.950> these<00:05:01.100> are<00:05:01.280> the<00:05:01.370> very<00:05:01.670> front

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
these because these are the very front

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:12.220 
these because these are the very front
loops<00:05:02.210> of<00:05:02.390> my<00:05:02.600> hairpiece<00:05:10.930> see<00:05:11.930> how<00:05:12.050> they're

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
loops of my hairpiece see how they're

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.670 
loops of my hairpiece see how they're
smaller<00:05:12.500> than<00:05:12.740> the<00:05:12.860> other<00:05:13.190> loops<00:05:14.500> no<00:05:15.500> other

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
smaller than the other loops no other

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.960 
smaller than the other loops no other
loops<00:05:15.980> are<00:05:16.130> going<00:05:16.250> to<00:05:16.340> go<00:05:16.400> in<00:05:16.490> front<00:05:16.700> of<00:05:16.820> those

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
loops are going to go in front of those

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.930 
loops are going to go in front of those
so<00:05:17.210> I<00:05:17.240> wanted<00:05:17.600> those<00:05:17.750> to<00:05:17.990> be<00:05:18.110> the<00:05:18.290> smallest<00:05:18.940> and

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
so I wanted those to be the smallest and

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.150 
so I wanted those to be the smallest and
now<00:05:20.600> I'm<00:05:20.810> in<00:05:20.960> the<00:05:21.080> back<00:05:21.290> you<00:05:21.470> should<00:05:21.560> be<00:05:21.800> a<00:05:21.830> pro

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
now I'm in the back you should be a pro

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.070 
now I'm in the back you should be a pro
by<00:05:22.190> now<00:05:22.430> with<00:05:22.940> all<00:05:23.090> those<00:05:23.270> dang<00:05:23.540> looping<00:05:23.930> and

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
by now with all those dang looping and

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.040 
by now with all those dang looping and
penny<00:05:24.700> you<00:05:25.700> don't<00:05:25.850> even<00:05:25.970> need<00:05:26.180> a<00:05:26.240> mirror<00:05:26.600> just

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
penny you don't even need a mirror just

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:35.520 
penny you don't even need a mirror just
loop<00:05:27.260> it<00:05:27.440> and<00:05:27.680> pin<00:05:28.130> it<00:05:31.900> loop<00:05:32.900> it<00:05:33.080> and<00:05:33.580> pin<00:05:34.580> it<00:05:34.730> I

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
loop it and pin it loop it and pin it I

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:48.080 
loop it and pin it loop it and pin it I
think<00:05:36.530> you're<00:05:36.680> getting<00:05:36.770> the<00:05:36.980> hang<00:05:37.100> of<00:05:37.340> it

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.120 

now<00:05:48.930> what<00:05:49.139> you're<00:05:49.230> going<00:05:49.380> to<00:05:49.470> do<00:05:49.650> is<00:05:49.830> take<00:05:50.100> a

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
now what you're going to do is take a

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.280 
now what you're going to do is take a
bobby<00:05:50.400> pin<00:05:50.550> and<00:05:50.940> pin<00:05:51.389> any<00:05:51.660> pieces<00:05:51.990> that<00:05:52.260> you

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.290 
bobby pin and pin any pieces that you

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.010 
bobby pin and pin any pieces that you
don't<00:05:52.590> like<00:05:53.240> you<00:05:54.240> know<00:05:54.360> what<00:05:54.510> I'm<00:05:54.630> looking<00:05:54.900> at

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
don't like you know what I'm looking at

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.230 
don't like you know what I'm looking at
I<00:05:55.199> don't<00:05:55.440> like<00:05:55.560> that<00:05:55.590> piece<00:05:56.190> right<00:05:56.340> there<00:05:56.550> I'm

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
I don't like that piece right there I'm

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:04.780 
I don't like that piece right there I'm
going<00:05:57.540> to<00:05:57.600> pin<00:05:57.780> that<00:05:57.960> in<00:05:59.150> tuck<00:06:00.150> it<00:06:00.330> in<00:06:00.510> pin<00:06:00.750> it<00:06:00.930> I

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.120 

also<00:06:05.790> don't<00:06:06.150> like<00:06:06.270> the<00:06:06.540> piece<00:06:06.810> back<00:06:07.050> there<00:06:07.440> so

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
also don't like the piece back there so

also don't like the piece back there so
I'm<00:06:08.280> going<00:06:08.490> to<00:06:08.550> tuck<00:06:08.790> that<00:06:08.820> in<00:06:09.270> pin<00:06:09.660> it<00:06:09.810> and
