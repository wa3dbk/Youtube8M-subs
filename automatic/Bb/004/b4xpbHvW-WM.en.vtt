00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:07.990
 I was insanely happy to know offended 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:10.120
 She that I know I was awesome in that 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:14.860
 child with us in the area the 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:17.470
 insulted liver sausage I found offended 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.880
 Great because I wanted the other people 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.560
 punish and then I have me too 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.699
 always presented the same as I die 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.699
 and then they are standing at a grave 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.830
 really regret that from the heart 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.780
 and they will not be happy anymore 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.160
 that was very important when they got away 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.059
 situation are a few 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:47.910
 sabrinas died my fault it has 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:50.460
 reassured me , I was 11 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:56.360
 12 13 14 I have the pretty pretty 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:01:00.989
 Well, until 28 I found the thought 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:04.110
 actually very nice that I will 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.510
 started to think so well 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.159
 Do not worry me now 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.680
 I have always been too long now 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.600
 not dead yet not come and 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.010
 the pleasure of seeing the people 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.280
 my tombstone I have to say now 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.110
 obviously change something myself and me 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.740
 also thought the whole just me 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.880
 just need the right people, the 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.060
 right people will find the right one 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.520
 man can find the right job find the 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.409
 Clothes size then everything is wonderful 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.150
 not only finally lose weight when I am 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.460
 finally that's when I finally have this 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.789
 I'm fine, no one knows 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.789
 you probably 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.750
 yes that did not work 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.090
 I then stupidly noticed 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.380
 I seem to have a problem 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.730
 that I have to solve myself and that 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.870
 not just a problem to his 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.470
 I'm scared but I realized 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.390
 have several of what we said earlier 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.830
 I always have to say no 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.810
 to give too much again 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.760
 I also have it selfishly 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.350
 I have always done so much 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.540
 in the hope that someday 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.520
 says buddy sabrina people is great 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:16.010
 that you really leave so 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.150
 she never says no 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.460
 I do not want to be like that either 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.360
 I am big 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.710
 Strangely enough, I felt 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.960
 not so happy with it 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:29.590
 and when I started saying no if 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.260
 the people appalled fits very well 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:37.960
 become realistic 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:40.030
 so I said yes with yours 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.980
 Spiritual background supposedly shops 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.450
 yes books over it and now me 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.210
 not to the airport just because you're straight 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:50.500
 So you can not really do that much 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:52.140
 cheap sure i am selfish 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.670
 become 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.290
 that was an exercise I once did 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.350
 she has learned all over spain 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:02.280
 does not mean to defend 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.480
 you know that is a great exercise 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.150
 It took me to see her 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.800
 but that was perfect then 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:13.140
 pretty much the choice 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:18.310
 that's all they accuse me of 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:20.470
 actually true somehow nothing if 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.090
 we say more there you are quite unreal 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:28.000
 yes that's right i 'm definitely 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:31.150
 also vain you think but now only 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.610
 Actually , that was clear 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.099
 I'm just thinking right now 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.170
 me or to you you can not 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:39.370
 leave 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.140
 Certainly one can sometimes if 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.329
 I look back there were moments there 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.670
 you could not rely on me 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.670
 what could blame her more 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:59.549
 I was not exactly there last year 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.269
 Do you know she has been hanging around 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.269
 Absolutely correct 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.780
 the moment you get out of this 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.780
 deflation situation and it 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.550
 were my main way 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.340
 not to deal with life 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:22.320
 defend happened is the 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.910
 Others are speechless because that's the argument 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.370
 is gone 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.500
 is the right one and I do not have that 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.210
 done because I just wanted to play like that 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.590
 that is a big difference whether you are 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.520
 just say 'I use it once the 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:40.850
 it already shows you really recognize 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.850
 if someone says something to me that's right 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.849
 this is true
