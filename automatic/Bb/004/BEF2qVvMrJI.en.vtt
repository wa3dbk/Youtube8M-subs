are those enough organizations for you
so<00:00:47.670> what<00:00:48.120> exactly<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.870> lunar<00:00:49.320> back<00:00:49.500> home

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
so what exactly is a lunar back home

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.280 
so what exactly is a lunar back home
well<00:00:50.430> it's<00:00:50.730> like<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:50.970> excavator<00:00:51.780> here<00:00:52.110> on

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
well it's like this excavator here on

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.590 
well it's like this excavator here on
earth<00:00:52.470> it's<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.250> big<00:00:53.430> machine<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.059> digs<00:00:54.330> dirt

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
earth it's a big machine that digs dirt

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.250 
earth it's a big machine that digs dirt
so<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:56.010> lunar<00:00:56.580> backhoe<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.360> big<00:00:57.690> machine<00:00:58.080> that

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
so a lunar backhoe is a big machine that

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.200 
so a lunar backhoe is a big machine that
digs<00:00:58.470> lunar<00:00:58.890> regolith<00:00:59.370> wonder<00:01:01.909> nASA<00:01:02.909> has<00:01:03.059> a

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
digs lunar regolith wonder nASA has a

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.579 
digs lunar regolith wonder nASA has a
lot<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.420> plans<00:01:03.720> for<00:01:04.019> going<00:01:04.170> back<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.440> the<00:01:04.559> moon

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
lot of plans for going back to the moon

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.740 
lot of plans for going back to the moon
right<00:01:04.920> now<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.090> one<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.420> initial

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
right now and this is one of the initial

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:19.490 
right now and this is one of the initial
steps<00:01:07.050> in<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:11.990> 3<00:01:12.990> 2<00:01:13.950> 1<00:01:14.370> power<00:01:15.270> run<00:01:18.409> in<00:01:19.409> the

placed randomly in the sandbox and had

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.669 
placed randomly in the sandbox and had
to<00:02:07.920> use<00:02:08.129> some<00:02:08.610> means<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.209> navigation<00:02:09.679> to

actually find his way around there are

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.890 
actually find his way around there are
rocks<00:02:13.769> placed<00:02:14.220> around<00:02:14.580> in<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:15.690> we<00:02:15.750> didn't

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
rocks placed around in it and we didn't

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.690

changes<00:04:26.240> based<00:04:26.510> on<00:04:26.750> the<00:04:26.900> pull<00:04:27.080> of<00:04:27.139> gravity<00:04:27.169> a

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
changes based on the pull of gravity a

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.760 
changes based on the pull of gravity a
70<00:04:28.940> kilogram<00:04:29.450> back<00:04:29.630> home<00:04:29.870> on<00:04:29.960> earth<00:04:30.169> would

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
70 kilogram back home on earth would

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.400 
70 kilogram back home on earth would
weigh<00:04:30.919> 16<00:04:31.639> that<00:04:31.910> amount<00:04:32.210> on<00:04:32.389> the<00:04:32.539> moon<00:04:32.720> that's

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
weigh 16 that amount on the moon that's

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.510 
weigh 16 that amount on the moon that's
only<00:04:33.680> a<00:04:33.800> little<00:04:34.039> over<00:04:34.310> 11<00:04:34.820> kilograms

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
only a little over 11 kilograms

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.510 
only a little over 11 kilograms
so<00:04:37.120> who<00:04:37.539> won<00:04:37.780> the<00:04:37.960> contest<00:04:38.520> well

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
so who won the contest well

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.650 
so who won the contest well
unfortunately<00:04:40.530> no<00:04:41.530> one<00:04:41.800> did<00:04:42.240> but<00:04:43.240> everyone

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
unfortunately no one did but everyone

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.110 
unfortunately no one did but everyone
had<00:04:43.900> lots<00:04:44.199> of<00:04:44.379> fun<00:04:44.650> and<00:04:45.009> next<00:04:45.610> time<00:04:45.879> they'll

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
had lots of fun and next time they'll

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.119 
had lots of fun and next time they'll
have<00:04:46.300> a<00:04:46.330> better<00:04:46.690> idea<00:04:46.780> of<00:04:47.229> what<00:04:47.530> it<00:04:47.650> takes<00:04:47.919> to

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:48.129 
have a better idea of what it takes to

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:52.260 
have a better idea of what it takes to
succeed<00:04:49.620> so<00:04:50.620> the<00:04:51.310> next<00:04:51.340> time<00:04:51.729> you<00:04:51.909> go<00:04:52.090> by<00:04:52.240> a

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
succeed so the next time you go by a

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.480 
succeed so the next time you go by a
construction<00:04:52.900> site<00:04:53.139> think<00:04:53.620> about<00:04:53.830> how<00:04:54.099> hard

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
construction site think about how hard

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.189 
construction site think about how hard
it's<00:04:54.669> going<00:04:54.879> to<00:04:54.970> be<00:04:55.090> to<00:04:55.300> do<00:04:55.419> the<00:04:55.539> same<00:04:55.780> kind<00:04:56.080> of

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 
it's going to be to do the same kind of

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:58.680 
it's going to be to do the same kind of
work<00:04:56.440> on<00:04:56.650> the<00:04:56.919> moon<00:04:57.129> and<00:04:57.460> who<00:04:58.180> knows<00:04:58.360> maybe

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
work on the moon and who knows maybe

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.689 
work on the moon and who knows maybe
you'll<00:04:59.289> be<00:04:59.440> the<00:04:59.470> next<00:04:59.590> one<00:04:59.979> to<00:05:00.009> win<00:05:00.280> a<00:05:00.310> future

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
you'll be the next one to win a future

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:11.890 
you'll be the next one to win a future
NASA<00:05:00.909> challenge
