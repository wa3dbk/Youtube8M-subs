00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
first feature of one point two point one

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.959 
first feature of one point two point one
of<00:00:35.070> PC<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:36.140> the<00:00:37.140> new<00:00:37.320> map<00:00:37.950> file<00:00:38.280> format<00:00:38.790> called

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
of PC is the new map file format called

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.260 
of PC is the new map file format called
anvil<00:00:39.600> which<00:00:40.200> means<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.770> height<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.340> actually

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
anvil which means the height is actually

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.479 
anvil which means the height is actually
going<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.540> be<00:00:42.660> twice<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.739> what<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.340> used

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
going to be twice that of what it used

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.000 
going to be twice that of what it used
to<00:00:44.640> be<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.120> these<00:00:45.390> maps<00:00:45.660> are<00:00:45.870> going<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.559> be<00:00:46.770> able

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
to be so these maps are going to be able

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.889 
to be so these maps are going to be able
to<00:00:47.219> like<00:00:47.399> reach<00:00:47.640> literally<00:00:48.360> into<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.660> sky

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
to like reach literally into the sky

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.410 
to like reach literally into the sky
because<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.649> sky<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:49.980> going<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.760> be<00:00:51.059> twice<00:00:51.360> as

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
because the sky is going to be twice as

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.979 
because the sky is going to be twice as
high<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.500> these<00:00:52.739> maps<00:00:53.010> bigger<00:00:53.850> maps<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.449> always

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
high so these maps bigger maps is always

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.670 
high so these maps bigger maps is always
a<00:00:55.170> plus<00:00:56.120> ok<00:00:57.120> so<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.449> next<00:00:57.480> feature<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.170> going

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
a plus ok so the next feature is going

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.950 
a plus ok so the next feature is going
to<00:00:58.770> be<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.070> added<00:00:59.489> jungle<00:00:59.969> biome<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:00.870> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
to be the added jungle biome so the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.410 
to be the added jungle biome so the
jungle<00:01:01.350> biome<00:01:01.739> looks<00:01:02.219> exactly<00:01:02.730> like<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.149> jungle

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
jungle biome looks exactly like a jungle

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.440 
jungle biome looks exactly like a jungle
it's<00:01:04.049> going<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.320> be<00:01:04.409> very<00:01:04.619> lush<00:01:05.040> green<00:01:05.909> it's

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
it's going to be very lush green it's

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.140 
it's going to be very lush green it's
going<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.659> full<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.110> trees<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.710> one<00:01:08.640> new<00:01:08.909> thing

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
going to full of trees and one new thing

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.300 
going to full of trees and one new thing
for<00:01:09.210> all<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.659> Xbox<00:01:10.049> people<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.130> could

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
for all the Xbox people is that it could

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.730 
for all the Xbox people is that it could
feature<00:01:11.520> cocoa<00:01:12.180> pods<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.810> when<00:01:13.380> these<00:01:13.530> are

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
feature cocoa pods and when these are

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.640 
feature cocoa pods and when these are
broken<00:01:14.159> they<00:01:14.580> actually<00:01:14.790> drop<00:01:15.240> cocoa<00:01:15.720> beans<00:01:15.960> so

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
broken they actually drop cocoa beans so

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.920 
broken they actually drop cocoa beans so
now<00:01:16.890> we<00:01:16.950> are<00:01:17.369> going<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.850> have<00:01:17.970> access<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.600> cocoa

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
now we are going to have access to cocoa

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.570 
now we are going to have access to cocoa
beans<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.439> we're<00:01:19.890> not<00:01:19.979> going<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.250> have<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.460> go

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
beans and we're not going to have to go

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.420 
beans and we're not going to have to go
searching<00:01:20.850> through<00:01:21.360> mob<00:01:21.930> spawners<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:23.159> find

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
searching through mob spawners to find

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.840 
searching through mob spawners to find
them<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:25.189> cocoa<00:01:26.189> beans<00:01:26.520> will<00:01:26.729> be

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
them so that the cocoa beans will be

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.850 
them so that the cocoa beans will be
easier<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.720> obtain<00:01:28.610> ok<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:29.840> they<00:01:30.840> will<00:01:31.110> also<00:01:31.710> be

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
easier to obtain ok so they will also be

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.179 
easier to obtain ok so they will also be
adding<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.400> slots<00:01:32.759> which<00:01:33.509> are<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:34.200> new<00:01:34.799> animal

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
adding a slots which are a new animal

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.390 
adding a slots which are a new animal
and<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.689> beauty<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.259> these<00:01:37.380> ocelots<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.159> they

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
and the beauty of these ocelots is they

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.210 
and the beauty of these ocelots is they
are<00:01:38.430> able<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.000> be<00:01:39.210> tamed<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:40.409> just<00:01:40.829> like<00:01:40.979> dogs

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
are able to be tamed so just like dogs

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.460 
are able to be tamed so just like dogs
we<00:01:41.610> are<00:01:41.759> going<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.240> be<00:01:42.360> able<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.750> tame<00:01:42.990> these

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
we are going to be able to tame these

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.520 
we are going to be able to tame these
ocelots<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:45.149> when<00:01:45.360> they<00:01:45.390> are<00:01:45.540> tamed<00:01:45.990> they

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
ocelots and so when they are tamed they

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.039 
ocelots and so when they are tamed they
actually<00:01:46.710> become<00:01:47.220> cats<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.600> these<00:01:48.720> cats

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
actually become cats and so these cats

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.770 
actually become cats and so these cats
have<00:01:49.380> various<00:01:50.100> different<00:01:50.520> skins<00:01:50.850> just<00:01:51.600> like

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
have various different skins just like

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.560 
have various different skins just like
there<00:01:52.350> are<00:01:52.380> different<00:01:52.860> like<00:01:53.759> all<00:01:54.000> cats<00:01:54.299> look

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
there are different like all cats look

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.630 
there are different like all cats look
differently<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.740> there's<00:01:56.369> going<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.610> be

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
differently so there's going to be

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.760 
differently so there's going to be
different<00:01:56.939> looking<00:01:57.210> cats<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.409> can<00:01:58.590> have

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
different looking cats and you can have

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.429 
different looking cats and you can have
a<00:01:59.040> house<00:01:59.310> full<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.579> cats<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.180> dogs<00:02:00.600> which<00:02:01.290> is
