pipes<00:04:58.229> on<00:04:58.409> this<00:04:58.529> beast<00:04:58.680> as<00:04:58.919> we<00:04:59.130> mentioned

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
pipes on this beast as we mentioned

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.830 
pipes on this beast as we mentioned
quite<00:04:59.849> a<00:04:59.909> few<00:05:00.060> times<00:05:00.240> and<00:05:00.510> it<00:05:00.599> look<00:05:00.810> very

aesthetically pleasing looking for SLI

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:03.530 
aesthetically pleasing looking for SLI
on<00:05:03.060> this<00:05:03.210> month

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
on this month

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.080

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
as well and we got two 6-pin power plugs

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.980 
as well and we got two 6-pin power plugs
so<00:05:06.630> you<00:05:06.720> can<00:05:06.990> definitely<00:05:07.470> run<00:05:07.590> not<00:05:08.190> very<00:05:08.430> big

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
so you can definitely run not very big

so you can definitely run not very big
you<00:05:09.990> don't<00:05:10.110> need<00:05:10.170> a<00:05:10.230> crease<00:05:10.440> power<00:05:10.620> switch<00:05:11.430> is

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
you don't need a crease power switch is

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.370 
you don't need a crease power switch is
