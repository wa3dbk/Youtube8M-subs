a<00:00:46.950> bit<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.340> transformation<00:00:48.180> we<00:00:48.629> really

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
a bit of a transformation we really

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.750 
a bit of a transformation we really
began<00:00:49.170> romantically<00:00:49.860> thinking<00:00:50.280> about<00:00:50.520> what

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
began romantically thinking about what

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.670 
began romantically thinking about what
swam<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.270> river<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.840> what<00:00:52.020> grazed<00:00:52.320> on<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
swam in the river and what grazed on the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.310 
swam in the river and what grazed on the
prairies<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.239> has<00:00:54.390> expanded<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:55.020> an

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
prairies and that has expanded to an

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.770 
prairies and that has expanded to an
amazing<00:00:55.680> network<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.489> farms<00:00:56.940> ranchers

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
amazing network of farms ranchers

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.450 
amazing network of farms ranchers
growers<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.500> purveyors<00:00:58.920> right<00:00:59.280> across

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
growers the purveyors right across

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.260 
growers the purveyors right across
