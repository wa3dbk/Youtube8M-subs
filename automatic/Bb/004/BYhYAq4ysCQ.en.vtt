he'll<00:04:15.140> jump<00:04:15.380> for<00:04:15.590> a<00:04:15.620> ball<00:04:15.830> he'll<00:04:16.370> miss<00:04:16.640> the

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
he'll jump for a ball he'll miss the

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.310 
he'll jump for a ball he'll miss the
first<00:04:17.030> jump<00:04:17.390> and<00:04:17.600> then<00:04:17.720> he'll<00:04:17.870> instantly

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
first jump and then he'll instantly

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.020 
first jump and then he'll instantly
second<00:04:18.709> jump<00:04:18.919> again<00:04:19.160> and<00:04:19.310> that<00:04:19.400> just<00:04:19.609> takes

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
second jump again and that just takes

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.430 
second jump again and that just takes
his<00:04:20.180> total<00:04:20.450> takes<00:04:20.630> his<00:04:20.780> tone<00:04:20.989> then<00:04:21.169> eventually

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
his total takes his tone then eventually

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.740 
his total takes his tone then eventually
