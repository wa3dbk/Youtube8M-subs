unravel the twist because I don't want
to<00:02:29.290> I<00:02:29.620> won't<00:02:30.040> break<00:02:30.730> any<00:02:31.060> of<00:02:31.240> her<00:02:31.420> hair<00:02:31.720> and

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.870 

when<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.650> twist<00:02:35.950> it<00:02:36.190> make<00:02:36.340> sure<00:02:36.370> you<00:02:36.700> don't

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
when you twist it make sure you don't

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.110 
when you twist it make sure you don't
borrow<00:02:37.180> here<00:02:37.690> so<00:02:38.560> basically<00:02:38.770> that<00:02:39.490> means<00:02:39.790> make

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
borrow here so basically that means make

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.180 
borrow here so basically that means make
sure<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:40.420> continue<00:02:40.960> to<00:02:41.290> use<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.650> same<00:02:41.860> two

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
sure you continue to use the same two

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.920 
sure you continue to use the same two
strands<00:02:42.850> so<00:02:43.540> that<00:02:43.780> they<00:02:43.960> unravel<00:02:44.410> very<00:02:44.860> easy

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
strands so that they unravel very easy

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.740 
strands so that they unravel very easy
so<00:02:46.930> I'm<00:02:47.020> just<00:02:47.200> unraveling<00:02:47.890> on<00:02:48.040> one<00:02:48.280> by<00:02:48.490> one<00:02:48.850> and

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
so I'm just unraveling on one by one and

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.350 
so I'm just unraveling on one by one and
I'm<00:02:50.530> being<00:02:50.800> extra<00:02:51.130> gentle<00:02:51.340> when<00:02:51.670> I<00:02:51.730> get<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:52.240> the

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
I'm being extra gentle when I get to the

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.960 
I'm being extra gentle when I get to the
ends<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:55.630> if<00:02:56.200> some<00:02:56.410> of<00:02:56.560> them<00:02:56.680> feel<00:02:56.890> dry<00:02:57.280> feel

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
ends and if some of them feel dry feel

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.480 
ends and if some of them feel dry feel

I'm<00:03:38.980> just<00:03:39.060> going<00:03:40.060> to<00:03:40.860> read<00:03:41.860> moisturize<00:03:42.550> and

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
I'm just going to read moisturize and

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.640 
I'm just going to read moisturize and
pull<00:03:43.330> as<00:03:43.630> I<00:03:43.870> do<00:03:43.930> that

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
pull as I do that

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.030 
pull as I do that
and<00:03:44.860> it'll<00:03:45.790> kind<00:03:45.970> of<00:03:46.120> separate<00:03:46.840> themselves<00:03:47.140> so

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
and it'll kind of separate themselves so

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.410 
and it'll kind of separate themselves so
that<00:03:48.220> it<00:03:48.489> stays<00:03:49.120> me<00:03:50.250> but

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.520 

it<00:03:55.230> gets<00:03:56.060> it's<00:03:57.060> kind<00:03:57.810> of<00:03:57.959> unseparated

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
it gets it's kind of unseparated

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:05.960 
it gets it's kind of unseparated
thickens<00:03:59.310> at<00:03:59.520> the<00:03:59.670> same<00:03:59.940> time<00:04:02.959> so<00:04:04.700> if<00:04:05.700> this

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
thickens at the same time so if this

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.559 
thickens at the same time so if this
were<00:04:06.180> my<00:04:06.420> hair<00:04:06.810> I<00:04:07.220> would<00:04:08.220> use<00:04:08.400> a<00:04:08.430> comb<00:04:08.819> but<00:04:09.330> with

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
were my hair I would use a comb but with

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.880 
were my hair I would use a comb but with
her<00:04:09.780> hair<00:04:10.200> I'm<00:04:11.100> just<00:04:11.489> going<00:04:11.850> to<00:04:12.860> use<00:04:13.860> my

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
her hair I'm just going to use my

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:20.000 
her hair I'm just going to use my
fingers<00:04:14.700> to<00:04:15.680> separate<00:04:17.209> the<00:04:18.320> parts<00:04:19.320> because<00:04:19.889> I

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
fingers to separate the parts because I

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.700 
fingers to separate the parts because I
feel<00:04:20.220> like<00:04:20.400> it's<00:04:20.609> less<00:04:21.510> damaging<00:04:22.169> than<00:04:22.350> using

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
feel like it's less damaging than using

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.370 
feel like it's less damaging than using
the<00:04:22.800> comb<00:04:25.070> so<00:04:26.540> let's<00:04:27.540> turn<00:04:27.780> to<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:28.050> front

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
the comb so let's turn to the front

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.060 
the comb so let's turn to the front
that's<00:04:29.100> what<00:04:29.280> it<00:04:29.490> looks<00:04:29.700> like<00:04:29.910> that<00:04:30.120> I

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
that's what it looks like that I

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.730 
that's what it looks like that I
probably<00:04:32.070> kissed<00:04:32.430> up<00:04:32.700> right<00:04:33.180> here<00:04:33.540> but<00:04:33.960> um<00:04:34.830> I

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
probably kissed up right here but um I

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.210 
probably kissed up right here but um I
don't<00:04:37.740> think<00:04:38.130> it<00:04:38.280> looks<00:04:38.520> neat<00:04:38.970> enough<00:04:39.979> so<00:04:40.979> what

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
don't think it looks neat enough so what

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.850 
don't think it looks neat enough so what
I'm<00:04:41.340> going<00:04:41.550> to<00:04:41.669> do<00:04:42.000> is<00:04:42.389> I'm<00:04:43.110> just<00:04:43.139> kind<00:04:43.560> of<00:04:43.620> put
