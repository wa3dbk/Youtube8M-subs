00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
Empire Strikes Back packaged in I think

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.369 
Empire Strikes Back packaged in I think
we'll<00:00:15.330> probably<00:00:15.389> start<00:00:15.809> with<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:15.960> packaging

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
we'll probably start with the packaging

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.050 
we'll probably start with the packaging
itself<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:17.100> some<00:00:17.310> might<00:00:17.460> actually<00:00:17.730> argue

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
itself and some might actually argue

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.210 
itself and some might actually argue
that's<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.359> best<00:00:18.539> bit<00:00:18.690> all<00:00:18.840> this<00:00:19.230> well<00:00:20.130> I'll

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
that's the best bit all this well I'll

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.260 
that's the best bit all this well I'll
let<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.400> make<00:00:20.520> your<00:00:20.580> own<00:00:20.760> lines<00:00:20.970> up<00:00:21.090> about

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
let you make your own lines up about

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.859 
let you make your own lines up about
that<00:00:21.449> so<00:00:21.600> I'll<00:00:21.720> move<00:00:21.900> him<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.289> one<00:00:22.470> side

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
that so I'll move him to one side

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.109 
that so I'll move him to one side
packaging<00:00:24.869> itself<00:00:25.170> is<00:00:25.410> very<00:00:25.789> faithful<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:26.820> the

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119

at<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.079> back<00:01:59.060> you'll<00:02:00.060> get<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.299> general<00:02:00.450> idea

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
at the back you'll get the general idea

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
this in that the larger wings on this

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:39.759 
this in that the larger wings on this
sort<00:02:38.810> of<00:02:38.840> should<00:02:38.989> be<00:02:39.019> much<00:02:39.260> more<00:02:39.439> movie

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639 
released by Kenner itself it has pullout

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:02.349

lasers<00:02:59.120> at<00:02:59.239> the<00:02:59.329> front<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:02.000> thing<00:03:02.120> that<00:03:02.239> could

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
lasers at the front the thing that could

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:03.550 
lasers at the front the thing that could
have<00:03:02.450> done<00:03:02.540> I<00:03:02.659> think<00:03:02.840> has<00:03:02.989> broken<00:03:03.260> it<00:03:03.439> down<00:03:03.500> a

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
have done I think has broken it down a

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.589 
have done I think has broken it down a
little<00:03:03.650> bit<00:03:03.829> more<00:03:04.010> those<00:03:04.310> once<00:03:05.120> again<00:03:05.359> this<00:03:05.480> is

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
little bit more those once again this is

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:06.909 
little bit more those once again this is
another<00:03:05.870> vehicle<00:03:06.079> what<00:03:06.439> you're<00:03:06.560> reading<00:03:06.709> he

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:06.919 
another vehicle what you're reading he

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:10.330 
another vehicle what you're reading he
would<00:03:07.069> have<00:03:07.219> had<00:03:07.909> sounds<00:03:08.540> and<00:03:08.719> maybe<00:03:09.650> have

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
would have had sounds and maybe have

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.179 
would have had sounds and maybe have
lights<00:03:10.549> along<00:03:10.849> my<00:03:11.239> headlights<00:03:11.859> but<00:03:12.859> this<00:03:13.010> one

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:13.189 
lights along my headlights but this one

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:15.039 
lights along my headlights but this one
doesn't<00:03:13.459> so<00:03:13.879> it's<00:03:14.359> more<00:03:14.510> basic<00:03:14.900> in<00:03:15.019> that

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
doesn't so it's more basic in that

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.649 
doesn't so it's more basic in that
respect<00:03:15.560> and<00:03:15.739> I<00:03:15.799> think<00:03:15.829> given<00:03:16.790> technology<00:03:16.970> to

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:17.659 
respect and I think given technology to

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:18.789 
respect and I think given technology to
them<00:03:17.780> their<00:03:17.930> chance<00:03:18.109> would<00:03:18.349> make<00:03:18.500> it<00:03:18.650> much

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
them their chance would make it much

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.270 
them their chance would make it much
more<00:03:18.949> movie<00:03:19.220> yeah<00:03:19.340> if<00:03:19.609> there's<00:03:19.819> place<00:03:20.540> those

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
more movie yeah if there's place those

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.349 
more movie yeah if there's place those
specifications<00:03:22.280> within<00:03:22.879> the<00:03:22.940> TIE<00:03:23.090> fighter

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
specifications within the TIE fighter

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.780 
specifications within the TIE fighter
itself<00:03:23.780> might<00:03:24.769> raise<00:03:24.979> the<00:03:25.129> price<00:03:25.310> slightly

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
itself might raise the price slightly

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.879 
itself might raise the price slightly
but<00:03:25.970> as<00:03:26.659> a<00:03:26.689> personnel<00:03:27.349> we've<00:03:27.500> been<00:03:27.590> prepared

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889 
but as a personnel we've been prepared

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:41.080 
but as a personnel we've been prepared
to<00:03:28.040> swallow<00:03:28.909> that<00:03:31.659> wings<00:03:39.699> but<00:03:40.699> all<00:03:40.819> you<00:03:40.970> know

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
to swallow that wings but all you know

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.179 
to swallow that wings but all you know
I'm<00:03:41.150> pleased<00:03:41.389> with<00:03:41.599> in<00:03:41.750> probably<00:03:42.709> as<00:03:42.949> I<00:03:43.009> said

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:43.189 
I'm pleased with in probably as I said

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:45.789 
I'm pleased with in probably as I said
at<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.310> beginning<00:03:43.400> of<00:03:43.879> the<00:03:44.090> review<00:03:44.569> even<00:03:45.439> more

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
at the beginning of the review even more

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.740 
at the beginning of the review even more
pleased<00:03:46.009> with<00:03:46.040> the<00:03:46.280> actual<00:03:46.549> packaging<00:03:47.060> itself

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
pleased with the actual packaging itself

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.619 
pleased with the actual packaging itself
I<00:03:47.930> think<00:03:47.989> it<00:03:48.169> really<00:03:48.349> sets<00:03:48.620> off<00:03:48.889> an<00:03:49.629> election

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
I think it really sets off an election

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.589 
I think it really sets off an election
