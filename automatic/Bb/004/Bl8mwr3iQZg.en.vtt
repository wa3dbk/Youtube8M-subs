much better than the nikon d800 the
nikon<00:00:08.519> d800<00:00:09.330> is<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.480> cheaper<00:00:09.900> camera<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:10.410> you

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
nikon d800 is a cheaper camera and you

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.709 
nikon d800 is a cheaper camera and you
get<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.710> whole<00:00:10.980> lot<00:00:11.010> more<00:00:11.429> for<00:00:11.639> your<00:00:11.730> money<00:00:11.910> the

get a whole lot more for your money the

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.230 
get a whole lot more for your money the
d800<00:00:13.530> has<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.710> revolutionary<00:00:14.460> sensor<00:00:14.940> which<00:00:15.089> is

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
d800 has a revolutionary sensor which is

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.779 
d800 has a revolutionary sensor which is
full<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.509> frame<00:00:15.750> in<00:00:15.929> past<00:00:16.139> 36<00:00:16.710> megapixels<00:00:17.490> it

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
full of frame in past 36 megapixels it

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.880 
full of frame in past 36 megapixels it
has<00:00:18.510> very<00:00:18.720> similar<00:00:18.930> noise<00:00:19.350> characteristics

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
has very similar noise characteristics

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.820 
has very similar noise characteristics
compared<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.970> d700<00:00:21.840> but<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.020> huge<00:00:22.410> increase

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
compared to the d700 but a huge increase

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.259 
compared to the d700 but a huge increase
in<00:00:22.949> resolution<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:24.420> Canon<00:00:24.840> 5d<00:00:25.140> three<00:00:25.410> goes<00:00:25.859> to

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
in resolution the Canon 5d three goes to

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.810 
in resolution the Canon 5d three goes to
26,500<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:28.019> so<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.349> d800<00:00:29.070> goes<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.580> same

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
26,500 I so the d800 goes to the same

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.389

reality focus in both cameras is very
very<00:01:07.380> good<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:07.830> it's<00:01:08.010> non<00:01:08.250> issue<00:01:08.460> but<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.060> read

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
very good so it's non issue but I read

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.510 
very good so it's non issue but I read
the<00:01:09.510> DP<00:01:09.869> pages<00:01:10.290> for<00:01:10.530> him<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.920> all<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.369> other

the DP pages for him and all the other
canon<00:01:12.000> fan<00:01:12.210> would<00:01:12.450> say<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.140> better<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:14.070> is

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
canon fan would say it is better this is

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.190 
canon fan would say it is better this is
because<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.670> majority<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:15.150> Canon<00:01:15.600> users<00:01:16.020> have

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
because the majority of Canon users have

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.539 
because the majority of Canon users have
