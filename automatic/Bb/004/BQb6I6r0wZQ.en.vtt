career<00:00:17.850> is<00:00:18.000> not<00:00:18.030> going<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.360> be<00:00:18.480> like<00:00:18.690> 10-15

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
the team is really about having a solid

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.240 
the team is really about having a solid
infrastructure<00:01:51.900> having<00:01:52.530> good<00:01:52.740> coaches<00:01:53.100> good

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
infrastructure having good coaches good

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.640

analysts<00:01:53.729> at<00:01:53.820> work<00:01:53.940> with<00:01:54.090> us<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.479> think<00:01:55.380> one<00:01:55.619> of

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
analysts at work with us I think one of

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.930 
analysts at work with us I think one of
the<00:01:55.770> main<00:01:55.800> reasons<00:01:56.190> local<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.550> such<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.790> good

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
the main reasons local is such a good

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.850 
the main reasons local is such a good
coach<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.330> that<00:01:57.540> he<00:01:58.020> really<00:01:58.229> respects<00:01:58.770> the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
coach is that he really respects the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.620 
coach is that he really respects the
players<00:01:59.100> opinion<00:01:59.490> because<00:01:59.640> he<00:02:00.149> has<00:02:00.390> been<00:02:00.600> a

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
players opinion because he has been a

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.359 
players opinion because he has been a
player<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.080> he<00:02:01.229> knows<00:02:01.560> how<00:02:01.830> it<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.220> be<00:02:02.250> a

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
player and he knows how it is to be a

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.510 
player and he knows how it is to be a
player<00:02:03.560> local<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.710> are<00:02:04.770> be<00:02:05.070> outspoken

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
player local and I are be outspoken

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.609 
player local and I are be outspoken
people<00:02:05.940> so<00:02:06.090> we<00:02:06.210> often<00:02:06.630> end<00:02:06.660> up<00:02:06.810> like<00:02:06.990> crashing

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
people so we often end up like crashing

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.650 
people so we often end up like crashing
we<00:02:08.070> don't<00:02:08.160> have<00:02:08.310> like<00:02:08.520> huge<00:02:09.119> arguments<00:02:09.509> but<00:02:09.570> we

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
we don't have like huge arguments but we

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.350 
we don't have like huge arguments but we
have<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.840> lot<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.080> small<00:02:10.350> disagreements<00:02:11.360> Indian

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
have a lot of small disagreements Indian

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.660 
have a lot of small disagreements Indian
the<00:02:12.750> only<00:02:13.020> reason<00:02:13.350> we<00:02:13.530> argue<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.980> only<00:02:14.220> reason

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
the only reason we argue the only reason

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.890 
the only reason we argue the only reason
that<00:02:14.700> we<00:02:14.850> disagree<00:02:14.970> is<00:02:15.300> because<00:02:15.570> we<00:02:15.690> care<00:02:15.870> so

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
that we disagree is because we care so

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.720 
that we disagree is because we care so
much<00:02:16.080> about<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.470> team<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:16.709> about<00:02:17.130> where

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
much about the team and about where

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.050 
much about the team and about where
we're<00:02:17.880> going<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.239> we<00:02:18.330> want<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.630> win<00:02:18.750> so<00:02:18.780> bad

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
we're going and we want to win so bad

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.340 
we're going and we want to win so bad
the<00:02:21.060> spring<00:02:21.270> foot<00:02:21.450> is<00:02:21.600> definitely<00:02:22.170> really

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
the spring foot is definitely really

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.770 
the spring foot is definitely really
important<00:02:22.830> it<00:02:23.700> gives<00:02:24.270> you<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.480> circuit

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
important it gives you the circuit

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.390 
important it gives you the circuit
points<00:02:25.020> obviously<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:25.650> if<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:26.040> make<00:02:26.190> it<00:02:26.220> a

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
points obviously and if you make it a

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.680 
points obviously and if you make it a
number<00:02:26.640> one<00:02:26.790> it<00:02:26.910> gives<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:27.150> a<00:02:27.209> chance<00:02:27.239> to<00:02:27.600> play

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
number one it gives you a chance to play

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.900 
number one it gives you a chance to play
internationally<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:28.530> think<00:02:28.770> getting<00:02:29.760> the

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
internationally and I think getting the

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.610 
internationally and I think getting the
planar<00:02:30.120> nationally<00:02:30.690> a<00:02:30.870> lot<00:02:31.140> of<00:02:31.260> people<00:02:31.470> really

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
planar nationally a lot of people really

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.430 
planar nationally a lot of people really
underestimate<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.250> I<00:02:32.700> saw<00:02:33.390> last<00:02:33.900> year<00:02:34.200> at

all stars there was a fun side of end
there<00:02:36.510> was<00:02:36.630> a<00:02:36.660> really<00:02:37.019> try<00:02:37.380> hard<00:02:37.410> side<00:02:37.799> of<00:02:37.890> it

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
there was a really try hard side of it
