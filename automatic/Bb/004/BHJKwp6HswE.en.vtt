now<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.820> will<00:01:54.509> say<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.750> tried<00:01:55.140> putting<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.530> piece

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
now I will say I tried putting a piece

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.920 
now I will say I tried putting a piece
of<00:01:55.829> paper<00:01:55.950> up<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.759> actuate<00:01:57.719> in<00:01:57.840> the

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
of paper up to it and actuate in the

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.459 
of paper up to it and actuate in the
blade<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:59.100> will<00:01:59.310> derail<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.060> blade<00:02:00.469> going

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
blade and it will derail the blade going

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.840 
blade and it will derail the blade going
through<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.799> piece<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.130> paper<00:02:02.250> but<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:02.610> think

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
through a piece of paper but I think

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.060 
through a piece of paper but I think
that's<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.119> safety<00:02:03.540> feature<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.829> you

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
that's a safety feature so that you

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.839 
that's a safety feature so that you
don't<00:02:05.250> stab<00:02:05.549> yourself<00:02:05.729> in<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.240> leg<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.719> mean

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 
don't stab yourself in the leg I mean

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:10.100 
don't stab yourself in the leg I mean
who<00:02:08.849> wants<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.300> stab<00:02:09.569> themselves

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
who wants to stab themselves

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.440 
who wants to stab themselves
accidentally<00:02:10.830> in<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:10.950> in<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.459> lake

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
accidentally in the in the lake

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.270 
accidentally in the in the lake
if<00:02:12.660> this<00:02:12.900> thing<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.290> still<00:02:13.530> he<00:02:13.680> opens<00:02:14.069> now<00:02:14.250> I

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
if this thing I still he opens now I

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.309 
if this thing I still he opens now I
don't<00:02:14.580> see<00:02:14.760> how<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.300> could<00:02:15.480> accidentally<00:02:15.990> open

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
don't see how it could accidentally open

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.680 
don't see how it could accidentally open
because<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:16.620> got<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:17.760> got<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:17.910> push<00:02:18.270> pretty

because you got a you got a push pretty

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.250 
because you got a you got a push pretty
doggone<00:02:19.530> hard<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.220> get<00:02:20.370> this<00:02:20.550> thing<00:02:20.849> open<00:02:21.300> but

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
doggone hard to get this thing open but

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.339 
doggone hard to get this thing open but
uh<00:02:22.290> nevertheless<00:02:23.780> just<00:02:24.780> going<00:02:24.989> through<00:02:25.020> some

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
uh nevertheless just going through some

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.620 
uh nevertheless just going through some
paper<00:02:25.560> every<00:02:25.950> now<00:02:26.069> and<00:02:26.250> then<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:27.090> know<00:02:27.209> well

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
paper every now and then you know well

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.330 
paper every now and then you know well
basically<00:02:28.440> every<00:02:28.650> time<00:02:28.830> you<00:02:28.980> try<00:02:29.130> to<00:02:29.160> go

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
basically every time you try to go

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.790 
basically every time you try to go
through<00:02:29.489> some<00:02:29.580> paper<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.120> will<00:02:30.620> derail<00:02:31.620> the

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
through some paper it will derail the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.970 
through some paper it will derail the
blade<00:02:32.510> so<00:02:33.510> that's<00:02:33.840> about<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.140> only<00:02:34.260> safety

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
blade so that's about the only safety

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.340 
blade so that's about the only safety
that's<00:02:35.160> on<00:02:35.370> this<00:02:35.520> knife<00:02:35.900> it<00:02:36.900> does<00:02:37.110> have<00:02:37.319> a

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
that's on this knife it does have a

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.940 
that's on this knife it does have a
pocket<00:02:37.620> clip<00:02:38.010> on<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.930> I'm<00:02:39.930> not<00:02:40.170> sure<00:02:40.560> if

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
pocket clip on it and I'm not sure if

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.650 
pocket clip on it and I'm not sure if
you<00:02:41.160> can<00:02:41.280> really<00:02:41.760> can<00:02:42.180> reverse<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:43.130> I<00:02:44.660> think

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
you can really can reverse it I think

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.759 
you can really can reverse it I think
it's<00:02:45.780> for<00:02:45.989> right<00:02:46.140> hand<00:02:47.330> carried<00:02:48.330> only<00:02:48.769> with

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
it's for right hand carried only with

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.710 
it's for right hand carried only with
the<00:02:49.980> tip<00:02:50.790> pointing<00:02:51.060> down<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.970> on<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.330> pocket

so it's not that heavy for such a you

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.880

know aluminum handles and metal blade I

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.690 
know aluminum handles and metal blade I
would<00:03:47.070> have<00:03:47.190> thought<00:03:47.310> it<00:03:47.459> would<00:03:47.549> have<00:03:47.609> been

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
would have thought it would have been

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.830 
would have thought it would have been
heavier<00:03:48.180> but<00:03:48.930> um<00:03:49.459> they<00:03:50.459> have<00:03:50.760> it<00:03:50.940> didn't<00:03:51.510> focus

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
heavier but um they have it didn't focus

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.050 
heavier but um they have it didn't focus
for<00:03:52.079> you<00:03:52.170> so<00:03:52.320> you<00:03:52.410> could<00:03:52.530> see<00:03:52.769> it<00:03:52.890> anyway
