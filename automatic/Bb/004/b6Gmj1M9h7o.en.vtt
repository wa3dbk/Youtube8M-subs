00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.109
 I had not wanted friend to visit us 

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:07.660
 on our facebook and youtube page 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:11.770
 and this morning more is doing the 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.360
 review of a nokia lumia 520 which 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.000
 It was brought by one of our clients 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.089
 since it went out and I did not want to turn 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.519
 more in the review we could see that at 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:24.460
 connect it to the power station or to the 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:27.609
 source can which does not send a 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.619
 3.6 volt voltage or a power of 2 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.810
 amps we could see that the phone 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:35.140
 is making an exaggerated consumption the 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.640
 which rises to 2.6 amps a 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.789
 normal consumption of interest form of 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.309
 turn on can be between 10 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:44.980
 milliamps and 15 milliamps already 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.460
 after 20 24 milliamps a consumption 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.320
 exaggerated 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.670
 after seeing that the consumption was 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.040
 exaggerated 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.500
 we continue to review the phone 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.430
 when uncovering it connect again to the 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.500
 source of power we could see that it is 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.260
 this part of the phone was 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.110
 heating up to uncover it study it well 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.720
 we find that it has to do with 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.850
 signal since here goes the memory or the 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.270
 piece responsible for the transmission of the 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:18.140
 signal to the call data network and 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.479
 good messages when dismantling the piece the 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.910
 phone turned on normally for 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.850
 correct this problem we should look for a 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:29.420
 Replace a card that is good and 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:32.119
 proceed to mount it on this card so 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.770
 We will solve the problem of 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.570
 signal transmission since the phone 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.070
 it does not turn on but at the moment of 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.020
 make a call or send a message 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.929
 we can not do it since this is the 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.399
 piece charged with the same situation in 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:45.590
 these all for this video of this 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.970
 application we are going to be turning on the 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.979
 phone so you can see the 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.780
 work that was done which is the 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.580
 same that is present here 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.610
 as we can see already here we see the 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.979
 phone turning on this can we 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.080
 serve for future reviews of 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.650
 repairs dear colleagues that at 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.080
 time to use the power source 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.660
 we must uncover the phone and keep 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.459
 the card at a glance to see the 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.100
 area where the card is heated 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.530
 so we can come up with many faults like 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.209
 it was like this one that was not 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.150
 I turned on the phone but they showed us 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.940
 Exaggerated consumption of 2000 amps this 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.170
 it was all for this video solutions 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.950
 mobile technical services 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.950
 specialized 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.810
 how do I believe this 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.629
 the only 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.629
 true
