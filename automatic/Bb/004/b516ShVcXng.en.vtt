new days and unwrapped it you this is
what<00:00:17.310> you'll<00:00:17.430> find<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.939> wire<00:00:18.150> goes<00:00:18.420> through

what you'll find the wire goes through

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.130 
what you'll find the wire goes through
to<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.960> foot<00:00:19.619> pedal<00:00:20.509> if<00:00:21.509> it's<00:00:21.750> probably<00:00:22.020> going

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
to the foot pedal if it's probably going

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.300 
to the foot pedal if it's probably going
it<00:00:22.259> probably<00:00:22.560> comes<00:00:22.650> out<00:00:22.890> through<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.160> same

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
it probably comes out through the same

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.490 
it probably comes out through the same
hole<00:00:23.610> I'll<00:00:24.300> just<00:00:24.539> double<00:00:24.869> looped<00:00:25.079> it<00:00:25.289> around

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
hole I'll just double looped it around

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.370 
hole I'll just double looped it around
the<00:00:25.980> pin<00:00:26.160> there<00:00:26.400> so<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.880> comes<00:00:27.029> out<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.300> back

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
the pin there so it comes out the back

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:34.280 
the pin there so it comes out the back
and<00:00:28.380> that's<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.590> good<00:00:28.739> steady<00:00:29.040> not<00:00:33.140> it's<00:00:34.140> like

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
and that's a good steady not it's like

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.619 
and that's a good steady not it's like
this<00:00:34.410> one<00:00:37.579> it<00:00:38.579> does<00:00:38.760> have<00:00:39.000> crimped<00:00:39.329> in<00:00:39.420> there

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
this one it does have crimped in there

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.080 
this one it does have crimped in there
if<00:00:40.079> you've<00:00:40.290> got<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.469> crimping<00:00:40.829> tool<00:00:41.039> you<00:00:41.940> can

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
if you've got a crimping tool you can

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.020 
if you've got a crimping tool you can
leave<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.390> way<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.510> was<00:00:43.250> and<00:00:44.250> click<00:00:44.520> back

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
leave it the way it was and click back

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.480 
leave it the way it was and click back
onto<00:00:45.240> itself<00:00:45.950> but<00:00:46.950> there's<00:00:47.100> no<00:00:47.190> problem

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:47.490 
onto itself but there's no problem
