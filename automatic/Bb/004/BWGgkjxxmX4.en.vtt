00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
trustful of it because it seemed to

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.480 
trustful of it because it seemed to

but<00:06:12.420> i<00:06:12.750> think<00:06:13.350> the<00:06:13.890> the<00:06:13.920> speed<00:06:14.520> gun<00:06:14.760> was<00:06:15.060> just

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
but i think the the speed gun was just

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.720 
but i think the the speed gun was just
fixed<00:06:15.780> on<00:06:15.900> one<00:06:15.930> number<00:06:16.560> and<00:06:16.590> so<00:06:17.010> when<00:06:17.700> they

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:17.730 
fixed on one number and so when they

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.700 
fixed on one number and so when they
pulled<00:06:18.360> us<00:06:18.480> over<00:06:18.720> and<00:06:19.020> they<00:06:19.230> had<00:06:19.410> me<00:06:19.560> in<00:06:19.590> the

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
pulled us over and they had me in the

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.650
