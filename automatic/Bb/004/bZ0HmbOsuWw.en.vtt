00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.040
 hello very good all kids and we are 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.450
 in a new video today I bring you the 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.420
 circuit installation review on 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.310
 mode for minecraft 1.6 point 4 is good 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.950
 7 asking why not serving 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:16.340
 Montena 1.7 points is basically because 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.930
 there is no way for 1.7 points are 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.410
 leaving rules that will follow nothing but 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.250
 a mod that is has been the mini temps that 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.539
 I'll leave it up here so nothing 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.190
 is waiting for a week for aetic 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.260
 now if they come out mod and well I'm going 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.170
 uploading a business to the channel but not 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.670
 I have seen that they are not going up despite 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.070
 that are not authorizing mod and good me 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.500
 I decide 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.760
 what was up a motel review 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.610
 previous 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.320
 guys is quite useful one of the most 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.720
 useful and how nike has still gone 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.110
 updating as little by little it's good 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.449
 the tri capi hector consists that by 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.699
 an ax and cutting the first trunk of 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:57.940
 wood to quiet a tree will fall all 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.920
 of good blow something that they have put 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.260
 new is that before this example as you see 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.009
 with a diamond ax takes much longer 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.830
 in cutting what is the trunk and fall 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.869
 all but before I cut it if it aggravates you 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.789
 very much less now I do it 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.520
 updated and how they all fall because it is 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:17.020
 as it is more resistant as I dressed 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.509
 with a diamond ax so it should 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.650
 should cut what is the tree very 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:25.930
 fast but nevertheless not 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.290
 it cuts it enough people 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.230
 how 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.630
 file this mode is basically what 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.060
 does not do anything else does not have 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.440
 less useful authority because it is 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.290
 quite pretty very useful 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.990
 here it has not happened to you playing the mode 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.660
 survival boxing does not need wood 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.790
 just a few minutes then we can not 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.700

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.770

 it's a motel 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.060

 is going to start loading what is the 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.730
 minecraft so let's wait for a 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.730
 little bit 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.860
 while what is loading the 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:57.370
 minecraft forge commented that in the 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.860
 description on my channel if you give more 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.300
 information 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:06.910
 the design is going to have two links that are 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:09.880
 where they are the mortals of two 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.290
 web pages that are pretty good a 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.180
 of them is in Spanish and English 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.500
 but good 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:19.259
 he has very little pain so if you want 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:23.009
 they are going out they are going to use 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:26.139
 the new versions of minecraft all 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:27.490
 has been completed we will accept and 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.350
 now let's open what he created me 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.389
 very important that you open minecraft 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.650
 then install the microphone so that 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.650
 start generating all the folders 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.569
 my heart 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:43.619
 very very 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:43.619
 a turn 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.909
 next to the play 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:55.800
 do not forgive, you do not have to give 8.4 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.340
 you have to give him to open mine 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.060
 what would it be to give it 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.060
 of the body 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:12.099
 and as you can see we are going to see 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.550
 will start the service noáin craft 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.750
 and will start to generate what is the 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.050
 folders as I said before the 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.050
 Minecraft 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.250
 do not 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.410
 there you are york how you had been 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.910
 minecraft because if you want verifiable 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.170
 for good times I had to be have 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.360
 to come out here in the version of 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:39.430
 mainqué to the warehouse and active what 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.590
 you are the new call love and even with 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.670
 it would be enough to check 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.440
 that has been installed 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.570
 now let's open our folder of 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.120
 minecraft point to take us open 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:52.270
 run 100% appropriate is by 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.010
 hundred we go pointed minecraft we open the 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.320
 folder called love and what we have 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.820
 What to do is drag the tri capi 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.430
 hector and the other file that we've 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.270
 created 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.270
 we drag it 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:10.319
 only missing and if you want to check 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.319
 that work but well let's do it 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:15.349
 It is very important that you reopen the 

00:06:12.179 --> 00:06:15.349
 what is the profile of the porch 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:22.860
 and if everything went well as it should not 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.860
 to have cited her I sleep correctly 

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:41.169
 and here then let's go down
