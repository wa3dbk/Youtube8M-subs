the shock mount really is we'll have to
wait<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.130> see<00:02:05.719> so<00:02:06.719> what<00:02:07.049> about<00:02:07.229> sound<00:02:07.740> quality

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
wait and see so what about sound quality

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.180 
wait and see so what about sound quality
well<00:02:08.759> almost<00:02:09.030> any<00:02:09.479> external<00:02:10.289> mic<00:02:10.500> will<00:02:10.830> do<00:02:11.039> a

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
well almost any external mic will do a

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.460 
well almost any external mic will do a
much<00:02:11.520> better<00:02:11.790> job<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.239> capturing<00:02:12.900> ambient

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
much better job of capturing ambient

dialogue and I sort of agree but with
reservations<00:02:48.100> it<00:02:48.550> will<00:02:48.880> beat<00:02:49.210> an<00:02:49.390> onboard<00:02:49.960> mic

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
reservations it will beat an onboard mic

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.710 
reservations it will beat an onboard mic
but<00:02:50.770> all<00:02:50.920> mics<00:02:51.190> really<00:02:51.700> only<00:02:51.850> work<00:02:52.150> well<00:02:52.480> for
