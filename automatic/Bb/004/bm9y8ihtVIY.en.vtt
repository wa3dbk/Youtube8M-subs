00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:02.890
 Hey guys I am 7 

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.550
 here again we have an announcement CDU but that refers to the stuff 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:07.340
 the 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.379
 will come again in the future that is in the future 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:12.309
 probably this week 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:14.959
 or should you soon 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:15.919
 around year 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:18.919
 not fooling me is the twelfth brought 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:25.449
 But now they are there I get concern is on the 13 that is 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:29.409
 at every company Leyen CDU comes 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:32.559
 that is why in 1314 little sand was filled 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.780
 So it will be a booster open 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.760
 without Diarra the LG on probably also this Tuesday I would have you 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.650
 then present 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.250
 I hope I pull again very good things 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.440
 and so much spilled on 7 August 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.870
 around 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.650
 then one more thing and that's because he videos the series actually was 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:54.780
 completed 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.720
 but I forgot something 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.040
 What I would like to catch up with right now, which of course I do 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.080
 can 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.340
 yes, it will 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.830
 one or two videos coming soon 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.260
 what it's worth raises to seven seems six or seven 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.810
 So two or one 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.240
 and 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.520
 and one more thing i wanted to start a new action 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.320
 and that's how it has gotten that frame made this video 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.250
 or lost 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.770
 and the vein did not ask for some then later 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.370
 around there said 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.370
 that you can do something like that with you and that's how it should be interpreted 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.549
 Hansi a great one so you can do more 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.180
 that you can ask more questions and therefore 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.220
 it is not intended 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.330
 but 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.350
 this is a new Zion I call it then won or lost 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.680
 when you turn me around 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.210
 Personal messages can only be personalized 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.150
 Messages others are not scored so what it scores i will give them more 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.880
 at least look at least 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.310
 but she herself bad when I come in a video 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.229
 Wiesent 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.989
 I'll drop it 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.439
 Milan has a look that sends back, for example, a tan 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:17.439
 Game situation that has not been clarified or 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.010
 comic Prof meet each other by two cards being the fictional 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.999
 neutralize each other or what I know 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:30.519
 he likes a very strange gameplay Aquitaine 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.709
 Write or write a personal message for this new category 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:34.709
 lost 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.040
 then I will 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.629
 I will let my player reflect rides in the infomobile 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:42.950
 the OAS does not inform that 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.149
 Steiner in the former admirer can get lost 

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:47.560
 Percent what I am 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.019
 of what I mean by the 1 what is going on for the game situation 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.919
 should have 

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:57.279
 funny sentence 

00:02:57.279 --> 00:02:59.469
 and then you can too 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:00.449
 Naturally 

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:03.099
 Write the audience as a comment 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:04.099
 as 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:05.769
 to see the situation 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.890
 and that's basically it 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.339
 exactly the same as winning or losing 

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:11.959
 Schwerin 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.849
 Who does not know that I'm watching that video? 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.849
 simply at 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.489
 new category won or lost writes more personal messages 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:22.679
 with saving 

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:26.539
 strangest game situation and I then try with the help of others 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:30.289
 So as comments just to solve 

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:34.129
 the feasting a Ari thing simply until they are just bachelor 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:35.629
 probably be the last resort 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:36.930
 So first to shiver
