00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
wheels I have right here these are the

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.540 
wheels I have right here these are the
loogie<00:00:21.600> wheels<00:00:21.840> so<00:00:22.380> they<00:00:22.500> are<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.710> green<00:00:23.189> and

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
loogie wheels so they are a green and

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.660 
loogie wheels so they are a green and
blue<00:00:24.539> swirled<00:00:24.930> wheels<00:00:25.230> as<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.710> can<00:00:25.859> see<00:00:26.070> so

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
blue swirled wheels as you can see so

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.859 
blue swirled wheels as you can see so
it's<00:00:26.820> like<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:26.970> two-tone<00:00:27.420> wheel<00:00:27.859> they<00:00:28.859> are

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
it's like a two-tone wheel they are

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.220 
it's like a two-tone wheel they are
single<00:00:30.869> bearing<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:32.329> they<00:00:33.329> are<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.989> medium

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
single bearing and they are a medium

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.130 
single bearing and they are a medium
hardness<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:35.219> they<00:00:35.640> grip<00:00:36.480> just<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.780> tiny<00:00:37.020> bit

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
hardness so they grip just a tiny bit

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.619 
hardness so they grip just a tiny bit
but<00:00:38.129> not<00:00:38.280> much<00:00:38.309> they're<00:00:38.730> actually<00:00:39.210> pretty<00:00:39.450> a

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
but not much they're actually pretty a

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.490 
but not much they're actually pretty a
pretty<00:00:40.050> solid<00:00:40.530> wheel<00:00:41.149> so<00:00:42.149> along<00:00:42.570> with<00:00:42.629> the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
pretty solid wheel so along with the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.440 
pretty solid wheel so along with the
wheels<00:00:43.710> they<00:00:44.160> come<00:00:44.399> in<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:44.850> package<00:00:45.300> right

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
wheels they come in this package right

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.100 
wheels they come in this package right
here<00:00:45.980> which<00:00:46.980> looks<00:00:47.340> like<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.640> little<00:00:47.789> lab<00:00:48.149> thing

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
here which looks like a little lab thing

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.750 
here which looks like a little lab thing
straight<00:00:49.860> out<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.100> lab<00:00:50.250> with<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> little

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
straight out of the lab with a little

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.689 
straight out of the lab with a little
label<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.210> everything<00:00:51.800> so<00:00:52.800> yeah<00:00:53.399> as<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.640> can

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
see I've got some wheels in there right

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.380 
see I've got some wheels in there right
now<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.559> really<00:00:56.250> cool<00:00:56.489> storage<00:00:56.789> package

now so a really cool storage package
right<00:00:57.539> here<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.980> quality<00:00:59.219> for<00:00:59.789> these

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
right here so the quality for these

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.590 
right here so the quality for these
wheels<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.690> just<00:01:01.050> outstanding<00:01:02.359> when<00:01:03.359> Todd

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
wheels is just outstanding when Todd

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.270 
wheels is just outstanding when Todd
makes<00:01:03.870> these<00:01:04.110> wheels<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.680> think<00:01:04.860> he<00:01:04.949> uses<00:01:05.250> a

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
makes these wheels I think he uses a

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.600 
makes these wheels I think he uses a
different<00:01:05.549> method<00:01:06.090> than<00:01:06.119> he<00:01:06.330> normally<00:01:06.450> does

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
different method than he normally does

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.890 
different method than he normally does
but<00:01:08.610> these<00:01:08.760> wheels<00:01:09.060> turned<00:01:09.360> out<00:01:09.479> really

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
but these wheels turned out really

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.420 
but these wheels turned out really
really<00:01:10.080> great<00:01:10.590> as<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:10.920> can<00:01:11.040> see<00:01:11.220> there

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
really great as you can see there

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.190 
really great as you can see there
they're<00:01:11.880> just<00:01:11.909> perfectly<00:01:12.420> made<00:01:12.720> no

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
they're just perfectly made no

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.800 
they're just perfectly made no
imperfections<00:01:13.500> or<00:01:13.979> anything<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.549> each<00:01:15.540> wheel

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
imperfections or anything and each wheel

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.999 
imperfections or anything and each wheel
is<00:01:15.960> going<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.140> look<00:01:16.229> different<00:01:16.259> because<00:01:16.680> of

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
is going to look different because of

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.820 
is going to look different because of
the<00:01:17.189> swirl<00:01:17.700> combination<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.990> overall<00:01:19.650> that

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
the swirl combination so overall that

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.440 
the swirl combination so overall that
just<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.310> quality<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.790> these<00:01:20.909> wheels<00:01:21.210> is

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
just the quality of these wheels is

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.770 
just the quality of these wheels is
outstanding<00:01:22.759> all<00:01:23.759> right<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.090> on<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.630> the

outstanding all right so on to the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.770 
outstanding all right so on to the
performance<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.860> wheels<00:01:26.420> to<00:01:27.420> be<00:01:27.509> honest

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
performance of the wheels to be honest

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.780 
performance of the wheels to be honest
they<00:01:27.900> roll<00:01:28.080> perfectly<00:01:28.829> smooth<00:01:29.159> they<00:01:29.579> roll

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
they roll perfectly smooth they roll

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
just as nice as any other no comply

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.620 
just as nice as any other no comply
wheels<00:01:32.189> or<00:01:32.430> flat<00:01:32.640> faced<00:01:32.880> wheels<00:01:33.119> or<00:01:33.329> anything

wheels or flat faced wheels or anything
like<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.320> no<00:01:35.009> problem<00:01:35.310> with<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.430> and

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
like that so a no problem with that and

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.090 
like that so a no problem with that and
what<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.869> really<00:01:37.229> really<00:01:37.259> like<00:01:37.740> about<00:01:37.890> these

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
what I really really like about these

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.179 
what I really really like about these
wheels<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.750> hardness<00:01:40.189> because

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
wheels is the the hardness because

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.300 
wheels is the the hardness because
usually<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:42.570> wheels<00:01:43.350> are<00:01:43.500> either<00:01:43.649> extremely

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
usually the wheels are either extremely

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.090 
usually the wheels are either extremely
hard<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.210> have<00:01:45.540> no<00:01:45.750> grip<00:01:46.290> at<00:01:46.320> all<00:01:46.619> or

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
hard so you have no grip at all or

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.789 
hard so you have no grip at all or
they're<00:01:47.460> super<00:01:47.850> super<00:01:48.180> grippy<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:49.140> can't

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
they're super super grippy and you can't

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.030 
they're super super grippy and you can't
like<00:01:50.460> Reever<00:01:50.850> editrix<00:01:51.390> but<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.290> found<00:01:52.860> that

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
like Reever editrix but I found that

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.069 
like Reever editrix but I found that
these<00:01:53.159> wheels<00:01:53.430> are<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:54.000> perfect<00:01:54.360> kind<00:01:55.049> of

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
these wheels are a perfect kind of

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.530 
these wheels are a perfect kind of
medium<00:01:55.500> because<00:01:56.430> there's<00:01:56.670> still<00:01:56.850> really<00:01:57.270> hard

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
medium because there's still really hard

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.950 
medium because there's still really hard
wheels<00:01:57.920> but<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.520> have<00:02:00.060> like<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.210> tiny<00:02:00.630> bit<00:02:00.840> of

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
wheels but a you have like a tiny bit of

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.800 
wheels but a you have like a tiny bit of
grip<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.500> if<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.100> like<00:02:02.340> do<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.030> birth<00:02:03.299> site<00:02:03.570> or

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
grip so if you like do a birth site or

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.209 
grip so if you like do a birth site or
something<00:02:04.110> you'll<00:02:04.229> get<00:02:04.409> that<00:02:04.530> little<00:02:04.740> squeak

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
something you'll get that little squeak

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.039 
something you'll get that little squeak
or<00:02:05.460> when<00:02:05.850> you're<00:02:05.939> doing<00:02:06.149> like<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.360> blunt<00:02:06.810> slide

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
or when you're doing like a blunt slide

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.229 
or when you're doing like a blunt slide
you<00:02:07.590> could<00:02:07.770> like<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.190> little<00:02:08.520> bit<00:02:08.670> squeak<00:02:08.970> on

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
you could like a little bit squeak on

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:09.760 
you could like a little bit squeak on
whatever

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
whatever

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.670 
whatever
you're<00:02:09.890> grinding<00:02:10.460> so<00:02:11.360> that's<00:02:12.260> really<00:02:12.410> nice

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
you're grinding so that's really nice

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.370 
you're grinding so that's really nice
and<00:02:13.420> just<00:02:14.420> overall<00:02:14.600> a<00:02:14.840> really<00:02:15.020> interesting

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
and just overall a really interesting

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.190 
and just overall a really interesting
way<00:02:15.560> to<00:02:15.710> ride<00:02:16.010> so<00:02:16.460> I<00:02:16.970> really<00:02:17.660> really<00:02:17.900> enjoy

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
way to ride so I really really enjoy

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.180 
way to ride so I really really enjoy
that<00:02:18.230> fact<00:02:18.590> about<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:19.160> lab<00:02:20.120> wheels<00:02:21.190> alright

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
that fact about the lab wheels alright

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.730 
that fact about the lab wheels alright
so<00:02:22.730> that<00:02:23.090> actually<00:02:23.450> pretty<00:02:23.960> much<00:02:24.110> wraps<00:02:24.440> it<00:02:24.650> up

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
so that actually pretty much wraps it up

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.770 
so that actually pretty much wraps it up
there<00:02:25.010> isn't<00:02:25.400> much<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:26.210> say<00:02:26.390> about<00:02:26.540> these

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
there isn't much to say about these

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.270 
there isn't much to say about these
wheels<00:02:26.990> besides<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.650> fact<00:02:27.770> that<00:02:27.920> they<00:02:28.250> are

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
wheels besides the fact that they are

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.940 
wheels besides the fact that they are
completely<00:02:28.670> amazing<00:02:29.260> I<00:02:30.260> would<00:02:30.680> definitely

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
completely amazing I would definitely

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.210 
completely amazing I would definitely
recommend<00:02:31.280> picking<00:02:31.820> up<00:02:32.090> acidities<00:02:32.570> because

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
recommend picking up acidities because

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.440 
recommend picking up acidities because
you<00:02:34.220> don't<00:02:34.400> you<00:02:34.520> won't<00:02:34.610> really<00:02:34.790> see<00:02:35.120> this<00:02:35.300> kind

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
you don't you won't really see this kind

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.090 
you don't you won't really see this kind
of<00:02:35.570> wheel<00:02:35.840> anywhere<00:02:36.380> else<00:02:36.530> I<00:02:36.770> mean<00:02:36.920> this<00:02:37.040> is

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
of wheel anywhere else I mean this is

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.370 
of wheel anywhere else I mean this is
pretty<00:02:37.430> this<00:02:38.150> is<00:02:38.270> pretty<00:02:38.450> outstanding<00:02:38.780> and

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
pretty this is pretty outstanding and

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.260 
pretty this is pretty outstanding and
I've<00:02:39.680> never<00:02:39.950> seen<00:02:40.280> wheels<00:02:40.580> like<00:02:40.700> this<00:02:40.880> before

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
I've never seen wheels like this before

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.440 
I've never seen wheels like this before
so<00:02:41.930> if<00:02:42.680> you're<00:02:43.010> interested<00:02:43.670> just<00:02:44.240> go<00:02:44.360> ahead
