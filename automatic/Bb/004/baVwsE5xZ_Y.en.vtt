just use the keyboard for like my w the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.140 
just use the keyboard for like my w the
a's<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.900> left<00:01:06.900> everyone<00:01:07.619> down<00:01:07.830> he<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.820> right

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.820 

volume<00:01:17.360> match<00:01:17.660> really<00:01:18.230> loud<00:01:18.530> really<00:01:18.890> clear<00:01:19.780> /

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
volume match really loud really clear /

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.050 
volume match really loud really clear /
using<00:01:21.830> that<00:01:21.980> let<00:01:22.160> me<00:01:22.220> turn<00:01:22.430> it<00:01:22.580> down<00:01:22.760> real

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
using that let me turn it down real

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.950 
using that let me turn it down real
quick<00:01:23.360> because<00:01:24.110> it<00:01:24.350> is<00:01:25.270> quite<00:01:26.270> loud<00:01:27.070> okay

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
quick because it is quite loud okay

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.450 
quick because it is quite loud okay
there<00:01:29.960> we<00:01:29.990> go<00:01:30.490> all<00:01:31.490> right<00:01:32.620> and<00:01:33.620> you<00:01:34.160> can<00:01:34.310> just

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
there we go all right and you can just

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.100 
there we go all right and you can just
see<00:01:34.550> how<00:01:35.150> much<00:01:35.360> like<00:01:35.870> smoother<00:01:36.500> it<00:01:36.620> is<00:01:38.110> and

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
see how much like smoother it is and

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.590 
see how much like smoother it is and
this<00:01:40.070> is<00:01:40.130> this<00:01:40.460> is<00:01:40.640> on<00:01:40.790> full<00:01:41.030> screen<00:01:41.240> you<00:01:41.480> can

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
this is this is on full screen you can

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.640 
this is this is on full screen you can
go<00:01:41.750> into<00:01:42.400> options<00:01:43.400> here<00:01:44.060> go<00:01:44.420> to<00:01:44.480> setting<00:01:44.960> and

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
go into options here go to setting and

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.510 
go into options here go to setting and
then<00:01:45.890> you<00:01:46.040> can<00:01:46.190> put<00:01:46.400> it<00:01:46.810> scaling<00:01:47.810> mode<00:01:48.020> and<00:01:48.770> you

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
then you can put it scaling mode and you

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.900 
then you can put it scaling mode and you
can<00:01:49.870> see<00:01:50.870> it<00:01:51.020> focus<00:01:51.440> there<00:01:51.680> we<00:01:51.770> go<00:01:51.890> scale<00:01:52.580> keep

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
can see it focus there we go scale keep

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.750 
can see it focus there we go scale keep
aspect<00:01:53.120> ratio<00:01:54.580> stretch<00:01:55.580> to<00:01:55.729> fit<00:01:55.910> screen<00:01:56.360> or<00:01:56.900> I

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
aspect ratio stretch to fit screen or I

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.580 
aspect ratio stretch to fit screen or I
think<00:01:58.760> it's<00:01:58.880> like<00:01:59.060> original<00:01:59.990> size<00:02:00.229> which<00:02:00.560> is

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
think it's like original size which is

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.400 
think it's like original size which is
like<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:00.920> smallest<00:02:01.430> size<00:02:01.640> over<00:02:01.880> so<00:02:02.240> I<00:02:02.479> just

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
like the smallest size over so I just

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.380 
like the smallest size over so I just
keep<00:02:03.560> it<00:02:03.680> on<00:02:03.770> that<00:02:03.920> first<00:02:04.160> one<00:02:04.280> anyways<00:02:05.180> let's

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
keep it on that first one anyways let's

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.940 
keep it on that first one anyways let's
see<00:02:06.140> here<00:02:06.910> you<00:02:07.910> can<00:02:08.030> see<00:02:08.179> I've<00:02:08.390> saved<00:02:09.080> it<00:02:09.320> so<00:02:09.350> I

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
see here you can see I've saved it so I

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.540 
see here you can see I've saved it so I
can<00:02:10.429> actually<00:02:10.729> get<00:02:10.850> back<00:02:11.030> to<00:02:12.220> normal<00:02:13.220> attempt

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
can actually get back to normal attempt

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.630 
can actually get back to normal attempt
to<00:02:13.760> just<00:02:13.970> show<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.950> know<00:02:16.010> just<00:02:16.190> walking

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
to just show you you know just walking

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.150 
to just show you you know just walking
around<00:02:17.260> for<00:02:18.260> some<00:02:18.410> reason<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.709> music<00:02:18.980> doesn't

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
around for some reason the music doesn't

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.970 
around for some reason the music doesn't

really demonstrate running and
everything<00:02:34.820> like<00:02:34.940> that<00:02:35.000> but<00:02:35.180> you<00:02:35.360> can<00:02:35.480> just

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
everything like that but you can just

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.090 
everything like that but you can just
see<00:02:37.209> going<00:02:38.209> through<00:02:38.660> and<00:02:38.989> it's<00:02:39.410> not<00:02:39.590> lagging

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
see going through and it's not lagging

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:47.610 
see going through and it's not lagging
or<00:02:40.280> anything<00:02:40.610> like<00:02:40.730> that<00:02:41.590> see<00:02:42.590> if<00:02:42.709> i<00:02:42.890> can<00:02:43.070> run
