00:02:53.379 --> 00:03:05.630 
than when I was thinking just try to let
it<00:02:53.609> and<00:02:54.609> hold<00:02:54.849> away<00:02:55.060> from<00:02:55.269> you

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.190 

but<00:03:06.640> then<00:03:06.760> I<00:03:06.820> went<00:03:07.060> through<00:03:07.270> and<00:03:07.510> cut<00:03:07.720> out<00:03:07.840> six

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
but then I went through and cut out six

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.070 
but then I went through and cut out six
half<00:03:08.620> circle<00:03:09.340> ish<00:03:09.550> looking<00:03:10.210> shape<00:03:10.510> that<00:03:10.960> would

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
half circle ish looking shape that would

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.230 
half circle ish looking shape that would
go<00:03:11.230> together<00:03:11.410> to<00:03:11.830> make<00:03:11.860> these<00:03:12.250> full<00:03:12.790> circle

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
go together to make these full circle

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:21.690 
go together to make these full circle
looking<00:03:13.750> shapes<00:03:14.050> for<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.470> flower<00:03:15.310> pot<00:03:20.700> then

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
looking shapes for the flower pot then

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.430 
looking shapes for the flower pot then
Charlie<00:03:22.090> cut<00:03:22.300> the<00:03:22.420> pieces<00:03:22.690> with<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:22.990> legs<00:03:23.230> and

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
Charlie cut the pieces with the legs and

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.980 
Charlie cut the pieces with the legs and
gave<00:03:24.250> them<00:03:24.400> a<00:03:24.490> third<00:03:24.730> degree<00:03:25.240> angle<00:03:25.660> as<00:03:25.780> well

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
gave them a third degree angle as well

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.350 
gave them a third degree angle as well
you<00:03:26.680> use<00:03:26.920> a<00:03:26.950> combination<00:03:27.370> of<00:03:27.820> a<00:03:27.940> framing

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
you use a combination of a framing

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.600 
you use a combination of a framing
nailer<00:03:28.570> as<00:03:29.050> well<00:03:29.440> as<00:03:29.590> on<00:03:29.800> the<00:03:29.890> next<00:03:30.160> spring<00:03:30.400> to

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
nailer as well as on the next spring to

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:56.760 
nailer as well as on the next spring to
put<00:03:30.790> this<00:03:30.940> thing<00:03:31.120> together

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.440 

and<00:03:57.770> then<00:03:58.010> I<00:03:58.100> gave<00:03:58.160> it<00:03:58.460> a<00:03:58.520> quick<00:03:58.550> sanding<00:03:59.210> just

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
and then I gave it a quick sanding just

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.300 
and then I gave it a quick sanding just
kind<00:03:59.630> of<00:03:59.690> smooth<00:04:00.020> over<00:04:00.350> the<00:04:00.380> rough<00:04:00.560> ends<00:04:01.160> and

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
kind of smooth over the rough ends and

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.120 
kind of smooth over the rough ends and
and<00:04:01.670> the<00:04:02.090> tear<00:04:02.330> out<00:04:02.510> and<00:04:02.870> the<00:04:03.380> sharp<00:04:03.650> edges<00:04:03.860> all

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
and the tear out and the sharp edges all

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.290 
and the tear out and the sharp edges all
that<00:04:04.250> sort<00:04:04.460> of<00:04:04.490> stuff<00:04:04.550> I<00:04:04.760> didn't<00:04:05.000> want<00:04:05.120> to<00:04:05.210> see

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
that sort of stuff I didn't want to see

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.360 
that sort of stuff I didn't want to see
that<00:04:05.420> too<00:04:05.570> much<00:04:05.720> because<00:04:05.840> I<00:04:05.960> want<00:04:06.200> the<00:04:06.500> rustic

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
that too much because I want the rustic

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.100 
that too much because I want the rustic
look<00:04:07.400> of<00:04:07.760> the<00:04:07.910> pallet<00:04:08.480> just<00:04:08.630> kind<00:04:08.900> of<00:04:08.990> stay

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
look of the pallet just kind of stay

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.660 
look of the pallet just kind of stay
intact<00:04:09.470> they<00:04:09.800> didn't<00:04:10.010> want<00:04:10.160> to<00:04:10.250> give<00:04:10.400> it<00:04:10.550> a

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
intact they didn't want to give it a

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.210 
intact they didn't want to give it a
once-over<00:04:11.180> and<00:04:11.600> then<00:04:12.230> I<00:04:12.260> gave<00:04:12.380> it<00:04:12.560> as<00:04:12.800> we<00:04:13.010> cut

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
once-over and then I gave it as we cut

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:29.720 
once-over and then I gave it as we cut
the<00:04:13.400> polyurethane

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.720 

and<00:04:30.720> then<00:04:31.380> I've<00:04:31.530> been<00:04:31.710> reading<00:04:32.070> some<00:04:32.100> catnip

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
and then I've been reading some catnip

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.150 
and then I've been reading some catnip
all<00:04:32.940> of<00:04:33.240> this<00:04:33.390> catnip<00:04:33.990> came<00:04:34.290> from<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:34.770> first

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
all of this catnip came from the first

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.670 
all of this catnip came from the first
plant<00:04:35.520> in<00:04:35.700> the<00:04:35.850> green<00:04:36.150> pot<00:04:36.450> right<00:04:36.660> here<00:04:36.900> and<00:04:37.350> it

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
plant in the green pot right here and it

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.200 
plant in the green pot right here and it
is<00:04:37.800> probably<00:04:38.190> the<00:04:38.280> easiest<00:04:38.700> thing<00:04:38.850> I've<00:04:39.060> ever

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
is probably the easiest thing I've ever

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.150 
is probably the easiest thing I've ever
really<00:04:39.630> besides<00:04:40.140> hydrangeas<00:04:40.800> I<00:04:40.950> mean

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
really besides hydrangeas I mean

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.920 
really besides hydrangeas I mean
actually<00:04:41.940> it<00:04:41.970> is<00:04:42.150> easier<00:04:42.510> than<00:04:42.630> hydrogen

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
actually it is easier than hydrogen

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.390 
actually it is easier than hydrogen
since<00:04:43.230> it<00:04:43.380> doesn't<00:04:43.530> require<00:04:43.800> nearly<00:04:44.220> as<00:04:44.280> much

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
since it doesn't require nearly as much

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.330 
since it doesn't require nearly as much
water<00:04:44.670> so<00:04:44.940> I<00:04:45.270> was<00:04:45.510> going<00:04:45.720> to<00:04:45.840> move<00:04:46.050> these

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
water so I was going to move these

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.650 
water so I was going to move these
larger<00:04:47.340> plants<00:04:47.700> over<00:04:48.030> and<00:04:48.270> then<00:04:48.360> I<00:04:48.420> thought

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
larger plants over and then I thought

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.450 
larger plants over and then I thought
the<00:04:49.140> pots<00:04:49.350> aren't<00:04:49.590> quite<00:04:49.860> big<00:04:50.040> enough<00:04:50.220> for<00:04:50.280> all

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
the pots aren't quite big enough for all

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.950 
the pots aren't quite big enough for all
those<00:04:50.670> roots<00:04:50.940> and<00:04:51.000> I<00:04:51.090> didn't<00:04:51.330> want<00:04:51.450> the<00:04:51.630> plant

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
those roots and I didn't want the plant

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.930 
those roots and I didn't want the plant
to<00:04:52.110> get<00:04:52.230> ruined<00:04:52.590> because<00:04:53.100> they<00:04:53.460> would<00:04:53.610> have

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
to get ruined because they would have

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.120 
to get ruined because they would have
enough<00:04:54.180> space<00:04:54.480> so<00:04:54.870> I<00:04:55.170> just<00:04:55.860> went<00:04:56.010> with<00:04:56.070> the

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
enough space so I just went with the

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.470 
enough space so I just went with the
smaller<00:04:56.490> ones<00:04:56.790> I<00:04:57.030> know<00:04:57.090> that<00:04:57.300> they're<00:04:57.450> not

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
smaller ones I know that they're not

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.770 
smaller ones I know that they're not
visually<00:04:58.350> is<00:04:58.470> nice<00:04:59.130> but<00:04:59.520> I<00:04:59.760> didn't<00:05:00.420> want<00:05:00.600> the

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
visually is nice but I didn't want the

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.810 
visually is nice but I didn't want the
trick<00:05:00.960> to<00:05:01.080> get<00:05:01.200> room<00:05:01.380> and<00:05:01.530> process<00:05:01.950> and<00:05:02.250> the

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
trick to get room and process and the

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.610 
trick to get room and process and the
year<00:05:03.000> is<00:05:03.120> a<00:05:03.150> finished<00:05:03.570> Enya<00:05:03.810> table<00:05:04.200> last<00:05:04.380> night

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
year is a finished Enya table last night

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.290 
year is a finished Enya table last night
and<00:05:05.010> it<00:05:05.100> was<00:05:05.130> kind<00:05:05.430> of<00:05:05.490> just<00:05:05.550> wandering<00:05:06.210> the

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
and it was kind of just wandering the

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.150 
and it was kind of just wandering the
shops<00:05:06.720> and<00:05:06.990> none<00:05:07.140> of<00:05:07.170> the<00:05:07.290> cats<00:05:07.530> are<00:05:07.770> outside

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
shops and none of the cats are outside

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.160 
shops and none of the cats are outside
and<00:05:08.460> then<00:05:08.910> this<00:05:09.090> morning<00:05:09.360> I<00:05:09.540> went<00:05:09.660> out<00:05:09.780> to<00:05:10.050> look

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
and then this morning I went out to look

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.650 
and then this morning I went out to look
at<00:05:10.230> the<00:05:10.410> table<00:05:10.860> and<00:05:11.370> those<00:05:11.550> full<00:05:11.850> sports<00:05:12.480> had

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
at the table and those full sports had

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.920 
at the table and those full sports had
already<00:05:12.870> pulled<00:05:13.380> up<00:05:13.530> all<00:05:13.680> of<00:05:13.830> that<00:05:13.860> catnip

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
already pulled up all of that catnip

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.730 
already pulled up all of that catnip
what<00:05:15.930> happened<00:05:16.350> here<00:05:18.170> what's<00:05:19.170> happened<00:05:19.620> to

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.770 

but<00:05:48.100> this<00:05:48.190> was<00:05:48.340> a<00:05:48.370> super<00:05:48.729> duper<00:05:48.759> easy<00:05:49.090> project

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
but this was a super duper easy project

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.659 
but this was a super duper easy project
they<00:05:49.930> had<00:05:50.110> done<00:05:50.259> within<00:05:50.470> a<00:05:50.560> few<00:05:50.740> hours<00:05:50.800> putting

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
they had done within a few hours putting

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:53.820 
they had done within a few hours putting
all<00:05:51.880> the<00:05:52.030> glue<00:05:52.270> up<00:05:52.419> time<00:05:52.690> and<00:05:52.930> the<00:05:53.020> failure<00:05:53.500> and

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
all the glue up time and the failure and

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.200 
all the glue up time and the failure and
you<00:05:53.919> know<00:05:54.039> stuff<00:05:54.340> it<00:05:54.580> would<00:05:54.699> be<00:05:54.759> pretty<00:05:55.090> easy

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
you know stuff it would be pretty easy

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.420 
you know stuff it would be pretty easy
to<00:05:55.360> come<00:05:55.479> together<00:05:55.660> and<00:05:56.169> definitely<00:05:57.160> could<00:05:57.310> be

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
to come together and definitely could be

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.670 
to come together and definitely could be
used<00:05:57.639> for<00:05:57.910> small<00:05:58.030> children<00:05:58.389> and<00:05:58.690> his<00:05:58.990> cat<00:05:59.320> I

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
used for small children and his cat I

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.529 
used for small children and his cat I
also<00:06:00.160> think<00:06:00.550> I'm<00:06:00.669> going<00:06:00.820> to<00:06:00.850> be<00:06:00.940> planting<00:06:01.389> some

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:01.539 
also think I'm going to be planting some

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:04.260 
also think I'm going to be planting some
cat<00:06:01.840> grass<00:06:02.350> in<00:06:02.710> the<00:06:03.100> pot<00:06:03.430> since<00:06:03.759> the<00:06:03.970> best<00:06:04.150> of

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
cat grass in the pot since the best of

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.180 
cat grass in the pot since the best of
catnip<00:06:04.690> but<00:06:04.870> because<00:06:05.110> cat<00:06:05.410> grass<00:06:05.680> is<00:06:05.949> more

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
catnip but because cat grass is more

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.580 
catnip but because cat grass is more
robust<00:06:06.580> plus<00:06:07.210> it<00:06:07.360> grows<00:06:07.539> faster<00:06:08.080> so<00:06:08.289> if<00:06:08.470> I'm

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
robust plus it grows faster so if I'm

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.129 
robust plus it grows faster so if I'm
going<00:06:08.740> to<00:06:08.830> do<00:06:08.919> that<00:06:09.160> while<00:06:09.850> our<00:06:10.330> catnip<00:06:10.990> is

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:11.139 
going to do that while our catnip is

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:12.960 
going to do that while our catnip is
getting<00:06:11.440> bigger<00:06:11.650> all<00:06:12.190> right<00:06:12.490> I<00:06:12.520> just<00:06:12.610> wanted

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970 
getting bigger all right I just wanted

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.760
