00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.799
 beyond the superpower unfortunately gabriel 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.410
 spleen was removed on the 12th place in 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.900
 second place in event 46 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.890
 ties three rangers caciques is very 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.620
 difficult, right? 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.360
 but it's like you're a modality that 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.730
 is well accustomed to playing with certainty 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.420
 It's the way I play online there 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.450
 much time and field now missing twelve 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.720
 people are very fi very difficult and 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.730
 In the state that does not care, I fell and 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.180
 Come on, let's prove it now. 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.190
 10k the sea also with ten houses and then 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.530
 tomorrow I will stay or not stay in the game 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.120
 Uh oh, he already saw the favorite with his eyes. 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.030
 Uruguayans also do not feel for whom 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.320
 do not know and who better and has a 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.329
 face of my right that he is a player 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.620
 lyon lille also played with him 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.870
 sometimes 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.880
 It's what was in front of me. 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.590
 apparently it was very good 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.989
 so I think it was very good I had more 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.700
 A couple of four there, obviously. 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.260
 Look only then try a movie. 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.830
 interesting because obviously the 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:14.549
 others are good but I am much more 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.260
 young cool you how the dynamics of 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.330
 a race that would be much more to lose 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.270
 time was already much more aggressive 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.130
 what is it like or how old are they or not 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.540
 has to be very aggressive a game that 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.369
 the position is worth a lot 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.350
 obviously in any modality that 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.979
 will play but the six max besides omaha 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.710
 you press too much is very important 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.299
 So it 's one of the games it's a game that I 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.710
 I like it so much, it 's what it really is. 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.110
 play online 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.360
 but while this question about 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.950
 aggression in you have to be 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.590
 aggressive, otherwise people will 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.850
 obligatory let's swallow in there is 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.460
 That's cool 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.799
 let me tell you one thing how 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.360
 You look so nice after falling in 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.090
 tournament from the final stretch is 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.939
 quiet is quiet being good 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.970
 It is your head that is training already makes 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.420
 time is of your personality how is that 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.799
 is 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.390
 I think I've seen training and 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.549
 talked a little about it I think she 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.410
 Yes, this is training. 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:13.470
 are six years playing professional 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.700
 professionally and how they play crawl 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.110
 laine already got used to it 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.270
 much to deal with very much 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.220
 large part of the game much of the 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.700
 if you have not prepared to deal 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.750
 with a final stretch and I fall into it I do not 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.239
 I'll get to play my best in this 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.220
 hand in this game I will not be able to 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:32.140
 I really had won first place 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.849
 so I have to play knowing 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.610
 that I can fall, that's okay 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:39.640
 the next one focused on the 10k and we'll get 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.830
 this perfect title good luck to you 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.950

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.470

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.049
