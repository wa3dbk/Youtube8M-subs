gonna walk you through some intermediate

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.709 
gonna walk you through some intermediate
waves<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.129> Robotron<00:00:41.910> we're<00:00:42.329> starting<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:42.690> a

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
waves and Robotron we're starting in a

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.959 
waves and Robotron we're starting in a
wave<00:00:42.899> 13<00:00:43.410> for<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:43.829> round<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.399> intermediate

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
wave 13 for this round of intermediate

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.350 
wave 13 for this round of intermediate
play<00:00:45.210> pause<00:00:46.100> okay<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:47.730> wave<00:00:47.940> there's

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
play pause okay on this wave there's

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.420 
play pause okay on this wave there's
basically<00:00:48.780> grunts<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.530> spheroids<00:00:50.039> my

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
basically grunts and spheroids my

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.520 
basically grunts and spheroids my
strategy<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.030> go<00:00:51.420> for<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.840> steroids

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
strategy is to go for the steroids

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.170 
strategy is to go for the steroids
before<00:00:52.920> they<00:00:53.039> develop<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.640> looks<00:00:53.820> like<00:00:53.969> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
before they develop it looks like the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.000 
before they develop it looks like the
top<00:00:54.449> right<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.079> bottom<00:00:55.110> left<00:00:55.559> have<00:00:55.739> some

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
top right and the bottom left have some

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.830 
top right and the bottom left have some
forwards<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:56.730> I'm<00:00:56.820> just<00:00:56.910> gonna<00:00:57.000> go<00:00:57.270> attack

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
forwards so I'm just gonna go attack

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:23.360 
forwards so I'm just gonna go attack
those<00:00:58.050> first<00:00:58.350> before<00:00:58.800> they<00:00:58.890> develop<00:00:59.280> continue

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.490 

this<00:01:24.370> is<00:01:24.550> gonna<00:01:24.760> be<00:01:25.030> a<00:01:25.060> wave<00:01:26.020> you<00:01:26.200> want<00:01:26.380> to

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
this is gonna be a wave you want to

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.260 
this is gonna be a wave you want to
pause<00:01:26.860> and<00:01:27.190> get<00:01:27.370> to<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:27.550> edge<00:01:27.670> as<00:01:27.880> soon<00:01:28.090> as<00:01:28.180> you

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
pause and get to the edge as soon as you

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.570 
pause and get to the edge as soon as you
can<00:01:28.420> and<00:01:28.660> it<00:01:28.870> becomes<00:01:29.500> pretty<00:01:29.770> easy<00:01:29.860> with<00:01:30.430> this

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
can and it becomes pretty easy with this

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.640 
can and it becomes pretty easy with this
wave<00:01:30.850> as<00:01:31.150> you<00:01:31.300> get<00:01:31.480> more<00:01:31.690> advanced<00:01:32.440> into

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
wave as you get more advanced into

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.470 
wave as you get more advanced into
nineteen<00:01:33.100> twenty<00:01:33.520> nine<00:01:33.640> thirty<00:01:33.910> nine<00:01:34.180> you

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
nineteen twenty nine thirty nine you

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.350 
nineteen twenty nine thirty nine you
have<00:01:34.720> moved<00:01:35.020> slower<00:01:35.320> to<00:01:35.710> clear<00:01:36.340> a<00:01:36.370> path<00:01:36.670> of<00:01:37.090> the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
have moved slower to clear a path of the

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.570 
have moved slower to clear a path of the
grunts<00:01:37.750> and<00:01:37.930> you<00:01:38.710> want<00:01:38.890> to<00:01:38.950> go<00:01:39.010> fast<00:01:39.250> but<00:01:39.460> the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
grunts and you want to go fast but the

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.160 
grunts and you want to go fast but the
game<00:01:39.730> won't<00:01:39.940> respond<00:01:40.450> to<00:01:40.540> what<00:01:40.690> you<00:01:40.810> want<00:01:41.080> to

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
game won't respond to what you want to

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.110 
game won't respond to what you want to
do<00:01:41.290> here<00:01:41.740> just<00:01:42.040> look<00:01:42.190> for<00:01:42.430> the<00:01:42.820> easiest

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
do here just look for the easiest

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.180 
do here just look for the easiest
possible<00:01:43.420> exit<00:01:44.290> strategy<00:01:44.740> and<00:01:44.950> you<00:01:45.040> have

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
possible exit strategy and you have

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.280 
possible exit strategy and you have
about<00:01:45.430> a<00:01:45.790> second<00:01:46.120> or<00:01:46.210> two<00:01:46.240> and<00:01:46.390> stay<00:01:46.960> in<00:01:47.110> one

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
about a second or two and stay in one

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.200 
about a second or two and stay in one
spot<00:01:47.320> and<00:01:47.860> try<00:01:48.070> to<00:01:48.130> clear<00:01:48.490> out<00:01:48.610> as<00:01:48.820> much<00:01:48.970> of<00:01:49.150> a

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
spot and try to clear out as much of a

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.120 
spot and try to clear out as much of a
past<00:01:49.390> as<00:01:49.630> you<00:01:49.810> can<00:01:50.020> but<00:01:50.410> at<00:01:50.590> a<00:01:50.680> point<00:01:50.890> you<00:01:51.040> have

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
past as you can but at a point you have

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.640 
past as you can but at a point you have
to<00:01:51.280> decide<00:01:51.400> I<00:01:51.850> got<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:52.120> go<00:01:52.210> for<00:01:52.479> it<00:01:52.540> now<00:01:52.650> okay

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
to decide I got to go for it now okay

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.890 
to decide I got to go for it now okay
continue<00:01:54.070> kind<00:01:54.850> of<00:01:54.910> got<00:01:55.030> lucky<00:01:55.180> there<00:01:55.450> and

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
continue kind of got lucky there and

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.600 
continue kind of got lucky there and
just<00:01:56.440> circle<00:01:56.650> around<00:01:56.970> and<00:01:59.340> choose<00:02:00.340> what's

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
just circle around and choose what's

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.300 
just circle around and choose what's
your<00:02:01.240> aim<00:02:01.479> behind<00:02:01.780> it<00:02:02.140> and<00:02:02.290> just<00:02:03.010> basically

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
your aim behind it and just basically

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.690 
your aim behind it and just basically
the<00:02:03.490> circle<00:02:03.910> screen<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:05.290> when<00:02:05.440> I<00:02:05.860> kind<00:02:06.520> of<00:02:06.580> use

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
the circle screen and when I kind of use

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.060 
the circle screen and when I kind of use
a<00:02:06.729> bob<00:02:07.030> weave<00:02:07.360> type<00:02:07.840> of<00:02:07.990> strategy<00:02:08.410> avoiding

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
a bob weave type of strategy avoiding

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:20.330 
a bob weave type of strategy avoiding
those<00:02:09.220> star<00:02:09.910> sign

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.740 

all<00:02:21.340> right<00:02:21.430> this<00:02:21.549> is<00:02:21.700> wave<00:02:21.879> 20<00:02:22.330> this<00:02:22.599> is<00:02:22.690> a

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
all right this is wave 20 this is a

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.869 
all right this is wave 20 this is a
basically<00:02:23.110> a<00:02:23.170> brain<00:02:23.440> wave<00:02:23.650> and<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.580> lot<00:02:24.849> of

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
basically a brain wave and a lot of

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.000 
basically a brain wave and a lot of
points<00:02:25.299> basically<00:02:25.900> just<00:02:26.260> want<00:02:26.409> to<00:02:26.470> get<00:02:26.620> rid<00:02:26.980> of

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
points basically just want to get rid of

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.970 
points basically just want to get rid of
all<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.310> brains<00:02:27.549> and<00:02:27.879> find<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.599> exit<00:02:29.409> strategy

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
all the brains and find a exit strategy

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.520 
all the brains and find a exit strategy
to<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.790> edges<00:02:31.150> and<00:02:31.420> then<00:02:31.659> do<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.810> surfer<00:02:32.230> around

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
to the edges and then do a surfer around

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.789 
to the edges and then do a surfer around
and<00:02:32.799> on<00:02:33.010> this<00:02:33.610> wave<00:02:33.849> I<00:02:34.180> tend<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:34.840> go<00:02:35.349> directly

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
and on this wave I tend to go directly

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.369 
and on this wave I tend to go directly
at<00:02:36.069> the<00:02:36.430> missiles<00:02:37.120> that<00:02:37.450> they<00:02:37.599> shoot<00:02:37.989> out<00:02:38.110> and

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
at the missiles that they shoot out and

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.800 
at the missiles that they shoot out and
they<00:02:38.980> tend<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.310> reward<00:02:39.849> you<00:02:40.000> for<00:02:40.030> having<00:02:40.720> the

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
they tend to reward you for having the

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:50.789 
they tend to reward you for having the
guts<00:02:40.959> to<00:02:41.079> go<00:02:41.260> right<00:02:41.560> at<00:02:41.709> him<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:50.410> next<00:02:50.620> wave

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
guts to go right at him the next wave

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.069 
guts to go right at him the next wave
wave<00:02:51.220> 29<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:52.180> beginning<00:02:52.480> of<00:02:52.569> this<00:02:52.660> is<00:02:52.900> just

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
wave 29 the beginning of this is just

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.099 
wave 29 the beginning of this is just
all<00:02:53.230> skill<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:54.790> gotta<00:02:55.000> know<00:02:55.359> when<00:02:55.810> you<00:02:55.930> got

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
all skill you gotta know when you got

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.640 
all skill you gotta know when you got
where<00:02:56.349> to<00:02:56.410> go<00:02:56.530> so<00:02:56.560> I'm<00:02:56.859> gonna<00:02:56.980> go<00:02:57.099> top<00:02:57.340> left

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
where to go so I'm gonna go top left

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:06.210 
where to go so I'm gonna go top left
look<00:02:59.650> at<00:02:59.769> that<00:02:59.950> play<00:03:01.019> wow<00:03:04.950> there's<00:03:05.950> a<00:03:06.040> little

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
look at that play wow there's a little

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.420 
look at that play wow there's a little
bit<00:03:06.340> of<00:03:06.430> luck<00:03:06.549> involved<00:03:06.730> in<00:03:07.090> this<00:03:07.239> way<00:03:07.420> of<00:03:08.430> nine

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
bit of luck involved in this way of nine

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.990 
bit of luck involved in this way of nine
wave<00:03:09.730> right<00:03:10.030> yeah<00:03:10.390> nine<00:03:10.690> waves

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
wave right yeah nine waves

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.509 
wave right yeah nine waves
you<00:03:13.000> got<00:03:13.480> a<00:03:13.510> pause<00:03:13.750> to<00:03:14.140> get<00:03:14.260> out<00:03:14.409> I<00:03:14.890> did<00:03:15.459> a

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
you got a pause to get out I did a

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.250 
you got a pause to get out I did a
little<00:03:15.700> bit<00:03:15.819> of<00:03:15.909> pause<00:03:16.060> there<00:03:16.329> and<00:03:16.359> got<00:03:17.049> lucky

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
little bit of pause there and got lucky

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.860 
little bit of pause there and got lucky
with<00:03:17.620> an<00:03:17.829> out<00:03:18.190> this<00:03:18.519> is<00:03:18.670> wave<00:03:18.879> 30<00:03:19.269> it's<00:03:19.629> a<00:03:19.690> very

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
with an out this is wave 30 it's a very

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.710 
with an out this is wave 30 it's a very
slow<00:03:20.260> developing<00:03:21.190> wave<00:03:21.430> so<00:03:21.940> you<00:03:22.060> can't<00:03:22.569> move

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
slow developing wave so you can't move

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.479 
slow developing wave so you can't move
to<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:22.989> outside<00:03:23.230> too<00:03:23.680> quick<00:03:24.010> but<00:03:24.280> when<00:03:24.400> you

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
to the outside too quick but when you

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.460 
to the outside too quick but when you
see<00:03:24.669> an<00:03:24.760> opening<00:03:24.880> basically<00:03:25.780> go<00:03:25.930> for<00:03:26.200> it<00:03:26.290> and

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
see an opening basically go for it and

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.500 
see an opening basically go for it and
then<00:03:26.590> just<00:03:26.980> circle<00:03:27.220> around<00:03:27.430> and<00:03:27.849> and<00:03:28.150> get<00:03:28.419> the

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
then just circle around and and get the

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.449 
then just circle around and and get the
points<00:03:28.959> can't<00:03:29.290> get<00:03:29.410> all<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.650> brains<00:03:29.950> go<00:03:30.400> to

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
points can't get all the brains go to

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.430 
points can't get all the brains go to
where<00:03:30.880> you<00:03:31.150> see<00:03:31.329> all<00:03:31.450> the<00:03:31.569> points<00:03:31.900> and<00:03:32.079> try<00:03:32.379> to

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
where you see all the points and try to

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.129 
where you see all the points and try to
keep<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:32.889> affair<00:03:33.370> I'd<00:03:33.549> live<00:03:34.000> before<00:03:34.540> you<00:03:34.989> get

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
keep the affair I'd live before you get

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:37.129 
keep the affair I'd live before you get
all<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.440> brains<00:03:35.829> just<00:03:36.160> gives<00:03:36.549> you<00:03:36.700> more

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
all the brains just gives you more

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:56.010 
all the brains just gives you more
opportunity<00:03:38.139> to<00:03:38.260> get<00:03:38.410> the<00:03:38.560> family

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.840 

and<00:03:57.020> that's<00:03:57.170> greed<00:03:57.470> right<00:03:57.740> there<00:03:58.160> yes<00:03:58.580> that's

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
and that's greed right there yes that's

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.850 
and that's greed right there yes that's
greed<00:03:59.120> don't<00:03:59.420> do<00:03:59.570> that<00:03:59.780> it's<00:04:00.680> not<00:04:00.830> worth<00:04:01.010> it<00:04:02.860> it

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
greed don't do that it's not worth it it

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.070 
greed don't do that it's not worth it it
next<00:04:04.190> is<00:04:04.280> wave<00:04:04.520> 37<00:04:05.270> trying<00:04:05.570> to<00:04:05.690> shoot

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
next is wave 37 trying to shoot

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.010 
next is wave 37 trying to shoot
diagonally<00:04:06.380> and<00:04:07.210> left-right<00:04:08.210> try<00:04:08.570> to<00:04:08.630> keep<00:04:08.900> in

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
diagonally and left-right try to keep in

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.330 
diagonally and left-right try to keep in
the<00:04:09.110> center<00:04:09.350> you<00:04:09.710> don't<00:04:09.890> want<00:04:10.040> to<00:04:10.100> be<00:04:10.190> on<00:04:10.250> the

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
the center you don't want to be on the

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.310 
the center you don't want to be on the
edges<00:04:10.640> too<00:04:10.790> much<00:04:10.970> so<00:04:11.240> it's<00:04:11.600> go<00:04:11.810> straight<00:04:12.110> for

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
edges too much so it's go straight for

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.810 
edges too much so it's go straight for
them<00:04:12.410> in<00:04:12.500> the<00:04:12.560> center<00:04:12.770> if<00:04:12.920> you<00:04:12.950> can<00:04:13.250> it's<00:04:13.700> on

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
them in the center if you can it's on

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.340 
them in the center if you can it's on
our<00:04:13.940> intuitive<00:04:14.180> but<00:04:14.660> that's<00:04:14.900> how<00:04:15.020> you<00:04:15.080> get<00:04:15.260> out

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
our intuitive but that's how you get out

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.780 
our intuitive but that's how you get out
of<00:04:15.440> the<00:04:15.530> way<00:04:15.680> especially<00:04:16.370> with<00:04:16.459> a<00:04:16.519> lot<00:04:16.670> of

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
of the way especially with a lot of

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.280 
of the way especially with a lot of
holes<00:04:16.970> in<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:17.239> middle<00:04:17.480> on<00:04:17.570> that<00:04:17.600> one<00:04:17.989> yeah

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
holes in the middle on that one yeah

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.320 
holes in the middle on that one yeah
okay<00:04:20.769> this<00:04:21.769> is<00:04:21.950> wave<00:04:22.160> 38<00:04:22.760> and<00:04:23.000> this<00:04:23.180> way

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
okay this is wave 38 and this way

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.840 
okay this is wave 38 and this way
there's<00:04:23.630> two<00:04:23.870> tank<00:04:24.560> developers<00:04:25.250> here<00:04:25.550> you

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
there's two tank developers here you

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.070 
there's two tank developers here you
want<00:04:26.000> to<00:04:26.060> get<00:04:26.180> rid<00:04:26.330> of<00:04:26.390> those<00:04:26.480> as<00:04:26.720> soon<00:04:26.900> as<00:04:26.990> you

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
want to get rid of those as soon as you

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.840 
want to get rid of those as soon as you
can<00:04:27.260> before<00:04:27.590> they<00:04:27.860> develop<00:04:28.310> just<00:04:28.520> makes<00:04:28.730> it

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
can before they develop just makes it

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.000 
can before they develop just makes it
more<00:04:28.970> complicated<00:04:29.510> so<00:04:30.080> those<00:04:30.380> are<00:04:30.560> basically

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
more complicated so those are basically

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.130 
more complicated so those are basically
diagonal<00:04:31.550> or<00:04:31.670> horizontal<00:04:32.240> shots<00:04:32.480> and<00:04:32.810> just

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
diagonal or horizontal shots and just

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.930 
diagonal or horizontal shots and just
run<00:04:33.650> through<00:04:33.860> the<00:04:34.010> rest<00:04:34.190> of<00:04:34.310> the<00:04:34.370> wave<00:04:34.490> and

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
run through the rest of the wave and

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.750 
run through the rest of the wave and
that<00:04:35.120> happens<00:04:35.540> obstacles<00:04:36.350> yeah<00:04:37.100> so<00:04:37.490> always

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
that happens obstacles yeah so always

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.700 
that happens obstacles yeah so always
whenever<00:04:38.570> you<00:04:38.720> get<00:04:38.810> a<00:04:38.870> spare<00:04:39.200> moment<00:04:39.620> in

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
whenever you get a spare moment in

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.580 
whenever you get a spare moment in
Robotron<00:04:40.220> focus<00:04:40.850> on<00:04:41.000> obstacle<00:04:41.570> yeah<00:04:41.810> get<00:04:42.110> get

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
Robotron focus on obstacle yeah get get

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.900 
Robotron focus on obstacle yeah get get
them<00:04:42.680> whether<00:04:43.100> you<00:04:43.220> think<00:04:43.400> they're<00:04:43.580> gonna<00:04:43.700> be

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
them whether you think they're gonna be

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:44.740 
them whether you think they're gonna be
in<00:04:44.000> your<00:04:44.090> way<00:04:44.150> or<00:04:44.240> not

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
in your way or not

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.600 
in your way or not
just<00:04:45.290> go<00:04:45.410> for<00:04:45.680> it<00:04:45.710> because<00:04:45.920> you<00:04:46.070> always<00:04:46.340> have

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
just go for it because you always have

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.700 
just go for it because you always have
spare<00:04:46.940> moment<00:04:47.560> yeah<00:04:48.940> every<00:04:49.940> other<00:04:50.060> half

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
spare moment yeah every other half

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.190 
spare moment yeah every other half
nanosecond<00:04:51.710> is<00:04:52.280> another<00:04:52.610> nine<00:04:52.880> wave<00:04:53.200> gotta

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
nanosecond is another nine wave gotta

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.080 
nanosecond is another nine wave gotta
get<00:04:54.410> slow<00:04:54.770> development<00:04:55.160> out<00:04:55.370> of<00:04:55.520> there<00:04:55.670> find<00:04:56.000> a

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
get slow development out of there find a

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.940 
get slow development out of there find a
way<00:04:56.210> and<00:04:56.630> that<00:04:56.690> was<00:04:57.170> kind<00:04:57.410> of<00:04:57.440> nice<00:04:57.560> and<00:04:57.860> they

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
way and that was kind of nice and they

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.920 
way and that was kind of nice and they
tend<00:04:58.220> to<00:04:58.310> be<00:04:58.700> nice<00:04:59.120> to<00:04:59.300> you<00:04:59.390> if<00:04:59.480> you<00:04:59.600> get<00:04:59.750> out<00:04:59.900> of

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
tend to be nice to you if you get out of

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.630 
tend to be nice to you if you get out of
there<00:05:00.169> notice<00:05:00.560> it<00:05:00.680> to<00:05:00.830> the<00:05:00.890> left-hand<00:05:01.160> corner

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
there notice it to the left-hand corner

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.250 
there notice it to the left-hand corner
they<00:05:01.970> pushed<00:05:02.270> all<00:05:02.419> the<00:05:02.450> difficult<00:05:03.020> stuff

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
they pushed all the difficult stuff

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260 
they pushed all the difficult stuff
there<00:05:03.560> and<00:05:03.770> with<00:05:04.310> like<00:05:04.520> four<00:05:04.760> or<00:05:04.850> five<00:05:04.880> shot

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
there and with like four or five shot

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.390 
there and with like four or five shot
you<00:05:05.480> get<00:05:05.600> rid<00:05:05.750> of<00:05:05.810> everything<00:05:06.110> so<00:05:06.590> nine<00:05:07.100> waves

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
you get rid of everything so nine waves

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.360 
you get rid of everything so nine waves
can<00:05:07.610> be<00:05:07.640> nice<00:05:07.940> you<00:05:08.360> know<00:05:08.390> like<00:05:08.630> 39<00:05:08.960> 49<00:05:09.440> 59<00:05:09.980> they

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
can be nice you know like 39 49 59 they

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.430 
can be nice you know like 39 49 59 they
develops<00:05:10.820> though<00:05:11.090> and<00:05:11.419> if<00:05:11.750> you<00:05:12.020> get<00:05:12.169> lucky

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
develops though and if you get lucky

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.350 
develops though and if you get lucky
enough<00:05:12.500> to<00:05:12.680> get<00:05:12.770> out<00:05:12.919> it's<00:05:13.400> it's<00:05:13.880> pretty<00:05:14.120> nice

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
enough to get out it's it's pretty nice

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:23.290 
enough to get out it's it's pretty nice
one<00:05:14.750> guy<00:05:15.020> way<00:05:19.510> this<00:05:20.510> way<00:05:20.810> 46<00:05:21.730> pause<00:05:22.730> this<00:05:23.240> is

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
one guy way this way 46 pause this is

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.930 
one guy way this way 46 pause this is
basically<00:05:23.900> this<00:05:24.050> fair<00:05:24.590> I'd<00:05:24.770> wave<00:05:24.950> with<00:05:25.550> lot<00:05:25.790> of

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
basically this fair I'd wave with lot of

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.640 
basically this fair I'd wave with lot of
grunts<00:05:26.270> get<00:05:26.780> rid<00:05:26.870> of<00:05:26.930> this<00:05:27.020> fair<00:05:27.290> words<00:05:27.530> as

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
grunts get rid of this fair words as

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.250 
grunts get rid of this fair words as
soon<00:05:27.830> as<00:05:27.950> you<00:05:28.040> can<00:05:28.250> and<00:05:28.490> get<00:05:29.390> any<00:05:29.810> points<00:05:30.050> you

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
soon as you can and get any points you

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260 
soon as you can and get any points you
can<00:05:30.440> near<00:05:30.860> the<00:05:30.980> end<00:05:31.100> of<00:05:31.160> this<00:05:31.280> wave<00:05:31.550> created<00:05:32.240> a

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
can near the end of this wave created a

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.300 
can near the end of this wave created a
little<00:05:32.360> pause<00:05:32.660> in<00:05:32.930> my<00:05:33.020> movement<00:05:33.290> and<00:05:33.710> that's

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
little pause in my movement and that's

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.860 
little pause in my movement and that's
for<00:05:34.580> scene<00:05:34.850> where<00:05:35.090> the<00:05:35.210> bullets<00:05:35.540> are<00:05:35.630> going

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
for scene where the bullets are going

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.560 
for scene where the bullets are going
and<00:05:36.110> just<00:05:36.800> getting<00:05:36.980> lucky<00:05:37.130> but<00:05:37.550> just<00:05:38.030> a<00:05:38.150> second

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
and just getting lucky but just a second

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.450 
and just getting lucky but just a second
plant<00:05:38.840> is<00:05:38.930> so<00:05:39.080> long<00:05:39.260> developing<00:05:39.919> the<00:05:40.070> skill<00:05:40.340> of

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
plant is so long developing the skill of

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.790 
plant is so long developing the skill of
pausing<00:05:41.090> it<00:05:41.570> doesn't<00:05:41.930> feel<00:05:42.050> natural<00:05:42.260> right

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
pausing it doesn't feel natural right

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.650 
pausing it doesn't feel natural right
yeah<00:05:43.100> that's<00:05:43.310> not<00:05:43.550> it<00:05:43.610> doesn't<00:05:44.030> feel<00:05:44.180> right<00:05:44.450> it

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
yeah that's not it doesn't feel right it

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.350 
yeah that's not it doesn't feel right it
does<00:05:44.810> not<00:05:45.050> feel<00:05:45.350> right<00:05:45.410> but<00:05:46.220> it's<00:05:46.729> it's<00:05:47.060> you're

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
does not feel right but it's it's you're

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.719 
does not feel right but it's it's you're
basically<00:05:47.690> tricking<00:05:48.110> them<00:05:48.290> to<00:05:48.800> thinking<00:05:49.280> it's

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:49.729 
basically tricking them to thinking it's

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:51.370 
basically tricking them to thinking it's
like<00:05:49.820> a<00:05:49.910> running<00:05:50.240> back<00:05:50.390> basically<00:05:50.870> so<00:05:51.110> you

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
like a running back basically so you

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.980 
like a running back basically so you
faking<00:05:51.830> out<00:05:51.919> the<00:05:52.090> defenders<00:05:53.090> here's<00:05:53.870> the

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
faking out the defenders here's the

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.390 
faking out the defenders here's the
pause<00:05:54.200> right<00:05:54.830> there

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
pause right there

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.380 
pause right there
usually<00:05:57.400> just<00:05:57.430> want<00:05:57.670> to<00:05:57.790> check<00:05:57.940> back<00:05:58.210> and

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.390 
usually just want to check back and

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:59.940 
usually just want to check back and
forth<00:05:58.690> but<00:05:58.960> at<00:05:59.050> that<00:05:59.200> point<00:05:59.440> you<00:05:59.620> felt<00:05:59.830> like

00:05:59.940 --> 00:05:59.950 
forth but at that point you felt like

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.680 
forth but at that point you felt like
you<00:06:00.130> needed<00:06:00.520> to<00:06:00.760> pause<00:06:01.000> because<00:06:01.240> install

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
you needed to pause because install

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.440 
you needed to pause because install
downtime<00:06:02.670> and<00:06:03.670> there's<00:06:03.880> basically<00:06:04.030> no<00:06:04.420> time

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:04.450 
downtime and there's basically no time

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.720 
downtime and there's basically no time
involved<00:06:05.140> with<00:06:05.380> the<00:06:05.470> pause<00:06:05.680> okay<00:06:06.340> this<00:06:06.550> is<00:06:06.700> a

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:06.730 
involved with the pause okay this is a

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:08.640 
involved with the pause okay this is a
tank<00:06:07.030> wave<00:06:07.270> I<00:06:07.540> tried<00:06:07.870> to<00:06:07.990> go<00:06:08.350> through<00:06:08.560> this

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
tank wave I tried to go through this

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.070 
tank wave I tried to go through this
wave<00:06:08.860> shooting<00:06:09.460> diagonally<00:06:10.120> top<00:06:10.510> left<00:06:10.810> and

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
wave shooting diagonally top left and

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.590 
wave shooting diagonally top left and
also<00:06:11.230> horizontally<00:06:12.070> left<00:06:12.280> right<00:06:12.520> I<00:06:12.730> just<00:06:13.390> see

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 
also horizontally left right I just see

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.060 
also horizontally left right I just see
as<00:06:13.720> it<00:06:13.930> develops<00:06:14.350> to<00:06:14.470> where<00:06:14.590> you<00:06:14.710> want<00:06:14.890> to<00:06:14.920> go

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070 
as it develops to where you want to go

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.520 
as it develops to where you want to go
with<00:06:15.250> that<00:06:15.280> and<00:06:15.670> during<00:06:16.240> tank<00:06:16.630> ways<00:06:16.840> once<00:06:17.440> you

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
with that and during tank ways once you

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.190 
with that and during tank ways once you
die<00:06:17.740> and<00:06:18.160> the<00:06:18.490> wave<00:06:19.120> starts<00:06:19.390> to<00:06:19.690> develop<00:06:20.080> again

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.200 
die and the wave starts to develop again

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.350 
die and the wave starts to develop again
the<00:06:20.620> tanks<00:06:20.920> develop<00:06:21.250> quicker<00:06:21.490> and<00:06:21.850> it<00:06:22.030> just

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 
the tanks develop quicker and it just

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.460 
the tanks develop quicker and it just
gets<00:06:22.540> more<00:06:22.810> difficult

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:23.470 
gets more difficult

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.350 
gets more difficult
you<00:06:23.710> pretty<00:06:24.070> much<00:06:24.160> respawn<00:06:24.880> and<00:06:25.090> you'll<00:06:25.210> be

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
you pretty much respawn and you'll be

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.030 
you pretty much respawn and you'll be
surrounded<00:06:25.570> by<00:06:25.990> tanks<00:06:26.500> yeah<00:06:26.710> so<00:06:26.920> it's

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040 
surrounded by tanks yeah so it's

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.430 
surrounded by tanks yeah so it's
important<00:06:27.490> not<00:06:27.700> to<00:06:27.910> die<00:06:28.300> on<00:06:28.510> a<00:06:28.630> tank<00:06:28.870> wave<00:06:29.080> yeah

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
important not to die on a tank wave yeah

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.370 
important not to die on a tank wave yeah
it's<00:06:30.010> much<00:06:30.790> nicer<00:06:31.210> to<00:06:31.480> be<00:06:31.630> able<00:06:31.840> to<00:06:32.050> clear

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380 
it's much nicer to be able to clear

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.320 
it's much nicer to be able to clear
before<00:06:32.980> they<00:06:33.310> spawn<00:06:33.670> this<00:06:33.970> is<00:06:34.060> one<00:06:34.210> of<00:06:34.270> those

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.330 
before they spawn this is one of those

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:35.790 
before they spawn this is one of those
waves<00:06:34.570> where<00:06:34.900> you<00:06:34.990> can<00:06:35.110> lose<00:06:35.290> three<00:06:35.560> guys<00:06:35.770> I
