00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.789
 which is only available for the estonia ericsson mini xperia x10 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.119

 dalmatian and forever marchetta let's say android - detail d sony 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.660
 given ericsson is called for wood 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.999
 this is why it is called capable 

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:40.569
 how to make this application allows you to make wallpapers 

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:42.200
 highly customized 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.400
 using the bases already present or to see also the other photo 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.350

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 wallpapers are see which one meant 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.660
 specialty 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.329
 that we have a story of the objects that will be inserted 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.379
 in our school tomorrow I show you how it was with simple creating a background 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.350
 personal we start with a base of this type 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.580
 such as a button to scroll right to left 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.870
 now let's put it 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.130
 of the circles 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.910
 long display 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.910
 elite the whole is very simple enough that we don't press 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.770
 these are created 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.680
 circles 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.540
 where we go in writing 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.790
 now we insert 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.790
 these dots change color 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.200
 even here 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.460
 net are dots that 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.749
 depending on how we want it, they will give everything creative 

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:48.749
 the display 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.480
 in our menu we reconstruct and take a text I chose written 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.480
 at the bottom we choose three characters 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.910
 we choose the soma character we give ok 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.650
 that don't post a color 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.269

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.669
 true he wrote it 

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.669
 done we take it goes very randomly 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:17.329
 It's the final effect is really beautiful 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:27.319
 Here is our background, we can clearly continue by including 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:28.549
 of cubes 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.479

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:25.429

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:30.649
 and so on 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:38.299
