a<00:02:47.680> little<00:02:48.680> bit<00:02:48.800> sketchy<00:02:49.130> on<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.400> highway<00:02:49.940> I

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
a little bit sketchy on the highway I

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.309 
a little bit sketchy on the highway I
would<00:02:51.440> take<00:02:51.680> it<00:02:51.890> on<00:02:52.099> a<00:02:52.160> long<00:02:52.430> trip<00:02:52.700> I<00:02:53.480> think

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
would take it on a long trip I think

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.140

the highway so I think a guy puts a pair
of<00:03:41.050> Hyde<00:03:41.260> miles<00:03:41.530> on<00:03:41.740> this<00:03:41.920> thing<00:03:42.160> to

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
of Hyde miles on this thing to

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.480
