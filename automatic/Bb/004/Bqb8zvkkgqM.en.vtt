towards the back of the order and then

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
luis of bad and i think but over the

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.090 
luis of bad and i think but over the

but<00:01:52.250> that<00:01:52.340> was<00:01:52.490> an<00:01:52.610> interesting<00:01:52.880> strategy

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
but that was an interesting strategy

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:04.640 
through a Russo a great little switch

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.270 
through a Russo a great little switch
back<00:06:04.910> former<00:06:05.510> co<00:06:05.660> bortolotti<00:06:06.050> but<00:06:06.710> zanella<00:06:07.070> is

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
back former co bortolotti but zanella is

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.010 
back former co bortolotti but zanella is
proper<00:06:07.760> clothes<00:06:08.000> as<00:06:08.180> they<00:06:08.300> now<00:06:08.420> climb<00:06:08.810> up

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
proper clothes as they now climb up

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.480 
proper clothes as they now climb up
through<00:06:09.230> a<00:06:09.290> route<00:06:09.590> look<00:06:09.830> how<00:06:09.980> much<00:06:10.160> quicker<00:06:10.340> he

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
through a route look how much quicker he

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:11.740 
through a route look how much quicker he
was<00:06:10.640> I<00:06:10.730> think<00:06:10.880> you<00:06:10.970> had<00:06:11.060> to<00:06:11.150> get<00:06:11.270> out<00:06:11.390> the<00:06:11.540> power

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
was I think you had to get out the power

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.510 
was I think you had to get out the power
there<00:06:12.050> as<00:06:12.320> they<00:06:12.500> Chris<00:06:12.770> they<00:06:12.920> let<00:06:13.100> Randy<00:06:13.400> on

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
there as they Chris they let Randy on

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.430 
there as they Chris they let Randy on
sideways<00:06:14.030> all<00:06:14.270> the<00:06:14.390> way<00:06:14.510> for<00:06:14.750> zanella<00:06:15.020> and

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
sideways all the way for zanella and

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.600 
sideways all the way for zanella and
bortolotti<00:06:15.860> has<00:06:16.070> got<00:06:16.220> enough<00:06:16.430> of<00:06:16.520> an

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
bortolotti has got enough of an

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.700 
bortolotti has got enough of an
advantage<00:06:16.880> I<00:06:17.120> think<00:06:17.150> zanella<00:06:17.720> is<00:06:18.020> really

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
advantage I think zanella is really

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.020 
advantage I think zanella is really
strong<00:06:18.950> through<00:06:19.190> a<00:06:19.250> Rouge<00:06:19.490> because<00:06:19.760> it<00:06:19.880> looked

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.030 
strong through a Rouge because it looked

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.160 
strong through a Rouge because it looked
to<00:06:20.150> me<00:06:20.180> as<00:06:20.300> though<00:06:20.450> he<00:06:20.570> had<00:06:20.600> to<00:06:20.780> get<00:06:20.930> out<00:06:21.050> the

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.170 
to me as though he had to get out the

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.350 
to me as though he had to get out the
power<00:06:21.380> there<00:06:21.680> as<00:06:22.400> I<00:06:22.430> said<00:06:22.760> earlier<00:06:22.790> you<00:06:23.240> need

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
power there as I said earlier you need

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.020 
power there as I said earlier you need
to<00:06:23.420> just<00:06:23.660> stay<00:06:23.900> away<00:06:24.170> from<00:06:24.200> those<00:06:24.500> curbs

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030

laterz they think of all month and turn
in<00:06:46.580> I<00:06:46.730> think<00:06:47.120> that<00:06:47.150> was<00:06:47.360> clever<00:06:47.570> driving<00:06:48.050> from

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:48.170 
in I think that was clever driving from

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.420 
in I think that was clever driving from
him<00:06:48.320> really<00:06:48.590> wasn't<00:06:48.830> it<00:06:48.890> cuz<00:06:49.010> if<00:06:49.100> he<00:06:49.190> places

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 
him really wasn't it cuz if he places

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.430 
him really wasn't it cuz if he places
his<00:06:49.640> car<00:06:49.820> there<00:06:50.030> Brundle<00:06:50.720> can't<00:06:50.930> get<00:06:51.140> the<00:06:51.260> cut

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 
his car there Brundle can't get the cut

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.690 
his car there Brundle can't get the cut
back<00:06:51.590> but<00:06:51.770> he's<00:06:51.860> right<00:06:52.130> in<00:06:52.310> the<00:06:52.400> slipstream

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:52.700 
back but he's right in the slipstream

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.580 
back but he's right in the slipstream
now<00:06:52.970> as<00:06:53.030> they<00:06:53.180> make<00:06:53.360> their<00:06:53.390> way<00:06:53.570> down<00:06:53.870> towards

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:54.590 
now as they make their way down towards

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.650 
now as they make their way down towards
a<00:06:54.680> ruse<00:06:54.890> this<00:06:55.130> is<00:06:55.280> where<00:06:55.520> drivers<00:06:56.150> earn<00:06:56.420> their

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:56.660 
a ruse this is where drivers earn their

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.030 
a ruse this is where drivers earn their
money<00:06:56.690> this<00:06:57.050> is<00:06:57.110> where<00:06:57.380> these<00:06:57.530> drivers<00:06:58.010> are

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:58.040 
money this is where these drivers are

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.690 
money this is where these drivers are
brave<00:06:58.370> all<00:06:59.090> very<00:06:59.660> close<00:07:00.080> and<00:07:00.440> just<00:07:01.130> about<00:07:01.490> they

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:01.700 
brave all very close and just about they

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.520 
brave all very close and just about they
get<00:07:01.880> through<00:07:02.150> there<00:07:02.360> i<00:07:02.390> think<00:07:02.510> Brundle<00:07:03.050> was

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:03.530 
get through there i think Brundle was

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.050 
get through there i think Brundle was
expecting<00:07:03.980> to<00:07:04.010> go<00:07:04.130> a<00:07:04.160> little<00:07:04.310> bit<00:07:04.490> faster<00:07:04.670> that

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:05.060 
expecting to go a little bit faster that

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.060 
expecting to go a little bit faster that
was<00:07:05.180> a<00:07:05.210> consequence<00:07:05.960> yeah<00:07:06.740> I<00:07:06.770> thought<00:07:06.950> was

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:07.070 
was a consequence yeah I thought was

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:08.620 
was a consequence yeah I thought was
going<00:07:07.160> to<00:07:07.220> go<00:07:07.310> straight<00:07:07.580> on<00:07:07.730> there<00:07:07.970> where<00:07:08.150> look

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:08.630 
going to go straight on there where look

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.900 
going to go straight on there where look
too<00:07:08.810> much<00:07:08.990> speed<00:07:09.290> on<00:07:09.500> the<00:07:09.590> way<00:07:09.740> in<00:07:09.980> and<00:07:10.010> and<00:07:10.370> has

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:10.910 
too much speed on the way in and and has

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:12.850 
too much speed on the way in and and has
now<00:07:11.120> missed<00:07:11.330> the<00:07:11.510> opportunity<00:07:11.600> to<00:07:12.260> attack<00:07:12.620> on

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:12.860 
now missed the opportunity to attack on
