00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.230
 good the keel flower wave is that such as 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.460
 are you see me with those of a few pints and 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.530
 such because I'm taking advantage of 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.810
 record a little more to get 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.220
 material for these days and good the 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.260
 video that I bring you today as you can see in 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.240
 the title is the favorite video of the 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.560
 month of March note with many things 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.720
 but good because they are important things 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.910
 and what I'm liking and I'm using 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.699
 very much so if you are interested in seeing 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.550
 this video stay with me starting 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:38.710
 for the care of the face this was taught 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.190
 eye makeup remover biphasic travels 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.019
 or from yaya or one you want to call has 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.460
 120 milliliters and good you see here 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:49.929
 perfectly that is basic is necessary 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.899
 move it and then apply it in a 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:54.969
 cotton for the eyes and good it cost me 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:56.620
 three insurance with 20 in the store 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:58.809
 I still have the price if you want 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.459
 I be honest , I've been using it 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:01.659
 week or something like that the truth that is a 

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:03.400
 spa villa the risks that is me 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.950
 really like it 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.370
 removes makeup in depth 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.230
 very well removes it apart from not 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.900
 it stings in the eyes perhaps there are others that 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.990
 they sting me a bit more but this with 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.820
 the mercadona are my favorites 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.290
 If I had to choose I do not know which one 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.869
 it would be because the two I think they do 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.759
 very good makeup function super good 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.670
 I think he uses makeup a little bit 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:31.210
 better than mercadona but it 's very 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.740
 they can look us right in the eyes and the truth 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.960
 that I love 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.270
 another little thing rubbed for 15 care of the 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.820
 body is that the bath cell travels from 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.580
 coconut is using it now more than 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.140
 He never has 500 milliliters and good 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.729
 I think I 've taken it out some other time in 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.140
 the our video but I'm not sure and 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.000
 is that it has a smell 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.510
 what's great because this is not that 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.659
 it smells a little strong and just like 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.610
 others have a slightly soft smell 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.479
 soft maybe like touch as it smells 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.479
 as if I had milk 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:11.959
 but if I eat a little milk very soft 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.880
 I know you should feel milk water but 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.430
 is that it smells like that is a little bit 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.870
 soft then you know that the gels of 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.750
 ground bath to me at least me 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.250
 it has a lot of its maximum in the smell in 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.950
 the body is not that it is a thing 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.440
 special or little is worth a little longer 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.840
 it's so good on the skin at all not 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.250
 it leaves me badly if you notice it hydrated and 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.170
 well what I like the most about him is the 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.850
 smell but the other things that it has 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.350
 that doing its function is not bad 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.230
 The next thing I teach you is the 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.940
 hair care you have already seen 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.980
 in the channel sometime when I bought it 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.840
 and good is this oceanic shampoo from the 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.700
 Gas brand that is well known and already 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.380
 Many of you will know about it and well it's a 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.750
 shampoo that I've been using for a while 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.430
 to have an opinion formed and the 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.920
 I love it, it's a shampoo that 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.720
 makes a lot of foam that cleans me very 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.940
 Well, my hair feels a lot cleaner 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.520
 for more time when he used this 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.960
 shampoo that when I use others is a shampoo 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.990
 that does not continue for less with which 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.300
 is much better than others and the truth is that 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.190
 I love I love I love it 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.980
 a lot of foam and clean me in 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.040
 another little thing that I teach them 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.340
 over here is the dry shampoo of the is 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.510
 Basque 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.220
 I do not know if you know what a brand is 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.590
 I like it very much and good 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.210
 this I know I use it sometimes 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.190
 special is worth when maybe that 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.840
 day nourishes me a little more and this day 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.430
 I do not have time to wash it because 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.990
 I also when I wash the but 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.840
 I need a lot of time because I have a lot 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.610
 but also that I like it later 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.760
 leave it a little to the 100 houses and carlos 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.290
 without a lot of dryer so as not to spoil it and 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.970
 Well, the truth is that I like it 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.680
 quite this shampoos and that for what 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.420
 when he fought me he has withdrawn me a little 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.460
 the house of the scalp tell you that 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.200
 be made on the scalp I'll 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.730
 separating the layers and I'm going to take a 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.560
 little bit and then brush it well since 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.460
 it stays the one a little bit white and 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.280
 without other brushes you will appear 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.040
 an older lady the pain you have and 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.860
 that I do not like much is a little 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:15.760
 peculiar flies me as well as lemon or 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:17.500
 something like that I do not smell something like that and the 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.600
 true that it fulfills its function 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.959
 pretty well it 's true I'm not going to 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.120
 say no 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.490
 is that this is the same as washing your hair 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.080
 it's worth it for nothing but simply 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.880
 yes we removed you I remove the mass of 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.410
 scalp and makes that day that 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.400
 while you could wash your hair you feel 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.930
 much more comfortable and I love it 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.460
 now we go to makeup things and 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.110
 this makeup base I already have 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.210
 taught in my video of bases of 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.919
 makeup for fat stones that 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.690
 would organize information people for themselves 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.780
 some cluelessness has not seen him and 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:51.620
 more interest factor the face finity 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:58.090
 worth three in one has a protector of 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:05:00.280
 solar factor of 20 and it's tone 60 comes out 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.230
 the truth that I have already commented things 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.050
 good of it is that it drives me crazy 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:07.150
 I love it, it fascinates me 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.370
 I put on and my face lasts a lot without 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.590
 glitters covers me pretty much 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.990
 imperfections without giving me the effect of 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.430
 I wear a mask and good the truth 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.080
 that I am delighted with her so 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.970
 when it takes a few 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.830
 how many hours do I get a little bit of 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.600
 shine but what happens with the majority and yes 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.729
 that it is true that with this it is with 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.680
 it has cost me more to leave 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:29.050
 shines I tell you that I'm wearing 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.610
 of mercadona imagine that you can not 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.919
 appreciate for nothing right in the camera 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.800
 but already in spa setting and the truth that the 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:37.270
 I tried yesterday afternoon and I have a note 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.490
 no glitter and there are opposites 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.310
 a come on her but good you 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.930
 I commented that I wear it and to go 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.950
 trying a little bit to be able to make a 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.220
 review 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:53.490
 and finally I show you Estela de l'Oréal 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.490
 of the l'oréal collection is the frame 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:06:00.000
 I do not know if you appreciate it and well that thinking 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:04.720
 the bambino really is one thing 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.790
 at the moment only as it gets good 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:11.230
 still the pink rose neither that is 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:14.640
 I love, I love, I wonder 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.640
 they fascinated of soacha from here 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.570
 right now I do not take every two for three 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.280
 besides that I love the smell that 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:27.080
 have I do not know if you can appreciate it well 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:29.660
 it's a super striking gorgeous pink and 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.750
 All those little things I love 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.770
 apart from telling you that it hydrates super well 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.960
 the lip 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:38.680
 they are not worth anything, little things or things 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.480
 of those and in life it lasts 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.890
 quite considerable or he wanted it 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.840
 teach apart from because it's being my 

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.890
 favorite also because there are so many 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.780
 girls that when I wear it 

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.970
 Such an envious person asks me that he 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.070
 they had carried and good etc the project

 it is super good 

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:57.770
 moisturizes the lip and smells super rich like that 

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:00.170
 I recommend it a lot, it cost me 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.550
 nine euros in the store and good 

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.320
