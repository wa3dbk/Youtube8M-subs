00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.380
 tens of thousands of years ago when the 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.120
 most precious treasure of mankind was 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.639
 the fire that I was able to rescue from the 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.679
 rays fallen on the trees the plans 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.150
 they took shelter in caverns to protect themselves 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.719
 from the weather and animals 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.719
 predators 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.880
 the sustenance of these first homo 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.130
 sapiens depended on the collection of 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.200
 wild fruits and hunting whose 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.780
 persecution forced them to wander 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.210
 from one place to another despite the precariousness of 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.120
 its existence towards the year 40,000 before 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.800
 of Christ the man of the Paleolithic 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.470
 began to look beyond reality 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.900
 rather, a 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.000
 parallel reality painting the on the 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.290
 rocks with your fingers or modeling the 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.290
 knocks on the stone and wood 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.320
 ah 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.970
 [Music] 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.460
 these 2 utensils as well as the 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.380
 cave paintings and figurines with the 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.750
 less cavemen conjured the good 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.610
 meat and fertility were the prelude 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.820
 of a long chain of artistic achievements 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.720
 and technologies designed to optimize the 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.720
 quality of human life 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.440
 ah 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.420
 [Music] 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.880
 already in the Mesolithic eight centuries before 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.860
 Christ the man had tamed the 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.110
 animals and learned to make 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.730
 fabrics with the vegetable pounds with what 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.050
 that his food and clothing were 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.250
 insured also in this period leaves 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.140
 definitely the caverns for 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.050
 build your own dwelling with mud and 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.480
 adobe paints stylized figures until the 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.760
 geometric wording and lifts with 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.530
 suns stone monuments to render 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.530
 worship to their ancestors and the gods 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.820
 ah 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.799
 this evolution culminates towards the 5000 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.659
 before Christ in the guards of 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.510
 symbols that have the pottery of 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.520
 neolithic immediate background of the 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.500
 writing they witnessed the 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.259
 Birth metal age and 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.760
 the first stable settlements all 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.270
 the rest of its history 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.270
 ah
