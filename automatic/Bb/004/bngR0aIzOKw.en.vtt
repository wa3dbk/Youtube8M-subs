who grew up together and they kind of

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.589 
who grew up together and they kind of
covered<00:02:11.879> that<00:02:11.970> in<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.150> beginning<00:02:12.450> of<00:02:12.510> the

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
covered that in the beginning of the

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.490 
covered that in the beginning of the
show

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
show

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.930 
show
and<00:02:13.620> ones<00:02:14.520> gay<00:02:15.330> ones<00:02:15.870> straight<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:17.040> in<00:02:17.760> this

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.180 
and ones gay ones straight and in this
show<00:02:18.150> they<00:02:18.510> work<00:02:19.080> together<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.560> think<00:02:19.710> they

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
show they work together I think they

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.830 
show they work together I think they
were<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:20.660> um<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:22.110> think<00:02:22.350> they're<00:02:22.620> architects

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
were you um I think they're architects

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.350 
were you um I think they're architects
probably<00:02:24.840> missed<00:02:25.050> that<00:02:25.230> part<00:02:25.500> not<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:26.010> their

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
probably missed that part not to their

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.810 
probably missed that part not to their
architects<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:28.020> architects<00:02:28.760> architects<00:02:30.080> and
