00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
if you have found the same thing I know

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.480

that<00:01:52.320> there<00:01:52.439> are<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.560> lot<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.860> guys<00:01:53.009> who<00:01:53.189> pride

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
that there are a lot of guys who pride

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.980 
that there are a lot of guys who pride
themselves<00:01:53.520> on<00:01:54.090> their<00:01:54.210> beard<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.689> now<00:01:54.780> I

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
themselves on their beard and now I

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.600

think<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.500> facial<00:01:55.890> hair<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.159> kind<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.399> like<00:01:56.579> a

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
think the facial hair is kind of like a

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.030 
think the facial hair is kind of like a
statement<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.360> masculinity<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.350> being<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.829> man

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
statement of masculinity of being a man

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.170 
statement of masculinity of being a man
and<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.310> difference<00:01:59.549> between<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.790> beard<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.119> a

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
and the difference between a beard and a

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.090 
and the difference between a beard and a
mustache<00:02:00.210> can<00:02:00.750> vary<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.259> way<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.409> look<00:02:01.710> also

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100
