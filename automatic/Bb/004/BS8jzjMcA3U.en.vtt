of time on this because one of the

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.039 
of time on this because one of the
things<00:00:08.290> that<00:00:09.330> some<00:00:10.330> students<00:00:10.629> struggle<00:00:11.020> with

things that some students struggle with

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:14.100 
things that some students struggle with
is<00:00:11.350> interpreting<00:00:11.950> video<00:00:12.250> reference<00:00:13.020> what<00:00:14.020> do

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.110 
is interpreting video reference what do

is interpreting video reference what do
I<00:00:14.199> look<00:00:14.469> for<00:00:16.080> I'll<00:00:17.080> start<00:00:17.619> with<00:00:21.150> animation<00:00:22.150> go

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
I look for I'll start with animation go

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:32.940 
I look for I'll start with animation go
there<00:00:24.880> it<00:00:24.970> is<00:00:30.509> usually<00:00:31.509> one<00:00:32.470> of<00:00:32.619> the<00:00:32.710> things

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 
there it is usually one of the things

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.950 
there it is usually one of the things
all<00:00:35.550> for<00:00:36.550> me<00:00:36.640> I<00:00:36.670> do<00:00:37.210> everything<00:00:37.600> pretty<00:00:37.930> much

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
all for me I do everything pretty much

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.060 
all for me I do everything pretty much
pose<00:00:38.380> based<00:00:39.420> I'm<00:00:40.420> a<00:00:40.600> pose<00:00:40.810> based<00:00:41.110> animator<00:00:41.620> so

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
pose based I'm a pose based animator so

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.670 
pose based I'm a pose based animator so
I<00:00:42.100> look<00:00:42.400> for<00:00:42.580> key<00:00:42.730> poses<00:00:43.080> so<00:00:44.080> when<00:00:44.290> studying

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
I look for key poses so when studying

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.710 
I look for key poses so when studying
animation<00:00:45.250> like<00:00:45.580> mr.<00:00:45.970> bean<00:00:46.120> coming<00:00:46.510> out<00:00:46.570> here

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720

animation like mr. bean coming out here
doing<00:00:46.870> this<00:00:46.990> crazy<00:00:47.320> dance<00:00:47.680> I'll<00:00:48.520> look<00:00:48.700> for

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
doing this crazy dance I'll look for

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.060 
doing this crazy dance I'll look for
what<00:00:49.120> are<00:00:49.150> the<00:00:49.330> main<00:00:49.540> poses<00:00:50.410> when<00:00:50.650> I<00:00:50.680> scrub

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
what are the main poses when I scrub

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.130 
what are the main poses when I scrub
through<00:00:51.250> the<00:00:51.310> video<00:00:51.520> reference<00:00:52.060> okay<00:00:52.810> okay

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
through the video reference okay okay

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.820 
through the video reference okay okay
I'll<00:00:53.230> look<00:00:53.410> for<00:00:53.650> the<00:00:53.740> extremes<00:00:54.310> of<00:00:54.640> action<00:00:55.090> so

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
I'll look for the extremes of action so

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.780 
I'll look for the extremes of action so
the<00:00:56.830> first<00:00:57.100> thing<00:00:57.370> I<00:00:57.460> look<00:00:57.610> for<00:00:57.670> is<00:00:58.620> kind<00:00:59.620> of

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
the first thing I look for is kind of

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.240 
the first thing I look for is kind of
the<00:01:00.790> extremes<00:01:01.240> of<00:01:01.480> the<00:01:01.900> hips<00:01:02.380> right<00:01:02.800> so<00:01:03.130> he's

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
the extremes of the hips right so he's

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.030 
the extremes of the hips right so he's
got<00:01:03.430> an<00:01:03.550> extreme<00:01:04.000> here<00:01:04.330> here's<00:01:04.930> kind<00:01:05.199> of<00:01:05.229> one

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
got an extreme here here's kind of one

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.029 
got an extreme here here's kind of one
pose<00:01:06.340> right<00:01:06.790> through<00:01:07.000> there<00:01:07.649> there's<00:01:08.649> kind<00:01:08.979> of

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:09.039 
pose right through there there's kind of

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:12.719 
pose right through there there's kind of
another<00:01:09.249> pose<00:01:10.829> here's<00:01:11.829> another<00:01:11.979> pose<00:01:12.369> as<00:01:12.549> he's

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
another pose here's another pose as he's

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:14.789 
another pose here's another pose as he's
coming<00:01:12.999> down<00:01:13.090> because<00:01:13.240> the<00:01:13.509> speeder<00:01:13.810> his<00:01:14.499> feet

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
coming down because the speeder his feet

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.739 
coming down because the speeder his feet
are<00:01:14.920> coming<00:01:15.189> together<00:01:15.310> so<00:01:16.240> I<00:01:16.299> can<00:01:16.420> also<00:01:16.539> look

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:16.749 
are coming together so I can also look

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:18.270 
are coming together so I can also look
at<00:01:16.869> the<00:01:16.990> context<00:01:17.560> of<00:01:17.649> the<00:01:17.770> feet<00:01:17.979> when<00:01:18.189> they

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
at the context of the feet when they

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.029 
at the context of the feet when they
move<00:01:18.490> and<00:01:18.670> when<00:01:18.789> they<00:01:18.909> stop<00:01:19.499> so<00:01:20.499> finding<00:01:20.890> out

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
move and when they stop so finding out

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:22.559 
move and when they stop so finding out
those<00:01:21.429> moments<00:01:21.789> and<00:01:22.060> it<00:01:22.119> walks<00:01:22.299> like<00:01:22.390> though

00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:22.569 
those moments and it walks like though

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:25.590 
those moments and it walks like though
it's<00:01:22.689> a<00:01:22.719> little<00:01:22.840> easier<00:01:23.310> because<00:01:24.390> if<00:01:25.390> we're

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
it's a little easier because if we're

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.469 
it's a little easier because if we're
looking<00:01:25.719> at<00:01:25.990> this<00:01:26.109> walk<00:01:26.350> cycle<00:01:26.380> for<00:01:26.950> instance

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
looking at this walk cycle for instance

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.499 
looking at this walk cycle for instance
well<00:01:28.479> look<00:01:28.600> at<00:01:28.719> it<00:01:28.810> from<00:01:28.899> the<00:01:29.049> side<00:01:29.289> view

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
well look at it from the side view

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:41.340 
well look at it from the side view
beside<00:01:31.509> you<00:01:39.509> it's<00:01:40.509> a<00:01:40.630> little<00:01:40.840> easier<00:01:41.109> to<00:01:41.170> break

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
beside you it's a little easier to break

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.169 
beside you it's a little easier to break
the<00:01:41.560> action<00:01:41.889> down<00:01:42.039> because<00:01:42.520> we<00:01:42.789> know<00:01:42.969> the

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
the action down because we know the

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:46.499 
the action down because we know the
extremes<00:01:43.810> are<00:01:44.139> on<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.649> low<00:01:45.130> curve<00:01:45.639> which<00:01:46.299> I'm

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
extremes are on the low curve which I'm

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:49.609 
extremes are on the low curve which I'm
walking<00:01:46.899> so<00:01:47.139> boom<00:01:47.850> it's<00:01:48.850> Jane<00:01:49.119> number<00:01:49.389> one

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
walking so boom it's Jane number one

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.899 
walking so boom it's Jane number one
right<00:01:50.619> here<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.990> is<00:01:53.049> a<00:01:53.380> pose<00:01:53.740> right<00:01:54.399> so<00:01:54.759> what

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
right here this is a pose right so what

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.910 
right here this is a pose right so what
I<00:01:54.939> do<00:01:55.030> is<00:01:55.420> when<00:01:55.569> I'm<00:01:55.719> observing<00:01:56.469> my<00:01:56.590> video

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
I do is when I'm observing my video

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.230 
I do is when I'm observing my video
reference<00:01:57.310> I'm<00:01:57.490> looking<00:01:57.850> for<00:01:58.209> mine<00:01:58.990> in<00:01:59.170> action

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
reference I'm looking for mine in action

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.940 
reference I'm looking for mine in action
I'm<00:02:01.240> looking<00:02:01.749> for<00:02:02.049> the<00:02:02.740> angle<00:02:03.009> of<00:02:03.579> the<00:02:03.999> foot

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
I'm looking for the angle of the foot

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.809 
I'm looking for the angle of the foot
how<00:02:05.950> far<00:02:06.369> forward<00:02:06.749> that<00:02:07.749> foot<00:02:08.110> is<00:02:08.610> what's<00:02:09.610> the

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
how far forward that foot is what's the

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.070 
how far forward that foot is what's the
distance<00:02:10.620> between<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:12.519> two<00:02:12.760> feet<00:02:13.060> these<00:02:13.930> are

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
distance between the two feet these are

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.740 
distance between the two feet these are
kind<00:02:14.319> of<00:02:14.379> observations<00:02:15.129> on<00:02:15.250> making<00:02:15.700> that<00:02:16.629> are

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
kind of observations on making that are

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.990 
kind of observations on making that are
relevant<00:02:17.110> to

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
relevant to

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.680 
relevant to
when<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.360> posed<00:02:18.690> this<00:02:18.930> in<00:02:19.170> Maya<00:02:20.450> what's<00:02:21.450> the

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
when I posed this in Maya what's the

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.300 
when I posed this in Maya what's the
twist<00:02:22.350> of<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.950> hips<00:02:24.650> it's<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.740> little<00:02:25.950> easier

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
twist of the hips it's a little easier

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.830 
twist of the hips it's a little easier
to<00:02:26.430> see<00:02:26.460> in<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.820> side<00:02:27.060> view<00:02:27.090> than<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.570> is<00:02:27.690> the

in<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.660> opposite<00:02:37.200> direction<00:02:37.680> right<00:02:38.420> are<00:02:39.420> you

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
in the opposite direction right are you

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.890 
in the opposite direction right are you
doing<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.810> long<00:02:39.990> cycle<00:02:41.120> what<00:02:42.120> art<00:02:42.330> is<00:02:42.510> arms

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
doing a long cycle what art is arms

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.380 
doing a long cycle what art is arms
doing<00:02:43.080> at<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.680> extreme<00:02:44.130> what's<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.700> angle<00:02:45.180> of

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
doing at the extreme what's the angle of

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.380 
doing at the extreme what's the angle of
this<00:02:45.510> big<00:02:45.750> elbow<00:02:46.700> with<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.880> angle<00:02:48.120> of<00:02:48.240> this

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
this big elbow with the angle of this

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.100 
this big elbow with the angle of this
big<00:02:48.630> elbow<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.350> in<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.560> angle<00:02:49.980> of<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.280> wrist

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
big elbow and in the angle of the wrist

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.480 
big elbow and in the angle of the wrist
so<00:02:52.110> not<00:02:52.290> just<00:02:52.470> from<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.770> side<00:02:52.980> view<00:02:53.250> but<00:02:53.459> also

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
so not just from the side view but also

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.920 
so not just from the side view but also
the<00:02:53.790> front<00:02:54.000> of<00:02:54.120> you<00:02:54.240> because<00:02:54.390> that<00:02:54.420> arm<00:02:54.750> is

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
the front of you because that arm is

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.570 
the front of you because that arm is
crossing<00:02:55.470> in<00:02:55.590> front<00:02:55.890> of<00:02:55.980> them<00:02:56.100> it's<00:02:56.310> crushing

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
crossing in front of them it's crushing

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.060 
crossing in front of them it's crushing
in<00:02:56.820> front<00:02:57.030> of<00:02:57.120> his<00:02:57.270> belly<00:02:57.570> right<00:02:58.140> so<00:02:58.560> I've<00:02:59.010> got

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
in front of his belly right so I've got

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.770 
in front of his belly right so I've got
a<00:02:59.250> determined<00:02:59.880> I'm<00:02:59.970> like<00:03:00.150> looking<00:03:00.510> at<00:03:00.660> that

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
a determined I'm like looking at that

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.660 
a determined I'm like looking at that
angle<00:03:01.020> it's<00:03:01.290> hard<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:01.530> see<00:03:01.709> here<00:03:02.100> but<00:03:02.370> from<00:03:02.550> the

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
angle it's hard to see here but from the

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.390 
angle it's hard to see here but from the
front<00:03:02.820> view<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.560> can<00:03:04.560> get<00:03:04.800> a<00:03:04.830> better<00:03:05.010> idea<00:03:05.130> of

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
front view I can get a better idea of

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.990 
front view I can get a better idea of
that<00:03:05.580> position<00:03:07.100> with<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.250> angle<00:03:08.550> of<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.760> neck

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
that position with the angle of the neck

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.560 
that position with the angle of the neck
what's<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.990> tilt<00:03:10.290> of<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.590> head<00:03:11.360> okay<00:03:12.360> all

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
what's the tilt of the head okay all

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.610 
what's the tilt of the head okay all
these<00:03:12.780> things<00:03:13.020> are<00:03:13.170> things<00:03:13.320> that<00:03:13.470> I'm

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
these things are things that I'm

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.890 
these things are things that I'm
observing<00:03:13.800> why<00:03:14.340> when<00:03:14.820> I<00:03:14.850> find<00:03:15.240> that<00:03:15.390> iconic

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
observing why when I find that iconic

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.230 
observing why when I find that iconic
extreme<00:03:16.500> pose<00:03:16.740> that<00:03:17.010> extreme<00:03:17.520> pose<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:18.030> I<00:03:18.060> can

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
extreme pose that extreme pose and I can

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.820 
extreme pose that extreme pose and I can
make<00:03:18.360> observations<00:03:18.540> based<00:03:19.320> off<00:03:19.560> of<00:03:19.590> that

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
make observations based off of that

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.550 
make observations based off of that
those<00:03:20.820> observations<00:03:21.420> can<00:03:22.200> then<00:03:22.440> get

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
those observations can then get

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.240 
those observations can then get
translated<00:03:23.280> into<00:03:23.670> my<00:03:24.150> CG<00:03:24.540> puppet<00:03:24.930> right<00:03:25.260> so<00:03:26.220> I

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
translated into my CG puppet right so I

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.580 
translated into my CG puppet right so I
typically<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:27.300> know<00:03:27.420> you<00:03:27.480> can<00:03:27.690> either<00:03:27.870> make

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
typically you know you can either make

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.960 
typically you know you can either make
notes<00:03:28.920> you<00:03:29.760> know<00:03:29.989> could<00:03:31.100> do<00:03:32.100> draw<00:03:32.370> overs<00:03:32.790> on

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
notes you know could do draw overs on

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.780 
notes you know could do draw overs on
top<00:03:33.209> of<00:03:33.330> your<00:03:33.420> video<00:03:33.570> to<00:03:34.140> help<00:03:34.320> out<00:03:34.590> a<00:03:34.890> lot<00:03:35.760> of

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
top of your video to help out a lot of

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.670 
top of your video to help out a lot of
people<00:03:36.120> nowadays<00:03:36.330> they<00:03:36.570> put<00:03:37.230> their<00:03:37.380> video

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
people nowadays they put their video

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.870 
people nowadays they put their video
front<00:03:38.010> in<00:03:38.190> Maya<00:03:38.580> which<00:03:39.060> is<00:03:39.239> pretty<00:03:39.480> easy<00:03:39.570> to<00:03:39.900> do

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
front in Maya which is pretty easy to do

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.180 
front in Maya which is pretty easy to do
and<00:03:41.880> I<00:03:41.940> think<00:03:42.000> Tommy<00:03:42.360> might<00:03:42.600> even<00:03:42.840> have<00:03:43.110> a<00:03:43.350> how

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
and I think Tommy might even have a how

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.289 
and I think Tommy might even have a how
to<00:03:44.250> video<00:03:44.519> on<00:03:44.900> doing<00:03:45.900> that<00:03:46.050> in<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:48.290> one<00:03:49.290> of<00:03:49.440> the

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
to video on doing that in the one of the

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.270 
to video on doing that in the one of the
sections<00:03:51.299> of<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.600> website<00:03:51.830> so<00:03:52.830> it's<00:03:53.100> pretty

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
sections of the website so it's pretty

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.699 
sections of the website so it's pretty
easy<00:03:53.489> to<00:03:53.640> do<00:03:53.900> but<00:03:54.900> that<00:03:55.080> can<00:03:55.200> help<00:03:55.320> you<00:03:55.470> as<00:03:55.560> well

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
easy to do but that can help you as well

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:56.990 
easy to do but that can help you as well
because<00:03:55.830> you<00:03:56.070> have<00:03:56.220> that<00:03:56.340> right<00:03:56.580> there<00:03:56.640> in

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
because you have that right there in

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.699 
because you have that right there in
your<00:03:57.030> mind<00:03:57.299> a<00:03:57.450> file<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:57.900> you<00:03:58.019> can<00:03:58.049> observe<00:03:58.500> it

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
your mind a file and you can observe it

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.970 
your mind a file and you can observe it
and<00:03:59.090> you<00:04:00.090> definitely<00:04:00.330> so<00:04:01.320> once<00:04:01.620> I<00:04:01.739> have<00:04:01.950> that

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
and you definitely so once I have that

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.530 
and you definitely so once I have that
extreme<00:04:02.459> pose<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:02.940> I<00:04:03.000> go<00:04:03.209> to<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.360> other

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
extreme pose and I go to the other

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.870 
extreme pose and I go to the other
extreme<00:04:03.630> pose<00:04:04.220> then<00:04:05.220> look<00:04:05.400> at<00:04:05.489> it<00:04:05.580> from<00:04:05.700> this

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
extreme pose then look at it from this

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.220 
extreme pose then look at it from this
point<00:04:06.150> of<00:04:06.330> view<00:04:06.360> and<00:04:06.720> make<00:04:06.870> some<00:04:07.080> observations

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
point of view and make some observations

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.330 
point of view and make some observations
here<00:04:08.750> then<00:04:09.750> in<00:04:09.989> terms<00:04:10.230> of<00:04:10.440> okay<00:04:10.980> what's<00:04:11.190> the

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
here then in terms of okay what's the

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.320 
here then in terms of okay what's the
breakdown<00:04:11.519> pose

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
breakdown pose

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.970 
breakdown pose
what's<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:12.660> passing<00:04:13.080> pose<00:04:13.260> look<00:04:13.500> like<00:04:13.709> in<00:04:13.860> the

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
what's the passing pose look like in the

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.520 
what's the passing pose look like in the
walk<00:04:14.190> cycle<00:04:14.480> again<00:04:15.480> what's<00:04:15.690> the<00:04:15.780> overall<00:04:16.290> line

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.009 
walk cycle again what's the overall line
of<00:04:16.709> action<00:04:17.299> right<00:04:18.299> now<00:04:18.450> he's<00:04:18.630> pretty<00:04:18.780> much

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
of action right now he's pretty much

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.440 
of action right now he's pretty much
straight<00:04:19.410> out<00:04:19.590> but<00:04:19.830> there<00:04:19.979> is<00:04:20.100> a<00:04:20.130> slight<00:04:20.450> into

pose the tip of the foot in relation to
the<00:04:25.950> heel<00:04:26.160> of<00:04:26.190> this<00:04:26.460> book<00:04:26.700> so<00:04:27.360> all<00:04:27.390> those

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
the heel of this book so all those

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.589 
the heel of this book so all those
things<00:04:27.870> I'm<00:04:28.020> making<00:04:28.320> observations<00:04:28.620> are

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:31.599 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:33.899 

so<00:04:32.529> I<00:04:32.559> think<00:04:32.649> it<00:04:32.919> helps<00:04:33.219> to<00:04:33.279> break<00:04:33.729> them<00:04:33.879> down

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:33.909 
so I think it helps to break them down

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:36.059 
so I think it helps to break them down
at<00:04:34.240> that<00:04:34.389> level<00:04:34.569> the<00:04:35.349> first<00:04:35.559> thing<00:04:35.800> I<00:04:35.889> look<00:04:36.009> for

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:36.069 
at that level the first thing I look for

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:38.040 
at that level the first thing I look for
is<00:04:36.279> in<00:04:36.399> line<00:04:36.580> of<00:04:36.729> action<00:04:37.059> what's<00:04:37.419> the<00:04:37.629> line<00:04:37.869> of

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
is in line of action what's the line of

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.469 
is in line of action what's the line of
action<00:04:38.439> of<00:04:38.529> the<00:04:38.649> character<00:04:39.009> and<00:04:39.159> it<00:04:39.729> in<00:04:39.939> the

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
action of the character and it in the

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.989 
action of the character and it in the
case<00:04:40.809> of<00:04:40.990> mr.<00:04:41.169> bean<00:04:41.499> so<00:04:42.099> when<00:04:42.279> we<00:04:42.429> find<00:04:42.789> it<00:04:42.909> a

00:04:42.989 --> 00:04:42.999 
case of mr. bean so when we find it a

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:50.519 
case of mr. bean so when we find it a
good<00:04:43.149> extreme<00:04:43.629> goes<00:04:43.869> on<00:04:44.050> mr.<00:04:44.349> bean<00:04:44.529> a<00:04:48.839> cure<00:04:49.839> in

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:50.529 
good extreme goes on mr. bean a cure in

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:53.219 
good extreme goes on mr. bean a cure in
this<00:04:50.709> pose<00:04:50.949> here<00:04:51.399> means<00:04:52.300> at<00:04:52.479> the<00:04:52.629> height<00:04:52.929> of

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
this pose here means at the height of

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:55.459 
this pose here means at the height of
his<00:04:53.770> little<00:04:54.249> dance

00:04:55.459 --> 00:04:55.469 
his little dance

00:04:55.469 --> 00:05:02.869 
his little dance
let's<00:04:56.469> see<00:04:59.610> the<00:05:00.610> overall<00:05:00.969> line<00:05:01.209> of<00:05:01.360> action<00:05:01.719> is

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:02.879 
let's see the overall line of action is

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:06.959 
let's see the overall line of action is
this<00:05:03.879> S<00:05:04.149> curve<00:05:04.599> through<00:05:05.020> the<00:05:05.110> body<00:05:05.909> from<00:05:06.909> that

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:06.969 
this S curve through the body from that

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:09.719 
this S curve through the body from that
S<00:05:07.389> curve<00:05:07.839> I<00:05:08.020> can<00:05:08.409> deduce<00:05:08.949> some<00:05:09.279> things<00:05:09.580> about

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
S curve I can deduce some things about

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:12.149 
S curve I can deduce some things about
the<00:05:10.029> hips<00:05:10.240> and<00:05:10.449> the<00:05:10.509> shoulders<00:05:10.899> right<00:05:11.289> from

00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:12.159 
the hips and the shoulders right from

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:14.969 
the hips and the shoulders right from
this<00:05:12.339> line<00:05:12.669> in<00:05:12.879> action<00:05:13.300> I<00:05:13.509> can<00:05:14.259> deduce<00:05:14.919> that

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
this line in action I can deduce that

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:18.359 
this line in action I can deduce that
his<00:05:15.959> shoulders<00:05:16.959> because<00:05:17.499> there's<00:05:17.709> this<00:05:17.860> curve

00:05:18.359 --> 00:05:18.369 
his shoulders because there's this curve

00:05:18.369 --> 00:05:21.329 
his shoulders because there's this curve
through<00:05:18.849> here<00:05:19.830> there's<00:05:20.830> going<00:05:21.009> to<00:05:21.069> be<00:05:21.129> some

00:05:21.329 --> 00:05:21.339 
through here there's going to be some

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:25.679 
through here there's going to be some
contrapposto<00:05:22.119> going<00:05:22.779> on<00:05:23.789> which<00:05:24.789> is<00:05:24.819> the<00:05:25.149> way

00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:25.689 
contrapposto going on which is the way

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:27.389 
contrapposto going on which is the way
the<00:05:25.930> hips<00:05:26.169> and<00:05:26.409> the<00:05:26.469> shoulders<00:05:26.860> tend<00:05:27.159> to

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:27.399 
the hips and the shoulders tend to

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:32.939 
the hips and the shoulders tend to
rotate<00:05:28.029> opposite<00:05:28.869> each<00:05:29.019> other<00:05:29.969> so<00:05:30.969> that<00:05:31.949> works

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:32.949 
rotate opposite each other so that works

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:35.159 
rotate opposite each other so that works
a<00:05:33.039> bit<00:05:33.069> right<00:05:33.639> your<00:05:33.879> hips<00:05:34.089> pointing<00:05:34.539> up<00:05:34.839> the

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 
a bit right your hips pointing up the

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.469 
a bit right your hips pointing up the
shoulders<00:05:35.589> looks<00:05:35.860> sore<00:05:36.339> is<00:05:36.519> going<00:05:36.729> to<00:05:36.969> canter

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
shoulders looks sore is going to canter

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:41.429 
shoulders looks sore is going to canter
okay<00:05:39.330> contrapposto<00:05:40.330> I<00:05:40.569> think<00:05:40.930> literally

00:05:41.429 --> 00:05:41.439 
okay contrapposto I think literally

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:45.329 
okay contrapposto I think literally
means<00:05:41.709> counter<00:05:42.219> pose<00:05:43.139> so<00:05:44.139> whatever<00:05:44.800> if<00:05:45.189> you

00:05:45.329 --> 00:05:45.339 
means counter pose so whatever if you

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:46.469 
means counter pose so whatever if you
can<00:05:45.490> find<00:05:45.699> out<00:05:45.789> what's<00:05:45.939> happening<00:05:46.269> in<00:05:46.360> the

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 
can find out what's happening in the

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:51.149 
can find out what's happening in the
hips<00:05:47.999> it<00:05:48.999> almost<00:05:49.209> always<00:05:49.899> extract<00:05:50.829> from<00:05:51.009> that

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:51.159 
hips it almost always extract from that

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:52.499 
hips it almost always extract from that
it<00:05:51.279> may<00:05:51.369> be<00:05:51.430> difficult<00:05:51.669> to<00:05:51.939> seen<00:05:52.149> your<00:05:52.269> video

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:52.509 
it may be difficult to seen your video

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:54.239 
it may be difficult to seen your video
reference<00:05:52.869> but<00:05:53.079> you<00:05:53.229> can<00:05:53.409> pretty<00:05:54.159> much

00:05:54.239 --> 00:05:54.249 
reference but you can pretty much

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:55.889 
reference but you can pretty much
guarantee<00:05:54.579> what<00:05:54.999> the<00:05:55.119> shoulders<00:05:55.479> are<00:05:55.629> doing

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:55.899 
guarantee what the shoulders are doing

00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:58.499 
guarantee what the shoulders are doing
and<00:05:56.229> what<00:05:56.379> the<00:05:56.469> horse<00:05:56.709> is<00:05:56.860> doing<00:05:57.009> rather<00:05:57.509> it's

00:05:58.499 --> 00:05:58.509 
and what the horse is doing rather it's

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:00.540 
and what the horse is doing rather it's
doing<00:05:58.719> the<00:05:58.809> opposite<00:05:59.409> of<00:05:59.589> what<00:05:59.919> the<00:06:00.159> hips<00:06:00.339> are

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
doing the opposite of what the hips are

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.869 
doing the opposite of what the hips are
and<00:06:00.849> that<00:06:01.629> is<00:06:01.869> deduce<00:06:02.680> from<00:06:02.889> the<00:06:03.339> line<00:06:03.669> of

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:03.879 
and that is deduce from the line of

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:05.339 
and that is deduce from the line of
action<00:06:04.209> right<00:06:04.389> so<00:06:04.599> if<00:06:04.689> I<00:06:04.809> got<00:06:04.959> this<00:06:05.050> curve

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:05.349 
action right so if I got this curve

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:06.209 
action right so if I got this curve
through<00:06:05.559> the<00:06:05.619> spine

00:06:06.209 --> 00:06:06.219 
through the spine

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:07.920 
through the spine
you<00:06:06.639> can<00:06:06.789> find<00:06:06.999> out<00:06:07.089> what<00:06:07.180> the<00:06:07.300> hips<00:06:07.479> are<00:06:07.659> doing

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
you can find out what the hips are doing

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.809 
you can find out what the hips are doing
I<00:06:08.110> can<00:06:08.439> do<00:06:08.559> find<00:06:08.979> out<00:06:09.099> with<00:06:09.279> the<00:06:09.430> shoulders<00:06:09.729> to

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:09.819 
I can do find out with the shoulders to

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:11.489 
I can do find out with the shoulders to
do<00:06:09.939> so<00:06:10.629> there's<00:06:10.809> many<00:06:10.959> different<00:06:11.079> ways<00:06:11.469> to

00:06:11.489 --> 00:06:11.499 
do so there's many different ways to

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:13.109 
do so there's many different ways to
observe<00:06:11.889> video<00:06:12.279> reference<00:06:12.610> and<00:06:12.789> find<00:06:12.999> out

00:06:13.109 --> 00:06:13.119 
observe video reference and find out

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:14.759 
observe video reference and find out
what's<00:06:13.269> going<00:06:13.509> on<00:06:13.599> these<00:06:13.809> things<00:06:13.990> are<00:06:14.169> these

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:14.769 
what's going on these things are these

00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:17.639 
what's going on these things are these
things<00:06:14.979> are<00:06:15.189> key<00:06:15.689> to<00:06:16.689> posing<00:06:17.050> your<00:06:17.199> characters

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:17.649 
things are key to posing your characters

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:21.179 
things are key to posing your characters
I'm<00:06:17.860> determining<00:06:19.349> you<00:06:20.349> know<00:06:20.469> what<00:06:20.829> the<00:06:21.009> angle

00:06:21.179 --> 00:06:21.189 
I'm determining you know what the angle

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:23.519 
I'm determining you know what the angle
of<00:06:21.519> this<00:06:21.669> is<00:06:22.110> determining<00:06:23.110> where<00:06:23.199> the<00:06:23.259> angle

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:23.529 
of this is determining where the angle

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:25.589 
of this is determining where the angle
of<00:06:23.589> that<00:06:23.649> is<00:06:23.979> because<00:06:24.129> that's<00:06:24.459> direct<00:06:25.059> to<00:06:25.569> what

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:25.599 
of that is because that's direct to what

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:27.449 
of that is because that's direct to what
you're<00:06:25.959> doing<00:06:26.139> with<00:06:26.259> your<00:06:26.289> character<00:06:26.829> you're

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:27.459 
you're doing with your character you're

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:29.480 
you're doing with your character you're
rotating<00:06:27.699> these<00:06:28.149> controls<00:06:28.659> so<00:06:28.930> certainly<00:06:29.199> map

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.490 
rotating these controls so certainly map

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:36.329 
rotating these controls so certainly map
based<00:06:30.490> off<00:06:30.669> your<00:06:30.699> video<00:06:31.119> reference<00:06:35.189> you<00:06:36.189> can

00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:36.339 
based off your video reference you can

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:37.679 
based off your video reference you can
look<00:06:36.490> at<00:06:36.610> just<00:06:36.819> the<00:06:36.939> spine<00:06:37.240> if<00:06:37.479> you<00:06:37.599> have

00:06:37.679 --> 00:06:37.689 
look at just the spine if you have

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:39.869 
look at just the spine if you have
trouble<00:06:38.050> like<00:06:38.289> figuring<00:06:39.249> out<00:06:39.309> what<00:06:39.430> the<00:06:39.579> what

00:06:39.869 --> 00:06:39.879 
trouble like figuring out what the what

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:42.569 
trouble like figuring out what the what
the<00:06:39.909> spine<00:06:40.479> is<00:06:40.689> doing<00:06:41.050> you<00:06:41.769> can<00:06:41.800> see<00:06:42.159> that<00:06:42.399> when

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:42.579 
the spine is doing you can see that when

00:06:42.579 --> 00:06:45.239 
the spine is doing you can see that when
he's<00:06:42.759> going<00:06:43.149> up<00:06:43.569> his<00:06:44.349> hips<00:06:44.709> there's

00:06:45.239 --> 00:06:45.249 
he's going up his hips there's

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:48.239 
he's going up his hips there's
nice<00:06:45.459> curvature<00:06:45.759> here<00:06:46.769> but<00:06:47.769> when<00:06:47.919> he<00:06:48.009> drops

00:06:48.239 --> 00:06:48.249 
nice curvature here but when he drops

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:52.169 
nice curvature here but when he drops
down<00:06:48.659> to<00:06:49.659> this<00:06:49.809> pose<00:06:50.139> here<00:06:50.819> we're<00:06:51.819> getting<00:06:52.059> his

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:52.179 
down to this pose here we're getting his

00:06:52.179 --> 00:06:56.939 
down to this pose here we're getting his
opposite<00:06:54.179> reversal<00:06:55.179> in<00:06:55.389> the<00:06:55.599> spine<00:06:55.929> so<00:06:56.709> his

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:56.949 
opposite reversal in the spine so his

00:06:56.949 --> 00:06:59.309 
opposite reversal in the spine so his
spine<00:06:57.279> is<00:06:57.309> doing<00:06:57.819> this<00:06:57.939> a<00:06:58.179> reversal<00:06:59.139> on

00:06:59.309 --> 00:06:59.319 
spine is doing this a reversal on

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:03.089 
spine is doing this a reversal on
certain<00:06:59.979> extremes<00:07:00.989> and<00:07:01.989> you<00:07:02.139> may<00:07:02.259> be<00:07:02.319> may<00:07:02.739> even

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:03.099 
certain extremes and you may be may even

00:07:03.099 --> 00:07:04.589 
certain extremes and you may be may even
observe<00:07:03.429> that<00:07:03.579> a<00:07:03.639> little<00:07:03.999> bit<00:07:04.119> on<00:07:04.239> your<00:07:04.389> walk

00:07:04.589 --> 00:07:04.599 
observe that a little bit on your walk

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:07.229 
observe that a little bit on your walk
may<00:07:04.959> observe<00:07:05.289> some<00:07:05.649> slight<00:07:06.039> kind<00:07:06.579> of<00:07:06.789> rotation

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:07.239 
may observe some slight kind of rotation

00:07:07.239 --> 00:07:09.869 
may observe some slight kind of rotation
of<00:07:07.449> the<00:07:07.599> spine<00:07:07.719> and<00:07:08.049> hits<00:07:08.339> the<00:07:09.339> way<00:07:09.489> his<00:07:09.639> body

00:07:09.869 --> 00:07:09.879 
of the spine and hits the way his body

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:13.109 
of the spine and hits the way his body
is<00:07:10.089> as<00:07:10.329> he's<00:07:10.539> moving<00:07:10.809> forward<00:07:11.819> you<00:07:12.819> know<00:07:12.939> the

00:07:13.109 --> 00:07:13.119 
is as he's moving forward you know the

00:07:13.119 --> 00:07:15.689 
is as he's moving forward you know the
slight<00:07:13.449> change<00:07:13.869> in<00:07:14.079> the<00:07:14.139> slight<00:07:14.979> reversal<00:07:15.579> in

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:15.699 
slight change in the slight reversal in

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:20.850 
slight change in the slight reversal in
this<00:07:15.849> line<00:07:16.119> going<00:07:16.869> wrong<00:07:19.589> you<00:07:20.589> know<00:07:20.679> if<00:07:20.769> you

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:20.860 
this line going wrong you know if you

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.189 
this line going wrong you know if you
want<00:07:21.039> to<00:07:21.099> get<00:07:21.219> super<00:07:21.749> analytical<00:07:22.749> about<00:07:22.989> it

00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 
want to get super analytical about it

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:26.639 
want to get super analytical about it
you<00:07:23.619> can<00:07:23.799> even<00:07:23.979> go<00:07:24.669> so<00:07:24.849> far<00:07:24.879> as<00:07:25.059> to<00:07:25.179> say<00:07:25.649> okay

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:26.649 
you can even go so far as to say okay

00:07:26.649 --> 00:07:27.929 
you can even go so far as to say okay
well<00:07:26.829> here's<00:07:27.099> the<00:07:27.279> low<00:07:27.489> point<00:07:27.759> of<00:07:27.849> the

00:07:27.929 --> 00:07:27.939 
well here's the low point of the

00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:29.489 
well here's the low point of the
character<00:07:28.360> and<00:07:28.539> I'm<00:07:28.599> going<00:07:28.779> to<00:07:28.839> use<00:07:28.989> kind<00:07:29.289> of<00:07:29.409> a

00:07:29.489 --> 00:07:29.499 
character and I'm going to use kind of a

00:07:29.499 --> 00:07:35.939 
character and I'm going to use kind of a
belt<00:07:29.829> buckle<00:07:30.099> as<00:07:30.339> the<00:07:30.519> mark<00:07:30.759> for<00:07:30.939> that<00:07:34.949> here's

00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:35.949 
belt buckle as the mark for that here's

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:39.389 
belt buckle as the mark for that here's
the<00:07:36.129> high<00:07:36.339> point<00:07:37.349> it<00:07:38.349> was<00:07:38.499> the<00:07:38.769> low<00:07:39.069> point<00:07:39.309> was

00:07:39.389 --> 00:07:39.399 
the high point it was the low point was

00:07:39.399 --> 00:07:43.019 
the high point it was the low point was
there<00:07:39.639> here's<00:07:39.879> the<00:07:39.999> high<00:07:40.179> point<00:07:41.759> yeah<00:07:42.759> that's

00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:43.029 
there here's the high point yeah that's

00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:46.499 
there here's the high point yeah that's
that's<00:07:43.929> about<00:07:44.139> a<00:07:44.259> character's<00:07:44.799> head<00:07:45.509> distance

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:46.509 
that's about a character's head distance

00:07:46.509 --> 00:07:49.559 
that's about a character's head distance
and<00:07:47.199> height<00:07:47.469> you<00:07:48.399> know<00:07:48.519> based<00:07:49.239> on<00:07:49.360> his

00:07:49.559 --> 00:07:49.569 
and height you know based on his

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:52.859 
and height you know based on his
proportions<00:07:51.149> so<00:07:52.149> you<00:07:52.209> go<00:07:52.419> in<00:07:52.599> there<00:07:52.809> and

00:07:52.859 --> 00:07:52.869 
proportions so you go in there and

00:07:52.869 --> 00:07:55.469 
proportions so you go in there and
you're<00:07:52.959> like<00:07:53.079> okay<00:07:53.529> well<00:07:53.789> that<00:07:54.789> distance<00:07:55.299> in

00:07:55.469 --> 00:07:55.479 
you're like okay well that distance in

00:07:55.479 --> 00:07:57.419 
you're like okay well that distance in
Mayas<00:07:55.899> probably<00:07:56.409> about<00:07:56.529> that<00:07:56.709> much<00:07:56.769> I'm

00:07:57.419 --> 00:07:57.429 
Mayas probably about that much I'm

00:07:57.429 --> 00:07:59.039 
Mayas probably about that much I'm
making<00:07:57.549> those<00:07:57.819> kinds<00:07:58.149> of<00:07:58.209> observations<00:07:58.539> the

00:07:59.039 --> 00:07:59.049 
making those kinds of observations the

00:07:59.049 --> 00:08:02.189 
making those kinds of observations the
amount<00:07:59.229> of<00:07:59.289> distance<00:07:59.649> traveled
