00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:09.820
 good 

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:09.820
 we found ourselves doing a pc and of 307 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:15.060
 the valid 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.480
 j 0 2 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:24.580
 this time if you have a 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:30.070
 95 160 what they usually do is 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:35.130
 cut the cut all here 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.130
 and then the sole to lift the info 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.970
 it is not necessary to do that if we 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.670
 here we made a connection ado 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:50.100
 The circuit 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:53.030
 then we came to the magnifying glass adapter 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.579
 with the cables 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.579
 in this case I'm with the 1.3 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:08.810
 and select 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.940
 95 160 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.850
 and here I have the reading 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:19.370
 I'm going to give you one more time to read so that 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.030
 see that the connection works 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.030
 and I give him to read 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.420
 and here I have 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.720
 this information then let's see how 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.270
 we process it 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:44.610
 and what are we going to do with this old 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:49.040
 so then 307 and valid j 0 2 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.040
 here we have a magnifying glass 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:59.950
 socket and we have here 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.950
 and connection in circuit 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.149
 for more information you can 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.679
 be communicating on our website 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:14.030
 what is www punto electronica martÃ­n 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:18.420
 dot com.ar or to the numbers 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:21.260
 telephone numbers that are in our 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.260
