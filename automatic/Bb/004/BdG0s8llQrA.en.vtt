00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
few people realize that concrete making

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.550 
few people realize that concrete making
it<00:00:04.589> and<00:00:04.799> using<00:00:05.310> it<00:00:05.430> is<00:00:06.410> responsible<00:00:07.410> for

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
it and using it is responsible for

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.030 
it and using it is responsible for
around<00:00:08.069> seven<00:00:08.760> percent<00:00:08.790> of<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.690> entire

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:10.040 
around seven percent of the entire

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.680 
around seven percent of the entire
global<00:00:11.040> emissions<00:00:11.280> of<00:00:11.670> carbon<00:00:11.880> dioxide<00:00:12.660> every

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
global emissions of carbon dioxide every

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.160 
global emissions of carbon dioxide every
year<00:00:13.019> that's<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.920> shocking<00:00:14.190> fact<00:00:14.900> around<00:00:15.900> half

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
year that's a shocking fact around half

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.439 
year that's a shocking fact around half
of<00:00:16.350> that<00:00:16.500> is<00:00:16.740> because<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.640> huge<00:00:18.000> amount<00:00:18.330> of

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
of that is because of a huge amount of

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.779 
of that is because of a huge amount of
heat<00:00:18.720> that<00:00:19.020> are<00:00:19.470> required<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:20.070> actually<00:00:20.430> make

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
heat that are required to actually make

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.689 
heat that are required to actually make
cement<00:00:21.240> in<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.539> first<00:00:21.779> place<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.519> the<00:00:23.519> other

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
cement in the first place and the other

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.390 
cement in the first place and the other
half<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.269> carbon<00:00:25.230> dioxide<00:00:25.740> that's<00:00:25.949> released

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
half is carbon dioxide that's released

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.089 
half is carbon dioxide that's released
as<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.670> result<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.960> very<00:00:28.109> useful<00:00:28.410> chemical

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
as a result of a very useful chemical

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.620 
as a result of a very useful chemical
reaction<00:00:29.519> when<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.699> add<00:00:29.939> water<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.599> mix

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
reaction when you add water to the mix

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.799 
reaction when you add water to the mix
and<00:00:31.550> all<00:00:32.550> kinds<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:32.940> amazing<00:00:33.120> things<00:00:33.510> happen

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
and all kinds of amazing things happen

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.520 
and all kinds of amazing things happen
and<00:00:33.930> then<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.440> concrete<00:00:34.649> says<00:00:36.170> so<00:00:37.170> what<00:00:37.380> can

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
and then the concrete says so what can

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.830 
and then the concrete says so what can
be<00:00:37.649> done<00:00:37.800> about<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.760> reason<00:00:38.969> why<00:00:39.300> seven

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
be done about it the reason why seven

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.270 
be done about it the reason why seven
percent<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.559> world<00:00:40.739> emissions<00:00:41.190> is

percent of the world emissions is

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.970 
percent of the world emissions is
concrete<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:42.329> because<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.350> much<00:00:43.500> building

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
concrete it's because so much building

well<00:01:12.590> so<00:01:13.590> what<00:01:13.890> can<00:01:14.040> be<00:01:14.100> done<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.640> reduce<00:01:14.760> this

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
well so what can be done to reduce this

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.130 
well so what can be done to reduce this
but<00:01:16.890> it's<00:01:17.009> very<00:01:17.159> interesting<00:01:17.869> research<00:01:18.869> been

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
but it's very interesting research been

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.380 
but it's very interesting research been
done<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.530> Australia<00:01:19.680> shows<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:21.000> we<00:01:21.180> can

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
done in Australia shows that we can

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.679 
done in Australia shows that we can

it becomes a new form of Crete the big

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.350 
it becomes a new form of Crete the big
question<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.350> how<00:01:49.680> stable<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:51.149> that's

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
question is how stable it is and that's

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.200 
question is how stable it is and that's
a<00:01:51.600> challenge<00:01:51.869> because<00:01:52.229> we<00:01:52.409> don't<00:01:52.710> really<00:01:52.890> know

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
a challenge because we don't really know

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.969 
a challenge because we don't really know
it's<00:01:54.210> all<00:01:54.390> very<00:01:54.630> well<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.110> say<00:01:55.170> oh<00:01:55.350> yes<00:01:55.710> we'll

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
mix this new heat grease and we'll use

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.539 
mix this new heat grease and we'll use
it<00:01:57.630> for<00:01:57.810> our<00:01:57.930> bridge<00:01:58.200> but<00:01:59.070> if<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.310> bridge

time that's not so smart and it will
take<00:02:04.409> us<00:02:04.439> some<00:02:04.950> years<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.640> know<00:02:05.909> what<00:02:06.600> the

take us some years to know what the

resilience is of these new kinds of

resilience is of these new kinds of
concrete<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.690> be<00:02:09.810> sure<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.379> we<00:02:10.470> can<00:02:10.619> you

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
concrete and to be sure that we can you

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.180 
concrete and to be sure that we can you
in<00:02:11.270> very<00:02:11.960> sensitive<00:02:12.530> structures<00:02:13.010> where

in very sensitive structures where

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.160 
in very sensitive structures where
long-term<00:02:13.790> strength<00:02:14.150> is<00:02:14.360> absolutely

long-term strength is absolutely

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.090 
long-term strength is absolutely
critical<00:02:16.030> but<00:02:17.030> I<00:02:17.270> would<00:02:17.870> say<00:02:18.080> that<00:02:18.680> we<00:02:18.860> will

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
critical but I would say that we will

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.360 
critical but I would say that we will
see<00:02:19.480> radical<00:02:20.480> forms<00:02:20.810> of<00:02:20.930> new<00:02:21.050> concrete<00:02:21.470> we

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
see radical forms of new concrete we

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.310 
see radical forms of new concrete we
will<00:02:22.580> see<00:02:22.790> all<00:02:23.030> kinds<00:02:23.420> of<00:02:23.510> innovations<00:02:24.050> in<00:02:24.170> the

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320

will see all kinds of innovations in the
construction<00:02:24.950> industry<00:02:25.240> which<00:02:26.240> will<00:02:26.450> perhaps

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
construction industry which will perhaps

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.110 
construction industry which will perhaps
have<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.800> amount<00:02:28.070> of<00:02:28.190> energy<00:02:28.370> needed<00:02:28.790> to

have the amount of energy needed to

have the amount of energy needed to
produce<00:02:29.600> a<00:02:30.080> ton<00:02:30.290> of<00:02:30.350> concrete<00:02:30.620> at<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.130> moment

produce a ton of concrete at the moment
it's<00:02:31.580> one<00:02:31.790> ton<00:02:32.000> of<00:02:32.030> carbon<00:02:32.480> for<00:02:33.110> one<00:02:33.230> ton<00:02:33.440> of

it's one ton of carbon for one ton of
