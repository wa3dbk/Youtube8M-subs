sewing machine the timing of the zigzag
the<00:00:24.810> needle<00:00:25.109> going<00:00:25.260> down<00:00:25.500> on<00:00:25.650> each<00:00:25.859> side<00:00:25.890> was

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
the needle going down on each side was

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.370 
the needle going down on each side was
off<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.710> now<00:00:28.710> I've<00:00:28.890> got<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:30.260> when<00:00:31.260> the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
off and now I've got it so when the

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.920 
off and now I've got it so when the
needle<00:00:31.650> pierces<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.130> fabric<00:00:32.669> it's<00:00:33.360> out<00:00:33.899> on

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
needle pierces the fabric it's out on

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.819 
needle pierces the fabric it's out on
each<00:00:34.290> edge<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.950> as<00:00:35.940> time<00:00:36.180> properly<00:00:36.710> but<00:00:37.710> when

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
each edge and as time properly but when

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.610 
each edge and as time properly but when
I<00:00:37.860> initially<00:00:38.100> got<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.700> out<00:00:39.230> later<00:00:40.230> on<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:40.530> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
I initially got it out later on in the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.549 
I initially got it out later on in the
video<00:00:40.739> I'll<00:00:41.070> show<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.489> how<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:42.000> used<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.450> be

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
video I'll show you how it used to be

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:49.130 
video I'll show you how it used to be
but<00:00:43.559> if<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.800> look<00:00:43.980> now<00:00:45.410> the<00:00:46.410> needle<00:00:48.140> switches

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
but if you look now the needle switches

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.319 
but if you look now the needle switches
when<00:00:50.039> it's<00:00:50.160> at<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.399> highest<00:00:50.579> position<00:00:50.850> from

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
when it's at the highest position from

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.439 
when it's at the highest position from
side<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.600> side<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.850> when<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:53.879> first<00:00:54.090> got<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
side to side and when I first got the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.500 
side to side and when I first got the
machine<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:55.140> needle<00:00:55.469> was<00:00:55.820> switching<00:00:56.820> as<00:00:57.239> it

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
machine the needle was switching as it

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.099 
machine the needle was switching as it
was<00:00:57.770> down<00:00:59.329> piercing<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.449> fabric<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.960> would

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
was down piercing the fabric it would

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.529 
was down piercing the fabric it would
move<00:01:01.320> from<00:01:01.530> from<00:01:02.039> one<00:01:02.219> side<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.609> other<00:01:02.699> so

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
move from from one side to the other so

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.030 
move from from one side to the other so
the<00:01:03.660> timing<00:01:03.989> was<00:01:04.019> off<00:01:04.290> on<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:04.799> I'm<00:01:04.890> going

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
the timing was off on that so I'm going

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.700 
the timing was off on that so I'm going
to<00:01:05.159> show<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.369> how<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:06.080> reset<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.200> timing<00:01:07.590> on

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
to show you how to reset the timing on

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.370 
to show you how to reset the timing on
one<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.280> these<00:01:08.400> machines

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.039 

so<00:01:13.070> I'll<00:01:13.430> show<00:01:13.670> you<00:01:13.729> now<00:01:14.030> that<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:14.570> timing

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
so I'll show you now that the timing

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.499 
so I'll show you now that the timing
between<00:01:16.039> the<00:01:16.610> swing<00:01:16.909> of<00:01:17.149> the<00:01:17.210> needle

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
between the swing of the needle

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.910 
between the swing of the needle
side-to-side<00:01:18.110> is<00:01:18.680> not<00:01:19.520> correct<00:01:20.560> and<00:01:21.560> I'll<00:01:21.710> go

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
side-to-side is not correct and I'll go

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.480 
side-to-side is not correct and I'll go
slowly<00:01:23.350> see<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.380> needle<00:01:24.770> is<00:01:24.860> just<00:01:25.100> now<00:01:25.220> coming

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
slowly see the needle is just now coming

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.880 
slowly see the needle is just now coming
down<00:01:25.820> and<00:01:26.210> it<00:01:26.659> should<00:01:26.689> go<00:01:27.049> down<00:01:27.259> and<00:01:27.530> stay<00:01:27.740> in

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
down and it should go down and stay in

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.880 
down and it should go down and stay in
the<00:01:28.759> right<00:01:28.970> side<00:01:29.390> position<00:01:29.630> while<00:01:30.560> it's<00:01:30.770> all

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
the right side position while it's all

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.160 
the right side position while it's all
the<00:01:31.009> way<00:01:31.130> down<00:01:31.310> and<00:01:31.520> then<00:01:31.640> back<00:01:31.789> up<00:01:32.000> again<00:01:32.170> but

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
the way down and then back up again but

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.669 
the way down and then back up again but
if<00:01:33.259> you<00:01:33.350> look<00:01:33.530> at<00:01:33.679> it<00:01:33.799> now<00:01:33.979> it<00:01:34.429> goes<00:01:34.640> down<00:01:34.970> and

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679 
if you look at it now it goes down and

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:41.169 
if you look at it now it goes down and
swings<00:01:36.679> to<00:01:37.069> the<00:01:37.130> side<00:01:37.720> comes<00:01:38.720> back<00:01:38.990> up<00:01:40.179> goes

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
swings to the side comes back up goes

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:43.510 
swings to the side comes back up goes
down<00:01:41.539> swings<00:01:42.200> over<00:01:42.530> to<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.890> other<00:01:42.979> side<00:01:43.280> and

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
down swings over to the other side and

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.210 
down swings over to the other side and
comes<00:01:43.700> back<00:01:43.939> up<00:01:44.409> so<00:01:45.409> as<00:01:45.530> you<00:01:45.649> can<00:01:45.770> see<00:01:46.009> the

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
comes back up so as you can see the

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.419 
comes back up so as you can see the
timing<00:01:46.670> is<00:01:46.819> very<00:01:47.539> off<00:01:47.840> on<00:01:48.110> this<00:01:48.289> if<00:01:48.530> you<00:01:49.280> can

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
timing is very off on this if you can

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:52.179 
timing is very off on this if you can
picture<00:01:50.229> the<00:01:51.229> needle<00:01:51.590> going<00:01:51.770> through

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
picture the needle going through

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.969 
picture the needle going through
something<00:01:55.240> it<00:01:56.240> goes<00:01:56.479> down<00:01:56.840> and<00:01:57.200> it's<00:01:57.709> supposed

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
something it goes down and it's supposed

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.249 
something it goes down and it's supposed
to<00:01:58.099> go<00:01:58.280> down<00:01:58.459> a<00:01:58.490> stay<00:01:58.880> in<00:01:59.149> the<00:01:59.209> position<00:02:00.020> that

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
to go down a stay in the position that

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.679 
to go down a stay in the position that
it's<00:02:00.439> at<00:02:00.640> and<00:02:01.640> then<00:02:01.819> come<00:02:02.030> back<00:02:02.060> up<00:02:02.240> in<00:02:02.569> that

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
it's at and then come back up in that

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.080 
it's at and then come back up in that
same<00:02:02.899> position<00:02:03.080> but<00:02:03.890> it's<00:02:04.039> coming<00:02:04.369> down<00:02:04.579> and

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
same position but it's coming down and

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.259 
same position but it's coming down and
you<00:02:05.689> can<00:02:05.840> see<00:02:06.020> it's<00:02:06.140> dragging<00:02:06.789> this<00:02:07.789> piece<00:02:08.119> of

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
you can see it's dragging this piece of

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.620 
you can see it's dragging this piece of
cloth<00:02:08.479> over<00:02:09.079> to<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.590> side<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:11.000> left<00:02:11.180> side<00:02:11.299> and

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
cloth over to the side the left side and

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.960 
cloth over to the side the left side and
then<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:11.870> needles<00:02:12.200> coming<00:02:12.500> back<00:02:12.650> up<00:02:12.970> heel

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
then the needles coming back up heel

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.390 
then the needles coming back up heel
goes<00:02:14.269> in<00:02:14.660> drags<00:02:15.260> it<00:02:15.470> over<00:02:15.680> to<00:02:15.829> the<00:02:15.950> right<00:02:16.130> side

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
goes in drags it over to the right side

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.759 
goes in drags it over to the right side
and<00:02:16.670> comes<00:02:16.850> back<00:02:17.060> up<00:02:17.090> so<00:02:17.989> the<00:02:18.200> timing<00:02:18.560> of<00:02:18.620> this

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
and comes back up so the timing of this

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.610 
and comes back up so the timing of this
needle<00:02:19.130> is<00:02:19.310> is<00:02:19.640> off<00:02:20.049> in<00:02:21.049> relation<00:02:21.590> to

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
needle is is off in relation to

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.500 
needle is is off in relation to
everything<00:02:21.829> else<00:02:22.310> so<00:02:22.549> that's<00:02:23.209> what<00:02:23.390> we're

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
everything else so that's what we're

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.900 
everything else so that's what we're
going<00:02:23.690> to<00:02:23.750> do<00:02:23.930> in<00:02:24.049> this<00:02:24.170> video<00:02:24.650> is<00:02:24.890> show<00:02:25.850> you

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
going to do in this video is show you

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.480 
going to do in this video is show you
how<00:02:26.030> to<00:02:26.180> correct<00:02:26.480> timing

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.550 

okay<00:02:33.300> now<00:02:33.510> we're<00:02:33.660> at<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.840> top<00:02:33.870> of<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.230> Machine

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
okay now we're at the top of the Machine

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.980 
okay now we're at the top of the Machine
and<00:02:34.710> here's<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.880> cam<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:37.130> this<00:02:38.130> is<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.990> swing

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
and here's the cam and this is the swing

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.500 
and here's the cam and this is the swing
mechanism<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:41.010> controls<00:02:41.520> the<00:02:42.210> needle

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
mechanism that controls the needle

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.040 
mechanism that controls the needle
position<00:02:46.190> so<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.220> get<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.580> cam<00:02:47.790> out<00:02:47.820> we<00:02:48.690> put

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
position so to get the cam out we put

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.890 
position so to get the cam out we put
the<00:02:49.230> we<00:02:50.040> set<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.460> zigzag<00:02:50.880> width<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.330> zero<00:02:51.600> and

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
the we set the zigzag width to zero and

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.800 
the we set the zigzag width to zero and
that<00:02:52.710> takes<00:02:52.980> attention<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.790> this<00:02:54.150> lever<00:02:54.480> off

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
that takes attention of this lever off

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.470 
that takes attention of this lever off
of<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.320> cam<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:55.980> then<00:02:56.640> we<00:02:56.850> can<00:02:57.000> just<00:02:57.090> pop<00:02:57.270> the

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
of the cam and then we can just pop the

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.950 
of the cam and then we can just pop the
cam<00:02:57.660> out<00:02:58.670> next<00:02:59.670> thing<00:02:59.940> to<00:03:00.060> do<00:03:00.210> is<00:03:00.240> to<00:03:00.540> take<00:03:00.720> off

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
cam out next thing to do is to take off

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.050 
cam out next thing to do is to take off
this<00:03:01.200> top<00:03:01.370> stud<00:03:02.480> which<00:03:03.480> holds<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.880> this<00:03:05.880> is

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
this top stud which holds the this is

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.000 
this top stud which holds the this is
the<00:03:06.240> spring<00:03:06.630> this<00:03:07.230> part<00:03:07.500> that's<00:03:07.620> spinning

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
the spring this part that's spinning

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.220 
the spring this part that's spinning
around<00:03:08.100> is<00:03:08.400> just<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.730> loose<00:03:08.880> spring<00:03:09.150> but<00:03:09.450> it<00:03:09.540> it

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
around is just a loose spring but it it

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.930 
around is just a loose spring but it it
holds<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.650> cam<00:03:10.860> in<00:03:11.010> position<00:03:11.460> when<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.760> cam

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
holds the cam in position when the cam

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.610 
holds the cam in position when the cam
is<00:03:12.150> snapped<00:03:12.540> into<00:03:12.780> plate<00:03:15.020> so<00:03:16.020> I've<00:03:16.260> already

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
is snapped into plate so I've already

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.080 
is snapped into plate so I've already
loosened<00:03:16.770> up<00:03:16.980> with<00:03:17.130> a<00:03:17.160> screwdriver<00:03:17.460> so<00:03:17.940> it's

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
loosened up with a screwdriver so it's

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.750 
loosened up with a screwdriver so it's
only<00:03:18.210> finger<00:03:18.570> tight<00:03:20.030> take<00:03:21.030> that<00:03:21.240> off<00:03:22.760> being

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
only finger tight take that off being

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.220 
only finger tight take that off being
careful<00:03:24.120> not<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.300> drop<00:03:24.540> anything<00:03:24.840> into<00:03:25.140> the

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
careful not to drop anything into the

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.510 
careful not to drop anything into the
bottom<00:03:25.530> of<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.710> machine<00:03:26.070> and<00:03:27.290> now<00:03:28.520> we're

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
bottom of the machine and now we're

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.840 
bottom of the machine and now we're
exposed<00:03:29.970> our<00:03:30.390> three<00:03:30.930> slots<00:03:31.260> on<00:03:31.580> this<00:03:32.580> steel

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
exposed our three slots on this steel

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.000 
exposed our three slots on this steel
piece<00:03:33.120> on<00:03:33.390> top<00:03:34.430> inside<00:03:35.430> those<00:03:35.700> three<00:03:35.940> slots

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
piece on top inside those three slots

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.890 
piece on top inside those three slots
they<00:03:38.010> just<00:03:38.400> happen<00:03:38.760> to<00:03:38.790> line<00:03:39.000> up<00:03:39.150> right<00:03:39.360> now<00:03:39.570> is

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
they just happen to line up right now is

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.290 
they just happen to line up right now is
three<00:03:40.290> screw<00:03:40.560> heads<00:03:41.090> but<00:03:42.090> those<00:03:42.630> screw<00:03:42.960> heads

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
three screw heads but those screw heads

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.920 
three screw heads but those screw heads
may<00:03:45.300> be<00:03:45.360> underneath<00:03:47.300> this<00:03:48.300> part<00:03:48.630> where<00:03:48.810> you

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
may be underneath this part where you

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.100 
may be underneath this part where you
just<00:03:49.110> need<00:03:49.320> to<00:03:49.550> spin<00:03:50.550> this<00:03:50.670> around<00:03:50.850> until<00:03:51.450> the

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
just need to spin this around until the

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.290 
just need to spin this around until the
screws<00:03:52.440> appear<00:03:53.270> under<00:03:54.270> those<00:03:54.420> thoughts<00:03:56.300> so

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
screws appear under those thoughts so

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.530 
screws appear under those thoughts so
once<00:03:57.510> that<00:03:57.630> happens<00:03:58.760> you<00:03:59.760> take<00:04:00.000> a<00:04:00.030> screwdriver

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
once that happens you take a screwdriver

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:14.230 
once that happens you take a screwdriver
and<00:04:00.960> loosen<00:04:01.710> those<00:04:02.100> three<00:04:02.520> screws

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.240 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.350 

now<00:04:14.780> by<00:04:14.990> loosening<00:04:15.320> those<00:04:15.620> now<00:04:16.040> this<00:04:16.400> tab<00:04:17.030> that

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:17.360 
now by loosening those now this tab that

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.180 
now by loosening those now this tab that
pokes<00:04:17.720> up<00:04:17.930> into<00:04:18.170> the<00:04:18.290> cam<00:04:18.530> is<00:04:19.810> free<00:04:20.810> to<00:04:21.190> swivel

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
pokes up into the cam is free to swivel

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.670 
pokes up into the cam is free to swivel
around<00:04:25.630> once<00:04:26.630> we<00:04:26.810> have<00:04:26.960> the<00:04:27.110> three<00:04:27.350> screws

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
around once we have the three screws

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.220 
around once we have the three screws
loosened<00:04:28.130> up<00:04:28.280> enough<00:04:28.580> that<00:04:28.820> this<00:04:29.030> can<00:04:29.390> spin

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230 
loosened up enough that this can spin

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:40.360 
loosened up enough that this can spin
around<00:04:31.720> we<00:04:33.730> pop<00:04:34.730> the<00:04:35.000> cam<00:04:35.210> back<00:04:35.450> on<00:04:39.310> now<00:04:40.310> the

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
around we pop the cam back on now the

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.890 
around we pop the cam back on now the
needles<00:04:40.880> at<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.150> bottom<00:04:41.420> of<00:04:41.930> its<00:04:42.140> stroke<00:04:42.470> and

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
needles at the bottom of its stroke and

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.310 
needles at the bottom of its stroke and
at<00:04:44.900> that<00:04:45.140> point<00:04:45.470> the<00:04:46.010> timing<00:04:46.490> mark<00:04:47.080> needs<00:04:48.080> to

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
at that point the timing mark needs to

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.450 
at that point the timing mark needs to
line<00:04:48.560> up<00:04:48.770> with<00:04:49.600> the<00:04:50.600> zigzag<00:04:50.900> lever<00:04:51.460> right

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
line up with the zigzag lever right

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.860 
line up with the zigzag lever right
there<00:04:53.980> so<00:04:54.980> if<00:04:55.160> you<00:04:55.310> can<00:04:55.490> see<00:04:55.730> that<00:04:56.000> here's<00:04:56.660> the

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
there so if you can see that here's the

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.390 
there so if you can see that here's the
timing<00:04:57.230> mark<00:04:57.440> on<00:04:57.650> the<00:04:57.940> zigzag<00:04:58.940> cam<00:04:59.240> and<00:05:00.400> this

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
timing mark on the zigzag cam and this

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.130 
timing mark on the zigzag cam and this
is<00:05:01.610> the<00:05:01.910> zig<00:05:02.150> zag<00:05:02.420> lever<00:05:02.750> with<00:05:03.440> a<00:05:03.470> little

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
is the zig zag lever with a little

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:11.980 
is the zig zag lever with a little
indicator<00:05:06.140> on<00:05:06.380> the<00:05:06.500> end<00:05:06.620> of<00:05:06.680> that<00:05:10.570> now<00:05:11.570> we<00:05:11.630> get

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
indicator on the end of that now we get

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.540 
indicator on the end of that now we get
those<00:05:12.200> exactly<00:05:12.830> lined<00:05:13.070> up<00:05:13.310> take<00:05:14.120> the<00:05:14.270> cam<00:05:14.510> off

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
those exactly lined up take the cam off

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:28.960 
those exactly lined up take the cam off
tighten<00:05:16.550> the<00:05:16.640> screws<00:05:17.000> back<00:05:17.270> up

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.900 

and<00:05:29.630> then<00:05:29.900> we<00:05:30.050> put<00:05:30.320> it<00:05:30.410> back<00:05:30.440> together<00:05:30.740> and<00:05:31.010> see

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
and then we put it back together and see

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.350 
and then we put it back together and see
how<00:05:32.120> well<00:05:32.360> it<00:05:32.390> works<00:05:33.610> put<00:05:34.610> a<00:05:34.730> little<00:05:34.940> spring

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
how well it works put a little spring

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.900 
how well it works put a little spring
and<00:05:35.630> screw<00:05:36.320> back<00:05:36.500> down<00:05:36.770> on<00:05:36.920> top<00:05:38.830> snap<00:05:39.830> the<00:05:40.190> cam

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
and screw back down on top snap the cam

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:47.180 
and screw back down on top snap the cam
back<00:05:41.120> in<00:05:41.330> place

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:53.030 

let's<00:05:47.610> dig<00:05:47.880> zag<00:05:48.180> back<00:05:48.540> to<00:05:48.870> maximum<00:05:51.110> and<00:05:52.110> then

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.040 
let's dig zag back to maximum and then

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.490 
let's dig zag back to maximum and then
we<00:05:53.340> watch<00:05:53.940> the<00:05:53.970> needle<00:05:54.450> to<00:05:54.930> see<00:05:55.590> how<00:05:55.830> it<00:05:55.980> reacts

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
we watch the needle to see how it reacts

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.110 
we watch the needle to see how it reacts
so<00:05:58.500> the<00:05:58.680> needle<00:05:59.010> is<00:05:59.190> all<00:05:59.610> the<00:05:59.790> way<00:05:59.880> to<00:05:59.940> the

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
so the needle is all the way to the

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.750 
so the needle is all the way to the
right<00:06:00.300> side<00:06:00.570> it's<00:06:01.350> coming<00:06:01.560> down<00:06:01.950> and<00:06:02.520> it

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 
right side it's coming down and it

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:09.620 
right side it's coming down and it
pierces<00:06:03.620> comes<00:06:04.620> up<00:06:05.130> and<00:06:06.320> it<00:06:07.320> is<00:06:08.100> clear<00:06:08.670> of<00:06:08.910> the

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
pierces comes up and it is clear of the

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.600 
pierces comes up and it is clear of the
fabric<00:06:10.050> before<00:06:10.230> it<00:06:10.530> starts<00:06:10.800> transition<00:06:11.460> to

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
fabric before it starts transition to

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.560 
fabric before it starts transition to
the<00:06:11.730> other<00:06:11.760> side<00:06:13.580> and<00:06:14.580> now<00:06:15.060> it's<00:06:15.210> all<00:06:15.360> the<00:06:15.480> way

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:15.570 
the other side and now it's all the way

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:24.439 
the other side and now it's all the way
to<00:06:15.630> the<00:06:15.810> left<00:06:15.960> side<00:06:17.150> and<00:06:18.470> then<00:06:19.470> it<00:06:19.650> pierces

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:24.449 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:27.239 

and<00:06:25.449> then<00:06:25.929> it<00:06:26.080> comes<00:06:26.349> up<00:06:26.589> again

00:06:27.239 --> 00:06:27.249 
and then it comes up again

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:30.479 
and then it comes up again
and<00:06:28.169> then<00:06:29.169> it<00:06:29.259> transitions<00:06:29.709> over<00:06:30.069> to<00:06:30.369> the

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:30.489 
and then it transitions over to the

00:06:30.489 --> 00:06:34.919 
and then it transitions over to the
right<00:06:31.229> goes<00:06:32.229> down<00:06:32.559> thumbs<00:06:33.550> up<00:06:33.849> transitions<00:06:34.749> to

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:34.929 
right goes down thumbs up transitions to

00:06:34.929 --> 00:06:38.600 
right goes down thumbs up transitions to
the<00:06:34.959> left<00:06:35.229> and<00:06:35.559> so<00:06:36.279> now<00:06:36.459> our<00:06:36.599> zigzag<00:06:37.599> timing<00:06:38.110> is

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
the left and so now our zigzag timing is

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:51.329 
the left and so now our zigzag timing is
correct<00:06:39.610> again<00:06:49.649> you<00:06:50.649> look<00:06:50.800> for<00:06:51.039> the<00:06:51.099> three

00:06:51.329 --> 00:06:51.339 
correct again you look for the three

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:56.279 
correct again you look for the three
slots<00:06:51.809> underneath<00:06:52.809> this<00:06:53.789> screw<00:06:54.789> here<00:06:55.059> and<00:06:55.289> you

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:56.289 
slots underneath this screw here and you

00:06:56.289 --> 00:06:58.919 
slots underneath this screw here and you
just<00:06:56.469> loosen<00:06:56.769> those<00:06:56.889> three<00:06:57.189> screws<00:06:57.749> spin<00:06:58.749> this

00:06:58.919 --> 00:06:58.929 
just loosen those three screws spin this

00:06:58.929 --> 00:07:00.839 
just loosen those three screws spin this
around<00:06:59.139> with<00:06:59.529> the<00:06:59.649> cam<00:06:59.889> on<00:07:00.099> it<00:07:00.249> until<00:07:00.519> the

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:00.849 
around with the cam on it until the

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:03.540 
around with the cam on it until the
timing<00:07:01.089> timing<00:07:01.899> marks<00:07:02.319> line<00:07:02.529> up<00:07:02.559> tighten<00:07:03.429> it

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:03.550 
timing timing marks line up tighten it

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:08.159 
timing timing marks line up tighten it
back<00:07:03.669> down<00:07:03.729> and<00:07:04.179> then<00:07:04.509> check<00:07:04.839> your<00:07:05.129> timing<00:07:07.169> so

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:08.169 
back down and then check your timing so

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:11.699 
back down and then check your timing so
thank<00:07:08.499> you<00:07:08.679> for<00:07:09.009> watching<00:07:09.459> this<00:07:09.550> video
