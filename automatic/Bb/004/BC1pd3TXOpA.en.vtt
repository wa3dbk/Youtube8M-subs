00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:06.610 
my husband and I sought treatment with

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.970 
my husband and I sought treatment with
dr.<00:00:06.640> Kaufmann<00:00:07.330> after<00:00:07.750> we<00:00:07.900> had<00:00:08.139> been<00:00:08.169> trying<00:00:08.830> to

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:08.980 
dr. Kaufmann after we had been trying to

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.539 
dr. Kaufmann after we had been trying to
conceive<00:00:09.429> a<00:00:10.330> child<00:00:10.570> for<00:00:11.349> about<00:00:11.679> a<00:00:11.709> year<00:00:12.129> a<00:00:12.219> big

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:12.549 
conceive a child for about a year a big

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:14.009 
conceive a child for about a year a big
question<00:00:12.879> we<00:00:12.999> always<00:00:13.209> get<00:00:13.360> is<00:00:13.570> when<00:00:13.780> should<00:00:13.959> I

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:14.019 
question we always get is when should I

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:15.810 
question we always get is when should I
seek<00:00:14.259> fertility<00:00:14.679> care<00:00:14.889> and<00:00:15.129> there<00:00:15.730> are<00:00:15.789> a

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820 
seek fertility care and there are a

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.460 
seek fertility care and there are a
number<00:00:15.849> of<00:00:16.030> variables<00:00:16.539> the<00:00:16.779> primary<00:00:17.050> one<00:00:17.410> is

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:17.470 
number of variables the primary one is

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.650 
number of variables the primary one is
age<00:00:17.740> so<00:00:18.189> if<00:00:18.340> somebody<00:00:18.699> is<00:00:18.939> older<00:00:19.300> and<00:00:19.330> I<00:00:19.480> try<00:00:19.630> to

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
age so if somebody is older and I try to

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.060 
age so if somebody is older and I try to
be<00:00:19.840> really<00:00:20.050> careful<00:00:20.230> when<00:00:20.710> I<00:00:20.800> talk<00:00:21.039> about

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
be really careful when I talk about

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.089 
be really careful when I talk about
older<00:00:21.609> what<00:00:21.759> that<00:00:21.910> means<00:00:22.289> but<00:00:23.289> probably<00:00:23.619> 35

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:24.099 
older what that means but probably 35

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:25.620 
older what that means but probably 35
and<00:00:24.310> older<00:00:24.460> we<00:00:24.849> need<00:00:25.029> to<00:00:25.119> move<00:00:25.240> things<00:00:25.480> a

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
and older we need to move things a

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.480 
and older we need to move things a
little<00:00:25.750> quicker<00:00:26.019> so<00:00:26.679> usually<00:00:27.220> if<00:00:27.339> it's

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
little quicker so usually if it's

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.220 
little quicker so usually if it's
somebody<00:00:27.609> that's<00:00:27.730> 35<00:00:28.179> and<00:00:28.390> older<00:00:28.480> probably

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
somebody that's 35 and older probably

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.689 
somebody that's 35 and older probably
want<00:00:29.499> to<00:00:29.529> seek<00:00:29.679> fertility<00:00:30.099> care<00:00:30.279> after<00:00:30.400> about

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:30.699 
want to seek fertility care after about

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.090 
want to seek fertility care after about
six<00:00:31.089> months<00:00:31.269> for<00:00:31.900> those<00:00:31.990> less<00:00:32.200> than<00:00:32.379> 35<00:00:32.649> about

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
six months for those less than 35 about

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.160 
six months for those less than 35 about
a<00:00:33.129> year<00:00:33.579> working<00:00:34.210> with<00:00:34.480> dr.<00:00:34.780> Kaufman<00:00:35.050> was

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
a year working with dr. Kaufman was

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.720 
a year working with dr. Kaufman was
different<00:00:35.620> than<00:00:35.739> what<00:00:35.890> we<00:00:35.980> had<00:00:36.129> experienced

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
different than what we had experienced

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.000 
different than what we had experienced
previously<00:00:37.329> in<00:00:38.079> the<00:00:38.260> year<00:00:38.469> that<00:00:38.590> we're<00:00:38.739> trying

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
previously in the year that we're trying

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.709 
previously in the year that we're trying
to<00:00:39.100> conceive<00:00:39.489> when<00:00:39.910> we<00:00:40.059> would<00:00:40.210> talk<00:00:40.360> to<00:00:40.570> other

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
to conceive when we would talk to other

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:43.319 
to conceive when we would talk to other
doctors<00:00:41.070> they<00:00:42.070> kind<00:00:42.309> of<00:00:42.370> wanted<00:00:42.699> to<00:00:42.910> just

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
doctors they kind of wanted to just

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.959 
doctors they kind of wanted to just
railroad<00:00:43.719> us<00:00:43.899> into<00:00:44.350> being<00:00:44.980> a<00:00:45.250> particular<00:00:45.730> type

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969 
railroad us into being a particular type

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:48.240 
railroad us into being a particular type
of<00:00:46.000> case<00:00:46.300> that<00:00:46.329> everyone<00:00:46.780> else<00:00:46.930> was<00:00:47.199> and<00:00:47.500> then

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
of case that everyone else was and then

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.849 
of case that everyone else was and then
when<00:00:48.430> we<00:00:48.579> met<00:00:48.879> with<00:00:49.210> dr.<00:00:49.629> Kaufmann<00:00:50.170> he

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:50.859 
when we met with dr. Kaufmann he

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:53.670 
when we met with dr. Kaufmann he
actually<00:00:51.219> gave<00:00:51.550> us<00:00:51.730> hope<00:00:52.000> he<00:00:52.780> didn't<00:00:53.109> say<00:00:53.350> well

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
actually gave us hope he didn't say well

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.500 
actually gave us hope he didn't say well
we'll<00:00:53.859> just<00:00:54.070> do<00:00:54.250> a<00:00:54.519> B<00:00:54.789> and<00:00:54.879> seeing<00:00:55.210> you'll<00:00:55.420> be

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
we'll just do a B and seeing you'll be

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.590 
we'll just do a B and seeing you'll be
on<00:00:55.629> your<00:00:55.660> way<00:00:55.840> he<00:00:56.620> was<00:00:56.769> personable<00:00:57.250> and

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
on your way he was personable and

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.389 
on your way he was personable and
compassionate<00:00:58.600> and<00:00:58.890> really<00:00:59.890> made<00:01:00.070> us<00:01:00.190> feel

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
compassionate and really made us feel

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.090 
compassionate and really made us feel
like<00:01:00.670> he<00:01:01.239> was<00:01:01.390> treating<00:01:01.719> us<00:01:01.870> as<00:01:02.019> a<00:01:02.079> couple<00:01:02.379> not

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
like he was treating us as a couple not

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.820 
like he was treating us as a couple not
just<00:01:03.340> as<00:01:03.640> a<00:01:04.119> medical<00:01:04.930> experiments<00:01:05.500> on<00:01:05.560> paper

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
just as a medical experiments on paper

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.080 
just as a medical experiments on paper
so<00:01:06.670> we<00:01:06.700> kind<00:01:07.270> of<00:01:07.330> lead<00:01:07.930> a<00:01:08.640> kind<00:01:09.640> of<00:01:09.729> common

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
so we kind of lead a kind of common

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.480 
so we kind of lead a kind of common
sense<00:01:10.270> protocol<00:01:11.110> here<00:01:11.409> where<00:01:12.070> we<00:01:12.250> kind<00:01:12.430> of

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
sense protocol here where we kind of

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.800 
sense protocol here where we kind of
step<00:01:12.700> up<00:01:12.729> treatments<00:01:13.299> based<00:01:13.420> on<00:01:13.689> the

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
step up treatments based on the

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.020 
step up treatments based on the
particular<00:01:13.960> patients<00:01:14.830> needs<00:01:15.070> and<00:01:15.369> so<00:01:15.640> you<00:01:15.700> try

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
particular patients needs and so you try

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.550 
particular patients needs and so you try
one<00:01:16.240> treatment<00:01:16.509> if<00:01:16.720> that<00:01:16.869> doesn't<00:01:17.229> work<00:01:17.259> we

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
one treatment if that doesn't work we

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.929 
one treatment if that doesn't work we
move<00:01:17.740> on<00:01:17.860> to<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:18.040> second<00:01:18.369> treatment<00:01:18.579> if<00:01:18.790> that

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
move on to the second treatment if that

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:20.100 
move on to the second treatment if that
doesn't<00:01:19.270> work<00:01:19.299> you<00:01:19.420> move<00:01:19.720> on<00:01:19.869> to<00:01:20.020> another

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
doesn't work you move on to another

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.230 
doesn't work you move on to another
treatment<00:01:20.530> and<00:01:20.829> so<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:21.520> next<00:01:21.700> year<00:01:22.030> would<00:01:22.210> be

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
treatment and so the next year would be

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.359 
treatment and so the next year would be
in<00:01:22.509> vitro<00:01:22.689> fertilization<00:01:23.560> where<00:01:24.220> we're

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
in vitro fertilization where we're

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.490 
in vitro fertilization where we're
actually<00:01:24.579> get<00:01:24.970> eggs<00:01:25.180> from<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.390> ovaries<00:01:25.840> put

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
actually get eggs from the ovaries put

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.200 
actually get eggs from the ovaries put
them<00:01:26.590> in<00:01:26.710> a<00:01:26.740> dish<00:01:27.159> take<00:01:27.549> the<00:01:27.700> sperm<00:01:27.970> fit

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
them in a dish take the sperm fit

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.420 
them in a dish take the sperm fit
together<00:01:28.570> in<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:28.840> dish<00:01:29.020> fertilize<00:01:29.950> them<00:01:30.189> and

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
together in the dish fertilize them and

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.649 
together in the dish fertilize them and
then<00:01:30.549> put<00:01:30.759> them<00:01:30.880> back<00:01:30.939> in<00:01:31.360> two<00:01:31.479> years

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
then put them back in two years

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.740 
then put them back in two years
initially<00:01:32.530> the<00:01:32.680> idea<00:01:32.710> of<00:01:33.340> doing<00:01:33.479> IVF<00:01:34.479> to

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
initially the idea of doing IVF to

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.620 
initially the idea of doing IVF to
anybody<00:01:35.170> sounds<00:01:35.799> extreme<00:01:36.490> and<00:01:36.820> invasive<00:01:37.149> and

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
anybody sounds extreme and invasive and

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.260 
anybody sounds extreme and invasive and
really<00:01:37.990> scary<00:01:38.380> however<00:01:39.159> dr.<00:01:39.549> Kaufmann<00:01:40.000> really

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
really scary however dr. Kaufmann really

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.380 
really scary however dr. Kaufmann really
do<00:01:40.479> mystified<00:01:41.020> that<00:01:41.409> for<00:01:41.680> us<00:01:41.710> and<00:01:42.130> was<00:01:42.969> able<00:01:43.149> to

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
do mystified that for us and was able to

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.749
