00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
the system and I'd like to do is just

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.700 
the system and I'd like to do is just
let<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.570> hear<00:00:54.780> watch<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.230> goes<00:00:55.440> on<00:00:55.680> with

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
let you hear watch it goes on with

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.920 
let you hear watch it goes on with
galloping<00:00:56.250> ghosts<00:00:57.530> so<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:59.300> put<00:01:00.300> old<00:01:00.449> wind<00:01:00.690> meter

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930

again<00:01:02.359> down<00:01:03.359> on<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.539> speaker<00:01:05.990> and<00:01:06.990> there<00:01:07.380> we

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
again down on the speaker and there we

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.969 
again down on the speaker and there we
go<00:01:08.030> you<00:01:09.030> can<00:01:09.150> actually<00:01:09.240> see<00:01:09.750> on<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:10.080> meter<00:01:10.320> is

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
go you can actually see on the meter is

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.200 
go you can actually see on the meter is
the<00:01:11.130> deflection<00:01:11.340> Allen<00:01:13.640> near<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.760> increase

in the rest and the reduction in it this

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.060 
in the rest and the reduction in it this
is<00:01:19.830> what<00:01:20.009> gave<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.369> elevator<00:01:20.820> control

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
is what gave you the elevator control

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.740 
is what gave you the elevator control
variation<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.250> pulse<00:01:23.460> width<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.570> cheek

arbiter<00:01:25.259> here<00:01:26.090> what<00:01:27.090> controls<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:28.110> rudder

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
arbiter here what controls the rudder

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.130

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
people disconnect these are incorrectly

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.969 
people disconnect these are incorrectly
the<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:51.270> action<00:01:51.750> very<00:01:52.229> high<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.500> be<00:01:52.740> full

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
the that action very high to be full

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.780 
the that action very high to be full
thing<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.700> for<00:01:53.970> down<00:01:54.180> elevator<00:01:55.490> slow<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.670> up

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
thing is for down elevator slow it up

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.090 
thing is for down elevator slow it up
have<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.479> little<00:01:57.810> something<00:01:58.170> down<00:01:58.380> Oh

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:16.590 

right<00:02:11.650> off<00:02:12.650> you<00:02:12.830> see<00:02:13.070> our<00:02:13.220> chocolate<00:02:13.580> welfare

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.020 

the<00:02:17.600> nice<00:02:17.810> benefit<00:02:18.590> of<00:02:18.680> system<00:02:19.070> is<00:02:19.550> no<00:02:19.730> look<00:02:19.910> at

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
the nice benefit of system is no look at

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.340 
the nice benefit of system is no look at
the<00:02:20.090> back<00:02:20.240> end<00:02:21.580> you<00:02:22.580> can<00:02:22.760> see<00:02:22.790> that

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
the back end you can see that

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.620 
the back end you can see that
around<00:02:24.530> neutral<00:02:25.010> now<00:02:25.970> let's<00:02:26.330> put<00:02:26.480> down

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
around neutral now let's put down

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.449 
around neutral now let's put down
elevating<00:02:27.260> it<00:02:27.470> makes<00:02:27.680> it<00:02:27.830> easy<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:28.100> see<00:02:28.340> the

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
elevating it makes it easy to see the

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:29.920 
elevating it makes it easy to see the
action<00:02:28.700> of<00:02:28.820> the<00:02:28.910> river<00:02:29.090> so<00:02:29.300> there<00:02:29.480> you<00:02:29.570> can<00:02:29.720> see

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
action of the river so there you can see

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.270 
action of the river so there you can see
it's<00:02:30.110> following<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.560> stick<00:02:30.830> movement

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
it's following the stick movement

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.570 
it's following the stick movement
