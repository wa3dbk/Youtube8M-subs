00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:12.019
 hi friends, good morning, I'm going to 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.449
 share a stitch for this rose and 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:18.380
 let's start look with a thread 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:20.250
 We are going to start scratching all the 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.790
 petal 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.790
 A) Yes 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.530
 so we're going to go 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.880
 doing a scratch 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.880
 one 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.360
 well together 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.360
 ah 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.020
 A) Yes 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:53.430
 until filling the whole petal like this 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.250
 and it was filled now with petal 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.700
 Different color of thread we will make 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.700
 this 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.040
 let's go putting 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:11.220
 so the centuries 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.220
 as a fan to himself 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.530
 so here below they will stay 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.240
 i 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.920
 make 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.259
 ah 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.190
 we're going to go 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:01.240
 until filling all the petal 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:05.030
 Well, the petal was already scratched 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:09.200
 now with the same thread 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:13.090
 let's go pulling the threads down and 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.090
 stepping on this other one from above 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.989
 so they give me 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.739
 I put this needle here so that from here I 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.150
 I'm going to go right here to get there and not 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.150
 go more up 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.410
 so we are going to raise the threads of 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.740
 down 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.700
 and stepping 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.700
 the one above 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.310
 well I got here where the needle is 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.310
 we remove it 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:23.800
 and here we would start to leave 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.800
 down to get here 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:36.240
 we will continue doing the same 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.240
 only now we're going down 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.269
 A) Yes 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:06.610
 so we raise all of these and we go out in 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.610
 the corner 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:19.329
 and so it looks like the triangle and 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:28.030
 since I'm here I put four 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:31.659
 threads because the petal is small 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:34.870
 with four threads so it is now we 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:38.620
 let's go around the outline and 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.919
 let's do your outline with point 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.919
 behind 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.470
 so look 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:54.949
 ah 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:14.550
 until you fill up all the good petal already 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:18.639
 I finished the outline now on the same 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:20.500
 outline let's go doing 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:23.010
 nudity 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.010
 A) Yes 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:39.220
 so we 're going to go 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.220
 all around 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:47.949
 to make the knots we will give 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:47.949
 two or three laps or four 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.600
 well look at this is the first 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:02.610
 so he stayed with two laps and I think so 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:05.070
 is going to stay because like the petals 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:08.800
 They are small if I put another round 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:11.320
 is going to cover too much the petal 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:15.670
 well look like that 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:18.280
 already with the knots that I put that gave 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:22.460
 a turn and then on that same me 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:24.830
 I came back and that's how you look 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.199
 Now I show you already finished 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:32.660
 Well, that's how it goes with all the 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:35.240
 petals finished now this I'm going to 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:37.270
 do everything together 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.090
 so look 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:42.639
 I will do the same steps 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:46.840
 fill it 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:48.810
 and then put these threads and right now 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:52.199
 I show how I'm going to put it 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.199
 this outline 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.540
 Well, I already did the middle part of 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.360
 the Rose 

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:04.270
 I did everything together with these same 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:07.120
 steps but now I put him in 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:10.810
 shape with the contour 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:14.410
 and on this we are going to do this same thing 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:17.350
 let's do everything here where I made 

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:20.729
 the outline so that it remains the same 

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:26.430
 how are we going to do it like this 

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:29.130
 with nuditos and we are going to give it two laps 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:31.030
 and good friends, that's how the rose was 

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:33.790
 already finished 

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:37.120
 look, I wish you like them 

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:39.910
 and put it into practice and I want to give it 

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:42.250
 thanks very much especially to all 

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:45.070
 friends who send me their step by step 

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:48.610
 by messages for me to do the 

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:51.910
 video thank you very much for sharing the and 

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:54.340
 I will upload my videos here for 

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:56.350
 who likes who likes to do them because 

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:59.070
 Many think that I will not continue with the 

00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:02.620
 videos but if I'm going to continue here 

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:05.880
 going up for those who like to make them 

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.880
 thank you
