00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.510 

here's<00:00:02.550> another<00:00:02.820> update<00:00:03.270> of<00:00:03.419> my<00:00:03.570> overhead<00:00:04.080> I

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:04.520 
here's another update of my overhead I

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.400 
here's another update of my overhead I
have<00:00:05.520> most<00:00:05.940> of<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.270> switches<00:00:06.569> installed<00:00:06.960> now

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
have most of the switches installed now

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.759 
have most of the switches installed now
and<00:00:08.240> I<00:00:09.240> laid<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.599> rotary<00:00:09.900> knobs<00:00:10.200> on<00:00:10.590> there

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
and I laid the rotary knobs on there

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.490 
and I laid the rotary knobs on there
again<00:00:11.070> so<00:00:11.280> you<00:00:11.370> can<00:00:11.490> check<00:00:11.670> those<00:00:11.849> out<00:00:12.090> and

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:12.500 
again so you can check those out and

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.780 
again so you can check those out and
this<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.679> generally<00:00:14.250> what<00:00:14.280> it's<00:00:14.580> going<00:00:14.730> to

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
this is generally what it's going to

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.230 
this is generally what it's going to
look<00:00:14.880> like<00:00:15.030> I<00:00:16.160> added<00:00:17.160> quite<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.730> bit<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:18.000> color

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
look like I added quite a bit of color

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.349 
look like I added quite a bit of color
just<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.720> spruce<00:00:19.500> it<00:00:19.770> up<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.250> kind<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.210> looks

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
just to spruce it up and kind of looks

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.060 
just to spruce it up and kind of looks
like<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.510> Christmas<00:00:21.990> tree<00:00:22.160> but<00:00:23.160> uh<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:24.500> put<00:00:25.500> color

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
like a Christmas tree but uh I put color

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.630 
like a Christmas tree but uh I put color
on<00:00:26.130> all<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.490> dummy<00:00:26.789> gauges<00:00:27.680> just<00:00:28.680> for<00:00:28.830> now<00:00:29.010> but

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
on all the dummy gauges just for now but

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.290 
on all the dummy gauges just for now but
I<00:00:31.610> installed<00:00:32.610> one<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.590> rotaries<00:00:34.880> I'd<00:00:35.880> made

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
I installed one of the rotaries I'd made

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.610 
I installed one of the rotaries I'd made
it<00:00:36.420> go<00:00:36.540> both<00:00:36.750> ways<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.200> didn't<00:00:37.350> know<00:00:37.410> if<00:00:37.500> it's

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
it go both ways I didn't know if it's

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.440 
it go both ways I didn't know if it's
supposed<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.920> do<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.250> or<00:00:38.399> not<00:00:41.210> and<00:00:42.230> then<00:00:43.230> I

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
supposed to do that or not and then I

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.209 
supposed to do that or not and then I
decided<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.870> was<00:00:46.170> going<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.350> put<00:00:46.469> mini<00:00:46.680> toggles

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
decided I was going to put mini toggles

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.770 
decided I was going to put mini toggles
in<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.460> lot<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.640> these<00:00:47.789> three<00:00:48.149> way<00:00:48.300> position

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
in a lot of these three way position

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.090 
in a lot of these three way position
switches<00:00:49.649> but<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.460> found<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:50.969> radioshack<00:00:51.329> the

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
switches but I found that radioshack the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.310 
switches but I found that radioshack the
larger<00:00:53.100> toggle<00:00:53.550> was<00:00:53.750> cheaper<00:00:54.750> than<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.930> minis

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
larger toggle was cheaper than the minis

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.880 
larger toggle was cheaper than the minis
so<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:56.219> did<00:00:57.120> decided<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.960> order<00:00:58.230> some<00:00:58.500> larger

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
so I did decided to order some larger

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.040 
so I did decided to order some larger
ones<00:00:59.100> but<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.520> problem<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:00.000> over<00:01:00.239> here<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.719> have

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
ones but the problem is over here I have

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.070 
ones but the problem is over here I have
the<00:01:01.260> whole<00:01:01.469> smaller<00:01:02.430> holes<00:01:02.730> drilled<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.870> if<00:01:03.960> i

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
the whole smaller holes drilled and if i

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.600 
the whole smaller holes drilled and if i
go<00:01:04.199> back<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.379> drill<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.010> shavings<00:01:05.489> are

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
go back to drill and the shavings are

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.760 
go back to drill and the shavings are
going<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.790> go<00:01:05.909> all<00:01:06.000> around<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.450> panel<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.530> i

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
going to go all around the panel and i

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.289 
going to go all around the panel and i
don't<00:01:07.950> know<00:01:08.040> if<00:01:08.130> there's<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.790> way<00:01:08.909> around<00:01:09.030> that

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
don't know if there's a way around that

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.350 
don't know if there's a way around that
or<00:01:09.540> not<00:01:10.400> besides<00:01:11.400> taking<00:01:11.670> stuff<00:01:11.909> apart<00:01:12.060> to

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
or not besides taking stuff apart to

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.570 
or not besides taking stuff apart to
clean<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.720> back<00:01:12.869> out<00:01:13.049> i<00:01:13.350> tried<00:01:14.040> drilling<00:01:14.340> these

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
clean it back out i tried drilling these

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.640 
clean it back out i tried drilling these
out<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.090> there<00:01:15.450> were<00:01:15.509> shavings<00:01:16.020> all<00:01:16.200> behind

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
out and there were shavings all behind

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.649 
out and there were shavings all behind
here<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.009> i<00:01:17.040> had<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.340> bring<00:01:17.939> these<00:01:18.060> bolts<00:01:18.479> up

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
here and i had to bring these bolts up

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.690 
here and i had to bring these bolts up
and<00:01:18.990> clean<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:21.920> I'm<00:01:22.920> just<00:01:23.130> afraid<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.549> getting

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
and clean and I'm just afraid of getting

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.340 
and clean and I'm just afraid of getting
shavings<00:01:24.390> back<00:01:24.600> in<00:01:24.780> there<00:01:24.900> because<00:01:25.020> there's

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
shavings back in there because there's

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.149 
shavings back in there because there's
oh<00:01:26.030> i<00:01:27.030> think<00:01:27.150> there's<00:01:27.360> about<00:01:27.509> 700<00:01:28.159> holes

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
oh i think there's about 700 holes

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.870 
oh i think there's about 700 holes
drilled<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:29.670> here<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:31.430> to<00:01:32.430> take<00:01:32.610> all<00:01:32.759> those

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
drilled in here and to take all those

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.789 
drilled in here and to take all those
bolts<00:01:33.270> out<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.659> all<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.079> switches<00:01:34.350> back<00:01:34.590> out

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
bolts out and all the switches back out

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.550 
bolts out and all the switches back out
to<00:01:34.950> clean<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.310> would<00:01:35.430> be<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> mess<00:01:35.990> so<00:01:36.990> anyway

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
to clean it would be a mess so anyway

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.490 
to clean it would be a mess so anyway
i'm<00:01:38.159> proud<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.430> just<00:01:39.030> put<00:01:39.360> three-way<00:01:39.869> minis<00:01:40.259> in

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
i'm proud to just put three-way minis in

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.700 
shipments the first one had really long
threads<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.270> these<00:02:23.480> are<00:02:23.660> shorter<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:24.200> they

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
threads and these are shorter and they

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.180 
threads and these are shorter and they
don't<00:02:24.890> go<00:02:25.250> all<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.430> way<00:02:25.460> through<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.760> glass

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
don't go all the way through the glass

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.720 
don't go all the way through the glass
so<00:02:28.190> I<00:02:28.930> find<00:02:29.930> a<00:02:30.020> trick<00:02:30.290> just<00:02:30.530> too<00:02:30.860> hot<00:02:31.490> glue

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
so I find a trick just too hot glue

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:39.190 
so I find a trick just too hot glue
those<00:02:31.940> in<00:02:32.210> and<00:02:33.050> it<00:02:33.200> works<00:02:33.440> so<00:02:34.630> I<00:02:37.780> got<00:02:38.780> some<00:02:39.050> with

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
those in and it works so I got some with

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.810 
those in and it works so I got some with
the<00:02:39.290> nut<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:39.530> some<00:02:39.950> that<00:02:40.100> are<00:02:40.220> just<00:02:40.250> hot<00:02:40.520> glued

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
the nut and some that are just hot glued

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.650 
the nut and some that are just hot glued
in<00:02:40.970> which<00:02:42.610> it's<00:02:43.610> pretty<00:02:43.850> much<00:02:43.970> only<00:02:44.180> switch<00:02:44.510> I

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
in which it's pretty much only switch I

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.900 
in which it's pretty much only switch I
can<00:02:44.690> get<00:02:44.960> away<00:02:45.050> with<00:02:45.290> doing<00:02:45.320> that<00:02:45.860> all<00:02:46.730> the

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
can get away with doing that all the

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.700 
can get away with doing that all the
rest<00:02:47.090> of<00:02:47.240> them<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.510> threads<00:02:47.810> go<00:02:48.080> through<00:02:48.440> and

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
rest of them the threads go through and

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.110 
rest of them the threads go through and
the<00:02:49.280> flight<00:02:49.700> deck<00:02:49.880> solution<00:02:51.760> toggles<00:02:52.760> are<00:02:53.000> the

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
the flight deck solution toggles are the

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.680 
the flight deck solution toggles are the
best<00:02:53.360> they<00:02:53.690> have<00:02:53.840> really<00:02:54.050> long<00:02:54.290> threads<00:02:54.710> and

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
best they have really long threads and

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.110 
best they have really long threads and
they're<00:02:56.690> real<00:02:56.960> industrial<00:02:57.320> so<00:02:58.040> I<00:02:58.280> recommend

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
they're real industrial so I recommend

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.150 
they're real industrial so I recommend
those<00:02:59.540> but<00:02:59.810> there<00:02:59.930> I<00:03:00.200> think<00:03:00.860> they're<00:03:01.010> about

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
those but there I think they're about

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.250 
those but there I think they're about
eight<00:03:01.340> bucks<00:03:01.610> apiece<00:03:01.870> for<00:03:02.870> different

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
eight bucks apiece for different

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.190 
eight bucks apiece for different
switches<00:03:03.680> or<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.790> radio<00:03:05.090> shack<00:03:05.420> are<00:03:05.660> down<00:03:05.840> to

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
switches or the radio shack are down to

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.940 
switches or the radio shack are down to
three<00:03:06.670> dollars<00:03:07.670> and<00:03:07.850> under<00:03:08.090> so<00:03:08.420> I<00:03:11.710> just<00:03:12.710> chose

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
three dollars and under so I just chose

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.120 
three dollars and under so I just chose
some<00:03:13.250> different<00:03:13.550> switches<00:03:14.270> for<00:03:14.770> right<00:03:15.770> here

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
some different switches for right here

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.850 
some different switches for right here
just<00:03:17.000> do<00:03:17.150> no<00:03:18.140> no<00:03:18.380> I<00:03:18.410> thought<00:03:18.680> they<00:03:18.770> look<00:03:18.950> cool

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
just do no no I thought they look cool

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.680 
just do no no I thought they look cool
again<00:03:21.860> the<00:03:22.010> paint<00:03:22.280> is<00:03:22.580> Matt<00:03:22.940> to<00:03:23.300> match<00:03:23.450> my

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
again the paint is Matt to match my

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.960 
again the paint is Matt to match my
simulator<00:03:24.200> I<00:03:24.440> kind<00:03:25.100> of<00:03:25.130> like<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.400> gray<00:03:25.640> trim

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
simulator I kind of like the gray trim

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.930 
simulator I kind of like the gray trim
here<00:03:26.270> I<00:03:26.450> think<00:03:27.440> that<00:03:27.470> helps<00:03:27.890> out<00:03:30.610> as<00:03:31.610> far<00:03:31.880> as

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
here I think that helps out as far as

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.320 
here I think that helps out as far as
the<00:03:32.060> annunciators<00:03:32.840> I<00:03:33.520> kind<00:03:34.520> of<00:03:34.580> just<00:03:34.730> ran<00:03:34.970> free

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
the annunciators I kind of just ran free

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.350 
the annunciators I kind of just ran free
with<00:03:35.480> the<00:03:35.600> bolt<00:03:36.220> idea<00:03:37.220> because<00:03:37.730> it<00:03:37.760> just<00:03:38.090> gave

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
with the bolt idea because it just gave

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.850 
with the bolt idea because it just gave
it<00:03:38.510> more<00:03:38.660> of<00:03:38.750> an<00:03:38.810> industrial<00:03:39.080> look<00:03:39.560> overall

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
it more of an industrial look overall

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.520 
it more of an industrial look overall
and<00:03:40.280> I<00:03:41.120> found<00:03:41.300> it<00:03:41.450> the<00:03:41.570> simplest<00:03:42.020> way<00:03:42.200> to<00:03:42.230> hold

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
and I found it the simplest way to hold

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.270 
and I found it the simplest way to hold
the<00:03:43.720> annunciators<00:03:44.720> on<00:03:44.900> plus<00:03:45.410> it<00:03:45.620> firms<00:03:45.830> up<00:03:46.040> the

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
the annunciators on plus it firms up the

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.710 
the annunciators on plus it firms up the
glass<00:03:47.200> so<00:03:48.200> I<00:03:49.120> was<00:03:50.120> debating<00:03:50.300> whether<00:03:50.630> i<00:03:50.660> was

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
glass so I was debating whether i was

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.300 
glass so I was debating whether i was
going<00:03:50.870> to<00:03:50.930> put<00:03:51.080> have<00:03:51.200> to<00:03:51.320> put<00:03:51.440> a<00:03:51.470> crosspiece<00:03:52.070> to

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
going to put have to put a crosspiece to

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.170 
going to put have to put a crosspiece to
help<00:03:53.270> support<00:03:53.510> it<00:03:53.840> but<00:03:53.930> this<00:03:54.080> thing's<00:03:54.350> solid

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
help support it but this thing's solid

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:02.380 
help support it but this thing's solid
so<00:03:56.180> I<00:03:56.600> probably<00:03:57.260> won't<00:03:57.410> have<00:03:57.620> to<00:03:57.740> do<00:03:57.890> that<00:04:01.390> so

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
so I probably won't have to do that so

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:03.430 
so I probably won't have to do that so
now<00:04:02.540> it'll<00:04:02.660> just<00:04:02.870> be<00:04:03.020> working<00:04:03.380> with

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
now it'll just be working with

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.370 
now it'll just be working with
backlighting<00:04:04.070> and<00:04:04.940> go<00:04:05.750> ahead<00:04:05.870> and<00:04:05.990> mount<00:04:06.200> it

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
backlighting and go ahead and mount it

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.980 
backlighting and go ahead and mount it
up<00:04:07.240> I'm<00:04:08.240> trying<00:04:08.570> to<00:04:08.750> I'm<00:04:10.450> going<00:04:11.450> to<00:04:11.510> try<00:04:11.720> to<00:04:11.750> put

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
up I'm trying to I'm going to try to put

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.690 
up I'm trying to I'm going to try to put
four<00:04:13.450> or<00:04:14.450> sorry<00:04:15.170> two<00:04:15.560> brackets<00:04:15.950> on<00:04:16.250> each<00:04:16.400> side

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
four or sorry two brackets on each side

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.610 
four or sorry two brackets on each side
that<00:04:17.030> would<00:04:17.120> come<00:04:17.450> may<00:04:17.720> be<00:04:17.780> down<00:04:18.080> and<00:04:18.109> have<00:04:18.590> a

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
that would come may be down and have a

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.400 
that would come may be down and have a
whole<00:04:19.400> hair<00:04:19.669> and<00:04:20.270> then<00:04:20.660> I'm<00:04:20.810> trying<00:04:21.140> to<00:04:21.229> run

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
whole hair and then I'm trying to run

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.570 
whole hair and then I'm trying to run
threaded<00:04:21.859> rod<00:04:22.130> for<00:04:22.760> my<00:04:22.910> ceiling

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
threaded rod for my ceiling

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.050 
threaded rod for my ceiling
studs<00:04:25.900> down<00:04:26.900> and<00:04:27.319> then<00:04:27.740> the<00:04:28.250> rod<00:04:28.699> will<00:04:28.729> just

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
studs down and then the rod will just

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.869 
studs down and then the rod will just
have<00:04:29.180> two<00:04:29.389> nuts<00:04:29.629> on<00:04:29.840> each<00:04:29.870> side<00:04:30.470> or<00:04:30.770> each<00:04:31.639> side

00:04:31.869 --> 00:04:31.879 
have two nuts on each side or each side

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:33.700 
have two nuts on each side or each side
of<00:04:31.910> the<00:04:32.000> bracket<00:04:32.270> and<00:04:32.659> then<00:04:32.870> I<00:04:32.930> can<00:04:33.110> adjust<00:04:33.500> the

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
of the bracket and then I can adjust the

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.850 
of the bracket and then I can adjust the
height<00:04:33.889> of<00:04:33.949> the<00:04:34.310> overhead<00:04:34.900> so<00:04:35.900> that's<00:04:36.620> the

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
height of the overhead so that's the

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.469 
height of the overhead so that's the
plan<00:04:38.169> potentially<00:04:39.169> one<00:04:39.500> two<00:04:40.220> three<00:04:40.789> four<00:04:41.120> rods

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
plan potentially one two three four rods

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:46.510 
plan potentially one two three four rods
but<00:04:41.990> maybe<00:04:42.229> one<00:04:42.560> two<00:04:42.800> three<00:04:43.190> four<00:04:43.550> five<00:04:43.849> six<00:04:45.520> if

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
but maybe one two three four five six if

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.540 
but maybe one two three four five six if
it<00:04:46.909> needs<00:04:47.180> it<00:04:47.710> so<00:04:48.710> I'll<00:04:48.860> probably<00:04:49.009> start<00:04:49.370> with

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
it needs it so I'll probably start with

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.850 
it needs it so I'll probably start with
four<00:04:49.819> and<00:04:50.000> then<00:04:50.060> if<00:04:50.180> it<00:04:50.330> isn't<00:04:51.139> quite<00:04:51.379> solid

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
four and then if it isn't quite solid

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.999 
four and then if it isn't quite solid
i'll<00:04:52.009> put<00:04:52.610> a<00:04:52.639> one<00:04:53.090> in<00:04:53.120> the<00:04:53.300> middle<00:04:53.800> on<00:04:54.800> each

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:55.009 
i'll put a one in the middle on each

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:59.080 
i'll put a one in the middle on each
side<00:04:56.860> so<00:04:57.860> I'll<00:04:58.009> just<00:04:58.069> see<00:04:58.310> how<00:04:58.400> that<00:04:58.610> goes<00:04:58.639> but

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
side so I'll just see how that goes but

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.999 
side so I'll just see how that goes but
that's<00:04:59.270> the<00:04:59.479> plan<00:04:59.690> to<00:04:59.870> keep<00:05:00.020> it<00:05:00.259> look<00:05:00.800> in<00:05:00.919> the

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:01.009 
that's the plan to keep it look in the

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.659 
that's the plan to keep it look in the
cleanest<00:05:01.460> and<00:05:01.639> I<00:05:02.090> want<00:05:02.300> it<00:05:02.389> easily<00:05:03.380> easy<00:05:04.250> so<00:05:04.639> I

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
cleanest and I want it easily easy so I

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:07.149 
cleanest and I want it easily easy so I
can<00:05:04.970> bring<00:05:05.810> it<00:05:05.960> up<00:05:06.050> and<00:05:06.199> down<00:05:06.380> if<00:05:06.620> I<00:05:06.710> want<00:05:06.979> to

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:07.159 
can bring it up and down if I want to

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:10.149 
can bring it up and down if I want to
work<00:05:07.639> on<00:05:07.819> it<00:05:08.000> because<00:05:08.930> as<00:05:09.349> of<00:05:09.680> now<00:05:09.889> I<00:05:09.919> don't

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:10.159 
work on it because as of now I don't

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:12.159 
work on it because as of now I don't
plan<00:05:10.370> on<00:05:10.520> wiring<00:05:10.819> up<00:05:11.180> the<00:05:11.210> switches<00:05:11.659> i'm<00:05:11.990> just

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
plan on wiring up the switches i'm just

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.770 
plan on wiring up the switches i'm just
going<00:05:12.319> to<00:05:12.349> mount<00:05:12.590> it<00:05:12.770> and<00:05:12.860> then<00:05:13.460> this<00:05:14.330> fall<00:05:14.630> i'm

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
going to mount it and then this fall i'm

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.209 
going to mount it and then this fall i'm
going<00:05:14.930> to<00:05:14.990> do<00:05:15.440> the<00:05:15.560> wiring<00:05:15.819> to<00:05:16.819> the<00:05:16.849> boards<00:05:17.330> i

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:18.219 
going to do the wiring to the boards i

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:20.409 
going to do the wiring to the boards i
plan<00:05:19.219> on<00:05:19.250> running<00:05:19.520> the<00:05:19.669> wiring<00:05:20.150> from<00:05:20.270> the

plan on running the wiring from the

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.459 
plan on running the wiring from the
boards<00:05:21.370> from<00:05:22.370> the<00:05:22.729> switchboards<00:05:23.569> there's

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:24.469 
boards from the switchboards there's

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:26.499 
boards from the switchboards there's
going<00:05:24.650> to<00:05:24.710> be<00:05:24.770> the<00:05:25.039> leo<00:05:25.250> bodnar<00:05:25.550> boards<00:05:26.270> and

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:26.509 
going to be the leo bodnar boards and

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:36.610 
going to be the leo bodnar boards and
the<00:05:29.590> LED<00:05:30.759> 64<00:05:32.229> fidget<00:05:33.229> cards<00:05:34.599> and<00:05:35.599> I've<00:05:36.319> plant

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
the LED 64 fidget cards and I've plant

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.170 
the LED 64 fidget cards and I've plant
and<00:05:36.889> then<00:05:38.620> imagine<00:05:39.620> they<00:05:39.860> both<00:05:40.009> have<00:05:40.250> USB<00:05:40.550> just

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
and then imagine they both have USB just

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.899 
and then imagine they both have USB just
to<00:05:41.300> the<00:05:41.389> computer<00:05:42.370> hopefully<00:05:43.370> up<00:05:43.490> over<00:05:43.789> the

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:43.909 
to the computer hopefully up over the

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:46.659 
to the computer hopefully up over the
ceiling<00:05:44.180> and<00:05:44.599> down<00:05:44.630> the<00:05:44.930> wall<00:05:45.110> as<00:05:45.460> opposed<00:05:46.460> to

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
ceiling and down the wall as opposed to

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:48.279 
ceiling and down the wall as opposed to
just<00:05:46.699> write<00:05:47.240> down<00:05:47.270> directly<00:05:48.050> to<00:05:48.199> the

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
just write down directly to the

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:51.010 
just write down directly to the
simulator<00:05:48.909> because<00:05:49.909> I<00:05:50.120> don't<00:05:50.569> want<00:05:50.630> to<00:05:50.840> see

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
simulator because I don't want to see

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.969 
simulator because I don't want to see
that<00:05:51.050> wire<00:05:51.400> so<00:05:52.400> if<00:05:52.520> i<00:05:52.639> can<00:05:52.789> get<00:05:52.880> extensions<00:05:53.979> for

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:54.979 
that wire so if i can get extensions for

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:58.240 
that wire so if i can get extensions for
those<00:05:55.659> boards<00:05:56.659> and<00:05:56.900> run<00:05:57.560> them<00:05:57.680> up<00:05:57.860> around<00:05:58.009> the

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
those boards and run them up around the

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.830 
those boards and run them up around the
wool<00:06:00.219> and<00:06:01.219> then<00:06:01.669> the<00:06:01.849> only<00:06:01.909> other<00:06:02.090> wiring<00:06:02.509> will

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 
wool and then the only other wiring will

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.149 
wool and then the only other wiring will
be<00:06:02.990> wiring<00:06:03.289> to<00:06:03.830> the<00:06:04.900> backlighting<00:06:05.900> and

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:06.159 
be wiring to the backlighting and

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:12.930 
be wiring to the backlighting and
that'll<00:06:07.159> be<00:06:07.310> just<00:06:08.650> general<00:06:11.680> electrical<00:06:12.680> wire

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
that'll be just general electrical wire

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.670 
that'll be just general electrical wire
up<00:06:13.940> or<00:06:14.210> over<00:06:14.539> the<00:06:14.630> ceiling<00:06:15.050> and<00:06:15.139> down<00:06:15.199> the<00:06:15.500> wall

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
up or over the ceiling and down the wall

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.040 
up or over the ceiling and down the wall
and<00:06:15.949> then<00:06:16.789> i<00:06:16.940> plan<00:06:17.180> on<00:06:17.210> just<00:06:17.449> covering<00:06:17.870> the

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
and then i plan on just covering the

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.930 
and then i plan on just covering the
wiring<00:06:18.440> up<00:06:18.590> with<00:06:18.800> some<00:06:19.069> sort<00:06:19.310> of<00:06:19.370> a<00:06:19.520> metal

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
wiring up with some sort of a metal

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.779 
wiring up with some sort of a metal
bracket<00:06:20.509> or<00:06:20.630> something<00:06:21.099> so<00:06:22.099> hopefully<00:06:22.669> it'll

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:22.789 
bracket or something so hopefully it'll

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:27.089 
bracket or something so hopefully it'll
be<00:06:22.849> a<00:06:22.940> nice<00:06:23.120> simple<00:06:23.419> look<00:06:23.719> and<00:06:24.639> won't<00:06:25.639> be<00:06:25.759> too

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:27.099 
be a nice simple look and won't be too

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:30.550 
be a nice simple look and won't be too
much<00:06:28.099> of<00:06:28.159> a<00:06:28.340> mess<00:06:28.370> consider<00:06:29.330> my<00:06:29.569> flight<00:06:30.199> sim<00:06:30.440> is

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 
much of a mess consider my flight sim is

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.170 
much of a mess consider my flight sim is
right<00:06:30.740> off<00:06:30.860> with<00:06:31.009> a<00:06:31.039> living<00:06:31.400> room<00:06:31.610> all<00:06:32.029> right

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
right off with a living room all right

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.450 
right off with a living room all right
so<00:06:32.539> I<00:06:32.899> need<00:06:33.529> to<00:06:33.620> keep<00:06:33.800> it<00:06:33.949> as<00:06:34.070> clean<00:06:34.310> as

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
so I need to keep it as clean as

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.600 
so I need to keep it as clean as
possible

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.010 

I've<00:06:38.610> done<00:06:38.820> pretty<00:06:38.940> good<00:06:39.210> covering<00:06:39.690> up<00:06:39.780> all<00:06:39.900> my

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 
I've done pretty good covering up all my

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:45.129 
I've done pretty good covering up all my
wires<00:06:40.290> on<00:06:40.560> my<00:06:40.680> others<00:06:40.860> on<00:06:41.160> the<00:06:41.430> main<00:06:43.100> MIP<00:06:44.100> I

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:45.139 
wires on my others on the main MIP I

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:48.439 
wires on my others on the main MIP I
think<00:06:46.139> I<00:06:46.199> only<00:06:46.260> have<00:06:46.380> a<00:06:46.500> few<00:06:46.740> showin<00:06:47.449> mm-hmm

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:48.449 
think I only have a few showin mm-hmm

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:50.360 
think I only have a few showin mm-hmm
and<00:06:49.350> I'm<00:06:49.440> glad<00:06:49.590> I<00:06:49.680> did<00:06:49.800> it<00:06:49.979> that<00:06:50.190> way<00:06:50.310> too

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:50.370 
and I'm glad I did it that way too

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.330 
and I'm glad I did it that way too
because<00:06:50.790> the<00:06:50.970> cats<00:06:51.180> are<00:06:51.680> they<00:06:52.680> just<00:06:52.860> chase

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:53.340 
because the cats are they just chase

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:54.680 
because the cats are they just chase
each<00:06:53.520> other<00:06:53.729> around<00:06:53.790> the<00:06:54.060> house<00:06:54.210> and<00:06:54.540> they'd

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:54.690 
each other around the house and they'd

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:56.900 
each other around the house and they'd
be<00:06:54.720> hiding<00:06:55.530> up<00:06:55.620> in<00:06:55.740> there<00:06:55.949> if<00:06:56.070> they<00:06:56.280> got<00:06:56.729> their

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:56.910 
be hiding up in there if they got their

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.960 
be hiding up in there if they got their
way<00:06:57.090> about<00:06:57.300> it<00:06:57.360> so<00:06:58.280> they<00:06:59.280> have<00:06:59.430> to<00:06:59.550> stay<00:06:59.790> out<00:06:59.940> of

00:06:59.960 --> 00:06:59.970 
way about it so they have to stay out of

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:06.230 
way about it so they have to stay out of
the<00:07:00.210> flight<00:07:00.449> simulator<00:07:05.000> the<00:07:06.000> only<00:07:06.210> other

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 
the flight simulator the only other

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.810 
the flight simulator the only other
concern<00:07:06.930> is<00:07:06.960> once<00:07:07.860> i<00:07:07.979> get<00:07:08.130> this<00:07:08.220> mounted<00:07:08.669> will

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:08.820 
concern is once i get this mounted will

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.840 
concern is once i get this mounted will
the<00:07:08.910> cats<00:07:09.150> try<00:07:09.540> to<00:07:09.889> hop<00:07:10.889> up<00:07:10.919> on<00:07:11.280> the<00:07:11.400> back<00:07:11.580> of<00:07:11.610> it

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:11.850 
the cats try to hop up on the back of it

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.150 
the cats try to hop up on the back of it
and<00:07:11.910> sleep<00:07:12.330> that'll<00:07:13.320> probably<00:07:13.530> be<00:07:13.650> something

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 
and sleep that'll probably be something

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.409 
and sleep that'll probably be something
to<00:07:14.280> a<00:07:14.520> problem<00:07:15.389> to<00:07:15.540> render<00:07:15.870> as<00:07:16.020> well<00:07:16.880> but<00:07:17.880> I'll

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:18.419 
to a problem to render as well but I'll

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:20.900 
to a problem to render as well but I'll
worry<00:07:18.630> about<00:07:18.690> that<00:07:18.840> when<00:07:19.050> I<00:07:19.139> get<00:07:19.380> to<00:07:19.560> it<00:07:19.910> but

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:20.910 
worry about that when I get to it but

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:23.420 
worry about that when I get to it but
the<00:07:21.180> whole<00:07:21.389> thing<00:07:21.690> now<00:07:21.960> I<00:07:22.320> can<00:07:22.860> lift<00:07:23.010> it<00:07:23.130> up<00:07:23.220> my

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:23.430 
the whole thing now I can lift it up my

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:30.680 
the whole thing now I can lift it up my
hand<00:07:23.700> here<00:07:26.780> probably<00:07:27.780> weighs<00:07:28.050> uh<00:07:29.360> maybe<00:07:30.360> 10

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:30.690 
hand here probably weighs uh maybe 10

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:32.480 
hand here probably weighs uh maybe 10
pounds<00:07:31.080> total<00:07:31.320> now<00:07:31.590> wants<00:07:31.919> all<00:07:32.130> the<00:07:32.280> wiring

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:32.490 
pounds total now wants all the wiring

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.090 
pounds total now wants all the wiring
stuff<00:07:32.910> in<00:07:33.180> it<00:07:33.270> might<00:07:33.389> be<00:07:33.479> up<00:07:33.570> to<00:07:33.600> 20<00:07:34.080> but<00:07:34.919> that's

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:35.100 
stuff in it might be up to 20 but that's

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.680 
stuff in it might be up to 20 but that's
not<00:07:35.280> going<00:07:35.520> to<00:07:35.610> be<00:07:35.639> too<00:07:35.880> bad<00:07:35.910> to<00:07:36.300> mount<00:07:36.510> from

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:36.690 
not going to be too bad to mount from

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:37.939 
not going to be too bad to mount from
the<00:07:36.810> ceiling<00:07:37.199> as<00:07:37.289> long<00:07:37.440> as<00:07:37.560> I<00:07:37.620> can<00:07:37.680> hit<00:07:37.830> the

00:07:37.939 --> 00:07:37.949 
the ceiling as long as I can hit the

00:07:37.949 --> 00:07:43.940 
the ceiling as long as I can hit the
studs<00:07:39.350> should<00:07:40.350> be<00:07:40.440> no<00:07:40.590> problem<00:07:41.539> so<00:07:42.800> there<00:07:43.800> it

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:43.950 
studs should be no problem so there it

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.029 
studs should be no problem so there it
is<00:07:44.039> and<00:07:44.660> hopefully<00:07:45.660> there's<00:07:46.080> no<00:07:46.200> catastrophic

00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.039 
is and hopefully there's no catastrophic

00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:49.460 
is and hopefully there's no catastrophic
crack<00:07:47.340> outs<00:07:47.580> or<00:07:47.789> anything<00:07:48.060> like<00:07:48.090> that<00:07:48.470> I'm

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:49.470 
crack outs or anything like that I'm

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:51.830 
crack outs or anything like that I'm
hitting<00:07:49.710> between<00:07:49.830> now<00:07:50.280> and<00:07:50.550> the<00:07:50.880> mounting<00:07:51.300> and

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 
hitting between now and the mounting and

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.120 
hitting between now and the mounting and
if<00:07:51.930> I<00:07:52.050> can<00:07:52.139> get<00:07:52.229> that<00:07:52.410> done<00:07:52.470> I<00:07:52.710> think<00:07:53.010> it's

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:53.130 
if I can get that done I think it's

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:55.629 
if I can get that done I think it's
going<00:07:53.220> to<00:07:53.310> be<00:07:53.430> pretty<00:07:53.610> good<00:07:54.030> and<00:07:54.330> should<00:07:54.900> be

00:07:55.629 --> 00:07:55.639 
going to be pretty good and should be

00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:59.659 
going to be pretty good and should be
pretty<00:07:56.639> much<00:07:56.760> a<00:07:56.880> done<00:07:57.150> deal<00:07:57.740> so<00:07:58.740> I<00:07:58.979> said<00:07:59.430> do<00:07:59.580> you

00:07:59.669 --> 00:08:04.670
