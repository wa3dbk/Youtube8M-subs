is<00:00:41.860> what<00:00:42.159> we<00:00:42.370> refer<00:00:42.699> to<00:00:42.729> as<00:00:42.970> a<00:00:43.150> flex<00:00:43.809> route<00:00:44.350> type

is what we refer to as a flex route type
of<00:00:45.100> transit<00:00:45.549> system<00:00:45.970> and<00:00:46.390> it<00:00:46.540> differs<00:00:46.750> from

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
of transit system and it differs from

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.259 
of transit system and it differs from
traditional<00:00:47.440> and<00:00:48.280> conventional<00:00:48.879> transit

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269

i'm going on route to prepare the buses

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.469 
i'm going on route to prepare the buses
are<00:00:59.080> able<00:00:59.440> to<00:00:59.559> deviate<00:01:00.129> off<00:01:00.430> the<00:01:00.729> route<00:01:00.940> by<00:01:01.299> as

are able to deviate off the route by as

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:04.289 
are able to deviate off the route by as

I was very pleased with it because we
were<00:01:18.820> moving<00:01:19.090> on<00:01:19.270> a<00:01:19.299> shoulder<00:01:19.659> the<00:01:19.780> bus<00:01:19.930> was

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
were moving on a shoulder the bus was

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.380 
were moving on a shoulder the bus was
moving<00:01:20.500> traffic<00:01:20.979> with<00:01:21.220> at<00:01:21.340> a<00:01:21.369> standstill<00:01:21.729> and

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.139 
without a car and bus is going on the
shoulder<00:01:31.509> are<00:01:31.690> much<00:01:32.050> faster<00:01:32.409> than<00:01:33.340> sitting<00:01:34.030> in

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
shoulder are much faster than sitting in

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.950 
shoulder are much faster than sitting in
the<00:01:34.270> traffic<00:01:35.940> transit<00:01:36.940> can<00:01:37.060> be<00:01:37.180> fast<00:01:37.509> it<00:01:37.840> can

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
the traffic transit can be fast it can

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.870 
the traffic transit can be fast it can
be<00:01:38.110> reliable<00:01:38.649> it<00:01:38.860> can<00:01:39.009> be<00:01:39.130> comfortable<00:01:39.430> all

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
be reliable it can be comfortable all

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.670 
be reliable it can be comfortable all
things<00:01:40.450> that<00:01:40.630> people<00:01:41.020> are<00:01:41.140> looking<00:01:41.200> for<00:01:41.590> to

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
things that people are looking for to

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.740 
things that people are looking for to
get<00:01:41.770> out<00:01:41.920> of<00:01:41.950> their<00:01:42.130> cars<00:01:42.369> well<00:01:43.090> I<00:01:43.119> get<00:01:43.509> to<00:01:43.630> work

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
get out of their cars well I get to work

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.399 
get out of their cars well I get to work
faster<00:01:44.290> then<00:01:44.770> taking<00:01:45.369> my<00:01:45.520> car

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
faster then taking my car

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.039 
faster then taking my car
I<00:01:47.469> think<00:01:48.219> it's<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.399> way<00:01:48.609> for<00:01:48.820> the<00:01:48.909> future
