00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.880 

hello<00:00:01.170> everybody<00:00:01.890> is<00:00:02.520> almost<00:00:03.149> draft<00:00:03.689> time<00:00:04.080> but

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
hello everybody is almost draft time but

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.380 
hello everybody is almost draft time but
it's<00:00:05.040> almost<00:00:05.220> a<00:00:05.520> done<00:00:05.730> deal<00:00:06.000> we're<00:00:06.210> going<00:00:06.330> to

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
it's almost a done deal we're going to

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.480 
it's almost a done deal we're going to
have<00:00:06.509> to<00:00:06.600> get<00:00:06.690> offensive<00:00:07.080> lineman<00:00:07.620> since<00:00:08.220> blow

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
have to get offensive lineman since blow

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.419 
have to get offensive lineman since blow
I<00:00:08.730> mean<00:00:08.940> it's<00:00:09.360> either<00:00:10.230> offensive<00:00:10.740> linemen<00:00:11.219> are

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
I mean it's either offensive linemen are

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.580 
I mean it's either offensive linemen are
possibly<00:00:12.300> safety<00:00:12.780> but<00:00:12.929> I<00:00:13.019> think<00:00:13.230> you<00:00:13.320> can<00:00:13.349> get

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
possibly safety but I think you can get

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.160 
possibly safety but I think you can get
some<00:00:13.710> values<00:00:14.099> at<00:00:14.280> safety<00:00:14.880> later<00:00:15.089> on<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.570> think

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
some values at safety later on I think

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.380 
some values at safety later on I think
if<00:00:16.740> you<00:00:17.010> want<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.250> protect<00:00:17.550> Tony<00:00:17.820> Romo<00:00:18.210> you

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
if you want to protect Tony Romo you

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.390 
if you want to protect Tony Romo you
need<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.690> get<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.869> quality<00:00:19.230> offensive<00:00:20.010> lineman

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
need to get a quality offensive lineman

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.830 
need to get a quality offensive lineman
that<00:00:20.550> could<00:00:20.640> come<00:00:20.880> in<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.300> play<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:22.529> know<00:00:22.710> to

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
that could come in and play you know to

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.000 
that could come in and play you know to
to<00:00:24.840> put<00:00:25.080> so<00:00:25.500> much<00:00:25.910> faith<00:00:26.910> in<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:28.109> unit<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.619> was

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
to put so much faith in a unit that was

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.009 
to put so much faith in a unit that was
probably<00:00:29.310> our<00:00:29.490> weakest<00:00:30.150> as<00:00:30.330> far<00:00:30.539> as<00:00:30.689> depth

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
probably our weakest as far as depth

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.520 
probably our weakest as far as depth
last<00:00:31.590> year<00:00:31.980> um<00:00:32.149> this<00:00:33.149> year<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.600> really<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.140> scary

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
last year um this year is really a scary

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.860 
last year um this year is really a scary
movie<00:00:34.890> especially<00:00:35.010> when<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.820> don't<00:00:36.329> know<00:00:36.540> about

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
movie especially when I don't know about

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.619 
movie especially when I don't know about
you<00:00:37.380> but<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.890> feel<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.520> offensive<00:00:38.850> line<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.480> the

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
you but I feel the offensive line is the

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.369 
you but I feel the offensive line is the
most<00:00:39.930> important<00:00:40.680> unit<00:00:41.460> on<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.030> field<00:00:42.379> period

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
most important unit on the field period

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.049 
most important unit on the field period
more<00:00:43.890> importantly<00:00:44.280> quarterback<00:00:44.789> more

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
more importantly quarterback more

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.010 
more importantly quarterback more
important<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.390> running<00:00:45.660> back<00:00:45.809> more

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
important and running back more

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.360 
important and running back more
important<00:00:46.379> receiver<00:00:46.710> more<00:00:47.010> important<00:00:47.309> than

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
important receiver more important than

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.920 
important receiver more important than
all<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.789> stuff<00:00:48.059> because<00:00:48.360> if<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.570> offensive

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
all that stuff because if the offensive

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.260 
all that stuff because if the offensive
line<00:00:49.050> don't<00:00:49.379> get<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.649> job<00:00:49.890> done<00:00:50.059> nobody<00:00:51.059> else

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
line don't get that job done nobody else

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.330 
line don't get that job done nobody else
can<00:00:51.449> do<00:00:51.629> there's<00:00:51.870> an<00:00:52.110> offensive<00:00:52.920> line<00:00:53.100> can

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
can do there's an offensive line can

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.740 
can do there's an offensive line can
make<00:00:53.489> an<00:00:53.610> average<00:00:54.030> quarterback<00:00:54.390> in<00:00:54.660> the
