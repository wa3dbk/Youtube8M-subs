00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.370 
machine and this is a scrap head for us
because<00:00:19.680> it's<00:00:19.949> just<00:00:20.160> been<00:00:21.199> fiddled<00:00:22.199> about

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
because it's just been fiddled about

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.060 
because it's just been fiddled about
with<00:00:22.560> way<00:00:22.830> too<00:00:22.859> much<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:24.470> it's<00:00:25.470> got<00:00:25.680> several

with way too much and it's got several

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.099 
with way too much and it's got several
problems<00:00:26.310> but<00:00:26.880> we're<00:00:27.390> going<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.630> use<00:00:27.750> this<00:00:27.900> as

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
problems but we're going to use this as

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.900 
problems but we're going to use this as
kind<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.470> test<00:00:28.650> mule<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.279> what<00:00:29.789> we've

Formula<00:00:51.899> One<00:00:52.050> plugs<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.530> they<00:00:52.649> used<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.980> use

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
Formula One plugs that they used to use

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.920 
Formula One plugs that they used to use
years<00:00:53.579> ago<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:54.000> fact<00:00:54.180> I'm<00:00:54.360> sure<00:00:54.539> they're

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
years ago in fact I'm sure they're

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.299 
years ago in fact I'm sure they're
probably<00:00:55.110> still<00:00:55.379> using<00:00:55.680> something<00:00:55.920> similar

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
probably still using something similar

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.430 
probably still using something similar
to<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.520> even<00:00:56.879> today

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
to this even today

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
to this even today
so<00:00:58.440> let's<00:00:58.590> take<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.770> look<00:00:58.920> at<00:00:59.070> what<00:00:59.190> we're<00:00:59.340> doing

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
so let's take a look at what we're doing

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.529 
so let's take a look at what we're doing
here<00:01:01.520> what<00:01:02.520> we've<00:01:02.699> done<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:03.120> we've<00:01:03.300> made<00:01:03.510> a

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
here what we've done is we've made a

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.700 
here what we've done is we've made a
little<00:01:04.409> piece<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:05.960> go<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.110> where<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.409> spark

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
little piece to go in where the spark

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.460 
little piece to go in where the spark
plug<00:01:07.920> goes<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.760> close<00:01:08.970> off<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.420> hole<00:01:09.630> and

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
plug goes in to close off that hole and

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.590 
plug goes in to close off that hole and
we've<00:01:10.650> drilled<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:11.250> couple<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.760> 10<00:01:12.180> millimeter

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
we've drilled a couple of 10 millimeter

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.399 
we've drilled a couple of 10 millimeter
holes<00:01:13.500> for<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.130> new<00:01:14.549> plugs<00:01:15.049> now<00:01:16.049> I'm<00:01:16.229> doing

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
holes for the new plugs now I'm doing

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:16.969 
holes for the new plugs now I'm doing
this

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
this

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.950 
this
we<00:01:17.159> found<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.729> we<00:01:17.880> went<00:01:18.119> into<00:01:18.270> water<00:01:18.630> over

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
we found that we went into water over

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.450 
we found that we went into water over
here<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.890> problem<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.280> we'll

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
here so this is a problem that we'll

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.240 
here so this is a problem that we'll
have<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.790> address<00:01:21.000> by<00:01:21.330> welding<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:22.320> we

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
have to address by welding and we

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.620 
have to address by welding and we
suspect<00:01:23.729> we're<00:01:23.880> going<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.060> have<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.330> do<00:01:24.450> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
suspect we're going to have to do the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.480 
suspect we're going to have to do the
same<00:01:24.840> thing<00:01:25.080> over<00:01:25.259> here<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.799> side<00:01:26.100> here

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
same thing over here on this side here

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.490 
same thing over here on this side here
now<00:01:27.259> that<00:01:28.259> means<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.799> couple<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.490> welds<00:01:29.909> here

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
now that means a couple of welds here

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.050 
now that means a couple of welds here
this<00:01:31.500> little<00:01:31.890> cavity<00:01:32.310> right<00:01:32.490> here<00:01:32.729> should<00:01:32.970> be

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
this little cavity right here should be

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.359 
this little cavity right here should be
filled<00:01:33.329> up<00:01:33.509> as<00:01:33.689> well<00:01:33.960> which<00:01:34.740> we<00:01:34.920> found<00:01:35.159> out

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
filled up as well which we found out

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.330 
filled up as well which we found out
over<00:01:35.610> here<00:01:35.729> our<00:01:35.880> threads<00:01:36.390> are<00:01:36.540> way<00:01:36.659> too<00:01:36.720> close

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
over here our threads are way too close

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.130 
over here our threads are way too close
as<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.549> can<00:01:38.670> see<00:01:38.790> on<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:38.970> cylinder<00:01:39.869> head<00:01:40.020> the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
as you can see on this cylinder head the

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.800 
as you can see on this cylinder head the
spark<00:01:40.439> plugs<00:01:40.680> whacked<00:01:40.950> out<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.600> but<00:01:42.600> let's

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
spark plugs whacked out on it but let's

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.450 
spark plugs whacked out on it but let's
take<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.049> look<00:01:43.229> on<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.500> inside<00:01:43.619> here<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.310> see

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
take a look on the inside here and see

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.770 
take a look on the inside here and see
what<00:01:44.549> we've<00:01:44.670> got<00:01:45.770> as<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.860> can<00:01:47.159> see<00:01:47.490> our<00:01:48.450> new

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
what we've got as you can see our new

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.109 
what we've got as you can see our new
plug<00:01:49.140> holes<00:01:49.490> I'm<00:01:50.490> going<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.759> go<00:01:50.820> ahead<00:01:50.909> and

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
plug holes I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.580 
plug holes I'm going to go ahead and
install<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.570> plugs<00:01:54.020> well<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.290> what<00:01:55.500> it

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
install the plugs well this is what it

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.730 
install the plugs well this is what it
looks<00:01:55.740> like<00:01:55.920> with<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.159> plugs<00:01:56.490> installed

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
looks like with the plugs installed

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.959 
looks like with the plugs installed
let's<00:01:58.740> turn<00:01:58.920> this<00:01:59.040> back<00:01:59.310> around<00:01:59.340> like<00:01:59.640> this

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
let's turn this back around like this

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.109 
let's turn this back around like this
you<00:02:00.450> can<00:02:00.659> see<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.990> plugs<00:02:01.610> go<00:02:02.610> side<00:02:02.909> by<00:02:03.090> each

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
you can see the plugs go side by each

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.359 
you can see the plugs go side by each
real<00:02:03.659> nice<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.380> we<00:02:04.680> did<00:02:04.829> leave<00:02:05.040> enough<00:02:05.280> room

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
real nice and we did leave enough room

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.999 
real nice and we did leave enough room
in<00:02:05.640> there<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:06.090> get<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.390> socket<00:02:06.719> that's<00:02:07.680> why<00:02:07.860> we

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
in there to get a socket that's why we

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.740 
in there to get a socket that's why we
had<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.190> cut<00:02:08.429> this<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.670> little<00:02:08.940> large<00:02:09.119> over<00:02:09.509> here

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
had to cut this a little large over here

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.330 
had to cut this a little large over here
and<00:02:09.929> that's<00:02:10.080> why<00:02:10.259> we<00:02:10.410> went<00:02:10.560> into<00:02:10.709> water

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
and that's why we went into water

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.370 
and that's why we went into water
that's<00:02:12.940> what<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.209> plug<00:02:13.390> situation<00:02:14.110> is<00:02:14.200> going

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
that's what the plug situation is going

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.070 
that's what the plug situation is going
to<00:02:14.440> look<00:02:14.530> like<00:02:15.569> you<00:02:16.569> might<00:02:16.720> be<00:02:16.840> asking

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
to look like you might be asking

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.780 
to look like you might be asking
yourself<00:02:17.440> well<00:02:17.620> why<00:02:18.190> do<00:02:18.250> you<00:02:18.340> want<00:02:18.550> dual

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
yourself well why do you want dual

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.850 
yourself well why do you want dual
ignition<00:02:19.270> this<00:02:19.750> is<00:02:19.959> an<00:02:20.110> airplane<00:02:20.590> what<00:02:20.739> do<00:02:20.800> you

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
ignition this is an airplane what do you

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.800 
ignition this is an airplane what do you
have<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.190> have<00:02:21.370> dual<00:02:21.640> ignition<00:02:22.150> yeah<00:02:22.540> you're

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
have to have dual ignition yeah you're

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.350 
have to have dual ignition yeah you're
right<00:02:23.069> well<00:02:24.069> I<00:02:24.099> used<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.340> have<00:02:24.430> a<00:02:24.520> 3,500

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
right well I used to have a 3,500

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.860 
right well I used to have a 3,500
Maserati<00:02:26.550> with<00:02:27.550> a<00:02:27.610> straight-6<00:02:28.330> that<00:02:28.540> had<00:02:28.690> dual

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
Maserati with a straight-6 that had dual

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.640 
Maserati with a straight-6 that had dual
ignition<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:29.730> had<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.930> ignition<00:02:31.930> system<00:02:32.170> so

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
ignition and had the ignition system so

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.979 
ignition and had the ignition system so
I<00:02:32.680> could<00:02:32.950> actually<00:02:33.069> pull<00:02:33.550> them<00:02:33.700> I<00:02:33.970> want<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:34.810> say

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
I could actually pull them I want to say

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.600 
I could actually pull them I want to say
pull<00:02:35.230> them<00:02:35.380> but<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:35.620> could<00:02:35.800> actually<00:02:36.130> disable

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
pull them but I could actually disable

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.910 
pull them but I could actually disable
one<00:02:36.760> over<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.209> other<00:02:37.239> and<00:02:37.599> you<00:02:38.530> can<00:02:38.680> certainly

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
one over the other and you can certainly

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.790 
one over the other and you can certainly
tell<00:02:39.250> a<00:02:39.280> difference<00:02:39.840> when<00:02:40.840> you<00:02:41.019> shut<00:02:41.319> off<00:02:41.349> one

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
tell a difference when you shut off one

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.410 
tell a difference when you shut off one
side<00:02:42.010> of<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.280> ignition<00:02:42.519> and<00:02:42.880> just<00:02:43.090> went<00:02:43.269> to<00:02:43.390> a

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
side of the ignition and just went to a

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.110 
side of the ignition and just went to a
single<00:02:43.840> ignition<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:45.190> idea<00:02:45.549> is<00:02:45.730> that<00:02:45.940> you're

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
single ignition the idea is that you're

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.729 
single ignition the idea is that you're
going<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.330> have<00:02:46.510> a<00:02:46.540> few<00:02:46.840> extra<00:02:46.870> degrees<00:02:47.470> of

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
going to have a few extra degrees of

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.670 
going to have a few extra degrees of
burn<00:02:48.010> time<00:02:48.370> on<00:02:48.640> your<00:02:49.540> air<00:02:49.720> fuel<00:02:50.019> mixture<00:02:50.049> and

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
burn time on your air fuel mixture and

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.610 
burn time on your air fuel mixture and
the<00:02:51.400> combustion<00:02:51.730> chamber<00:02:52.269> which<00:02:53.080> is<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.319> real

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
the combustion chamber which is a real

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.150 
the combustion chamber which is a real
positive<00:02:53.830> thing<00:02:54.870> so<00:02:55.870> anyway<00:02:56.200> this<00:02:56.799> is<00:02:56.980> what

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
positive thing so anyway this is what

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.699 
positive thing so anyway this is what
puts<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:57.489> research<00:02:58.360> and<00:02:58.599> development<00:02:59.049> in<00:02:59.230> R&amp;D

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
puts the research and development in R&amp;D

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.039 
puts the research and development in R&amp;D
here<00:03:00.120> well<00:03:01.120> I'm<00:03:01.299> guessing<00:03:01.540> that<00:03:01.870> you're

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
here well I'm guessing that you're

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:03.960 
here well I'm guessing that you're
trying<00:03:02.470> to<00:03:02.560> figure<00:03:03.370> out<00:03:03.400> how<00:03:03.610> we're<00:03:03.790> going<00:03:03.910> to

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
trying to figure out how we're going to

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.710 
trying to figure out how we're going to
actually<00:03:04.380> fire<00:03:05.380> these<00:03:05.620> two<00:03:05.860> plugs<00:03:06.160> at<00:03:06.310> once

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
actually fire these two plugs at once

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.970 
actually fire these two plugs at once
that's<00:03:07.720> a<00:03:07.870> good<00:03:07.989> question<00:03:08.470> because<00:03:08.590> you<00:03:08.830> need

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
that's a good question because you need

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.220 
that's a good question because you need
to<00:03:09.069> have<00:03:09.220> a<00:03:09.330> distributor<00:03:10.330> or<00:03:10.510> pair<00:03:11.140> of

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
to have a distributor or pair of

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.860 
to have a distributor or pair of
distributors<00:03:11.799> to<00:03:12.010> do<00:03:12.190> that<00:03:12.569> well<00:03:13.569> what<00:03:13.750> we

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
distributors to do that well what we

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.539 
distributors to do that well what we
found<00:03:14.110> is<00:03:14.290> we<00:03:14.410> found<00:03:14.620> this<00:03:14.769> distributor<00:03:15.370> here

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
found is we found this distributor here

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.690 
found is we found this distributor here
and<00:03:16.260> it's<00:03:17.260> actually<00:03:17.470> a<00:03:17.739> dual<00:03:18.160> ignition

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
and it's actually a dual ignition

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.630 
and it's actually a dual ignition
distributor<00:03:19.209> we<00:03:19.269> got<00:03:19.420> this<00:03:19.739> online<00:03:20.739> out<00:03:21.519> of<00:03:21.609> a

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
distributor we got this online out of a

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.289 
distributor we got this online out of a
junkyard<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:22.829> as<00:03:23.829> the<00:03:24.130> electronic<00:03:24.910> control

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
junkyard and as the electronic control

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:26.729 
junkyard and as the electronic control
module<00:03:25.450> on<00:03:25.780> it<00:03:25.900> which<00:03:26.019> will<00:03:26.200> amplify<00:03:26.470> the

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
module on it which will amplify the

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.910 
module on it which will amplify the
voltage<00:03:27.280> and<00:03:27.549> the<00:03:28.480> distributor<00:03:29.019> cap<00:03:29.049> on<00:03:29.560> the

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
voltage and the distributor cap on the

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.479 
voltage and the distributor cap on the
rotor<00:03:30.130> right<00:03:30.310> here<00:03:30.549> you<00:03:30.819> can<00:03:30.910> see<00:03:31.090> there's<00:03:31.420> two

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
rotor right here you can see there's two

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.809 
rotor right here you can see there's two
contact<00:03:33.489> points<00:03:33.850> on<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.060> rotor<00:03:34.269> and<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:36.190> cap

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
contact points on the rotor and the cap

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.430 
contact points on the rotor and the cap
itself<00:03:37.480> has<00:03:39.510> two<00:03:40.510> places<00:03:40.840> where<00:03:41.200> the

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
itself has two places where the

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.240 
itself has two places where the
high-tension<00:03:42.040> goes<00:03:42.400> in<00:03:42.700> and<00:03:43.769> two<00:03:44.769> sets<00:03:45.069> of

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
high-tension goes in and two sets of

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.210 
high-tension goes in and two sets of
leads<00:03:45.730> that<00:03:45.940> are<00:03:46.329> opposing<00:03:46.660> each<00:03:46.900> other<00:03:47.260> so

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
leads that are opposing each other so

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.680 
leads that are opposing each other so
all<00:03:48.400> we<00:03:48.519> have<00:03:48.670> to<00:03:48.880> do<00:03:49.030> now<00:03:49.209> is<00:03:49.480> to<00:03:50.380> adapt<00:03:51.690> this

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
all we have to do now is to adapt this

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.990 
all we have to do now is to adapt this
distributor<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:55.810> our<00:03:55.989> Fiat<00:03:56.819> we've<00:03:57.819> already

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
distributor to our Fiat we've already

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.550 
distributor to our Fiat we've already
been<00:03:58.209> working<00:03:58.389> on<00:03:58.630> this<00:03:58.810> we<00:03:59.019> got<00:03:59.170> a<00:03:59.200> little

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
been working on this we got a little

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.379 
been working on this we got a little
different<00:04:01.079> mechanism<00:04:02.079> down<00:04:02.260> here<00:04:02.560> for<00:04:02.859> the

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
different mechanism down here for the

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.660 
different mechanism down here for the
coupling<00:04:04.389> with<00:04:04.569> the<00:04:04.750> engine<00:04:05.340> for<00:04:06.340> Volkswagen

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
coupling with the engine for Volkswagen

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.030 
coupling with the engine for Volkswagen
so<00:04:07.269> we're<00:04:07.569> actually<00:04:07.750> working<00:04:08.049> on<00:04:08.319> this<00:04:08.560> for<00:04:09.010> a

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
so we're actually working on this for a
