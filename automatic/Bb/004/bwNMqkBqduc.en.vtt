now<00:00:33.680> we're<00:00:33.800> going<00:00:33.920> to<00:00:33.980> take<00:00:34.160> a<00:00:34.190> look<00:00:34.460> at<00:00:34.580> how<00:00:34.670> we

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
now we're going to take a look at how we

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.390 
now we're going to take a look at how we
store<00:00:35.210> information<00:00:35.510> in<00:00:36.170> the<00:00:36.290> PC<00:00:36.770> in<00:00:37.160> our

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400 
store information in the PC in our

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.400 
store information in the PC in our
previous<00:00:37.820> example<00:00:38.450> we<00:00:38.630> saw<00:00:38.870> that<00:00:38.900> there<00:00:39.290> were

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
previous example we saw that there were

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.200 
previous example we saw that there were
two<00:00:39.440> different<00:00:40.370> locations<00:00:40.520> where

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
two different locations where

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.540 
two different locations where
information<00:00:41.510> was<00:00:41.990> stored<00:00:42.260> and<00:00:42.890> the<00:00:42.950> processor

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
information was stored and the processor

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.510 
information was stored and the processor
is<00:00:43.670> responsible<00:00:43.850> for<00:00:44.840> calculating

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
is responsible for calculating

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.470 
is responsible for calculating
information<00:00:46.520> but<00:00:46.640> it's<00:00:46.760> not<00:00:46.850> responsible<00:00:47.360> for

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
information but it's not responsible for

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.230 
information but it's not responsible for
storing<00:00:48.290> that<00:00:48.470> information<00:00:48.760> so<00:00:49.760> instead<00:00:50.060> the

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:50.240 
storing that information so instead the

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.350 
storing that information so instead the
processor<00:00:50.720> is<00:00:50.780> going<00:00:50.930> to<00:00:50.990> rely<00:00:51.320> on<00:00:51.350> two<00:00:51.920> other

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
processor is going to rely on two other

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.870 
processor is going to rely on two other
components<00:00:53.360> to<00:00:53.780> retrieve<00:00:54.350> the<00:00:54.950> data<00:00:55.160> and<00:00:55.490> then

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
components to retrieve the data and then

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.870 
components to retrieve the data and then
to<00:00:56.180> have<00:00:57.020> it<00:00:57.080> in<00:00:57.410> a<00:00:57.530> location<00:00:58.160> when<00:00:58.520> it's<00:00:58.670> up

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
to have it in a location when it's up

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.760 
to have it in a location when it's up
and<00:00:59.060> running<00:00:59.390> now<00:00:59.540> memory<00:01:00.050> is<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:00.500> first

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
and running now memory is the first

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.700 
and running now memory is the first
memory<00:01:01.310> is<00:01:01.340> referred<00:01:01.760> to<00:01:01.790> as<00:01:02.180> primary<00:01:02.870> storage

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
memory is referred to as primary storage

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.090 
memory is referred to as primary storage
memory<00:01:04.550> holds<00:01:05.540> the<00:01:05.690> contents<00:01:06.380> of<00:01:06.500> programs

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
memory holds the contents of programs

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.000 
memory holds the contents of programs
that<00:01:07.340> are<00:01:07.400> currently<00:01:07.729> running<00:01:08.710> so<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:09.830> more

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
that are currently running so the more

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.370 
that are currently running so the more
memory<00:01:10.340> your<00:01:10.550> computer<00:01:11.000> has<00:01:11.270> that<00:01:11.840> means<00:01:12.110> the

more programs you can be running at the
same<00:01:15.710> time<00:01:16.130> it's<00:01:16.430> a<00:01:16.490> very<00:01:16.520> common

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
same time it's a very common

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.109 
same time it's a very common
misconception<00:01:18.170> that<00:01:18.200> I've<00:01:18.500> found<00:01:18.800> to<00:01:19.160> say

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
misconception that I've found to say

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.300 
misconception that I've found to say
while<00:01:20.330> I<00:01:20.360> was<00:01:20.600> not<00:01:20.780> able<00:01:21.020> to<00:01:21.380> download<00:01:21.710> this

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
while I was not able to download this

while I was not able to download this
program<00:01:22.640> I<00:01:23.300> was<00:01:23.869> not<00:01:24.020> able<00:01:24.229> to<00:01:24.350> copy<00:01:25.250> this<00:01:25.700> file

off of a CD or dvd onto my disk because

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.570 
off of a CD or dvd onto my disk because
I<00:01:29.240> didn't<00:01:29.780> have<00:01:30.050> enough<00:01:30.410> memory<00:01:30.860> that's

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
I didn't have enough memory that's

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.520 
I didn't have enough memory that's
actually<00:01:32.090> an<00:01:32.180> inaccurate<00:01:32.630> statement<00:01:33.380> it's

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
actually an inaccurate statement it's

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.320 
actually an inaccurate statement it's
logical<00:01:34.190> because<00:01:34.400> it's<00:01:34.880> kind<00:01:35.060> of<00:01:35.090> how<00:01:35.270> we

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
logical because it's kind of how we

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.710 
logical because it's kind of how we
think<00:01:35.570> but<00:01:36.530> memory<00:01:37.039> is<00:01:37.130> non<00:01:37.759> permanent

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
think but memory is non permanent

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.100 
think but memory is non permanent
storage<00:01:39.229> it's<00:01:40.009> storage<00:01:40.670> locations<00:01:41.390> just<00:01:41.869> when

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
storage it's storage locations just when

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.100 
storage it's storage locations just when
the<00:01:42.770> programs<00:01:43.729> are<00:01:43.940> up<00:01:44.090> and<00:01:44.270> running<00:01:44.420> think

the programs are up and running think
back<00:01:45.289> to<00:01:45.440> the<00:01:45.530> example<00:01:45.679> the<00:01:46.520> processor

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
back to the example the processor

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.660 
back to the example the processor
located<00:01:48.259> the<00:01:48.440> program<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.190> calculator

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
located the program the calculator

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.029 
located the program the calculator
program<00:01:50.149> on<00:01:50.330> the<00:01:50.600> hard<00:01:50.869> drive<00:01:51.200> that's<00:01:51.679> where

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
program on the hard drive that's where

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.950 
program on the hard drive that's where
it<00:01:52.130> was<00:01:52.220> actually<00:01:52.700> stored<00:01:53.030> and<00:01:53.390> then<00:01:53.840> it

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
it was actually stored and then it

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.770 
it was actually stored and then it
brought<00:01:54.229> it<00:01:54.410> in<00:01:54.590> to<00:01:54.830> a<00:01:54.860> location<00:01:55.310> in<00:01:55.640> memory<00:01:55.970> so

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
brought it in to a location in memory so

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.180 
brought it in to a location in memory so
that<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.080> processor<00:01:57.679> could<00:01:57.860> send

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
that the processor could send

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.340 
that the processor could send
information<00:01:58.490> back<00:01:59.119> and<00:01:59.179> forth<00:01:59.450> with<00:02:00.319> that

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
information back and forth with that

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.430 
information back and forth with that
program<00:02:01.100> we<00:02:01.880> call<00:02:02.090> memory<00:02:02.300> primary<00:02:03.080> storage

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440

the other hand provide what's known as
secondary<00:02:19.819> storage<00:02:20.270> and<00:02:20.569> it's<00:02:20.780> a<00:02:20.900> permanent

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
around you store it on the hard drive

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.309 
around you store it on the hard drive
okay<00:02:28.459> that<00:02:28.970> way<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.270> remains<00:02:29.660> there<00:02:29.959> and<00:02:30.200> it

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
okay that way it remains there and it

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.690 
okay that way it remains there and it
remains<00:02:30.590> there<00:02:30.770> until<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:31.130> next<00:02:31.310> time<00:02:31.520> you

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
remains there until the next time you

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.309 
remains there until the next time you
run<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:31.970> program<00:02:32.150> every<00:02:32.840> time<00:02:32.959> you<00:02:33.110> run<00:02:33.260> the

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
run the program every time you run the

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.309 
run the program every time you run the
program<00:02:33.440> or<00:02:34.010> you<00:02:34.040> open<00:02:34.250> a<00:02:34.520> document<00:02:34.900> then<00:02:35.900> that

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
program or you open a document then that

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.140 
program or you open a document then that
information<00:02:37.130> that<00:02:37.310> document<00:02:37.910> or<00:02:38.000> that

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
information that document or that

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.940 
information that document or that
program<00:02:38.390> is<00:02:38.810> placed<00:02:39.140> into<00:02:39.500> a<00:02:39.590> specific

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
program is placed into a specific

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.720 
program is placed into a specific
location<00:02:40.760> in<00:02:41.180> memory

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
location in memory

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.260 
location in memory
and<00:02:42.000> that's<00:02:42.540> how<00:02:42.750> I'm<00:02:42.900> accessing<00:02:43.379> it<00:02:43.819> but<00:02:44.819> the

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
and that's how I'm accessing it but the

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.570 
and that's how I'm accessing it but the
permanent<00:02:45.660> storage<00:02:46.050> is<00:02:46.500> always<00:02:47.069> on<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.340> drive

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
permanent storage is always on the drive

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.670 
permanent storage is always on the drive
so<00:02:47.819> it<00:02:47.940> doesn't<00:02:48.150> matter<00:02:48.239> what<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.660> is<00:02:48.870> if<00:02:49.440> it's

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
so it doesn't matter what it is if it's

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.670 
so it doesn't matter what it is if it's
documents<00:02:50.340> pictures<00:02:50.519> musics<00:02:51.360> video<00:02:51.690> anything

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
documents pictures musics video anything

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.030 
documents pictures musics video anything
that<00:02:53.220> is<00:02:53.370> saved<00:02:53.870> permanently<00:02:54.870> on<00:02:55.410> your<00:02:55.590> system

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
that is saved permanently on your system

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.770 
that is saved permanently on your system
is<00:02:56.220> saved<00:02:56.580> on<00:02:56.879> the<00:02:57.030> hard<00:02:57.239> drive

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
is saved on the hard drive

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.020 
is saved on the hard drive
now<00:02:58.530> there's<00:02:58.769> other<00:02:58.920> means<00:02:59.250> of<00:02:59.519> permanently

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
now there's other means of permanently

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.600 
now there's other means of permanently
storing<00:03:00.390> information<00:03:01.280> that<00:03:02.280> are<00:03:02.400> not

hard-disk<00:03:03.180> drives<00:03:03.510> but<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.870> hard<00:03:04.050> disk<00:03:04.260> drive

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.890 
hard-disk drives but the hard disk drive
is<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.769> one<00:03:04.950> that<00:03:05.190> is<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.340> kind<00:03:06.209> of<00:03:06.300> a<00:03:06.390> permanent

machine as well most will have one drive
these<00:03:15.959> are<00:03:16.170> what<00:03:16.560> known<00:03:16.799> as<00:03:17.040> optical<00:03:17.340> drives

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
these are what known as optical drives

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.350 
these are what known as optical drives
that<00:03:19.080> will<00:03:19.380> have<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:19.920> ability<00:03:20.010> to<00:03:20.489> play<00:03:20.849> both

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
ability to burn CDs and DVDs what do we

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.520 
ability to burn CDs and DVDs what do we
mean<00:03:26.880> by<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.150> term<00:03:27.299> burn<00:03:27.900> well<00:03:28.230> that<00:03:28.349> just

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
mean by the term burn well that just

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.009 
mean by the term burn well that just
means<00:03:28.799> that<00:03:29.010> I<00:03:29.069> can<00:03:29.340> write<00:03:29.790> information<00:03:30.209> to<00:03:30.900> it

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
means that I can write information to it

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.550 
means that I can write information to it
I<00:03:31.110> can<00:03:31.170> save<00:03:31.940> data<00:03:32.940> on<00:03:33.269> it<00:03:33.540> just<00:03:34.140> like<00:03:34.200> I<00:03:34.410> could

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
I can save data on it just like I could

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.800 
I can save data on it just like I could
save<00:03:34.739> data<00:03:34.980> on<00:03:35.190> a<00:03:35.220> hard<00:03:35.340> drive<00:03:35.849> now<00:03:36.750> the

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
save data on a hard drive now the

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:37.970 
save data on a hard drive now the
process<00:03:37.290> is<00:03:37.380> gonna<00:03:37.470> be<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.680> little<00:03:37.799> bit

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
process is gonna be a little bit

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.430 
process is gonna be a little bit
different<00:03:38.310> with<00:03:38.459> CDs<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:38.970> DVDs<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:40.079> idea

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
different with CDs and DVDs and the idea

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.830 
different with CDs and DVDs and the idea
is<00:03:40.769> that<00:03:41.010> they<00:03:41.190> are<00:03:41.370> portable<00:03:41.849> they're<00:03:42.299> mobile

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
is that they are portable they're mobile

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.080 
is that they are portable they're mobile
I<00:03:43.019> can<00:03:43.440> move<00:03:43.650> them<00:03:44.010> and<00:03:44.220> take<00:03:44.430> them<00:03:44.670> from<00:03:44.819> one

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
I can move them and take them from one

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.970 
I can move them and take them from one
computer<00:03:45.450> to<00:03:45.599> another<00:03:45.750> I<00:03:46.139> can<00:03:46.470> take<00:03:46.650> them<00:03:46.829> to<00:03:46.950> a

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
computer to another I can take them to a

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.280 
computer to another I can take them to a
different<00:03:47.220> location<00:03:47.549> so<00:03:48.209> they<00:03:48.329> usually<00:03:48.600> are

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
different location so they usually are

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.470 
different location so they usually are
providing<00:03:49.950> a<00:03:50.069> method<00:03:50.459> of<00:03:50.670> backing<00:03:51.299> up

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
providing a method of backing up

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.379 
providing a method of backing up
information<00:03:52.139> or<00:03:52.709> copying<00:03:53.670> information<00:03:54.209> from

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
information or copying information from

the<00:05:41.870> primary<00:05:42.199> one<00:05:42.800> let's<00:05:43.490> do<00:05:43.610> a<00:05:43.639> little<00:05:43.819> bit<00:05:44.059> of

00:05:44.079 --> 00:05:44.089 
the primary one let's do a little bit of

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:45.999 
the primary one let's do a little bit of
a<00:05:44.300> compare<00:05:44.749> and<00:05:44.779> contrast<00:05:44.990> between<00:05:45.559> memory

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:48.979 
and disk drives again we get this false

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:52.209 
and disk drives again we get this false

idea that the more memory we have the

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:54.820 
idea that the more memory we have the
more<00:05:52.370> information<00:05:52.879> I<00:05:52.969> can<00:05:53.180> save<00:05:53.589> and<00:05:54.589> that's

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
more information I can save and that's

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.859 
more information I can save and that's
just<00:05:55.069> not<00:05:55.189> true<00:05:55.639> because<00:05:55.909> of<00:05:56.119> the<00:05:56.240> way<00:05:56.449> memory

00:05:56.859 --> 00:05:56.869 
just not true because of the way memory

00:05:56.869 --> 00:05:59.199 
just not true because of the way memory
is<00:05:57.050> used<00:05:57.319> versus<00:05:57.800> the<00:05:57.949> way<00:05:58.069> a<00:05:58.309> disk<00:05:58.789> drive<00:05:58.849> is

00:05:59.199 --> 00:05:59.209 
is used versus the way a disk drive is

00:05:59.209 --> 00:06:01.839 
is used versus the way a disk drive is
used<00:05:59.240> so<00:06:00.050> with<00:06:00.229> memory<00:06:00.620> the<00:06:01.009> information<00:06:01.699> is

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:01.849 
used so with memory the information is

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:03.760 
used so with memory the information is
not<00:06:01.999> permanent<00:06:02.689> and<00:06:02.779> what<00:06:03.080> we<00:06:03.199> mean<00:06:03.439> by<00:06:03.740> that

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
not permanent and what we mean by that

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.790 
not permanent and what we mean by that
is<00:06:04.219> it's<00:06:04.909> lost<00:06:05.300> when<00:06:05.839> the<00:06:05.990> computer<00:06:06.499> shuts

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
is it's lost when the computer shuts

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.939 
is it's lost when the computer shuts
down<00:06:06.949> now<00:06:07.759> most<00:06:08.209> of<00:06:08.330> us<00:06:08.449> go<00:06:08.659> that's<00:06:09.349> we<00:06:09.919> think

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:09.949 
down now most of us go that's we think

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:11.679 
down now most of us go that's we think
that<00:06:10.309> that's<00:06:10.399> a<00:06:10.550> terrible<00:06:10.939> thing<00:06:10.999> but<00:06:11.509> again

00:06:11.679 --> 00:06:11.689 
that that's a terrible thing but again

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:13.600 
that that's a terrible thing but again
the<00:06:12.379> purpose<00:06:12.740> of<00:06:12.889> memory<00:06:13.189> is<00:06:13.309> not<00:06:13.459> to

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
the purpose of memory is not to

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.459 
the purpose of memory is not to
permanently<00:06:14.059> save<00:06:14.300> anything<00:06:14.809> the<00:06:14.959> purpose<00:06:15.319> of

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:15.469 
permanently save anything the purpose of

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:17.889 
permanently save anything the purpose of
memory<00:06:15.830> is<00:06:16.009> the<00:06:16.580> running<00:06:16.849> program<00:06:17.209> so<00:06:17.749> when

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:17.899 
memory is the running program so when

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:20.799 
memory is the running program so when
you<00:06:17.990> do<00:06:18.169> a<00:06:18.199> reboot<00:06:18.919> a<00:06:19.159> restart<00:06:19.849> then<00:06:20.389> you<00:06:20.539> lose

00:06:20.799 --> 00:06:20.809 
you do a reboot a restart then you lose

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:23.110 
you do a reboot a restart then you lose
all<00:06:21.259> of<00:06:21.289> that<00:06:21.469> information<00:06:21.889> if<00:06:22.490> you<00:06:22.999> had<00:06:23.089> a

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
all of that information if you had a

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.909 
all of that information if you had a
program<00:06:23.360> that<00:06:23.779> was<00:06:23.930> up<00:06:24.110> and<00:06:24.349> running<00:06:24.409> and<00:06:24.830> you

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 
program that was up and running and you

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:27.100 
program that was up and running and you
hadn't<00:06:25.279> saved<00:06:25.639> the<00:06:26.059> document<00:06:26.240> I'm<00:06:26.749> working<00:06:27.050> on

hadn't saved the document I'm working on

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.779 
hadn't saved the document I'm working on
a<00:06:27.169> Word<00:06:27.379> document<00:06:27.409> and<00:06:27.949> I<00:06:28.009> haven't<00:06:28.309> saved<00:06:28.519> it

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:28.789 
a Word document and I haven't saved it

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:31.329 
a Word document and I haven't saved it
then<00:06:28.969> that<00:06:29.659> program<00:06:29.839> or<00:06:30.289> that<00:06:30.439> information<00:06:31.219> is

00:06:31.329 --> 00:06:31.339 
then that program or that information is

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:33.279 
then that program or that information is
going<00:06:31.490> to<00:06:31.550> be<00:06:31.699> gone<00:06:31.879> if<00:06:32.240> I<00:06:32.479> restart<00:06:33.139> my

00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:52.909 
not the program is running it's just

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:55.839 
not the program is running it's just
there<00:06:53.269> as<00:06:53.449> a<00:06:53.479> permanent<00:06:53.809> means<00:06:54.110> of<00:06:54.349> storage<00:06:54.849> so

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:55.849 
there as a permanent means of storage so

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:57.699 
there as a permanent means of storage so
when<00:06:56.269> we're<00:06:56.419> talking<00:06:56.659> about<00:06:57.019> what<00:06:57.409> kind<00:06:57.649> of

00:06:57.699 --> 00:06:57.709 
when we're talking about what kind of

00:06:57.709 --> 00:06:59.799 
when we're talking about what kind of
effect<00:06:58.129> it's<00:06:58.399> going<00:06:58.490> to<00:06:58.729> have<00:06:58.819> the<00:06:59.509> more

00:06:59.799 --> 00:06:59.809 
effect it's going to have the more

00:06:59.809 --> 00:07:02.980 
effect it's going to have the more
memory<00:07:00.349> that<00:07:00.979> you<00:07:01.189> have<00:07:01.490> allows<00:07:02.209> me<00:07:02.539> to<00:07:02.779> run

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:02.990 
memory that you have allows me to run

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:06.759 
memory that you have allows me to run
more<00:07:03.379> programs<00:07:04.249> at<00:07:04.639> a<00:07:04.699> single<00:07:05.240> time<00:07:05.479> so<00:07:06.439> the

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:06.769 
more programs at a single time so the

00:07:06.769 --> 00:07:08.470 
more programs at a single time so the
accurate<00:07:07.310> statement<00:07:07.789> is<00:07:07.909> my<00:07:08.089> compute

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:08.480 
accurate statement is my compute

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.200 
accurate statement is my compute
going<00:07:08.960> really<00:07:09.260> slow<00:07:10.040> I<00:07:10.070> need<00:07:10.640> more<00:07:10.880> memory

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:11.210 
going really slow I need more memory

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.660 
going really slow I need more memory
that's<00:07:12.020> the<00:07:12.290> accurate<00:07:12.470> statement<00:07:13.310> if<00:07:13.370> you're

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:13.670 
that's the accurate statement if you're

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:15.880 
that's the accurate statement if you're
having<00:07:13.910> trouble<00:07:14.240> downloading<00:07:14.780> something<00:07:15.560> and

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:15.890 
having trouble downloading something and

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:17.800 
having trouble downloading something and
saving<00:07:16.400> something<00:07:16.700> then<00:07:17.270> you<00:07:17.420> need<00:07:17.600> more

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:17.810 
saving something then you need more

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:21.970 
saving something then you need more
harddrive<00:07:18.530> space<00:07:18.800> so<00:07:19.700> disk<00:07:20.150> drive<00:07:20.680> space<00:07:21.680> is

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:21.980 
harddrive space so disk drive space is

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.650 
harddrive space so disk drive space is
going<00:07:22.160> to<00:07:22.310> affect<00:07:22.610> the<00:07:22.730> number<00:07:23.000> of<00:07:23.120> documents

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:23.660 
going to affect the number of documents

these things but it helps us to try to

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:02.030 
have to be able to send our commands to

have to be able to send our commands to

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:03.440 
tell the computer what to do the

tell the computer what to do the
computer<00:08:03.770> is<00:08:03.830> not<00:08:03.860> going<00:08:03.980> to<00:08:04.160> do<00:08:04.250> anything<00:08:04.490> on

computer is not going to do anything on
its<00:08:05.120> own<00:08:05.270> so<00:08:06.140> we<00:08:06.320> need<00:08:06.620> input<00:08:07.010> devices<00:08:07.730> and

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:08.120 
its own so we need input devices and

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.400 
its own so we need input devices and
then<00:08:08.330> we<00:08:08.450> have<00:08:08.660> to<00:08:08.810> have<00:08:08.930> a<00:08:08.960> way<00:08:09.140> to<00:08:09.170> get

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:09.410 
then we have to have a way to get

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.050 
then we have to have a way to get
information<00:08:09.530> back<00:08:10.100> out<00:08:10.340> and<00:08:10.670> that's<00:08:10.880> the

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:11.060 
information back out and that's the

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.630 
information back out and that's the
output<00:08:11.240> devices<00:08:11.990> in<00:08:12.140> the<00:08:12.500> next<00:08:12.830> section<00:08:13.310> we're

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:13.640 
output devices in the next section we're

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.950 
output devices in the next section we're
gonna<00:08:13.730> take<00:08:14.030> a<00:08:14.060> look<00:08:14.330> at<00:08:14.630> these<00:08:14.780> IO<00:08:15.200> devices
