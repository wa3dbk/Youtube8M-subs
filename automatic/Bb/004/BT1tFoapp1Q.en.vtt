00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
you have this big wand and you wrap it

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.290 
you have this big wand and you wrap it
around<00:00:20.039> that's<00:00:20.369> so<00:00:20.550> much<00:00:20.670> work<00:00:20.880> but<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.180> is

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
around that's so much work but that is

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.779 
around that's so much work but that is
not<00:00:21.480> what<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:21.869> this<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.920> took<00:00:23.100> me<00:00:23.250> only<00:00:23.340> 10

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
not what you this it took me only 10

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.730 
not what you this it took me only 10
seconds<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.510> curl<00:00:24.720> my<00:00:24.840> entire<00:00:25.199> head<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.619> hair

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
seconds to curl my entire head of hair

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
for people with big hair it would

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.320 
for people with big hair it would
probably<00:00:27.060> take<00:00:27.210> 20<00:00:27.869> seconds<00:00:28.230> so<00:00:28.380> here<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.460> the
