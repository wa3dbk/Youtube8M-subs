that<00:02:02.070> these<00:02:02.250> cards<00:02:02.850> are<00:02:03.799> taking<00:02:04.799> longer<00:02:05.070> to

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
that these cards are taking longer to

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.639 
that these cards are taking longer to
release<00:02:05.460> however<00:02:06.149> there<00:02:06.840> are<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.049> couple<00:02:07.409> of

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
release however there are a couple of

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.660 
release however there are a couple of
reasons<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:08.280> think<00:02:08.700> behind<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:10.039> and<00:02:11.039> this<00:02:11.489> is

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
reasons I think behind this and this is

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.230 
reasons I think behind this and this is
not<00:02:11.940> me<00:02:12.180> speaking<00:02:12.300> on<00:02:12.720> behalf<00:02:12.840> of

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
not me speaking on behalf of

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.740 
not me speaking on behalf of
AMD<00:02:13.920> but<00:02:14.920> this<00:02:15.100> is<00:02:15.280> me<00:02:15.460> kind<00:02:15.730> of<00:02:15.850> guessing<00:02:16.180> that

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
AMD but this is me kind of guessing that

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.270 
AMD but this is me kind of guessing that
the<00:02:16.930> reason<00:02:17.290> because<00:02:17.590> we've<00:02:17.740> heard<00:02:17.950> a<00:02:18.070> couple

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
the reason because we've heard a couple

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.700 
the reason because we've heard a couple
of<00:02:18.490> early<00:02:18.610> release<00:02:19.240> dates<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:19.900> they've<00:02:20.680> just

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
of early release dates and they've just

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.840 
of early release dates and they've just
not<00:02:21.100> happened<00:02:22.350> why<00:02:23.350> well<00:02:24.160> in<00:02:24.340> my<00:02:24.490> personal

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
not happened why well in my personal

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.370 
not happened why well in my personal
opinion<00:02:25.120> it's<00:02:25.630> because<00:02:25.990> of<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.230> high

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
opinion it's because of the high

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.470 
opinion it's because of the high
bandwidth<00:02:26.800> memory<00:02:27.220> I<00:02:27.400> think<00:02:27.850> they're<00:02:28.090> trying

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
bandwidth memory I think they're trying

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.740 
bandwidth memory I think they're trying
to<00:02:28.600> make<00:02:28.720> sure<00:02:29.110> that<00:02:29.380> it's<00:02:29.650> you<00:02:30.010> know<00:02:30.940> works

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
to make sure that it's you know works

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.390 
to make sure that it's you know works
they<00:02:32.110> really<00:02:32.440> want<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.650> test<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.040> product

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
they really want to test the product

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.980 
they really want to test the product
they<00:02:33.880> want<00:02:34.090> to<00:02:34.180> make<00:02:34.300> sure<00:02:34.330> that<00:02:34.480> they<00:02:34.690> can<00:02:34.840> get

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
they want to make sure that they can get

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.390 
they want to make sure that they can get
good<00:02:35.170> heats<00:02:35.440> they're<00:02:35.710> probably<00:02:35.890> trying<00:02:36.250> to

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
good heats they're probably trying to

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.130 
good heats they're probably trying to
clock<00:02:36.640> it<00:02:36.790> as<00:02:36.880> aggressively<00:02:37.330> as<00:02:37.480> possible<00:02:37.570> and

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
clock it as aggressively as possible and

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.510 
clock it as aggressively as possible and
to<00:02:38.680> be<00:02:38.800> honest<00:02:39.040> with<00:02:39.160> you<00:02:39.220> they're<00:02:39.490> probably

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
to be honest with you they're probably

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.670 
to be honest with you they're probably
just<00:02:40.060> testing<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.630> technology<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.380> making

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
just testing the technology and making

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.320 
just testing the technology and making
sure<00:02:41.830> that<00:02:42.010> all<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:42.250> drivers<00:02:42.550> and<00:02:42.880> stuff<00:02:42.970> work

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
sure that all the drivers and stuff work

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.440 
sure that all the drivers and stuff work
which<00:02:43.960> would<00:02:44.230> make<00:02:44.440> sense<00:02:44.770> and<00:02:45.210> frankly<00:02:46.210> if

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
which would make sense and frankly if

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.210 
which would make sense and frankly if
some<00:02:46.780> of<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:46.990> rumors<00:02:47.440> with<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.770> whole<00:02:47.920> water

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
some of the rumors with the whole water

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.220 
some of the rumors with the whole water
version<00:02:48.760> water<00:02:49.300> cooling<00:02:49.660> versions<00:02:50.020> of<00:02:50.110> the

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360

eight<00:02:52.570> gigabytes<00:02:53.200> of<00:02:53.380> RAM<00:02:53.740> situation<00:02:54.670> which

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
eight gigabytes of RAM situation which

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.900 
eight gigabytes of RAM situation which
we've<00:02:55.120> discussed<00:02:55.840> on<00:02:56.110> 10<00:02:56.560> *<00:02:56.950> point<00:02:57.310> previously

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
we've discussed on 10 * point previously

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.640 
we've discussed on 10 * point previously
and<00:02:58.060> obviously<00:02:58.600> it's<00:02:58.750> just<00:02:58.930> basically<00:02:59.350> the

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
and obviously it's just basically the

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.120 
and obviously it's just basically the
fact<00:02:59.830> that<00:02:59.950> hbm<00:03:00.700> one<00:03:00.940> typically<00:03:01.330> has<00:03:01.660> a<00:03:02.130> memory

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
fact that hbm one typically has a memory

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.020 
fact that hbm one typically has a memory
limit<00:03:03.520> four<00:03:03.790> gigabytes<00:03:04.270> so<00:03:04.540> they're

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
limit four gigabytes so they're

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.940 
limit four gigabytes so they're
basically<00:03:07.030> using<00:03:07.660> technology<00:03:08.290> to<00:03:08.320> get<00:03:08.620> around

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
basically using technology to get around

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.300 
basically using technology to get around
that<00:03:09.220> limit<00:03:09.610> to<00:03:10.540> go<00:03:11.110> to<00:03:11.170> eight<00:03:11.440> gigabytes<00:03:12.010> is

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
that limit to go to eight gigabytes is

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.640 
that limit to go to eight gigabytes is
probable<00:03:13.120> look<00:03:13.330> some<00:03:13.660> of<00:03:13.780> this<00:03:13.810> has<00:03:14.200> taken

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
probable look some of this has taken

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.740 
probable look some of this has taken
additional<00:03:15.130> R&amp;D<00:03:15.910> time<00:03:16.180> they've<00:03:16.450> had<00:03:16.570> to

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
additional R&amp;D time they've had to

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.540 
additional R&amp;D time they've had to
actually<00:03:16.930> test<00:03:17.410> it<00:03:17.680> they<00:03:18.130> have<00:03:18.280> to<00:03:18.310> of<00:03:18.520> course

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
actually test it they have to of course

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.220 
actually test it they have to of course
get<00:03:18.880> official<00:03:19.180> approval<00:03:19.450> to<00:03:19.780> make<00:03:19.900> sure<00:03:20.050> that

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
get official approval to make sure that

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.200 
get official approval to make sure that
it's<00:03:20.350> you<00:03:20.620> know<00:03:20.650> safe<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.250> use<00:03:21.370> and<00:03:21.670> all<00:03:22.090> of

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210 
it's you know safe to use and all of

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.060 
it's you know safe to use and all of
that<00:03:22.240> stuff<00:03:22.510> so<00:03:23.200> this<00:03:23.440> stuff<00:03:23.680> takes<00:03:23.920> time

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
that stuff so this stuff takes time

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.060 
that stuff so this stuff takes time
unfortunately<00:03:24.670> I<00:03:25.470> have<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.620> feeling<00:03:26.860> that

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
unfortunately I have the feeling that

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.070 
unfortunately I have the feeling that
some<00:03:27.490> of<00:03:27.610> it<00:03:27.730> as<00:03:27.880> well<00:03:28.180> was<00:03:28.600> to<00:03:28.750> do<00:03:28.870> with<00:03:29.020> the

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
bit slower but using those figures one

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.390

can<00:03:59.050> just<00:03:59.260> extrapolate<00:03:59.890> and<00:04:00.040> say<00:04:00.160> it's<00:04:00.310> going

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
can just extrapolate and say it's going

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.210 
can just extrapolate and say it's going
to<00:04:00.520> have<00:04:00.640> about<00:04:00.900> 8.5<00:04:01.900> tflops<00:04:02.440> of<00:04:02.710> computing

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220
