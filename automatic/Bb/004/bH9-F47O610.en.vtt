 color combinations as you have to play 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.570
 which combo you are currently playing and 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.970
 which combination possibilities first game 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.500
 you can even give at the top

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.619
 will be shown in the lower left of the game 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.420

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:36.420
 The ice-cold puzzle will be heard 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.850
 Penguins with each level more difficult 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.950
 means you have to take care that well 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.319
 we removed the right blocks because 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.869
 if you have a row out of sight 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.909
 Loses this very quickly until the 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.549
 grow on the top of the screen 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.770
 and then the game is lost and you 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.189
 you have to change the current level from scratch 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.189
 begin 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:02.039
 Conveniently , you are also available 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.500
 a few useful extras available 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.270
 that can prevent you from the 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.759
 stones stand up to the ceiling 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.110
 the extras are always random in the 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.390
 find blocks 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.700
 with bombs you can heap a whole lot 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.220
 free penguins at once and enter 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.010
 Big hole in the block Rhine travel 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.319
 as another extra there are the arrows 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.170
 with the arrows all blocks are upper 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.450
 and below the extras removed 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.650
 this way gets rid of you very fast 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.380
 a whole series 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.150
 It is even better if you succeed 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.549
 to combine the extras 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.109
 In the course of the game, you will always be new 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.109
