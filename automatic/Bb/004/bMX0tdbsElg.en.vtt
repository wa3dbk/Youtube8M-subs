00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
the game now one thing that I notice

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.760 
the game now one thing that I notice
first<00:01:22.470> off<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:23.090> how<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.150> HUD<00:01:24.650> instead<00:01:25.650> of

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
first off is how the HUD instead of

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
first off is how the HUD instead of
being<00:01:26.210> centered<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:28.380> focused<00:01:29.159> toward<00:01:29.640> the

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
being centered is is focused toward the

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.880 
being centered is is focused toward the
middle<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.210> screen<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.720> honestly<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.560> like

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
middle of the screen and honestly I like

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.130 
middle of the screen and honestly I like
that<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.340> like<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.909> way<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.390> looks<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.990> looks

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
that I like the way that looks it looks

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.140 
that I like the way that looks it looks
really<00:01:34.439> fluid<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.280> almost<00:01:35.430> gives<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.939> sort

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
really fluid and it almost gives it sort

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.359 
really fluid and it almost gives it sort
of<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.360> wit<00:01:36.630> sort<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.320> windshield<00:01:37.650> kind<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.280> a

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
of a wit sort of a windshield kind of a

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.460 
of a wit sort of a windshield kind of a
look<00:01:38.579> which<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.270> really<00:01:39.509> like<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.079> think<00:01:40.409> it

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
look which I really like and I think it

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.830 
look which I really like and I think it
adds<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.799> nice<00:01:40.979> dimension<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.119> i<00:01:42.299> also<00:01:42.450> like

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
adds a nice dimension to it i also like

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.980 
adds a nice dimension to it i also like
how<00:01:43.500> they<00:01:43.680> have<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.220> tires<00:01:44.490> right<00:01:45.030> there<00:01:45.329> next

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
how they have the tires right there next

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.280 
how they have the tires right there next
to<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.729> next<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.970> tack<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.600> think<00:01:49.079> it's<00:01:49.200> a

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
to the next to the tack I think it's a

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.950 
to the next to the tack I think it's a
really<00:01:49.500> nice<00:01:49.799> spot<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.490> put<00:01:50.850> them<00:01:51.030> because<00:01:51.780> you

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
really nice spot to put them because you

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.450 
really nice spot to put them because you
can<00:01:52.079> see<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.500> know<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.649> heat<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.130> your<00:01:53.159> tires

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
can see you know the heat of your tires

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.630 
can see you know the heat of your tires
without<00:01:53.790> turning<00:01:54.240> on<00:01:54.530> telemetry<00:01:55.530> which<00:01:56.009> comes

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
without turning on telemetry which comes

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.249 
without turning on telemetry which comes
right<00:01:57.090> up<00:01:57.119> on<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.390> middle<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.780> screen<00:01:57.990> and

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
right up on the middle of the screen and

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.520

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
gets in your face and Forza for now just

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.160 
gets in your face and Forza for now just
one<00:02:01.920> thing<00:02:02.219> though<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.520> notice<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.750> sound

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
one thing though to notice the sound

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.069 
one thing though to notice the sound
sounds<00:02:05.130> really<00:02:05.729> really<00:02:05.880> good<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.450> crits<00:02:06.840> it's

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
sounds really really good the crits it's

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.130 
sounds really really good the crits it's
very<00:02:07.350> crisp<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.610> feel<00:02:08.940> like<00:02:08.970> it's<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.869> little

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
very crisp and I feel like it's a little

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.290 
very crisp and I feel like it's a little
bit<00:02:10.289> crisper<00:02:10.920> than<00:02:10.950> Forza<00:02:11.459> 4<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:11.760> feel<00:02:12.180> like

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
bit crisper than Forza 4 I feel like

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.260 
bit crisper than Forza 4 I feel like
there's<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.599> crisp

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
there's a crisp

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.870 
there's a crisp
to<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.050> sound<00:02:14.380> that<00:02:14.980> you<00:02:15.040> don't<00:02:15.310> really<00:02:15.460> hear

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
to the sound that you don't really hear

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.730 
to the sound that you don't really hear
in<00:02:16.060> Forza<00:02:16.360> 4<00:02:16.540> now<00:02:16.750> we<00:02:16.810> look<00:02:17.230> at<00:02:17.350> this<00:02:17.500> view

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
in Forza 4 now we look at this view

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.370 
in Forza 4 now we look at this view
though<00:02:17.950> look<00:02:18.580> at<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.910> shocked<00:02:19.240> look<00:02:19.630> at<00:02:20.290> the

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
though look at the shocked look at the

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.070 
though look at the shocked look at the
shock<00:02:20.650> working<00:02:21.220> that<00:02:21.820> is<00:02:22.150> one<00:02:22.360> of<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.570> biggest

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
shock working that is one of the biggest

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.400 
shock working that is one of the biggest
reasons<00:02:23.680> why<00:02:24.280> I<00:02:24.310> think<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.300> open<00:02:25.810> wheel<00:02:26.020> cars

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
reasons why I think the open wheel cars

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.390 
reasons why I think the open wheel cars
and<00:02:26.710> forza<00:02:27.040> 5<00:02:27.250> are<00:02:27.640> going<00:02:28.390> to<00:02:28.570> be<00:02:28.750> not<00:02:29.740> just<00:02:29.920> not

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
and forza 5 are going to be not just not

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.100 
and forza 5 are going to be not just not
just<00:02:30.430> a<00:02:30.760> really<00:02:31.300> good<00:02:31.330> evolution<00:02:31.930> of<00:02:32.020> the

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
just a really good evolution of the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.660 
just a really good evolution of the
series<00:02:32.530> but<00:02:32.980> something<00:02:33.250> that<00:02:33.340> I<00:02:33.370> think<00:02:33.490> is

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
series but something that I think is

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.280 
series but something that I think is
going<00:02:33.850> to<00:02:33.910> be<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.030> really<00:02:34.300> popular<00:02:34.630> part<00:02:35.110> of<00:02:35.170> the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
going to be a really popular part of the

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.860 
going to be a really popular part of the
game<00:02:35.470> because<00:02:36.190> you're<00:02:36.520> able<00:02:36.790> to<00:02:36.880> see<00:02:37.180> the

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
game because you're able to see the

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.170 
game because you're able to see the
shocks<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.620> in<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:39.400> springs<00:02:39.820> and<00:02:40.150> the

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
shocks and the in the springs and the

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.770 
shocks and the in the springs and the
suspension<00:02:40.660> all<00:02:41.070> working<00:02:42.070> to<00:02:42.610> all<00:02:43.330> working

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
suspension all working to all working

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.870 
suspension all working to all working
together<00:02:43.930> really<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.650> and<00:02:45.100> seeing<00:02:45.460> all<00:02:45.700> those

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
together really and and seeing all those

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.720 
together really and and seeing all those
parts<00:02:46.360> moving<00:02:46.720> I<00:02:47.050> think<00:02:47.530> really<00:02:47.980> adds<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.550> the

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
parts moving I think really adds to the

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.000 
parts moving I think really adds to the
experience<00:02:48.970> now<00:02:49.750> I<00:02:49.780> don't<00:02:50.050> know<00:02:50.110> about<00:02:50.200> this<00:02:50.590> I

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
experience now I don't know about this I

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.650 
experience now I don't know about this I
don't<00:02:51.550> know<00:02:51.610> how<00:02:51.700> I<00:02:51.730> feel<00:02:52.060> about<00:02:52.120> this<00:02:52.480> like

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
don't know how I feel about this like

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.140 
don't know how I feel about this like
super<00:02:53.170> dramatic<00:02:53.350> music<00:02:54.220> in<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.550> in<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:54.790> menu

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
super dramatic music in the in the menu

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.060 
super dramatic music in the in the menu
screens<00:02:55.480> I<00:02:55.720> think<00:02:56.050> it's<00:02:56.140> pretty<00:02:56.290> cool<00:02:56.590> I<00:02:56.890> mean

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
screens I think it's pretty cool I mean

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.370 
screens I think it's pretty cool I mean
it<00:02:57.190> adds<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.490> nice<00:02:57.610> touch<00:02:57.880> to<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:58.750> game<00:02:58.930> also<00:02:59.200> I

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
it adds a nice touch to the game also I

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.310 
it adds a nice touch to the game also I
like<00:02:59.680> how<00:02:59.830> there's<00:03:00.390> drivers<00:03:01.390> and<00:03:01.780> pit<00:03:02.050> crew

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
like how there's drivers and pit crew

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.010 
like how there's drivers and pit crew
kind<00:03:02.590> of<00:03:02.680> walking<00:03:02.920> around<00:03:03.310> in<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:03.670> pre-race

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
kind of walking around in the pre-race

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.390 
kind of walking around in the pre-race
screen<00:03:05.020> I<00:03:05.050> think<00:03:05.380> that's<00:03:05.590> a<00:03:05.740> nice<00:03:05.890> touch<00:03:06.160> as

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
screen I think that's a nice touch as

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.610 
screen I think that's a nice touch as
well<00:03:06.430> and<00:03:06.850> the<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.600> character<00:03:08.110> models<00:03:08.440> look

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
well and the the character models look

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.110 
well and the the character models look
really<00:03:08.980> good<00:03:09.130> I<00:03:09.190> was<00:03:09.340> actually<00:03:09.550> surprised

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
really good I was actually surprised

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.200 
really good I was actually surprised
because<00:03:10.590> racing<00:03:11.590> simulators<00:03:12.190> you<00:03:12.730> guys<00:03:12.910> know

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
because racing simulators you guys know

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.730 
because racing simulators you guys know
if<00:03:13.330> you've<00:03:13.480> played<00:03:13.630> a<00:03:13.750> lot<00:03:13.990> of<00:03:14.110> them<00:03:14.200> are<00:03:14.410> not

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
if you've played a lot of them are not

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.760 
if you've played a lot of them are not
known<00:03:15.040> for<00:03:15.370> their<00:03:16.140> character<00:03:17.140> models<00:03:17.500> most

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
known for their character models most

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.980 
known for their character models most
character<00:03:18.280> models<00:03:18.640> in<00:03:18.850> simulation<00:03:19.600> racers

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
character models in simulation racers

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.670 
character models in simulation racers
looks<00:03:20.590> look<00:03:21.010> like<00:03:21.190> absolute<00:03:21.850> crap<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:23.560> be

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
looks look like absolute crap to be

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.290 
looks look like absolute crap to be
honest<00:03:24.070> pretty<00:03:24.430> much<00:03:24.610> every<00:03:25.060> simulation

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
honest pretty much every simulation

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.410 
honest pretty much every simulation
racer<00:03:25.840> I<00:03:26.200> have<00:03:26.709> ever<00:03:26.890> played<00:03:27.160> has<00:03:27.610> crappy

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
racer I have ever played has crappy

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.830 
racer I have ever played has crappy
character<00:03:29.020> models<00:03:29.520> but<00:03:30.520> in<00:03:30.790> Forza<00:03:31.390> 5<00:03:31.570> they

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
character models but in Forza 5 they

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.120 
character models but in Forza 5 they
seem<00:03:32.050> to<00:03:32.080> have<00:03:32.200> kicked<00:03:32.530> up<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:32.800> character

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
seem to have kicked up the character

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.070 
seem to have kicked up the character
models<00:03:33.459> a<00:03:33.520> notch<00:03:33.730> which<00:03:34.000> is<00:03:34.150> a<00:03:34.180> nice<00:03:34.420> touch<00:03:34.660> and

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
models a notch which is a nice touch and

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.640 
models a notch which is a nice touch and
I<00:03:35.560> think<00:03:35.920> it<00:03:36.040> really<00:03:36.420> it<00:03:37.420> really<00:03:37.480> improves<00:03:38.230> the

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
I think it really it really improves the

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.699 
I think it really it really improves the
the<00:03:39.280> overall<00:03:39.760> look<00:03:40.360> of<00:03:40.570> the<00:03:40.660> game<00:03:40.959> in<00:03:41.230> terms<00:03:41.530> of

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
the overall look of the game in terms of

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.820 
the overall look of the game in terms of
how<00:03:41.860> polished<00:03:42.490> its<00:03:42.820> it<00:03:43.150> feels<00:03:43.500> and<00:03:44.500> if<00:03:44.680> you

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
how polished its it feels and if you

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:45.930 
how polished its it feels and if you
look<00:03:45.010> right<00:03:45.220> here<00:03:45.280> right<00:03:45.610> here<00:03:45.640> with<00:03:45.850> this

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
look right here right here with this

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.600 
look right here right here with this
view<00:03:46.180> you<00:03:46.360> can<00:03:46.810> see<00:03:46.840> you<00:03:47.740> could<00:03:47.920> see<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.400> two

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
it and I think that these open wheel

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.320 
it and I think that these open wheel
cars<00:04:20.650> are<00:04:21.010> going<00:04:21.430> to<00:04:21.489> bring<00:04:21.700> a<00:04:21.850> new<00:04:22.120> dimension

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
cars are going to bring a new dimension

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.780 
cars are going to bring a new dimension
to<00:04:22.720> that<00:04:22.840> and<00:04:23.200> add<00:04:23.380> this<00:04:23.740> whole<00:04:24.040> this<00:04:24.729> whole

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
to that and add this whole this whole

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.879 
to that and add this whole this whole
new<00:04:25.150> basically<00:04:25.750> almost<00:04:25.900> like<00:04:26.169> an<00:04:26.320> open

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889

real<00:04:26.979> subculture<00:04:27.909> to<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.150> game<00:04:28.360> I<00:04:28.389> think

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539
