00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
video card it's not that good that's ati

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.079 
video card it's not that good that's ati
mobility<00:00:45.569> it's<00:00:46.159> way<00:00:47.159> too<00:00:47.219> expensive<00:00:47.399> for<00:00:47.940> what

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.089 
mobility it's way too expensive for what

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:51.129 
mobility it's way too expensive for what
it's<00:00:48.329> worth<00:00:48.829> so<00:00:49.829> we're<00:00:50.249> going<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.460> look<00:00:50.519> at<00:00:50.670> the

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:51.139 
it's worth so we're going to look at the

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:57.649 
it's worth so we're going to look at the
the<00:00:52.139> big<00:00:52.559> guy<00:00:52.969> the<00:00:53.969> 17<00:00:54.510> inch<00:00:55.399> mac<00:00:56.399> pro<00:00:56.940> macbook

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:57.659 
the big guy the 17 inch mac pro macbook

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:01.520 
the big guy the 17 inch mac pro macbook
pro<00:00:58.670> which<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.909> little<00:01:00.299> better<00:01:00.569> i<00:01:00.690> think<00:01:00.809> in

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
pro which is a little better i think in

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.529 
pro which is a little better i think in
terms<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.549> how<00:01:02.699> much<00:01:02.819> money<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.269> actually

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
terms of how much money you actually

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.960 
terms of how much money you actually
have<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.719> spend<00:01:03.989> on<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.640> let's<00:01:05.640> check<00:01:05.790> that

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
have to spend on it so let's check that

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.569 
have to spend on it so let's check that
out<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.500> it<00:01:07.500> looks<00:01:07.649> like<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.920> can<00:01:08.039> only<00:01:08.070> have

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:08.579 
out and it looks like you can only have

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:12.499 
out and it looks like you can only have
a<00:01:09.770> 3<00:01:10.770> point<00:01:11.009> 33<00:01:11.159> gigahertz<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:12.060> can<00:01:12.210> have<00:01:12.360> up

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
a 3 point 33 gigahertz you can have up

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.029 
a 3 point 33 gigahertz you can have up
to<00:01:12.539> three<00:01:12.869> gigabytes<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.560> memory<00:01:13.740> that's

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039 
to three gigabytes of memory that's

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:16.670 
to three gigabytes of memory that's
pretty<00:01:14.250> good<00:01:14.689> the<00:01:15.689> hard<00:01:15.899> drive<00:01:16.079> you<00:01:16.409> can<00:01:16.439> have

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
pretty good the hard drive you can have

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.330 
pretty good the hard drive you can have
up<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.920> 200<00:01:17.579> gigabytes<00:01:17.969> but<00:01:18.750> only<00:01:19.079> with<00:01:19.340> 5400

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
up to 200 gigabytes but only with 5400

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.459 
up to 200 gigabytes but only with 5400
rotations<00:01:20.729> per<00:01:20.759> minute<00:01:20.909> which<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> very

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:22.469 
rotations per minute which is a very

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:24.109 
rotations per minute which is a very
important<00:01:23.039> thing<00:01:23.219> rotation<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> minute

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
important thing rotation for a minute

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.770 
important thing rotation for a minute
makes<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.840> lot<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.799> people<00:01:26.039> think<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.280> just

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
makes a lot of people think is just

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.810 
makes a lot of people think is just
processing<00:01:27.780> speed<00:01:28.170> but<00:01:28.350> no<00:01:28.759> rotation<00:01:29.759> is

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
processing speed but no rotation is

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.340 
processing speed but no rotation is
permitted<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.329> your<00:01:30.509> hard<00:01:30.719> drive<00:01:30.930> will<00:01:31.229> make

little animation there so let's see you

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.349 
little animation there so let's see you
can<00:02:01.950> have<00:02:02.069> up<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.340> two<00:02:02.759> point<00:02:02.969> three<00:02:03.119> three

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:03.359 
can have up to two point three three

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:07.099 
can have up to two point three three
gigahertz<00:02:03.719> just<00:02:04.140> like<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.380> mac<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:05.960> you<00:02:06.960> can

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:07.109 
gigahertz just like the mac and you can

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:09.820 
gigahertz just like the mac and you can
even<00:02:07.229> have<00:02:07.550> still<00:02:08.550> windows<00:02:08.940> XP<00:02:09.509> professional

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
even have still windows XP professional

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.500 
even have still windows XP professional
which<00:02:10.830> i<00:02:10.979> think<00:02:11.039> is<00:02:11.220> pretty<00:02:11.370> good<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:12.360> can

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
which i think is pretty good you can

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.780 
which i think is pretty good you can
have<00:02:12.600> this<00:02:12.780> too<00:02:12.960> if<00:02:13.020> you<00:02:13.110> want<00:02:13.290> but<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:14.610> don't

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
have this too if you want but you don't

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.500 
have this too if you want but you don't
need<00:02:14.940> it

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
need it

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.059 
need it
and<00:02:16.510> scrolling<00:02:17.200> down<00:02:17.319> you're<00:02:17.709> going<00:02:17.830> to<00:02:17.890> see

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
and scrolling down you're going to see

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.949 
and scrolling down you're going to see
that<00:02:18.310> you<00:02:18.670> can<00:02:18.849> have<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:21.400> two<00:02:22.269> gigabytes<00:02:22.750> of

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
that you can have the two gigabytes of

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.190 
that you can have the two gigabytes of
RAM<00:02:23.760> so<00:02:24.760> okay<00:02:25.180> you<00:02:25.239> can't<00:02:25.569> have<00:02:25.690> as<00:02:25.780> many<00:02:25.900> as

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
RAM so okay you can't have as many as

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.800 
RAM so okay you can't have as many as
much<00:02:26.830> RAM<00:02:27.099> as<00:02:27.280> you<00:02:27.370> can<00:02:27.549> with<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.760> mac<00:02:27.970> but<00:02:28.720> it

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
much RAM as you can with a mac but it

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.100 
much RAM as you can with a mac but it
doesn't<00:02:29.049> really<00:02:29.110> matter<00:02:29.379> you<00:02:29.739> can<00:02:30.370> also<00:02:30.519> have

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
much better graphics card 256 and veda

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.720 
much better graphics card 256 and veda
geforce<00:02:58.329> and<00:02:59.129> it's<00:03:00.129> actually<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.459> hundred

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
geforce and it's actually a hundred

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.780 
geforce and it's actually a hundred
dollars<00:03:00.970> less<00:03:01.420> expensive<00:03:01.930> so<00:03:02.799> i<00:03:02.829> think<00:03:03.220> it's

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
dollars less expensive so i think it's

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.020 
dollars less expensive so i think it's
better<00:03:03.970> if<00:03:04.269> you're<00:03:04.390> trying<00:03:04.569> to<00:03:05.159> check<00:03:06.159> out<00:03:06.370> if
