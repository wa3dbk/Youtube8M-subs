00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
looking at five simple rules the first

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.430 
looking at five simple rules the first
one<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.710> avoid<00:00:38.070> white<00:00:38.489> carbohydrates<00:00:39.440> so

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
one is to avoid white carbohydrates so

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.740 
one is to avoid white carbohydrates so
that's<00:00:40.620> anything<00:00:41.070> white<00:00:41.460> like<00:00:42.329> rice<00:00:43.280> grains

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
that's anything white like rice grains

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.130 
Brad or anything like oh meal anything
of<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.579> nature<00:00:50.700> we<00:00:51.270> want<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.570> avoid<00:00:51.780> number

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
of that nature we want to avoid number

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.410 
of that nature we want to avoid number
two<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.590> eat<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.010> same<00:00:53.250> few<00:00:53.640> meals<00:00:53.879> over

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
two is to eat the same few meals over

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.110 
two is to eat the same few meals over
and<00:00:54.570> over<00:00:54.629> again<00:00:55.070> keep<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.219> consistent<00:00:56.579> we

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
and over again keep it consistent we

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.760 
and over again keep it consistent we
don't<00:00:57.239> need<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.510> get<00:00:57.629> fancy<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.170> try<00:00:58.590> new

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
don't need to get fancy and try new

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.430 
don't need to get fancy and try new
things<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.789> more<00:01:00.149> fancy<00:01:00.719> stuff<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.140> try<00:01:01.379> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
things the more fancy stuff you try the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.130 
things the more fancy stuff you try the
harder<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.250> stick<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.640> routine<00:01:03.140> and

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
harder it is to stick to the routine and

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.050 
harder it is to stick to the routine and
the<00:01:04.290> more<00:01:04.500> likely<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.939> might
