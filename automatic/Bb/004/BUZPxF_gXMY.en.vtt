00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.059
 ajax has a good starting position 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.589
 hibernation european but the 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.999
 Amsterdammers do have a laundry list 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:14.190
 based 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:15.929
 so many boelikin sat against nac on saturday 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.539
 and his symbion and buy from one 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.400
 Sigthorsson has long been out of circulation 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.140
 the press conference responded frank 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.249
 farmer also on the occurrence of kenneth 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.339
 vermeer 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:27.779
 take it you all know that you 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:29.990
 of course we want to make mistakes 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.329
 limited to the minimum and 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.510
 certainly know it too because I have it now 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.890
 and I also said I am not 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.949
 someone who trust a lot 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.320
 indicates players and not after a two 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.329
 competitions than it gives 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.829
 one he knows like no other i have short 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.780
 with their spoken and he must 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.969
 that it is an incident 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.799
 because otherwise it might leave something behind 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.850
 the free thing that wanted is nobody's 

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:57.589
 he just has to 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.649
 cling to the races 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.879
 for what they were that who it 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.589
 fantastic did the who too 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:08.299
 points for us 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:10.069
 so I think we'll be fine 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.530
 Sparta went wrong last season 

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:18.799
 the farmer does not assume such another 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:21.709
 scenario now that you should not 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.020
 think that the competition is normative 

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:24.170
 which is erase but that you each 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.440
 respects 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.920
 must give everything and not that you think 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.970
 well we can do something here for a while 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.189
 bring about 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.369
 so he will know very cost and top 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:40.369
 not as an individual but as a whole team 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.780
 the same the substitutes the we there 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.000
 Also a very important role is 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.300
 just yes i think it is an issue 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.340
 yes like Louis always mentioned in 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.670
 machines honor the imagination of the 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.489
 competitions and that you are not alone 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.170
 think of that match at home but right 

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:59.420
 also how it is possible here 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.459
 possibly from spoot there is idea after 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.690
 that experience has been very good of it 

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:05.080
 later on that it is not again 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.080
 happens
