00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 the damn nerds need to be 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.740
 informed by that now maximum brings you 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.590
 all the news from the world of 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.639
 technology and that video games 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.580
 magnetic 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.980
 the return of the bird even though 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.050
 a few weeks ago don joo in decided 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.820
 take out of the appstore and google play at 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.410
 addictive game flap and watch the 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.750
 developer would be considering 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.519
 enable it again for download 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.529
 in an interview he gave the site 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.269
 North American Rolling Stones New Girl 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.309
 He said that in the event that the game 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.350
 was online again I would include 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.520
 a warning sign telling you to 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.200
 the players who take a break 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.910
 between game and game 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.530
 remember that last month as well 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.180
 had said that the tremendous addiction that 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.460
 generated flap and green in thousands of 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.020
 users who downloaded it had been a 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.000
 of the main reasons why 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.890
 he decided to remove it from the stores of 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.239
 download the developer also said 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.829
 that control of the game in which 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.420
 we have to touch the screen to do 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.789
 jump to the bird and dodge obstacles 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.590
 It's that simple because it's thought 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.780
 for people who walk around all 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.850
 sides without removing the eyes from your cell phone 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.019
 as it happens in the city where he lives 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.810
 hanoi capital of vietnam 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.340
 a step back to the robotics 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.320
 robotics is one of the weapons of the 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.360
 science that more interest awakens in the 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.039
 nerd after all we all dream of 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.929
 a future like that of the supersonic 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:18.850
 although more than one would prefer that of 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:20.679
 terminator but just like we had fun 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.450
 watching these dogs robots of sun that 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:23.829
 they have less wave than a rule or 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.689
 we celebrate the arrival of those 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:27.880
 Automatic vacuum cleaners that spin 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.619
 all day and they save us having to 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.170
 Sweep some moments give us 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.819
 agena shame at the CeBIT expo that 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.860
 is developing in Germany the 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:37.750
 software development company toby 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.799
 decided that it would be a good idea to 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.539
 draw attention 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.880
 they set up a stage in their stand where 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.849
 a dj robot with a head of 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.979
 megaphone and two exotic dancers 

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:50.170
 robots that move roughly to the rhythm 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.299
 of music the proud representative 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.189
 The company clarifies, however, that 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.530
 they try new models we put 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.299
 color and larger breasts declares 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.159
 proud showing that he has not seen 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.200
 much more than robot breasts in their 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.729
 eye that yes yes anyway 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.200
 the idea excited you two we tell you 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.390
 that you can buy one of these 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.340
 tin ballerinas for 39 thousand 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.500
 five hundred dollars but do not include 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.130
 poxirrán nor the poxirrán to stick 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:18.040
 which will fall of shame 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.500
 stanley against disney nobody doubts that 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.270
 stanley is the creator of spider man but 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.610
 how the rights belong to marvel 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.140
 there is a gray area where they are insured 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.600
 that he can exploit the spiderman 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.610
 as well as the company that owns it 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.380
 most recent legal conflict occurred 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.090
 this week with another demand by part 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.400
 of stand that hit the lawyers 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.620
 from disney the company that now bought 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.480
 marvel and if that seems like a legal bard 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.700
 in the middle of all this mess are 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.550
 got a third in discord the 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.650
 theatrical company america music theater a 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.410
 which Disney sued for making a 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.940
 musical show of spider-man and that 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.860
 answered the comedy company 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.410
 musicals that the rights sold them 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.950

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.900

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.700

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.710
 of Grandpa Stanley did not get to good 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.010
 port but this matter continues for now 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.540
 in the hands of American justice 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.490
