00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:05.789 
and today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:05.789 --> 00:00:09.560 
and today I'm going to show you how to
do<00:00:06.209> a<00:00:06.509> felted<00:00:07.109> join<00:00:07.499> a<00:00:07.859> way<00:00:08.519> of<00:00:08.759> joining<00:00:09.120> two

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
do a felted join a way of joining two

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.169 
do a felted join a way of joining two
pieces<00:00:09.870> of<00:00:10.110> yarn<00:00:10.169> together<00:00:10.679> without<00:00:11.459> a<00:00:11.730> knot

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
pieces of yarn together without a knot

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.400 
pieces of yarn together without a knot
in<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.719> fairly<00:00:12.990> um<00:00:13.669> seamless<00:00:14.669> way<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.389> do<00:00:16.230> this

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
in a fairly um seamless way to do this

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.160 
in a fairly um seamless way to do this
you<00:00:16.619> will<00:00:16.710> need<00:00:16.769> some<00:00:17.250> water<00:00:17.539> you<00:00:18.539> can<00:00:18.810> use

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
you will need some water you can use

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.290 
you will need some water you can use
your<00:00:19.380> own<00:00:19.560> spit<00:00:19.980> but<00:00:20.519> for<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.880> purposes<00:00:21.240> of

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
your own spit but for the purposes of

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.790 
your own spit but for the purposes of
this<00:00:21.480> video<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.810> figured<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:22.439> would<00:00:22.590> use

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
this video I figured that I would use

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.130 
this video I figured that I would use
just<00:00:22.830> some<00:00:23.189> normal<00:00:23.550> tap<00:00:23.730> water<00:00:23.960> and<00:00:24.960> you'll

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
just some normal tap water and you'll

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.579 
just some normal tap water and you'll
need<00:00:25.259> two<00:00:26.089> strands<00:00:27.089> of<00:00:27.240> yarn<00:00:27.300> whether<00:00:27.869> it's<00:00:28.230> a

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:28.589 
need two strands of yarn whether it's a

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.519 
need two strands of yarn whether it's a
broken<00:00:29.339> piece<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.580> yarn<00:00:29.970> or<00:00:30.380> something<00:00:31.380> else

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
broken piece of yarn or something else

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.410 
broken piece of yarn or something else
but<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.830> needs<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.099> be<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.220> yarn<00:00:32.490> that<00:00:32.670> is<00:00:32.730> felt<00:00:33.330> a

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
but it needs to be a yarn that is felt a

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.800 
but it needs to be a yarn that is felt a
bowl<00:00:33.890> which<00:00:34.890> means<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.490> it<00:00:35.580> needs<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:36.150> not<00:00:36.600> be

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:36.810 
bowl which means that it needs to not be

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.500 
bowl which means that it needs to not be
super<00:00:37.050> washed<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.650> have<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.890> really<00:00:38.280> high<00:00:38.610> wool

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
super washed and have a really high wool

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.590 
super washed and have a really high wool
content<00:00:40.550> the<00:00:41.550> yarns<00:00:41.880> that<00:00:42.060> I'm<00:00:42.180> using<00:00:42.330> right

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
content the yarns that I'm using right

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.850 
content the yarns that I'm using right
now<00:00:42.630> are<00:00:42.810> both<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.500> hundred<00:00:43.920> percent<00:00:44.390> wool<00:00:45.390> and

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
now are both a hundred percent wool and

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.200 
now are both a hundred percent wool and
so<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:47.010> another<00:00:47.280> video<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.670> show<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:47.850> how<00:00:47.970> to<00:00:48.090> do

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
so in another video I show you how to do

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.270 
so in another video I show you how to do
a<00:00:48.240> Russian<00:00:48.540> join<00:00:49.080> which<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.890> can<00:00:50.040> certainly

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
a Russian join which you can certainly

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.150 
a Russian join which you can certainly
do<00:00:50.820> with<00:00:51.690> felt<00:00:51.960> above<00:00:52.200> wools<00:00:52.410> but<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:53.040> will

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
do with felt above wools but you will

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.890 
do with felt above wools but you will
find<00:00:53.400> that<00:00:53.670> what<00:00:54.030> I'm<00:00:54.120> about<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.420> show<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.630> is

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
find that what I'm about to show you is

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.530 
find that what I'm about to show you is
a<00:00:55.170> lot<00:00:55.410> faster<00:00:56.030> so<00:00:57.030> you're<00:00:57.240> going<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.390> take

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
a lot faster so you're going to take

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.190 
a lot faster so you're going to take
your<00:00:57.660> two<00:00:57.810> yarns<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.500> cross<00:00:59.130> them<00:01:00.200> and

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
your two yarns and cross them and

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.929 
your two yarns and cross them and
creating<00:01:02.040> two<00:01:02.460> loops<00:01:03.080> bring<00:01:04.080> them<00:01:04.350> back<00:01:04.939> on

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
creating two loops bring them back on

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.849 
creating two loops bring them back on
each<00:01:06.179> other<00:01:06.420> like<00:01:07.369> so<00:01:09.380> next<00:01:10.460> you<00:01:11.460> want<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.789> wet

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:12.859 
each other like so next you want to wet

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:16.910 
each other like so next you want to wet
this<00:01:13.859> join<00:01:14.960> again<00:01:15.960> as<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.320> said<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.740> can<00:01:16.890> use

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
this join again as I said you can use

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.270 
this join again as I said you can use
saliva<00:01:17.460> but<00:01:18.359> in<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:18.869> case<00:01:19.079> we're<00:01:19.380> using<00:01:19.530> some

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
saliva but in this case we're using some

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.370 
saliva but in this case we're using some
just<00:01:20.820> some<00:01:20.909> tap<00:01:21.149> water<00:01:23.749> alright<00:01:24.749> so<00:01:25.049> now<00:01:25.200> we've

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
just some tap water alright so now we've

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.389 
just some tap water alright so now we've
got<00:01:25.590> our<00:01:26.490> these<00:01:27.420> pieces<00:01:27.689> saturated<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.770> next

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
got our these pieces saturated and next

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.029 
got our these pieces saturated and next
all<00:01:29.700> we<00:01:29.759> need<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.149> do<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.539> felt<00:01:30.960> these<00:01:31.619> ends

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
all we need to do is felt these ends

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:37.700 
all we need to do is felt these ends
together<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.869> so<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:34.079> do<00:01:34.140> this<00:01:36.020> with<00:01:37.020> just<00:01:37.350> some

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
together and so I do this with just some

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.249 
together and so I do this with just some
agitation<00:01:38.420> so<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.509> can<00:01:39.600> see<00:01:39.749> I'm<00:01:39.869> putting<00:01:40.049> my

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
agitation so you can see I'm putting my

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.029 
agitation so you can see I'm putting my
hands<00:01:40.499> together<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.780> just<00:01:42.780> rubbing

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039

enrolling<00:01:47.039> me<00:01:47.609> on<00:01:47.789> back<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.420> forth<00:01:48.859> so<00:01:49.859> I'll

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
enrolling me on back and forth so I'll

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.270 
enrolling me on back and forth so I'll
do<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.280> I'll<00:01:50.700> spread<00:01:51.179> my<00:01:51.359> fingers<00:01:51.420> apart<00:01:52.280> so

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.440 
you can get a better sense of what I'm
doing<00:01:55.069> what<00:01:56.069> I'm<00:01:56.189> doing<00:01:56.429> is<00:01:56.520> I'm<00:01:56.670> rolling<00:01:57.299> the

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
doing what I'm doing is I'm rolling the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:05.950 
doing what I'm doing is I'm rolling the
yarn<00:01:57.689> back<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.350> forth<00:01:59.030> against<00:02:00.030> my<00:02:00.209> palm

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:15.110 

okay<00:02:07.190> and<00:02:08.190> now<00:02:11.210> if<00:02:12.210> you<00:02:12.390> try<00:02:12.600> to<00:02:12.660> pull<00:02:14.120> you'll

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
okay and now if you try to pull you'll

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.900 
okay and now if you try to pull you'll
see<00:02:15.420> that<00:02:15.600> you<00:02:15.840> cannot<00:02:16.230> separate<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.610> strands

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
see that you cannot separate the strands

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.000 
see that you cannot separate the strands
here<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.300> from<00:02:18.390> each<00:02:18.570> other<00:02:18.750> because<00:02:19.320> you

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
here and from each other because you

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.250 
here and from each other because you
have<00:02:20.190> felted<00:02:20.520> them<00:02:20.640> together<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.600> you<00:02:22.110> may

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
have felted them together and you may

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.760 
have felted them together and you may
have<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.860> little<00:02:23.100> bit<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.340> an<00:02:23.460> extra<00:02:23.700> end<00:02:24.770> and

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
have a little bit of an extra end and

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:33.170 
have a little bit of an extra end and
those<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.160> can<00:02:26.310> just<00:02:26.340> clip<00:02:26.850> off<00:02:31.970> but<00:02:32.970> now<00:02:33.120> we

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
those you can just clip off but now we

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.130 
those you can just clip off but now we
have<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.780> nice<00:02:34.490> felted<00:02:35.490> to<00:02:35.610> join<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.480> so<00:02:37.050> you

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
have a nice felted to join and so you

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.930 
have a nice felted to join and so you
can<00:02:37.260> continue<00:02:37.650> knitting<00:02:37.800> as<00:02:38.220> this<00:02:38.520> this<00:02:38.730> was<00:02:38.910> a

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
can continue knitting as this this was a

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.760 
can continue knitting as this this was a
single<00:02:39.150> strand<00:02:39.480> of<00:02:39.540> yarn<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.380> you<00:02:40.500> don't<00:02:40.680> have

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
single strand of yarn and you don't have

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.730 
single strand of yarn and you don't have
any<00:02:41.040> knots<00:02:41.370> or<00:02:41.820> any<00:02:42.330> ant<00:02:42.660> ends<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.530> need

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
any knots or any ant ends that you need

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.210 
any knots or any ant ends that you need
to<00:02:43.980> weave<00:02:44.340> in<00:02:44.990> the<00:02:45.990> only<00:02:46.530> real<00:02:46.740> difference

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
to weave in the only real difference

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.030 
to weave in the only real difference
between<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:48.240> fill<00:02:48.390> to<00:02:48.540> join<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.200> then<00:02:49.650> normal

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
between the fill to join and then normal

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.250 
between the fill to join and then normal
strands<00:02:50.550> is<00:02:50.730> that<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.510> felted<00:02:51.840> portions

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
strands is that the felted portions

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.580 
strands is that the felted portions
might<00:02:52.560> be<00:02:52.740> a<00:02:52.950> little<00:02:53.490> thicker<00:02:53.900> than<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.410> rest

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
might be a little thicker than the rest

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.250 
might be a little thicker than the rest
of<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:55.830> yarn<00:02:56.209> but<00:02:57.209> unlike<00:02:57.540> a<00:02:57.570> Russian<00:02:57.990> join

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
of the yarn but unlike a Russian join

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.250 
of the yarn but unlike a Russian join
really<00:02:59.190> we<00:02:59.430> only<00:02:59.760> use<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.450> overlap<00:03:00.930> portion

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
really we only use the overlap portion

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.430 
really we only use the overlap portion
is<00:03:01.410> about<00:03:01.530> this<00:03:01.950> big<00:03:02.250> so<00:03:03.150> it<00:03:03.810> doesn't<00:03:04.170> require

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
is about this big so it doesn't require

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.790 
is about this big so it doesn't require
a<00:03:04.890> ton<00:03:05.220> of<00:03:05.280> overlap<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.150> able<00:03:06.600> to<00:03:06.630> fix<00:03:06.900> this<00:03:07.140> so

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
a ton of overlap and able to fix this so

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.140 
a ton of overlap and able to fix this so
this<00:03:07.950> is<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.070> technique<00:03:08.519> that<00:03:08.580> works<00:03:08.940> really

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
this is a technique that works really

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.540 
this is a technique that works really
well<00:03:09.269> if<00:03:09.540> you've<00:03:09.690> had<00:03:09.900> say<00:03:10.680> your<00:03:10.950> yarn<00:03:11.220> break

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
well if you've had say your yarn break

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.190 
well if you've had say your yarn break
in<00:03:11.850> the<00:03:12.000> middle<00:03:12.209> of<00:03:12.300> the<00:03:12.390> project<00:03:12.600> or

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
in the middle of the project or

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.259 
in the middle of the project or
something<00:03:14.190> like<00:03:14.370> that<00:03:15.410> so<00:03:16.410> anyway<00:03:17.090> this<00:03:18.090> is

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
something like that so anyway this is

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.720 
something like that so anyway this is
