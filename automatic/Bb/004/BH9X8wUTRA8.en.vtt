00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
these updates once a week but I guess it

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.510 
these updates once a week but I guess it
would<00:03:46.290> be<00:03:46.320> nice<00:03:46.590> to<00:03:46.830> have<00:03:46.920> a<00:03:46.980> steady<00:03:47.280> supply

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
videos having maybe a video a day that's

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.949 
videos having maybe a video a day that's
something<00:03:50.340> I'm<00:03:50.459> like<00:03:51.030> going<00:03:51.450> for<00:03:51.660> something

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
something I'm like going for something

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.040 
something I'm like going for something
i'm<00:03:52.170> hoping<00:03:52.620> i<00:03:52.709> can<00:03:52.820> get<00:03:53.820> two<00:03:54.120> at<00:03:54.510> one<00:03:54.540> point

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
i'm hoping i can get two at one point

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.610 
i'm hoping i can get two at one point
but<00:03:55.400> let's<00:03:56.400> just<00:03:56.610> do<00:03:57.240> it<00:03:57.270> this<00:03:57.720> way<00:03:57.990> i<00:03:58.020> think

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
but let's just do it this way i think

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.530 
but let's just do it this way i think
it's<00:03:58.740> better<00:03:58.950> to<00:03:59.220> have<00:03:59.280> one<00:03:59.400> video<00:04:00.000> a<00:04:00.030> day<00:04:00.300> then

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
it's better to have one video a day then

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.810 
it's better to have one video a day then
have<00:04:00.690> a<00:04:00.750> long<00:04:01.020> video<00:04:01.260> every<00:04:01.920> week<00:04:02.250> about<00:04:02.550> this

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
have a long video every week about this

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.740 
have a long video every week about this
because<00:04:03.450> it's<00:04:04.350> like<00:04:04.650> a<00:04:05.070> rush<00:04:05.970> i<00:04:06.240> have<00:04:06.390> to<00:04:06.510> rush

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750

in<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.700> game<00:04:17.850> of<00:04:17.910> course<00:04:18.390> the<00:04:18.930> dossiers

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
in the game of course the dossiers

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.719 
in the game of course the dossiers
always<00:04:19.739> looked<00:04:19.950> a<00:04:20.010> little<00:04:20.160> bit<00:04:20.280> different

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
always looked a little bit different

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:21.629 
always looked a little bit different
from<00:04:20.850> what<00:04:21.030> it's<00:04:21.180> actually

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
from what it's actually

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.820 
from what it's actually
look<00:04:21.819> like<00:04:22.030> in<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.300> game<00:04:22.539> and<00:04:22.840> I'm<00:04:23.620> always

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.739 
look like in the game and I'm always
excited<00:04:24.280> to<00:04:24.490> see<00:04:24.759> what<00:04:24.939> the<00:04:25.030> model<00:04:25.210> looks<00:04:25.360> like

00:04:25.739 --> 00:04:25.749

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:37.599 
mechanics behind this and I think this

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:39.749 
mechanics behind this and I think this
is<00:04:37.659> going<00:04:38.080> to<00:04:38.169> be<00:04:38.289> a<00:04:38.319> great<00:04:38.620> thing<00:04:38.889> for<00:04:39.219> the

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 
is going to be a great thing for the

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:42.899 
is going to be a great thing for the
game<00:04:40.409> because<00:04:41.409> why<00:04:41.650> not<00:04:41.680> I<00:04:42.159> hope<00:04:42.610> it's<00:04:42.789> going

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:42.909 
game because why not I hope it's going

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:44.610 
game because why not I hope it's going
to<00:04:42.999> be<00:04:43.090> in<00:04:43.240> the<00:04:43.330> deep<00:04:43.539> though<00:04:43.779> so<00:04:44.080> if<00:04:44.229> I'm<00:04:44.379> just

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
to be in the deep though so if I'm just

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.230 
to be in the deep though so if I'm just
swimming<00:04:44.949> around<00:04:45.039> the<00:04:45.340> water<00:04:45.610> in<00:04:45.909> the<00:04:45.939> river

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
swimming around the water in the river

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.499 
swimming around the water in the river
it's<00:04:46.449> not<00:04:46.569> going<00:04:46.689> to<00:04:46.810> push<00:04:47.819> latch<00:04:48.819> onto<00:04:49.120> me<00:04:49.419> and

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:49.509 
it's not going to push latch onto me and

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:52.769 
it's not going to push latch onto me and
suck<00:04:49.779> my<00:04:49.930> blood<00:04:50.460> but<00:04:51.460> I<00:04:51.849> think<00:04:52.479> it's<00:04:52.599> going<00:04:52.719> to

00:04:52.769 --> 00:04:52.779 
suck my blood but I think it's going to

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:56.550
