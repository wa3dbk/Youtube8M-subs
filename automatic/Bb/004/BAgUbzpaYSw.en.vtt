00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 Hello everyone and in this video, I continue 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.719
 the topic a healthy delicious food in this 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.049
 moment in relatively healthy but all of us 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.120
 You want to want sweet and preferably from 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.630
 its variety of sweet foods 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.910
 choose or whale which is less harmful in 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.039
 more tasty i'm showing you now 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.699
 such an option as 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:32.640
 canned fruit i think that 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:34.100
 harm canning is not as great as 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.420
 may seem at first glance 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.579
 especially if you compare those harm 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.430
 canning 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:44.390
 in cans of such ki we see 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.100
 Now we have to compare the years of this 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.260
 canning on Wednesday 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.039
 canning which undertake 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.230
 in order to bring us fruit 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:57.120
 fresh and fruit 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.899
 which we can buy in the store on 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.070
 a market that is brought from afar and 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.379
 which are treated with special 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.689
 drugs in order for 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.350
 long journey they do not mold whether they 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.850
 were ravaged 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.280
 all sorts of different microorganisms and not 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.369
 lost their appearance 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.840
 for canned fruit 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.659
 canned cans appearance 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.030
 as you understand absolutely has 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.670
 no value 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.500
 conservation is done where 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.210
 these fruits grow 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.820
 that is, freshly rolled up and 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.579
 they bring us in the form of such compotes 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.030
 I think that this second option 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:40.740
 rolling a can he allows us 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.259
 bring us fruit let in sugar 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.320
 launch cans but without 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.750
 abundant amounts of all sorts and herbicides 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.770
 and other preservatives 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.649
 designed to keep us above all 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.759
 product appearance they taste it 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.820
 some properties 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:01.560
 In the following I would like to note that you can 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.580
 buy similar compotes in the store 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.980
 quite tasty they are different 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.590
 which ones are which basically are you 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.810
 figure out if the ways to buy in 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.130
 The process is what I would like 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:19.670
 pay attention that she us and of course 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.700
 better to buy in the rings rather than in 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.260
 pieces it may seem that in pieces 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.320
 in some cases it will be more convenient 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.890
 for example if you want to add salad 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.190
 no need to cut but on the other hand 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.340
 simply 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.040
 simple logic will tell you that the rings 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.430
 can only be obtained from whole not 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.590
 spoiled fruit and pieces can 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.350
 just cut those fruits in which 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.660
 partially spoiled and something with them is not 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.300
 so therefore as a rule and in my 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.620
 Observation is also a ring 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.600
 tastier price by the way here 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.060
 absolutely not an indicator because 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.490
 maybe delicious cheap that is here 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.050
 here for example such a series to red 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:07.580
 price and here and here and it was all 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.739
 amazingly tasty but not once 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.950
 have to as you understand depends 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:16.070
 rather from the party rather than from the price 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:21.080
 specific store and so forth here's another 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:22.940
 one not bad mmo is called maternity not 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.230
 cheapest products 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:29.959
 it is somewhere well, the average price is closer to itself 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.330
 high when compared on the shelf but in 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.980
 In principle, one of my observations 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.390
 most reliable that is if i doubt 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.390
 well do not have a wide choice i like 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.550
 rule friend of the city ​​whether it is fruit or to 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.910
 green track something like that and in 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:50.269
 Basically, they have not upset me yet 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:54.350
 up the calorie content of these foods is not very 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:58.310
 high about 250 270 kcal per 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:03.220
 100 grams of pot usually contains but here 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:05.420
 here is 600 milliliters here for 750 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.420
 milliliters so many grams it's me not 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.879
 I know, but in general a little bit of the whole jar 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.650
 on 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:13.400
 you can always eat a little 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.680
 maybe 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.859
 and at least in the evening 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.799
 experience, I did not feel adverse 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:25.610
 consequences if it ate again this 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:29.090
 quite tasty this fruit can 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:32.330
 you can eat it in a compartment with something 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:35.270
 add the salad there is amazingly delicious 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.580
 sugar compote inside you can drink it 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:41.240
 so but I usually dilute it because everything 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.070
 still seems to me too sweet and even 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.850
 particles of taste I want 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:49.250
 a little dilute with some water here once 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:52.700
 I diluted with sparkling water 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.970
 and it turned out something like lemonade well 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:59.870
 that's about 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:02.450
 these compotes for now everyone happy 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.840
 good luck to all 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:07.400
 eat tasty eat useful 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.910
 try to find some kind of compromise 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:14.320
 it is possible and I will tell you what 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:17.710
 watched what I understood felt myself 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.710
 bye everyone
