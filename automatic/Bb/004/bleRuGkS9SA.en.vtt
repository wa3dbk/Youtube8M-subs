 Friends nights or good afternoon today I want 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.740
 explain to you to teach you to recommend a 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:12.570
 new book that has come out although in 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.330
 reality is one of an English edition 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.060
 of a few years ago that is called 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.950
 spell surgery laquis good in 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.250
 reality is an anatomy book 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.800
 surgical in a book that I what 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.020
 I recommend a lot for everyone who 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.090
 is going to start a presidency a 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.160
 residency either general surgery of 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.460
 a little bit maybe the one that is more 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.460
 indicated as surgery from cardiology 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.589
 urologic everything that is thorax or abdomen 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.469
 this is a book written by anatomist 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:46.589
 and by people who are helping the 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.719
 surgeons understand what access roads 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:50.190
 that you have to look for that you have to 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.489
 look that you should touch that you should not 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.380
 touching inside the human body when 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.300
 he 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.600
 The first thing I want to point out is that 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.670
 they have very good drawings very good 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.430
 scheme because it's based mostly on 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.640
 the surgery all the topics there are topics 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.040
 I already say of neurology great vessels like 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.680
 larynx breast 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.909
 many digestive a lot of intestine 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.740
 of pancreas liver 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.110
 all the surgery has from time to time 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.909
 some some sections in which a 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.009
 you see explained in anatomy come 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.200
 explaining what the alterations are 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.869
 Anatomical are speaking from the 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.840
 ethnicity here this tumor is pro fatty 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.840
 neurovascular injuries in 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.170
 finishing describing what are the 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.240
 injuries from the point of view of 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.979
 the anatomy is saying yes 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.810
 what lesson are you going to find that 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.380
 compromises a glass that complements fat 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.540
 then he comes explaining what the 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.090
 most usual surgeries and if I say no 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.920
 is a book of surgery to the use of many 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.740
 photos with step by step preparation 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.659
 patient prepares the roasts enters by 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.909
 it's fine with the other surgery 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.860
 that comes is a surgery indicating to 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.569
 big features what are the big ones 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.019
 large operations 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.300
 the great techniques and especially that 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.740
 you have to be careful that from point 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.720
 of anatomical view 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.930
 is a base book does not get it in a 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.250
 base book usually come a 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.290
 history of what are the techniques 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.360
 surgical that during the history more 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.690
 It does not work and how they will see is full of 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.340
 pearl dogs of both images and 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.769
 of explanations 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.989
 for me it seems like a pretty book 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.680
 interesting as a basic book for 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.970
 start talking is very funny but 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.430
 when the mir begin the 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.420
 specialties you always arrive looking for 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.780
 these great techniques that is all 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.360
 Material that is all they are the 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.390
 instrumental and in recent years the 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.269
 r3 r4 of the older era surgery just 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.400
 arriving and saying I'm looking for a book of 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.099
 anatomy from the point of view of the 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.230
 surgery because it is that if the anatomy does not 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.880
 I know where I am half the time 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.500
 I know why I have back that this technique 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.380
 in the other I do not know why I can not count 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.360
 here rusty and I need a book of 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.920
 anatomy that explain me well what 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.470
 I'm talking even if they get to 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.239
 bring anatomy books with photography 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.790
 of corpses because with photography of 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.800
 corpses is the closest thing to what it is 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.350
 the body when when a surgeon 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.900
 that is not necessary and right now I am 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.580
 with many explanations with many 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.940
 linkages of each body to each 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.980
 system where this application has 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.240
 nerves have what are the 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.070
 complications with are the errors 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.490
 even from the point of view not 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:46.040
 going public that can commit what 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.530
 are the relationships within the normal 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.260
 and it 's a book that I honestly think 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.240
 very very very very basic to not wait for 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.570
 r3 r4 to buy it 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:00.570
 the only thing to say is that I find it curious 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.670
 a book america is very curious 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.830
 that in the same book both the 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.240
 Surgical anatomy of urologists as 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.560
 that of the digestives or of the 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:12.030
 surgeons 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:14.940
 cardiovascular but the fact is that 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.440
 although I always say think this 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.600
 indicates a little bit for the surgeons more 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.910
 general any specialty within 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.580
 everything we are saying would be for 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.260
 serve to buy is this bible 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.630
 this bible from the base of the of the 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.880
 surgery in which 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.260
 can the surgeon who starts president 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.810
 I start to find all the 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.310
 documentation you need to 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.620
 make a specialty with some 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.840
 knowledge based knowledge 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.150
 solid and strong what can start 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.340
 knowing 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.230
 paintings you do not know the structures 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.800
 anatomical why I'm driving 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:52.140
 that scalpel I very well hope it is 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.120
 biology one free and acquire be of 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.770
 agreement with me the one who has to his 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.490
 header book at least for the 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.490
 first years d
