 it's a theme of this month are animals 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.019
 the protagonists of this version of 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.820
 small library that has nothing 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.910
 Too much so I will not even be showing her 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.050
 I'm going to leave a photo of the version of 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.940
 letter company 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.309
 The story begins on this farm in the 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.620
 when all the animals in the 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.960
 farm they will gather round the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.660
 major who is the oldest animal they 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.969
 have that is a little he is just seeing 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.980
 that age because it was few 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.550
 was also learned these 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.230
 things 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.059
 this one because he is dying in step 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.550
 end of the great he then left 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.590
 other animals to be able to divide 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.449
 his experiences to be able to 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.550
 some notices the experience he wants 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.559
 share the wisdom he wants to pass 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.719
 for the other animals is about how they 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.309
 Are you feeling so much leaving for the 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.130
 farmer whose name is jones 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.990
 he speaks as I actually reality 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.100
 of any animal is just somehow 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.290
 died or turned into food or is a weekly 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.900
 glue factory that kind of thing and he 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.150
 also talked about a future in which 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.729
 there is a revolution in animals and that 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.450
 own animals here go and gift yourself 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.060
 same 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.450
 is the future where mankind men 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.670
 their sovereign animals are no longer in the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.759
 only land they will send a 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.549
 time after this the death of this major 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.700
 of the body the animals will gather from 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.250
 new and they will start the revolution 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.009
 they will who only the two command 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.439
 pigs they will free themselves leader of 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.659
 men will attack and make them a disco 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.490
 of the farm itself in the 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.890
 own farm they go from mother to 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.630
 this farm animals farm 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.969
 from there the animals 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.950
 organized they will create some rules 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.869
 of coexistence between them 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.119
 these rules are mainly for 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.550
 differentiate those from humans and they will 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.519
 to get consensus on colo dvd channel 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.010
 of animals like prison do the job 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.140
 they start an egalitarian society 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.700
 where each one will take back will not 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.400
 working the same way will not have 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.010
 the same benefits so they alone 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.989
 start even they start doing the 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.239
 work on the implementation farm of 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.730
 harvesting together in two ports and 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.380
 half napoleon and the snowball and 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.569
 that they eat plants like 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.250
 colonized as leaders arises because 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.709
 they speak better 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.140
 they have a natural leadership in them and they 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.780
 will also start from the books 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.610
 magazines as well as bar in the 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.110
 farmer who will also start 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.549
 learn to read and write 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.739
 only these two pigs will always be 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.299
 laying staves need they will 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.250
 presenting ideas 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.079
 they will address these ideas 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.090
 with the other animals that will ask the 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.980
 and their followers are 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.680
 always fighting each other because they have 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.880
 is to differentiate a good time then from 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.829
 story 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.299
 it will start when one of these topics 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.700
 he will be presenting one of the 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:12.390
 his ideas for making improvements on the farm 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.030
 on the farm and another because he will do 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.579
 a blow it will give a way to 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.690
 able to expel this other this 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:24.450
 he is fired from the war in 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.579
 force of reason of an ok status even 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.799
 to be able to take the place 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:32.220
 this is the only pig recognized as 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.989
 as thinker organizer of the church 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.639
 from there that audience that will start 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.560
 to dictate the rules 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:39.900
 They are going to start a little boy. 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.829
 governor from the vote that all 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.590
 they had 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.900
 it will start to impose that the 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.359
 rules his ideas george orwell 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.049
 so what you're going to do is build a lot 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:51.060
 good 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:54.120
 not all this history of this story 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.420
 it will represent in fact what 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.260
 requires a seizure by a dictatorship in the 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.290
 parents 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.450
 of a social nature is left-wing 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.630
 from the foci to the power of imposition 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.960
 from viana 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:10.900
 this is only part of the editorial writer that 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:13.240
 is the lack of popular participation 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.740
 as well as demonstrations of cruelty 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.120
 of strength they do not have to do to 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.060
 stay in that power 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.890
 so even though using elements 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.610
 emphasized the fable of this genre 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.320
 literary or traveled and can put 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.690
 all subjects that are very high in 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.310
 truth of the book and within that 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.130
 story is the book is very important 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.300
 Do you want to start the readings? 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.280
 historical 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.110
 he is a book around the be for this 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.940
 exactly that it goes with a story 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.130
 for children with this formula well 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.490
 chewed until then mainly for 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.080
 a book like his too in 1984 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.890
 this book is very good that it goes 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:53.310
 putting in didactic way and system 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.700
 all the points that will be addressed in 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.530
 1984 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.420
 I knew this way simpler and better. 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.490
 more exposed is once you have 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.350
 read the bug revolution 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.760
 you notice a few more points 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:08.800
 easily new 1974 mechanical orange 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.120
 we got a new one and the characters 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.740
 wanting it to build is that 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.410
 really make this story 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.600
 then each of the farm animals 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.550
 they are made by representatives a 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.590
 extreme of a personality that goes 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.680
 appeared to have entered this type of 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:27.160
 also the sheep who are 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.680
 blind insurers have the horse that is 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.720
 very hard worker but also going 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.010
 follow that he will care about the 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.710
 what is he talking about 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:38.200
 the pigs there that are representing 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.330
 that social band is being placed 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.040
 above the rest have characters that are 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.470
 very entertaining some characters who 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.120
 You will also like the 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.760
 character called throat which some 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.860
 pigs that are there to do this part 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.470
 the new regulation of brand media 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.110
 manipulation and how that government is 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.580
 being seen in the character of the most 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.710
 interesting in the book 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.740
 despite being one of the antagonists and 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:05.320
 me in spite of that golden day focus that 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.480
 he has with one with communism with the 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:12.669
 socialism that is where it's going to take 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:14.580
 his ideas for the 1984 book 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:16.740
 I also think that 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.990
 in this coffin perfectly fine in 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:23.129
 any type of dictatorship that is placed 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:24.689
 both socially and religiously 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:26.939
 and the conservatives 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:29.219
 all this type of event are the 

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:31.379
 same things that will happen on 

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:34.199
 manipulation and how these people 

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:36.770
 implement this type of government the 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:40.020
 Remote short one it is very fast 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:42.659
 it is very well written to the active goes 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:45.270
 very easy and is not exaggerated then 

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:46.439
 History is not very full or in 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.719
 elements that appear to be 

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:50.520
 dragging within a while it is a 

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:52.020
 these books than any anyone 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.180
 who likes a good read has to 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:57.030
 to train on the shelf he is one of the books 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.650
 who coined several of them during the hours 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.870
 people will hear forever that they will be 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:03.330
 reference and forms part of a 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:05.610
 of the basic readings you have to 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:07.500
 have if you want to catch my readers 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.039
 more important then help a lot 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.539
 in that 

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:12.719
 and look that will serve to create also 

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:13.319
 if you want to put a child already 

00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:15.120
 thanks 

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:18.270
 I would not mind leaving it there. 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:20.250
 despite the book's more mature cuts 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:22.050
 then one more recommendation 

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:24.029
 definitely it was very good I'm going 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.889
 put a blog post also explained 

00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:27.449
 talking a little more in the discussion a 

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:29.099
 in the book for those who have already 

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:31.169
