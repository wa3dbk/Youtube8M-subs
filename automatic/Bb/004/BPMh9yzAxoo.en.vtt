00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
off which makes a total of six so there

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.590 
off which makes a total of six so there
is<00:00:47.129> an<00:00:47.309> illumination<00:00:47.730> key<00:00:48.030> right<00:00:48.270> on<00:00:48.450> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
going to turn the lighting off so it's

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.889 
going to turn the lighting off so it's

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
lighting levels so we can go through

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
want red maybe I want to go back to that

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.979 
want red maybe I want to go back to that
original<00:02:10.229> blue<00:02:10.770> so<00:02:11.069> we'll<00:02:11.250> go<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.400> blue<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.989> we

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
original blue so we'll go to blue and we

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.760 
original blue so we'll go to blue and we
hit<00:02:13.230> apply

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
hit apply

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
to change our keys here to blue now

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.140 
to change our keys here to blue now
again<00:02:19.770> you<00:02:19.920> can<00:02:20.070> pick<00:02:20.250> any<00:02:20.520> color<00:02:20.880> that<00:02:20.970> you

want you can also change the
illumination<00:02:23.280> without<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.420> actual<00:02:25.200> button

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
illumination without the actual button

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.250 
illumination without the actual button
on<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.580> mouse<00:02:26.850> or<00:02:27.120> on<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.510> keyboard<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:28.230> can

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
on the mouse or on the keyboard you can

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.690 
on the mouse or on the keyboard you can
do<00:02:28.530> it<00:02:28.620> in<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:28.800> software<00:02:29.100> so<00:02:29.280> let's<00:02:29.400> turn<00:02:29.580> the

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
do it in the software so let's turn the

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.750 
do it in the software so let's turn the
brightness<00:02:29.880> down<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:30.420> maybe<00:02:30.570> like<00:02:30.780> 50%<00:02:31.760> right

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
brightness down so maybe like 50% right

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.060 
brightness down so maybe like 50% right
there<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.240> we'll<00:02:34.020> hit<00:02:34.170> apply<00:02:35.240> and<00:02:36.920> it's<00:02:37.920> going

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
there and we'll hit apply and it's going

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.290 
there and we'll hit apply and it's going
to<00:02:38.190> turn<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:38.460> brightness<00:02:38.880> down<00:02:39.030> but<00:02:39.240> of

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
to turn that brightness down but of

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.270 
to turn that brightness down but of
course<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:39.780> like<00:02:40.560> my<00:02:40.680> brightness<00:02:41.010> all<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.190> way

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
course I like my brightness all the way

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.410 
course I like my brightness all the way
up<00:02:41.370> so<00:02:41.400> we're<00:02:41.580> going<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.760> go<00:02:41.850> all<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.180> way<00:02:42.210> back

up so we're going to go all the way back
up<00:02:42.660> in<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.990> software<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.760> I<00:02:44.760> hit<00:02:44.970> apply<00:02:45.240> and

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
up in the software and I hit apply and

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.620 
up in the software and I hit apply and
we're<00:02:46.830> all<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.130> way<00:02:47.250> back<00:02:47.520> up<00:02:47.550> now<00:02:47.970> one<00:02:48.510> other

so we've changed the color to yellow and
you<00:03:08.790> can<00:03:08.940> see<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.300> breathing<00:03:09.750> effect<00:03:10.050> in

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
you can see the breathing effect in

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.930 
you can see the breathing effect in
action<00:03:10.560> it's<00:03:10.650> pretty<00:03:10.860> cool<00:03:11.040> again<00:03:11.670> something

gives<00:03:24.360> you<00:03:24.540> in<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:25.260> software<00:03:25.709> but<00:03:25.890> it<00:03:26.040> also

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
gives you in the software but it also
