00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
in this video I'll show you how we go

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.799 
in this video I'll show you how we go
about<00:00:13.380> preparing<00:00:14.070> these<00:00:14.190> 384<00:00:14.849> well<00:00:14.880> plates<00:00:15.330> by

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
about preparing these 384 well plates by

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.980 
about preparing these 384 well plates by
hand<00:00:16.170> using<00:00:16.980> tools<00:00:17.490> from<00:00:17.789> bio<00:00:18.060> flow

hand using tools from bio flow

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.390 
hand using tools from bio flow
so<00:00:20.990> the<00:00:21.110> first<00:00:21.320> step<00:00:21.560> is<00:00:21.770> to<00:00:21.920> make<00:00:22.070> up<00:00:22.280> the

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
so the first step is to make up the

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.340 
so the first step is to make up the
master<00:00:22.820> mix<00:00:23.000> and<00:00:23.360> transfer<00:00:24.020> it<00:00:24.110> to<00:00:24.140> a

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
master mix and transfer it to a

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.770 
master mix and transfer it to a
reservoir<00:00:25.010> we<00:00:25.520> use<00:00:25.670> these<00:00:25.880> low<00:00:26.210> volume

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:26.780 
reservoir we use these low volume

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.590 
reservoir we use these low volume
single-use<00:00:27.710> disposable<00:00:27.950> reservoirs<00:00:28.850> so<00:00:29.390> here

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:29.600 
single-use disposable reservoirs so here

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.540 
single-use disposable reservoirs so here
I'm<00:00:29.690> adding<00:00:30.020> the<00:00:30.320> master<00:00:30.740> mix<00:00:30.920> for<00:00:31.070> my<00:00:31.190> gene<00:00:31.430> of

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.880 

now<00:01:14.009> I'm<00:01:14.159> ready<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.640> load<00:01:15.329> my<00:01:15.630> master<00:01:16.259> mix<00:01:16.439> for

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
now I'm ready to load my master mix for

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.770 
now I'm ready to load my master mix for
the<00:01:17.009> gene<00:01:17.219> of<00:01:17.250> interest<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.969> onto<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.600> right

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:40.929 
the gene of interest to onto the right
hand<00:01:18.810> side<00:01:19.289> of<00:01:19.469> the<00:01:19.560> 384<00:01:20.189> well<00:01:20.219> plate

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.529 

so<00:01:41.899> next<00:01:42.109> I<00:01:42.350> need<00:01:42.530> to<00:01:42.679> get<00:01:42.799> my<00:01:43.009> 64<00:01:43.700> samples<00:01:43.999> all

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
so next I need to get my 64 samples all

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:47.050 
so next I need to get my 64 samples all
lined<00:01:44.899> up<00:01:45.140> in<00:01:45.380> Eppendorf<00:01:46.100> tube<00:01:46.159> racks<00:01:46.609> ready

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
lined up in Eppendorf tube racks ready

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.389 
lined up in Eppendorf tube racks ready
for<00:01:47.329> the<00:01:47.390> via<00:01:47.600> flow<00:01:47.899> Voyager<00:01:48.469> so<00:01:49.100> this<00:01:49.250> is<00:01:49.369> a

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
for the via flow Voyager so this is a

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.639 
for the via flow Voyager so this is a
pipette<00:01:49.819> that<00:01:50.030> has<00:01:50.179> adjustable<00:01:50.840> tip<00:01:51.079> spacing

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
pipette that has adjustable tip spacing

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.279 
pipette that has adjustable tip spacing
so<00:01:52.609> I'll<00:01:52.700> be<00:01:52.819> able<00:01:52.909> to<00:01:53.030> pick<00:01:53.210> up<00:01:53.359> samples<00:01:54.140> from

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
so I'll be able to pick up samples from

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:56.830 
so I'll be able to pick up samples from
these<00:01:54.469> tubes<00:01:54.829> and<00:01:55.069> then<00:01:55.280> drop<00:01:56.270> them<00:01:56.450> off<00:01:56.600> into

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
these tubes and then drop them off into

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:16.300 
these tubes and then drop them off into
the<00:01:57.079> 384-well<00:01:57.679> plate

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.760 

so<00:02:17.270> now<00:02:17.450> I<00:02:17.480> need<00:02:17.720> to<00:02:17.900> set<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.319> live<00:02:18.500> flight

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
so now I need to set the live flight

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.510 
so now I need to set the live flight
Voyager<00:02:19.310> prepare<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:20.420> repeat<00:02:21.140> dispensed<00:02:21.590> 2.5

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
Voyager prepare to repeat dispensed 2.5

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:34.080 
Voyager prepare to repeat dispensed 2.5
microliters<00:02:23.270> in<00:02:23.450> triplicate

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.670 

so<00:02:35.090> this<00:02:35.240> pipette<00:02:35.630> has<00:02:35.840> adjustable<00:02:36.470> tip

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
so this pipette has adjustable tip

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.910 
so this pipette has adjustable tip
spacing<00:02:37.840> that<00:02:38.840> will<00:02:38.960> allow<00:02:39.260> me<00:02:39.440> to<00:02:39.470> prepared

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
spacing that will allow me to prepared

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:54.250 
spacing that will allow me to prepared
straight<00:02:40.190> from<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.460> eppendorf<00:02:40.880> tubes

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.259 

so<00:02:54.890> here<00:02:55.129> I'm<00:02:55.250> loading<00:02:55.610> my<00:02:55.730> first<00:02:56.030> set<00:02:56.239> of
