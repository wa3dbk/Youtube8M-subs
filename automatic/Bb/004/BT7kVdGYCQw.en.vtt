00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.879
 Today is St. Christopher 's Day 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.740
 a category of professionals who are 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.870
 every day on the streets 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.809
 they face stressful situations 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.880
 many times even lose a 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.340
 reflecting the pressure that the 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.279
 bus drivers do not have much what 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.410
 celebrate but gains a strength from who 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.300
 use their service on a daily basis 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.410
 today, for example, the tributes to this 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.720
 category began an early procession 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.719
 commenced the commemorations of the 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.390
 driver and faithful welcomed 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.219
 are patron of the category 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.230
 according to the belief that Christians were a 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.350
 soldier who decided to serve God 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.750
 taking faithful in his boat and the office of 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.250
 transporting people is also the great 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.050
 emerson's satisfaction 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.989
 the bus driver is in the profession 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.980
 only two years ago and guarantees that you like 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.039
 of what does 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.379
 I liked figueiredo's laugh 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.989
 secret to keep yourself at ease 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.449
 in the chaotic traffic of the savior is the 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.380
 patience that he exercises throughout 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.950
 moment that a patient 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.659
 I threw the problem, did not divide the drivers. 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.579
 buses carry out an activity 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.920
 essential in the life of the 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:17.990
 five thousand workers who 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.329
 deserve all the honors 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.610
 but according to the professionals themselves the 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.890
 reasons for commemoration do not 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.350
 problems faced on a day-to-day basis 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.350
 had really really exclusive 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.409
 The fact that we have to take it is one of them. 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.659
 the traffic is not that it is so much 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.990
 interesting people do not understand 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.000
 you do not understand the other is to increase 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.009
 very difficult and goes around 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.590
 stress and lack of rest leads 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.880
 around 30% of drivers 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.009
 doctor's office 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.470
 routine of seven hours a day of 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.740
 work they even change gears 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.500
 about eight thousand times may not seem like 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.520
 but this represents a physical effort 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.159
 risk 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.560
 he is at the job in wanting 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.159
 is in a totally uneconomical position 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.780
 which can cause problems in his column 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.150
 upper limb and legs 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.560
 this will bring consequences like 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.560
 for example it was distrustful 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.470
 is upper limbs is also with the 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:21.269
 problem is mainly of shoulder 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.269
 probably he will have problem 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:27.030
 articular muscle and the number of 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.909
 superior dealing with people and traffic 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.280
 the various situations of daily life 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:34.709
 can also be a difficult heavy load. 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.709
 to sustain if the mind is not 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:40.799
 Quiet stone of stress and he 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:45.090
 begin with fatigue with drowsiness or 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:47.340
 Otherwise it 's irritability insomnia right 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.860
 then this will cause serious problems 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.810
 in his health as a general rule 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.359

 of these professionals is a career I 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.500
 I find it very tiring 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:05.220
 Good morning to him, may God continue. 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:08.310

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:19.109
