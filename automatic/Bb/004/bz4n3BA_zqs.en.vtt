00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.810 
they just slip and fall out the
skullcandys<00:04:36.870> they<00:04:37.110> may<00:04:37.350> be<00:04:37.410> cheap<00:04:37.820> plasticky

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
skullcandys they may be cheap plasticky

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.490 
skullcandys they may be cheap plasticky
and<00:04:39.060> but<00:04:39.420> they<00:04:39.540> are<00:04:39.660> light<00:04:39.900> and<00:04:40.110> they<00:04:40.290> always

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
and but they are light and they always

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.890 
and but they are light and they always
stand<00:04:40.890> my<00:04:40.980> ear<00:04:41.160> I'm<00:04:41.340> walking<00:04:41.790> so<00:04:42.660> that's<00:04:42.840> a

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
stand my ear I'm walking so that's a

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.540 
stand my ear I'm walking so that's a
little<00:04:42.990> downside<00:04:43.290> that<00:04:43.770> may<00:04:44.160> really<00:04:44.370> just

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
little downside that may really just

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.210 
little downside that may really just
depend<00:04:44.910> on<00:04:45.090> your<00:04:45.240> ears<00:04:45.570> mine<00:04:46.020> or<00:04:46.350> mine<00:04:47.070> are

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
probably different size and shape and

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.880 
probably different size and shape and
yours<00:04:49.860> so<00:04:50.340> really<00:04:50.910> depends<00:04:51.540> but<00:04:52.320> like<00:04:52.770> I<00:04:52.860> said

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890
