00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.400
 Hello everyone, today we will be doing a very interesting Christmas experiment called "Winter in the Cup" 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.950
 This experiment is mainly based on the sublimation and desublimation of benzoic acid. 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.900
 Benzoic acid is an organic compound that is a white powder in appearance. 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.000
 In this experiment, we need to prepare a fir branch 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.000
 First, let's pour a small amount of benzoic acid into a large glass. 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:38.300
 Next, put the fir branches in the glass so that the benzoic acid can be covered on the branches. 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.700
 Now I took an alcohol lamp and lit it, then put the glass on it and started to heat it. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 I took an evaporation cup and placed it on top of the glass. 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.600
 Therefore, the benzoic acid vapor formed in this reaction does not escape. 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.500
 After a while, the glass is heated to the temperature at which benzoic acid begins to sublimate. 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.600
 This is a change from solid to gaseous without liquid conversion 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.500
 After a while, the glass will be filled with benzoic acid vapor. 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:19.000
 The process of sublimation is quite fast. After a while, we take the glass off from above and cool it down. 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.100
 At room temperature, the gaseous benzoic acid will dehydrate on the cup wall and branches. 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.700
 Now we can see that there is a very beautiful winter scene in the cup. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 I am trying to clean the surface of the glass to see the scene inside more clearly. 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:48.000
 Beautiful benzoic acid crystals can be deposited on and around the branches 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.900
 However, these crystals are very fragile 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.600
 If you shake the branches, they will fall off easily. 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.100
 This experiment is very beautiful and spectacular. 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.000
 If you live in places that rarely snow or snow 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.300
 Then it may bring you some spiritual comfort 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
