 down in the recipe link these are 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.869

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.500

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:19.450
 cup measurements for the different 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.429
 concrete ingredients of this we are going to 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.140
 need three fighters so what 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:25.140
 let's do to prepare it 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.159
 this chanta chan you have to chop what 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.570
 here a little bit worth 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.570
 of friends 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.490
 I help but with my fingers 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.000
 and of that we're going to need three cups 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.939
 to see how you are going 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.979
 and you can enter it into a processor in 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:58.080
 a blender too but we to 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.080
 I bring you a hand, you want to spoon it 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.619
 for breakfast 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.180
 and we will be worth to do these 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.180
 cookies from before 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.180
 one 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.630
 s 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:34.910
 you know what the videos call you 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.910
 because it makes so many follies yes 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.460
 what 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.760
 Yes Yes 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.980
 fun to make lists 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:15.800
 and here now there is a spoon 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:15.800
 so we're going to get a little fat 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:23.550
 not a little much if then we eat it 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.970
 and then we went for a while 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:31.370
 if we take bikes with no ipad 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:34.599
 lay not the opposite as slimming 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.599
 at the end of the next match 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.450
 well then once we have passed this 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.000
 long while preparing the ingredients 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.150
 we started putting in a pan the 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.129
 milk and sugar 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.110
 and let's go mixing with the fire 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.489
 half more or less until it dissolves 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.819
 well that sugar is incorporated in the 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.819
 milk 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.140
 and stirring always so that it does not 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.140
 stick 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.040
 and when you notice that the sugar is not visible 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.370
 that is more or less diluted we add the 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.019
 cocoa little by little always better and 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.489
 we keep stirring better always with 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.489
 a wooden spoon or a spatula 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.430
 you know that this is pure cocoa 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.410
 we keep stirring until it's 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.190
 completely dissolved it takes a little while 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.320
 a little patience 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.240
 well let's add a teaspoon of 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.320
 vanilla essence or extract 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.930
 vanilla 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.550
 then the butter or butter 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.190
 peanut or peanut butter 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.450
 it's called the three ways has a 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.720
 taste a little special we have already done 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.970
 videos of other recipes and good here is 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.310
 uses a lot of vigland ireland you know and 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.930
 also in the USA in Spain a little bit 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.310
 least at least this experience that 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.830
 I have 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.720
 It is very oily or imagine that 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.430
 makes peanut has a lot of fat 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.030
 and it tends to come off a bit too 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.000
 oil that arrives 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.130
 the peanut oil 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.900
 well then once the 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.240
 peanut butter we incorporate the 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.580
 butter the normal one of cow of all 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.530
 the life of cow's milk 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.889
 other than salad is just 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.810
 normal butter 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:24.999
 It's not worth margarine because it usually has 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.230
 less fat and here we want it to be 

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:28.760
 pretty fatty 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.200
 Well, once we have everything right 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.940
 dissolved let's go incorporating the 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.430
 cereal that we've been looking at little to 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.260
 little souvenir koshwal in oat flakes 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.270
 that are already done or as we have done 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.850
 we have crumbled these cereals 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.370
 of wheat then take any cereal 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.870
 also and beat it a bit or crush it 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:48.170
 with the spoon until it is like 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:50.210
 powder not too powdered a 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:52.160
 I do not know how to tell you in 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.640
 granitos a little bit big in flakes 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.640
 little ones 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.330
 it's an environment 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.449
 Well, while here it was done 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.490
 when the spoon 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:32.379
 let's go placing them with a spoon 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.270
 on a plate previously prepared with 

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:35.949
 kitchen paper we put a quantity 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.490
 how are you seeing what fits in a 

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:38.490
 soup spoon 

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.950
 I 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.470
 and in fat 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:54.730
 little by little we are going to place them 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:57.340
 place them separately and we will give them 

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:59.620
 crushed and round shape like 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:02.200

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.120
 with the spatula this silicone you see 

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.810
 I make the edges milestones and crushed them a 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.880
 little bit 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:10.880

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:15.520
 or three hours and we're going to try them 

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:18.789
