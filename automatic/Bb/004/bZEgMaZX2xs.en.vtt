project<00:00:43.430> a<00:00:43.730> different<00:00:43.850> take<00:00:44.210> on<00:00:44.390> a<00:00:44.450> castle<00:00:45.020> and

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
project a different take on a castle and

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.940 
project a different take on a castle and
I<00:00:46.100> this<00:00:46.489> is<00:00:46.670> just<00:00:46.700> a<00:00:47.030> prototype<00:00:48.020> mock-up<00:00:48.739> so

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
I this is just a prototype mock-up so

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.950 
I this is just a prototype mock-up so
I'll<00:00:49.070> be<00:00:49.190> doing<00:00:49.489> a<00:00:49.640> couple<00:00:49.670> more<00:00:50.180> versions<00:00:50.660> so

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
I'll be doing a couple more versions so

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.590 
I'll be doing a couple more versions so
I<00:00:51.020> can<00:00:51.290> do<00:00:51.500> a<00:00:51.530> nice<00:00:51.770> tutorial<00:00:52.040> on<00:00:52.610> it<00:00:52.790> but<00:00:53.510> if

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
I can do a nice tutorial on it but if

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.930 
I can do a nice tutorial on it but if
you<00:00:53.690> like<00:00:53.809> to<00:00:53.899> make<00:00:54.020> paper<00:00:54.260> things<00:00:54.760> this<00:00:55.760> would

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
you like to make paper things this would

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.369 
you like to make paper things this would
probably<00:00:56.059> be<00:00:56.300> an<00:00:56.390> Isis<00:00:56.629> after<00:00:56.780> a<00:00:56.989> few<00:00:57.170> to<00:00:57.260> me

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
probably be an Isis after a few to me

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.200 
probably be an Isis after a few to me
it's<00:00:58.040> kind<00:00:58.309> of<00:00:58.399> unique<00:00:58.550> and<00:00:58.910> it's<00:00:59.000> a<00:00:59.090> little

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
it's kind of unique and it's a little

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.580 
it's kind of unique and it's a little
bit<00:00:59.420> different<00:00:59.629> it<00:00:59.870> looks<00:00:59.899> like<00:01:00.140> it's<00:01:00.440> the

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
bit different it looks like it's the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.880 
bit different it looks like it's the
visual<00:01:00.770> metaphor<00:01:01.309> of<00:01:01.399> a<00:01:01.489> dragon<00:01:02.680> maybe<00:01:03.680> soon

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
visual metaphor of a dragon maybe soon

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.049 
visual metaphor of a dragon maybe soon
is<00:01:04.070> actually<00:01:04.489> a<00:01:04.550> little<00:01:04.729> bit<00:01:04.850> challenging

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
is actually a little bit challenging

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.969 
is actually a little bit challenging
because<00:01:05.449> some<00:01:05.780> of<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:05.930> curves<00:01:06.110> some<00:01:06.830> of<00:01:06.920> the

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
because some of the curves some of the

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:08.920 
because some of the curves some of the
shapes<00:01:07.160> are<00:01:07.369> curved<00:01:07.729> so<00:01:08.479> that<00:01:08.630> makes<00:01:08.780> it<00:01:08.899> a

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
shapes are curved so that makes it a

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:09.910 
shapes are curved so that makes it a
little<00:01:09.020> bit<00:01:09.200> of<00:01:09.320> a<00:01:09.380> challenge

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
little bit of a challenge

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.350 
little bit of a challenge
my<00:01:10.250> other<00:01:10.369> castles<00:01:10.670> has<00:01:10.970> been<00:01:11.090> pretty<00:01:11.270> much

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
my other castles has been pretty much

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.510 
my other castles has been pretty much
straight<00:01:11.990> with<00:01:12.259> the<00:01:12.410> towers<00:01:12.860> and<00:01:13.069> the<00:01:13.130> turrets

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
straight with the towers and the turrets

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.010 
straight with the towers and the turrets
and<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:13.759> walls<00:01:14.030> have<00:01:14.360> all<00:01:14.479> been<00:01:14.690> pretty<00:01:14.810> much

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
and the walls have all been pretty much

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.809 
and the walls have all been pretty much
straight<00:01:15.289> angles<00:01:15.740> so<00:01:16.369> this<00:01:16.520> one's<00:01:16.670> a<00:01:16.700> little

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:16.819 
straight angles so this one's a little

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:18.820 
straight angles so this one's a little
bit<00:01:17.000> challenging<00:01:17.179> but<00:01:17.569> a<00:01:17.600> lot<00:01:17.780> of<00:01:17.899> fun<00:01:18.080> and<00:01:18.319> you

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
bit challenging but a lot of fun and you

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
can all be printed up on one sheet of

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.219 
can all be printed up on one sheet of
paper<00:01:20.060> on<00:01:20.950> sheets<00:01:21.950> of<00:01:22.130> paper<00:01:22.310> in<00:01:22.610> your<00:01:22.759> printer
