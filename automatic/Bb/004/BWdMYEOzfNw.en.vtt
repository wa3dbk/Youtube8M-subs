00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.249
 and friends welcome to another video of 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.299
 mods in skyrim and it was not dead 

00:00:05.249 --> 00:00:12.839
 I was waiting to relive the response and 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:15.560
 today I have the mod 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:17.390
 perfect 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.390
 and it's very simple they have to download the 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:24.710
 way they have to go to this part bout 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.560
 saint hour latorre down who can 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.410
 see far away 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:33.010
 today at 25 skyrim have gone through this 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.410
 they know that there are many bandits and 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:39.400
 well what does this mode do? 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:42.010
 that adds a predator to your world 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.040
 they write and the good thing about that is that they 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.110
 you can remove the armor and use it but 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:53.949
 First you must beat the duel 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:57.040
 creator of the series is that the truth is 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.930
 a very ballistic dog see him 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.710
 even wait for me just open the door 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:05.379
 and I'm going to attack good the move is 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.270
 also says that it partly resembles 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.140
 Warrior 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.119
 kind of dark souls 2 + the warrior do not know 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.820
 good in dark souls but maybe the 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:19.479
 it looks familiar the predator maybe 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.179
 for is to fall into it maybe mcguire is 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.689
 seems to creator because if the point is 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:28.930
 that adds 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.880
 to your game and here I have it is 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.270
 finishing killing the bandits in 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.270
 this tower 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:47.040
 and well there is my enemy 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.670
 that's right here is the predator 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.680
 can not see the truth I'm doing 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.800
 trap I have revenge 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.520
 god activated if they want to fight does it 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.140
 one skin 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:06.100
 tense and difficult I recommend you fight 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.560
 with the fifth level 2030 no pain ever 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.300
 it's 20 32 and they must be 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.930
 prepared with many positions because 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.290
 this type of missiles 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.959
 maybe the taste of a little skyrim 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.500
 you install this mold while a flight to 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.870
 play against him 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.400
 the winner takes all creator not 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.250
 I have time already I know that I am like a level 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.250
 3 I do not know I'm going down in nothing of life 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.320
 the answers to these tasks 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.840
 strong had to fall once more 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:56.440
 there fell to the other side 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.060
 so you do not like my voice just you 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.140
 memory 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.140
 the words 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:09.780
 and I think he died 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:12.540
 apparently the strongest warrior 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:16.580
 has the ability to water 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.250
 what's still alive 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.830
 the problem 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:26.710
 I will fight to the death after five years 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:30.280
 to do a little cheating 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:34.270
 the power of console magic 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:37.030
 for a dead thanks loser you were a 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.690
 very worthy rival but unfortunately not 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.900
 I have so much time 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.430
 I will return when I have a better level and 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.660
 now let's see what it is that has 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.910
 has these two berserker swords that 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.420
 they have fire damage 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.430
 this is more or less like that the great thing 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.580
 just the doubt to carry and this is 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:02.810
 armor of the emperor obviously here 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.760
 the skin you have to dedicate so 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.880
 let's put on the armor to see what 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.880
 such 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.220
 it is assumed that from the outside you can see how it is 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.489
 the armor is not crap 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.040
 horseshoe that was brought and we are going to equip 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.190
 the swords to have the complete set 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.050
 of 3 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.750
 good 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:32.350
 there is the predator 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:36.190
 matt walker if you are fans of stark shows 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.230
 I do not really die too well 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.880
 it's time now that I have the armor 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.500
 to do my 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.500
 my predatory imitation 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.599
 the bingos sounds ridiculous I'm sorry 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:02.130
 as a wedding emperor attack from 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.130
 farther places 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.070
 jump to good scale can be 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.000
 at our moment it would be great to have a 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:12.310
 position of 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.610
 invisibility but there's no time to 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.610
 that 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:23.199
 and I'm scaring something like that game 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:25.199
 to the psoe without a bomb let this giant go 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:27.260
 to kill 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:30.020
 to 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.620
 we know we have a good giant 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:37.460
 but not so good to dodge 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:40.460
 my backs to the leg 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.580
 I also do not leave around sorry I am 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.400
 a bad predator imitator 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.800
 what if I'm not bad is doing what 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:52.229
 makes a good predator as a prize 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.229
 I'll take the giant's finger and I'll eat it 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.440
 finish
