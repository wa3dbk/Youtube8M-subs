started<00:00:16.199> with<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.500> front<00:00:28.070> right

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:47.190 

on<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.420> sides

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.740 

right<00:00:48.200> to<00:00:48.500> my<00:00:48.620> collarbone<00:00:49.220> on<00:00:50.180> the<00:00:50.330> left<00:00:50.540> side

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
right to my collarbone on the left side

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.930 
right to my collarbone on the left side
on<00:00:51.140> the<00:00:51.320> right<00:00:51.530> side<00:00:54.129> it's<00:00:55.129> a<00:00:55.190> little<00:00:55.430> past<00:00:55.610> my

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
on the right side it's a little past my

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.750 
on the right side it's a little past my
collarbone<00:00:56.480> so<00:00:56.720> it<00:00:56.809> seems<00:00:57.080> as<00:00:57.290> though<00:00:57.760> the

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
collarbone so it seems as though the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.000 
collarbone so it seems as though the
left<00:00:59.000> side<00:00:59.270> is<00:00:59.629> a<00:00:59.660> little<00:00:59.989> bit<00:01:00.140> shorter<00:01:00.739> than

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010

left side is a little bit shorter than
the<00:01:01.879> right<00:01:02.120> side
