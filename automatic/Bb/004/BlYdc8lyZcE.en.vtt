you're<00:03:43.440> not<00:03:43.590> going<00:03:43.770> to<00:03:43.830> manage<00:03:44.160> that<00:03:44.190> if

you're not going to manage that if

you're fatigued dizzy unconscious or

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.520 
you're fatigued dizzy unconscious or
dead<00:03:47.180> so<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.300> best<00:03:48.510> thing<00:03:48.660> we<00:03:48.870> can<00:03:49.020> do<00:03:49.200> is<00:03:49.230> make

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
dead so the best thing we can do is make

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.590 
dead so the best thing we can do is make
sure<00:03:49.560> that<00:03:49.710> when<00:03:50.010> we're<00:03:50.190> exercising<00:03:50.490> to<00:03:51.390> keep

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
sure that when we're exercising to keep

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.750 
sure that when we're exercising to keep
a<00:03:51.720> nice<00:03:51.960> cool<00:03:52.350> temperature<00:03:53.010> and<00:03:53.220> to<00:03:53.550> be<00:03:53.670> able

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
a nice cool temperature and to be able

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.120 
a nice cool temperature and to be able
to<00:03:53.970> prolong<00:03:54.180> that<00:03:54.420> exercise<00:03:54.960> and<00:03:55.290> ultimately

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
to prolong that exercise and ultimately

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:04.880 
to prolong that exercise and ultimately
burn<00:03:56.700> more<00:03:57.060> body<00:03:57.330> fat

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.380 

so<00:04:05.890> let's<00:04:06.130> take<00:04:06.370> a<00:04:06.430> cautious<00:04:06.730> about<00:04:07.210> a

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
so let's take a cautious about a

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.570 
so let's take a cautious about a
common-sense<00:04:07.870> approach<00:04:08.200> and<00:04:08.710> look<00:04:09.310> at<00:04:09.490> this

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
common-sense approach and look at this

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.980 
common-sense approach and look at this
from<00:04:09.700> a<00:04:09.820> different<00:04:09.850> angle<00:04:12.630> okay<00:04:13.630> so<00:04:13.690> we've<00:04:13.870> got

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
from a different angle okay so we've got

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.390 
from a different angle okay so we've got
three<00:04:14.200> different<00:04:14.350> grips<00:04:14.770> in<00:04:14.980> three<00:04:15.190> different

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
three different grips in three different

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.750 
three different grips in three different
forms<00:04:15.880> the<00:04:16.420> first<00:04:16.720> group<00:04:16.930> a<00:04:17.230> plump<00:04:17.760> healthy

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
forms the first group a plump healthy

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.090 
forms the first group a plump healthy
and<00:04:18.970> fully<00:04:19.329> hydrated<00:04:19.810> now<00:04:20.500> we<00:04:20.560> pull<00:04:20.859> the<00:04:20.950> water

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
and fully hydrated now we pull the water

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.770 
and fully hydrated now we pull the water
out<00:04:21.310> of<00:04:21.370> those<00:04:21.549> become<00:04:21.970> dehydrated<00:04:22.150> and

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
out of those become dehydrated and

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.660 
out of those become dehydrated and
become<00:04:23.110> reasons<00:04:23.590> they're<00:04:24.190> a<00:04:24.220> little<00:04:24.490> bit

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
become reasons they're a little bit

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.760 
become reasons they're a little bit

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
beat up to him grip again but ultimately

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.030 
beat up to him grip again but ultimately
then<00:04:40.150> more<00:04:40.510> or<00:04:40.660> less<00:04:40.810> gaining<00:04:41.350> back<00:04:41.620> what's

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
then more or less gaining back what's

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.100

they get hydrated again ultimately they

they get hydrated again ultimately they

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
never be that grip again because the

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.350 
never be that grip again because the
damage<00:04:50.980> has<00:04:51.220> been<00:04:51.250> done<00:04:51.370> to<00:04:51.580> him<00:04:51.850> through<00:04:52.270> the

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
damage has been done to him through the

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.350 
damage has been done to him through the
dehydration<00:04:52.960> during<00:04:53.380> that<00:04:53.530> process<00:04:54.150> now<00:04:55.150> it's

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
dehydration during that process now it's

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.360 
dehydration during that process now it's
exactly<00:04:55.960> the<00:04:56.140> same<00:04:56.410> or<00:04:56.590> more<00:04:56.620> or<00:04:57.070> less<00:04:57.190> the

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
exactly the same or more or less the

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.940 
exactly the same or more or less the
same<00:04:57.400> with<00:04:57.700> our<00:04:57.850> bodies<00:04:58.410> when<00:04:59.410> we<00:04:59.590> lose<00:04:59.890> that

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
same with our bodies when we lose that

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.730 
same with our bodies when we lose that
what<00:05:00.400> way<00:05:00.669> it's<00:05:00.970> not<00:05:01.480> permanent<00:05:01.810> it's<00:05:02.320> only

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
what way it's not permanent it's only

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.040 
what way it's not permanent it's only
temporary<00:05:03.130> as<00:05:03.700> soon<00:05:04.030> as<00:05:04.180> we<00:05:04.360> hydrate<00:05:04.900> the<00:05:05.020> body

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
temporary as soon as we hydrate the body

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.560 
temporary as soon as we hydrate the body
again<00:05:05.530> it<00:05:05.830> will<00:05:06.160> take<00:05:06.430> on<00:05:06.700> that<00:05:06.820> water<00:05:07.090> again

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
again it will take on that water again

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.560 
again it will take on that water again
and<00:05:07.780> go<00:05:08.020> back<00:05:08.290> so<00:05:08.800> almost<00:05:09.100> or<00:05:09.700> definitely<00:05:10.330> its

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
and go back so almost or definitely its

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.010 
and go back so almost or definitely its
original<00:05:11.110> way<00:05:11.260> in<00:05:12.000> the<00:05:13.000> meantime<00:05:13.240> the

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
original way in the meantime the

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.990 
original way in the meantime the
dehydration<00:05:14.770> process<00:05:14.950> which<00:05:15.490> we<00:05:15.640> put<00:05:15.880> our

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
dehydration process which we put our

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.820 
dehydration process which we put our
body<00:05:16.240> through<00:05:16.479> can<00:05:17.050> wreak<00:05:17.229> havoc<00:05:17.650> on<00:05:17.770> our

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
body through can wreak havoc on our

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.159 
body through can wreak havoc on our
health<00:05:18.220> it<00:05:18.700> can<00:05:18.760> prosper<00:05:19.210> problems<00:05:19.960> with<00:05:20.080> our

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
health it can prosper problems with our

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.400 
health it can prosper problems with our
kidneys<00:05:20.680> with<00:05:21.340> our<00:05:21.520> skin<00:05:22.030> and<00:05:22.210> ultimately<00:05:23.169> we

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
kidneys with our skin and ultimately we

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.590 
kidneys with our skin and ultimately we
can<00:05:23.440> end<00:05:23.770> up<00:05:23.890> looking<00:05:24.280> worse<00:05:24.360> than<00:05:25.360> when<00:05:25.570> we

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
can end up looking worse than when we

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.500 
can end up looking worse than when we
