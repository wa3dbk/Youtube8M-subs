00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
to start painting well I had a little

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.300 
to start painting well I had a little
bit<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.659> change<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:46.049> plan<00:01:46.350> instead<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.189> going

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
bit of change in plan instead of going

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.920 
bit of change in plan instead of going
ahead<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.700> finishing<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.240> other<00:01:48.360> wheels<00:01:48.630> yet

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
ahead and finishing the other wheels yet

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.960 
ahead and finishing the other wheels yet
I<00:01:49.140> wanted<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.829> go<00:01:49.950> ahead<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.399> see<00:01:50.610> what<00:01:50.790> one

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
I wanted to go ahead and see what one

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.530 
I wanted to go ahead and see what one
would<00:01:51.149> look<00:01:51.270> like<00:01:51.509> with<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.590> first<00:01:52.799> coat<00:01:53.159> on

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
would look like with the first coat on

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.380 
would look like with the first coat on
it<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:54.720> here's<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.380> before<00:01:55.970> and<00:01:56.970> I<00:01:57.180> went<00:01:57.329> ahead

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
it so here's the before and I went ahead

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.210 
it so here's the before and I went ahead
and<00:01:57.630> refinished<00:01:58.049> one<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:58.470> black<00:01:58.799> it's<00:01:59.130> not

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
and refinished one in black it's not

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.980 
and refinished one in black it's not
done<00:01:59.610> it's<00:01:59.850> just<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.119> first<00:02:00.299> coating<00:02:00.630> but

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
done it's just the first coating but

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.080 
done it's just the first coating but
it's<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.259> massive<00:02:01.710> difference<00:02:01.939> and<00:02:02.939> it's

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
it's a massive difference and it's

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.450 
it's a massive difference and it's
definitely<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.540> look<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.869> like<00:02:04.170> better<00:02:04.460> so

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
definitely a look I like better so

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.469 
definitely a look I like better so
there's<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.540> first<00:02:06.719> coat<00:02:07.700> it's<00:02:08.700> drying<00:02:09.269> right

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
there's the first coat it's drying right

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.330 
there's the first coat it's drying right
now<00:02:09.570> it'll<00:02:09.750> be<00:02:09.869> about<00:02:10.079> an<00:02:10.259> hour<00:02:10.350> before<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:10.950> can

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
now it'll be about an hour before I can

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.060 
now it'll be about an hour before I can
put<00:02:11.519> the<00:02:11.640> second<00:02:12.030> coat<00:02:12.209> on<00:02:12.530> and<00:02:13.530> after<00:02:13.799> the

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
put the second coat on and after the

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.770 
put the second coat on and after the
second<00:02:14.459> coat<00:02:14.760> that'll<00:02:15.090> be<00:02:15.180> about<00:02:15.390> three<00:02:15.630> hours

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
second coat that'll be about three hours

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.090 
second coat that'll be about three hours
before<00:02:15.959> I<00:02:16.290> can<00:02:16.470> handle<00:02:16.829> it

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
before I can handle it

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.120 
before I can handle it
but<00:02:17.700> anyway<00:02:18.000> big<00:02:18.269> difference<00:02:18.780> from<00:02:19.650> the

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
but anyway big difference from the

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.670 
but anyway big difference from the
before<00:02:20.489> can<00:02:20.820> coat<00:02:21.030> done<00:02:21.329> it<00:02:21.989> has<00:02:22.140> been<00:02:22.170> drying

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
before can coat done it has been drying

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.100 
before can coat done it has been drying
for<00:02:22.829> about<00:02:23.130> a<00:02:23.430> half<00:02:23.700> an<00:02:23.880> hour<00:02:24.000> so<00:02:24.120> far<00:02:24.570> it<00:02:24.840> still

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
for about a half an hour so far it still

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.780 
for about a half an hour so far it still
got<00:02:25.230> about<00:02:25.380> two<00:02:25.769> and<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:25.950> half<00:02:26.040> hours<00:02:26.430> before

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
got about two and a half hours before

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.390 
got about two and a half hours before
I'll<00:02:26.910> feel<00:02:27.150> like<00:02:27.530> I'm<00:02:28.530> comfortable<00:02:28.950> handling

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
I'll feel like I'm comfortable handling

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.190 
I'll feel like I'm comfortable handling
and<00:02:29.549> I've<00:02:29.640> laid<00:02:29.850> it<00:02:29.880> out<00:02:30.090> in<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.329> Sun<00:02:30.570> so<00:02:30.989> it'll

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
and I've laid it out in the Sun so it'll

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.650 
and I've laid it out in the Sun so it'll
bake<00:02:31.739> on<00:02:31.920> there<00:02:32.190> a<00:02:32.220> little<00:02:32.400> faster<00:02:32.700> they<00:02:33.390> still

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
bake on there a little faster they still

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.390 
bake on there a little faster they still
take<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:33.930> few<00:02:34.170> days<00:02:34.380> for<00:02:34.680> it<00:02:34.769> to<00:02:34.829> cure<00:02:35.070> but<00:02:35.280> I'll

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
take a few days for it to cure but I'll

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.259 
take a few days for it to cure but I'll
put<00:02:35.549> that<00:02:35.730> this<00:02:36.239> away<00:02:36.540> in<00:02:36.720> my<00:02:36.930> storage<00:02:37.850> shop<00:02:38.850> so

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
it have a couple days to cure before I

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.309 
it have a couple days to cure before I
put<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.550> back<00:02:41.580> on<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.940> truck<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:42.420> got<00:02:43.140> the

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
put it back on the truck I got the

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.110 
put it back on the truck I got the
second<00:02:43.680> wheel<00:02:43.830> ready<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.340> go<00:02:44.519> it

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
second wheel ready to go it

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.640 
second wheel ready to go it
sanded<00:02:45.450> down<00:02:45.480> is<00:02:45.840> cleaned<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.349> this<00:02:46.470> is

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
sanded down is cleaned and this is

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.170 
sanded down is cleaned and this is
finishing<00:02:46.980> drying<00:02:47.340> right<00:02:47.549> now<00:02:47.670> so<00:02:47.849> I<00:02:47.909> can<00:02:48.090> go

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
finishing drying right now so I can go

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.690 
finishing drying right now so I can go
ahead<00:02:48.299> and<00:02:48.450> start<00:02:48.629> spraying<00:02:48.959> that<00:02:49.290> but<00:02:49.700> it's

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
ahead and start spraying that but it's

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.339 
ahead and start spraying that but it's
definitely<00:02:51.030> taking<00:02:51.450> longer<00:02:51.690> than<00:02:51.900> I<00:02:52.110> would

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
definitely taking longer than I would

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.789 
definitely taking longer than I would
have<00:02:52.379> imagined<00:02:53.069> but<00:02:53.220> that's<00:02:53.610> just<00:02:53.790> part<00:02:54.000> of<00:02:54.150> it

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
have imagined but that's just part of it

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.350 
have imagined but that's just part of it
never<00:02:55.799> goes<00:02:56.010> as<00:02:56.310> quick<00:02:56.549> as<00:02:56.730> you<00:02:56.879> would<00:02:57.030> like<00:02:57.209> it

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
never goes as quick as you would like it

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.250 
never goes as quick as you would like it
to<00:02:57.390> but<00:02:58.260> uh<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:59.040> can't<00:02:59.280> rush<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.640> results

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
to but uh you can't rush the results
