system<00:00:56.420> you<00:00:57.420> know<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.600> traditional

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
system you know in traditional

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.319 
system you know in traditional
psychotherapists<00:00:59.190> there's<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.460> idea<00:00:59.850> that

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
psychotherapists there's the idea that

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.209 
psychotherapists there's the idea that
we<00:01:00.510> have<00:01:01.350> experienced<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.890> number<00:01:01.920> of

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
we have experienced a number of

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.070 
we have experienced a number of
traumatic<00:01:02.760> things<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.539> course<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.930> our

traumatic things in the course of our

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.520 
traumatic things in the course of our
life<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.559> there<00:01:04.710> it's<00:01:04.979> kind<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.339> mosaic<00:01:05.760> of

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
life and there it's kind of a mosaic of

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.580 
life and there it's kind of a mosaic of
traumas<00:01:07.530> whereas<00:01:08.430> if<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.820> work<00:01:09.060> on<00:01:09.330> these

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
traumas whereas if you work on these

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.700 
traumas whereas if you work on these
past<00:01:10.590> issues<00:01:10.860> using<00:01:12.590> experience<00:01:13.590> or

these traumatic memories seem to form

these traumatic memories seem to form
certain<00:01:23.640> kinds<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.060> constellations<00:01:24.920> so<00:01:25.920> for

certain kinds of constellations so for

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.890 
certain kinds of constellations so for
example<00:01:26.430> when<00:01:26.580> somebody<00:01:26.820> has<00:01:27.330> problems<00:01:27.840> with

example when somebody has problems with

example when somebody has problems with
a<00:01:28.049> self-image<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.549> kind<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.880> word<00:01:30.150> work

a self-image in this kind of word work

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.649 
a self-image in this kind of word work
what<00:01:31.140> can<00:01:31.320> come<00:01:31.560> up<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.280> series<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:33.150> traumas

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
what can come up is a series of traumas

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.980 
what can come up is a series of traumas
that<00:01:33.900> have<00:01:34.350> damaged<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.130> person's

periods of that person's life and they

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.429 
periods of that person's life and they
create<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> kind<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:41.060> constellation<00:01:42.320> you<00:01:43.320> know

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
specific forms of behavior and so on

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.380 
specific forms of behavior and so on
and<00:02:13.409> what<00:02:13.620> is<00:02:13.739> fascinating<00:02:13.920> here<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:14.879> that

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
and what is fascinating here is that

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.330 
and what is fascinating here is that
each<00:02:15.659> of<00:02:15.689> those<00:02:16.049> coax<00:02:16.560> system<00:02:16.890> seems<00:02:17.159> to<00:02:17.249> be

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
each of those coax system seems to be

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.449 
each of those coax system seems to be
anchored<00:02:17.939> in<00:02:18.269> a<00:02:19.019> particular<00:02:19.319> facet<00:02:19.920> of<00:02:20.099> the

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
anchored in a particular facet of the

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.179

varied<00:02:39.959> for<00:02:40.409> very<00:02:40.680> distinct<00:02:41.219> patterns<00:02:41.790> of

certain kind of imagery which was very

certain kind of imagery which was very

specific for each of these clusters and

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.209 
specific for each of these clusters and
it<00:02:57.540> was<00:02:57.689> actually<00:02:57.840> people<00:02:58.319> themselves<00:02:58.469> who

00:02:59.209 --> 00:02:59.219 
it was actually people themselves who

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:03.199 
it was actually people themselves who
started<00:03:00.120> relating<00:03:00.780> them<00:03:00.989> to<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:02.760> specific

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
started relating them to the specific

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.270 
started relating them to the specific

mm-hm<00:03:05.699> and<00:03:05.819> so<00:03:06.359> I<00:03:06.389> sort<00:03:06.599> of<00:03:06.659> extracted<00:03:07.290> somehow

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
mm-hm and so I sort of extracted somehow

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.420 
mm-hm and so I sort of extracted somehow
the<00:03:08.430> experiential<00:03:09.090> patterns<00:03:09.629> from<00:03:10.430> people's

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
the experiential patterns from people's

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.420 
the experiential patterns from people's
accounts<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.319> I<00:03:13.319> started<00:03:13.590> referring<00:03:14.099> to<00:03:14.280> them

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
accounts and I started referring to them

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.659 
accounts and I started referring to them
as<00:03:14.750> basic<00:03:15.750> perinatal<00:03:16.319> matrices<00:03:16.739> we've

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:17.669 
as basic perinatal matrices we've

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:19.460 
as basic perinatal matrices we've
already<00:03:17.849> touched<00:03:18.180> on<00:03:18.479> the<00:03:18.689> first<00:03:18.989> of<00:03:19.290> these

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
already touched on the first of these

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.229 
already touched on the first of these
when<00:03:19.769> I<00:03:19.799> mentioned<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.400> experience<00:03:21.060> of

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
when I mentioned the experience of

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.530 
when I mentioned the experience of
oneness<00:03:21.479> in<00:03:21.959> in<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.530> womb<00:03:22.849> how<00:03:23.849> would<00:03:24.120> how

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
oneness in in the womb how would how

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.999 
oneness in in the womb how would how
would<00:03:24.569> that<00:03:24.870> for<00:03:25.199> example<00:03:25.560> in<00:03:25.829> your

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:26.009 
would that for example in your

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:31.119 
would that for example in your
experience<00:03:26.639> affect<00:03:27.449> later<00:03:27.750> life<00:03:28.680> development

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.129 
experience affect later life development

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.949 
experience affect later life development
that<00:03:32.129> depends<00:03:32.699> very<00:03:32.909> much<00:03:33.150> as<00:03:33.509> I<00:03:33.780> already

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
that depends very much as I already

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.319 
that depends very much as I already
mentioned<00:03:34.489> what<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.669> experience<00:03:36.150> was<00:03:36.299> like

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
mentioned what the experience was like

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.569 
mentioned what the experience was like
mm-hmm<00:03:36.989> so<00:03:37.500> if<00:03:37.769> that<00:03:37.979> experience<00:03:38.280> was

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
mm-hmm so if that experience was

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.319 
mm-hmm so if that experience was
predominantly<00:03:39.329> positive<00:03:40.169> and<00:03:40.430> if<00:03:41.430> let's<00:03:42.239> say

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
predominantly positive and if let's say

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.899 
predominantly positive and if let's say
under<00:03:42.479> the<00:03:42.659> influence<00:03:43.079> of<00:03:43.169> later<00:03:43.909> experiences
