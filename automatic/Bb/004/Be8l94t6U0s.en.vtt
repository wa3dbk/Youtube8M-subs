00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.650 
that I should have one from the other
person<00:03:28.620> so<00:03:28.800> that's<00:03:29.430> kind<00:03:29.670> of<00:03:29.730> weird<00:03:29.880> but<00:03:30.150> that

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
person so that's kind of weird but that

was an extra three mil to add to the
bank<00:03:32.370> I<00:03:32.580> think<00:03:33.180> about<00:03:33.330> a<00:03:33.360> 30<00:03:33.780> mil<00:03:34.020> cash<00:03:34.230> stack

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.400 
bank I think about a 30 mil cash stack
right<00:03:34.710> now<00:03:34.920> so<00:03:35.580> less<00:03:36.450> than<00:03:36.630> 20<00:03:36.930> mil<00:03:37.080> away<00:03:37.230> from

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
right now so less than 20 mil away from

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.130 
right now so less than 20 mil away from
forplay<00:03:37.680> body<00:03:38.130> I<00:03:38.370> came<00:03:38.970> here<00:03:39.420> thinking<00:03:39.780> maybe

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
forplay body I came here thinking maybe

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.570

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.670 
more information on route fest to see
when<00:03:50.250> it<00:03:50.370> is<00:03:50.720> because<00:03:51.720> obviously<00:03:51.900> I've<00:03:52.260> school

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
when it is because obviously I've school

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.700 
when it is because obviously I've school
so<00:03:53.040> whatever<00:03:53.820> that<00:03:54.030> is<00:03:54.240> it's<00:03:54.570> it's<00:03:54.990> possible
