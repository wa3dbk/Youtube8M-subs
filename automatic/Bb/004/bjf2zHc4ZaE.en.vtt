that one MMA dude anderson silva and

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.030 
that one MMA dude anderson silva and
once<00:03:30.660> he<00:03:30.780> figures<00:03:30.930> you<00:03:31.080> out<00:03:31.350> he<00:03:31.650> figures<00:03:31.920> out

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
once he figures you out he figures out

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.560 
once he figures you out he figures out
your<00:03:32.220> moves<00:03:32.400> he'll<00:03:32.610> do<00:03:32.760> like<00:03:32.940> a<00:03:32.970> shimmy<00:03:33.270> bop

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
your moves he'll do like a shimmy bop

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.180 
your moves he'll do like a shimmy bop
around<00:03:33.750> you<00:03:34.050> and<00:03:34.200> kind<00:03:34.380> of<00:03:34.470> like<00:03:34.620> an<00:03:34.770> Irish<00:03:34.920> you

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
around you and kind of like an Irish you

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.740 
around you and kind of like an Irish you
and<00:03:35.730> that's<00:03:35.850> what<00:03:35.970> i<00:03:36.030> was<00:03:36.150> going<00:03:36.270> for<00:03:36.390> right

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
and that's what i was going for right

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.180 
and that's what i was going for right
now<00:03:36.780> with<00:03:37.080> that<00:03:37.200> little<00:03:37.350> dragon<00:03:37.800> dance<00:03:38.010> in

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
now with that little dragon dance in

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.630 
now with that little dragon dance in
their<00:03:38.310> face<00:03:39.710> okay<00:03:40.710> so<00:03:40.770> i<00:03:40.980> just<00:03:41.160> picked<00:03:41.340> up<00:03:41.460> some

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
their face okay so i just picked up some

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.090 
their face okay so i just picked up some
like<00:03:41.820> super<00:03:42.240> red<00:03:42.450> fire<00:03:42.780> mode<00:03:43.110> and<00:03:43.470> it<00:03:43.830> makes<00:03:44.010> my

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
like super red fire mode and it makes my

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.310 
like super red fire mode and it makes my
fire<00:03:44.310> sound<00:03:44.610> better<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:45.990> probably<00:03:46.140> does

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
fire sound better and it probably does

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.470 
fire sound better and it probably does
more<00:03:46.500> damage<00:03:46.530> or<00:03:47.040> kills<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:47.550> it's<00:03:47.640> faster<00:03:48.030> but

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
more damage or kills you it's faster but

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.460 
more damage or kills you it's faster but
i<00:03:48.570> like<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.810> sense<00:03:50.870> you<00:03:51.870> can<00:03:51.990> expect<00:03:52.320> more

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
i like the sense you can expect more

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.650 
i like the sense you can expect more
power-ups<00:03:52.830> you<00:03:53.220> can<00:03:53.370> expect<00:03:53.700> more<00:03:53.940> upgrades

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
power-ups you can expect more upgrades

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.490 
power-ups you can expect more upgrades
and<00:03:55.050> i<00:03:55.140> hope<00:03:55.380> there's<00:03:55.650> a<00:03:55.710> boss<00:03:56.900> pretty<00:03:57.900> cool<00:03:58.140> at

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
and i hope there's a boss pretty cool at

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.230 
and i hope there's a boss pretty cool at
first<00:03:58.710> I<00:03:58.890> was<00:03:59.010> kind<00:03:59.190> of<00:03:59.250> upset<00:03:59.430> because<00:03:59.760> the

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
first I was kind of upset because the

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.990 
first I was kind of upset because the
banner<00:04:01.230> action<00:04:01.740> was<00:04:01.950> fairly<00:04:02.190> low<00:04:02.520> or<00:04:02.850> like

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
banner action was fairly low or like

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.760 
banner action was fairly low or like
there<00:04:03.180> wasn't<00:04:03.330> a<00:04:03.450> whole<00:04:03.480> lot<00:04:03.600> of<00:04:03.810> input<00:04:03.960> but<00:04:04.470> I

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
there wasn't a whole lot of input but I

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.800 
there wasn't a whole lot of input but I
kind<00:04:05.490> of<00:04:05.550> cast<00:04:05.760> that<00:04:05.970> mentality<00:04:06.270> to<00:04:06.540> the<00:04:06.660> side

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
kind of cast that mentality to the side

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.600 
kind of cast that mentality to the side
pretty<00:04:07.080> quick<00:04:07.320> and<00:04:07.500> found<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:08.220> game<00:04:08.370> that<00:04:08.550> I

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
pretty quick and found the game that I

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.970 
pretty quick and found the game that I
really<00:04:08.850> enjoyed<00:04:09.180> and<00:04:09.480> that<00:04:09.930> I<00:04:10.080> am<00:04:10.650> gonna<00:04:10.800> play
