Rocky<00:01:22.170> Mountain<00:01:22.259> ATV<00:01:22.890> when<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.130> was<00:01:23.340> over<00:01:23.640> there

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
back east but didn't have him here so I

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.679 
back east but didn't have him here so I
bought<00:01:32.250> these<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.970> when<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.119> got<00:01:33.360> him<00:01:33.570> it

bought these and when I got him it

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.060 
bought these and when I got him it
looked<00:01:33.869> like<00:01:33.990> they<00:01:34.140> were<00:01:34.170> gonna<00:01:34.320> be<00:01:34.590> way<00:01:35.040> too

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
looked like they were gonna be way too

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.480 
looked like they were gonna be way too
wide<00:01:36.560> especially<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.680> phone<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.189> was<00:01:38.310> kind

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
wide especially the phone so I was kind

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.240 
wide especially the phone so I was kind
of<00:01:38.520> concerned<00:01:38.880> about<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.210> handling<00:01:39.600> on<00:01:39.750> him

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
of concerned about the handling on him

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.929 
of concerned about the handling on him
but<00:01:41.899> once<00:01:42.899> they<00:01:43.049> got<00:01:43.200> on<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:44.189> rim<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.640> got

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
but once they got on the rim and got

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.460 
but once they got on the rim and got
inflated<00:01:45.450> up<00:01:45.600> they<00:01:46.549> actually<00:01:47.549> look<00:01:47.670> really

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
inflated up they actually look really

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.010 
inflated up they actually look really
good<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:50.479> don't<00:01:51.479> know<00:01:51.540> how<00:01:51.659> it's<00:01:51.810> possible

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
good so I don't know how it's possible

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.050 
good so I don't know how it's possible
but<00:01:52.350> they<00:01:52.590> actually<00:01:53.100> make<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.700> easier<00:01:53.790> to

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
but they actually make it easier to

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.160 
but they actually make it easier to
steer<00:01:54.540> than<00:01:54.869> my<00:01:55.079> stock<00:01:55.380> Dunlop's<00:01:56.189> did<00:01:56.490> so

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
steer than my stock Dunlop's did so

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.590 
steer than my stock Dunlop's did so
pretty<00:01:58.170> happy<00:01:58.439> about<00:01:58.469> that

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
pretty happy about that

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.870 
pretty happy about that
as<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.619> mentioned<00:02:02.009> these<00:02:02.100> are<00:02:02.810> 26<00:02:03.810> tall<00:02:04.469> and

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
as I mentioned these are 26 tall and

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.429 
as I mentioned these are 26 tall and
they<00:02:05.880> will<00:02:06.119> measure<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.540> if<00:02:07.020> they're

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
they will measure that if they're

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.889 
they will measure that if they're
inflated<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.069> 15<00:02:08.459> psi<00:02:09.030> like<00:02:09.390> they<00:02:09.539> were<00:02:09.599> when

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
inflated to 15 psi like they were when

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.630 
inflated to 15 psi like they were when
the<00:02:10.020> bead<00:02:10.200> was<00:02:10.410> seated

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
the bead was seated

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.140 
the bead was seated
but<00:02:12.090> got<00:02:12.510> them<00:02:12.660> down<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:13.910> three<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:15.060> half

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
but got them down to three and a half

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.240 
but got them down to three and a half
pounds<00:02:15.420> right<00:02:15.810> now<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.440> they're<00:02:17.010> measuring

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
pounds right now and they're measuring

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.059 
pounds right now and they're measuring
right<00:02:17.640> at<00:02:17.819> 25<00:02:18.630> so<00:02:19.080> they<00:02:19.290> are<00:02:19.440> about<00:02:19.709> a<00:02:19.740> full

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
right at 25 so they are about a full

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.840 
right at 25 so they are about a full
inch<00:02:20.630> short<00:02:21.630> at<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.110> at<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.100> psi<00:02:23.520> that<00:02:23.700> you're

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
inch short at the at the psi that you're

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.000 
inch short at the at the psi that you're
actually<00:02:24.030> gonna<00:02:24.300> run<00:02:27.500> that's<00:02:28.500> probably<00:02:28.830> how<00:02:28.980> a

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
actually gonna run that's probably how a

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.870 
actually gonna run that's probably how a
lot<00:02:29.280> of<00:02:29.370> them<00:02:29.490> are<00:02:29.700> but<00:02:30.740> my<00:02:31.740> stock<00:02:32.310> Dunlop's

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560

the rear and they were actually 24 at
five<00:02:37.770> pounds<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:39.050> the<00:02:40.050> Front's<00:02:40.470> were

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.979 
I really liked the Elevens in the rear
their<00:02:58.360> website<00:02:58.959> says<00:02:59.290> that<00:02:59.319> the<00:02:59.620> Elevens<00:03:00.989> are

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
their website says that the Elevens are

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.720 
their website says that the Elevens are
actually<00:03:02.590> a<00:03:02.620> little<00:03:02.920> bit<00:03:03.160> lighter<00:03:03.459> than<00:03:03.580> the

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
actually a little bit lighter than the

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.369 
actually a little bit lighter than the
tens<00:03:04.769> but<00:03:05.819> have<00:03:06.819> a<00:03:06.849> higher<00:03:07.120> load<00:03:07.450> capacity<00:03:07.480> so

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
tens but have a higher load capacity so

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:09.839 
tens but have a higher load capacity so
I<00:03:08.620> don't<00:03:08.769> know<00:03:08.830> if<00:03:08.890> that's<00:03:09.069> a<00:03:09.190> misprint<00:03:09.580> or<00:03:09.730> not

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
I don't know if that's a misprint or not

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.199 
I don't know if that's a misprint or not
but<00:03:10.150> I<00:03:11.010> decided<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.190> go<00:03:12.310> with<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.519> 11s<00:03:13.030> and<00:03:13.090> I

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
but I decided to go with the 11s and I

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.740 
but I decided to go with the 11s and I
think<00:03:13.420> I'm<00:03:13.569> glad<00:03:13.690> I<00:03:13.780> did<00:03:14.110> I<00:03:15.450> really<00:03:16.450> look<00:03:16.569> good

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
think I'm glad I did I really look good

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:34.950 
think I'm glad I did I really look good
on<00:03:16.930> there<00:03:17.880> handling<00:03:18.880> is<00:03:19.170> vastly<00:03:20.170> improved

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:34.960 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.650 

then<00:03:35.500> riding<00:03:35.800> Maxis<00:03:36.670> Bighorns<00:03:37.240> for<00:03:37.450> a<00:03:37.480> long

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
then riding Maxis Bighorns for a long

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.190 
then riding Maxis Bighorns for a long
time<00:03:37.960> and<00:03:38.230> I<00:03:39.150> just<00:03:40.150> wanted<00:03:40.540> to<00:03:40.600> try<00:03:40.810> something

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
time and I just wanted to try something

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.550 
time and I just wanted to try something
a<00:03:41.230> little<00:03:41.290> different<00:03:42.330> around<00:03:43.330> my<00:03:44.140> neck<00:03:44.350> of<00:03:44.500> the

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
a little different around my neck of the

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.010 
a little different around my neck of the
woods<00:03:44.590> all<00:03:45.460> you<00:03:45.880> see<00:03:46.150> if<00:03:46.330> it's<00:03:46.540> an<00:03:46.660> aftermarket

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
woods all you see if it's an aftermarket

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.920 
woods all you see if it's an aftermarket
tire<00:03:47.440> is<00:03:47.830> as<00:03:48.550> Maxis<00:03:49.060> Bighorns<00:03:49.600> and<00:03:49.810> they're<00:03:49.900> a

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
tire is as Maxis Bighorns and they're a

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.030 
tire is as Maxis Bighorns and they're a
great<00:03:50.080> tire<00:03:52.140> but<00:03:53.140> read<00:03:53.290> a<00:03:53.320> few<00:03:53.500> reviews<00:03:53.560> on

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
great tire but read a few reviews on

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.700 
great tire but read a few reviews on
these<00:03:54.220> that<00:03:54.430> said<00:03:54.610> that<00:03:54.730> these<00:03:54.820> were<00:03:54.880> actually

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
these that said that these were actually

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.500 
these that said that these were actually
every<00:03:56.710> bit<00:03:56.890> as<00:03:56.980> good<00:03:57.220> at<00:03:57.370> every<00:03:57.670> category<00:03:57.940> as

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
every bit as good at every category as

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.240 
every bit as good at every category as
the<00:03:58.660> Bighorns<00:03:59.140> except<00:03:59.830> for<00:03:59.980> they<00:04:00.070> were

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
the Bighorns except for they were

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.570 
the Bighorns except for they were
actually<00:04:00.550> a<00:04:00.580> little<00:04:00.670> better<00:04:00.970> in<00:04:01.240> the<00:04:01.270> mud<00:04:02.580> no

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
actually a little better in the mud no

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.760 
actually a little better in the mud no
so<00:04:03.910> I<00:04:03.940> figured<00:04:04.480> I'd<00:04:04.570> try<00:04:04.780> these<00:04:04.840> so<00:04:05.410> far<00:04:05.620> I'm

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
so I figured I'd try these so far I'm

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:15.660 
so I figured I'd try these so far I'm
really<00:04:05.800> happy<00:04:06.220> with<00:04:06.460> them<00:04:14.220> I've<00:04:15.220> been<00:04:15.400> going

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
really happy with them I've been going

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:22.980 
really happy with them I've been going
around<00:04:15.790> some<00:04:16.780> pretty<00:04:16.930> steep<00:04:17.200> stuff<00:04:20.700> and<00:04:21.990> I

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
around some pretty steep stuff and I

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.720 
around some pretty steep stuff and I
haven't<00:04:23.770> even<00:04:23.920> needed<00:04:24.160> to<00:04:24.340> put<00:04:24.550> it<00:04:24.640> in

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
haven't even needed to put it in

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.330 
haven't even needed to put it in
four-wheel<00:04:25.000> drive<00:04:25.330> yet<00:04:25.570> of<00:04:26.050> course<00:04:26.280> these<00:04:27.280> are

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
four-wheel drive yet of course these are

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.870 
four-wheel drive yet of course these are
steeper<00:04:27.880> than<00:04:28.000> what<00:04:28.150> they<00:04:28.300> look<00:04:29.790> and<00:04:30.790> I've

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
steeper than what they look and I've

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.070 
steeper than what they look and I've
been<00:04:31.030> hitting<00:04:31.210> them<00:04:31.300> at<00:04:31.420> different<00:04:31.750> speeds

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
been hitting them at different speeds

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.960 
been hitting them at different speeds
just<00:04:32.380> to<00:04:32.500> see<00:04:32.710> if<00:04:32.800> I<00:04:33.040> was<00:04:33.160> gonna<00:04:33.340> be<00:04:33.820> able<00:04:33.880> to

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
just to see if I was gonna be able to

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.470 
just to see if I was gonna be able to
make<00:04:34.150> it<00:04:34.300> up<00:04:34.360> or<00:04:34.570> not<00:04:35.910> there's<00:04:36.910> a<00:04:36.970> couple<00:04:37.000> times

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
make it up or not there's a couple times

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.990 
make it up or not there's a couple times
where<00:04:37.750> I<00:04:38.290> kind<00:04:39.100> of<00:04:39.130> slowed<00:04:39.370> down<00:04:39.550> a<00:04:39.580> little<00:04:39.730> bit

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
where I kind of slowed down a little bit

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.320 
where I kind of slowed down a little bit
but<00:04:40.360> they<00:04:41.110> just<00:04:41.320> dug<00:04:41.530> in<00:04:41.740> and<00:04:41.890> kept<00:04:42.070> rolling<00:04:42.460> so

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.610 

go<00:04:46.330> put<00:04:46.540> it<00:04:46.630> in<00:04:46.720> four-wheel<00:04:46.990> drive<00:04:47.290> on<00:04:47.470> some

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
go put it in four-wheel drive on some

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:55.500 
go put it in four-wheel drive on some
nastier<00:04:48.070> stuff<00:04:48.430> today<00:04:53.250> anyhow

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
nastier stuff today anyhow

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.100 
nastier stuff today anyhow
that's<00:04:56.510> all<00:04:56.690> I<00:04:56.720> had<00:04:56.930> to<00:04:57.020> report<00:04:57.320> right<00:04:57.560> now<00:04:57.590> I

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
that's all I had to report right now I

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.900 
that's all I had to report right now I
will<00:05:00.110> make<00:05:00.290> another<00:05:00.620> chapter<00:05:00.980> later<00:05:01.490> on<00:05:01.640> today

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
will make another chapter later on today

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.840 
will make another chapter later on today
and<00:05:02.060> some<00:05:02.270> nasty<00:05:02.600> stuff
