take<00:02:05.080> the<00:02:05.170> montage<00:02:05.530> I<00:02:05.830> started<00:02:06.490> editing<00:02:06.700> it

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
take the montage I started editing it

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.320 
take the montage I started editing it
today<00:02:08.259> actually<00:02:08.500> it's<00:02:09.160> pretty<00:02:09.340> pretty<00:02:10.090> nice

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
today actually it's pretty pretty nice

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.900 
today actually it's pretty pretty nice
so<00:02:10.840> far<00:02:10.869> we're<00:02:11.650> going<00:02:11.860> to<00:02:11.920> be<00:02:12.010> focusing<00:02:12.280> on<00:02:12.700> a

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
so far we're going to be focusing on a

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.970 
so far we're going to be focusing on a
lot<00:02:13.600> better<00:02:13.750> gameplay<00:02:14.049> really<00:02:14.590> I<00:02:14.620> think<00:02:14.680> we're

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
lot better gameplay really I think we're

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.380 
lot better gameplay really I think we're
going<00:02:15.069> to<00:02:15.160> be<00:02:15.220> going<00:02:15.310> for<00:02:15.580> longer<00:02:15.730> strikes<00:02:16.120> and

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
going to be going for longer strikes and

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.990 
going to be going for longer strikes and
not<00:02:16.450> just<00:02:16.660> sort<00:02:16.870> of<00:02:16.930> six<00:02:17.500> shots<00:02:17.769> and<00:02:18.160> yeah<00:02:18.819> it's

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
not just sort of six shots and yeah it's

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.240 
not just sort of six shots and yeah it's
got<00:02:19.120> to<00:02:19.180> be<00:02:19.239> more<00:02:19.330> like<00:02:19.540> five<00:02:19.989> six<00:02:20.680> kills<00:02:20.920> yeah

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
got to be more like five six kills yeah

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.039 
got to be more like five six kills yeah
well<00:02:21.459> so<00:02:21.670> with<00:02:21.880> our<00:02:21.910> first<00:02:22.150> montage<00:02:22.420> I<00:02:22.780> think

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
well so with our first montage I think

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.560 
well so with our first montage I think
we<00:02:23.170> really<00:02:23.500> are<00:02:23.620> sort<00:02:24.250> of<00:02:24.280> rushed<00:02:24.519> it<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:24.849> we

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
we really are sort of rushed it and we

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.599 
we really are sort of rushed it and we
pretty<00:02:25.989> much<00:02:26.109> we<00:02:26.650> had<00:02:26.769> a<00:02:26.799> couple<00:02:27.040> of<00:02:27.220> days<00:02:27.400> I'll
