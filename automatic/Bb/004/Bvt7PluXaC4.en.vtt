00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.519
 let's take a brief review of the use 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.379
 of the keyboard outlining the 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.240
 operation of the main keys and of 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:14.099
 some special keys 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.500
 to practice you can open the program 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.650
 notepad text processing that 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.430
 you can find the Start menu 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.430
 programs 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.990
 accessories 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.990
 block notes 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.230
 when we press any of the keys 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.450
 the letter entered appears on the screen in 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.250
 tiny block letters 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.410
 to get the same letter in 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.110
 capital letters are necessary 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.880
 hold down the shift key while you are 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.920
 type that letter 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.740
 in other words, first we press the key 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.260
 shift and then holding shift 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:57.480
 we press the alphabetical key 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.269
 the shift key has two positions 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.399
 in each keyboard the dimensions of the two 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.800
 keys may be different but the 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.720
 function is the same 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.680
 as an alternative to the shift key for 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.530
 get letters in block letters 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.170
 uppercase we can use the lock key 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.110
 capital letters or caps locks that we find 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.090
 just above the left shift key 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.340
 if we take this key a single one 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.110
 once we activate the functionality of 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.610
 caps Lock 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.560
 from this moment every letter that 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.870
 type will appear in block letters 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.730
 uppercase without needing to hold 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.950
 pressed any other key 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.750
 caps lock is useful when 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.520
 we need to write portions of 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.130
 relatively long text in block letters 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.080
 uppercase for example paragraph titles 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.850
 a tax code, etc. 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.430
 be careful that if the lock function 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.830
 capitalization active and we use the 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.390
 shift key to type a letter al 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.430
 place to get that letter in 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.290
 We obtain capital letters in 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.820
 tiny block letters 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.070
 in other words when the 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.420
 Caps lock the function of the key 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.189
 shift is inverted 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.290
 to disable the lock function 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.450
 capitalization and return to the normal state 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.259
 bastari press the button one single 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.720
 time 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.310
 just above the alphabetic keys we have 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.740
 the numeric keys arranged in order 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.720
 increasing 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.120
 each numeric key contains two 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.710
 symbols the numeric character is a 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.230
 second character 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.200
 if we take one of these keys we go 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.000
 to type the numeric character on the screen 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.830
 to get the symbol that appears on the 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.290
 top of the same key instead 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.840
 we have to hold down the shift key 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.390
 as we have seen before for example for 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.730
 get the percentage symbol but 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.410
 keep the shift key pressed and 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.410
 press the 5 key once 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.939
 what we have just seen for the keys 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.680
 numerical also applies to any other 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:52.069
 button that contains two symbols 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.120
 the general rule is this by pressing the 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.010
 button individually 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.920
 let's type the symbol that 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.840
 appears at the bottom of the button 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.000
 while pressing the same key in 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.920
 combination with shift we type al 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.790
 symbol that appears at the top of the 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.000
 key 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.980
 now some keys contain three symbols 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.750
 to get the third symbol what 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.090
 appears on the right side 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.739
 we must use the alt gr 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.220
 exactly as we have seen for the 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.230
 shift key 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.870
 for example to type the symbol of 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.400
 first let's press the alt key first 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.650
 gr 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.600
 and then keeping it pressed we press the 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.580
 relative key 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.860
 note that the alt key is at two o'clock 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.360
 end of the space bar but 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.290
 only the one on the right shows the 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.290
 wording gr 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.920
 other important keys for the 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.600
 word processor is the space bar 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.620
 which allows us to type a space 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.870
 in the text 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.340
 the backspace key that deletes a 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.340
 character at a time to the left 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.760
 to delete one character at a time 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.300
 instead to the right we use the delete key 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.300
 hotel 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.740
 send or inter that allows you to go to 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.260
 terminus 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.939
 the arrow keys 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.870
 to move the cursor without making 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:10.870
 no change to the text 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.379
 the number lock key which in 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.480
 keypads with keypad 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:20.180
 numeric activates or 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.650
 disable this keypad in others 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.419
 words to use the 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.350
 numeric keypad to enter dei 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.850
 numbers 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.100
 we must first activate the keypad 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.750
 with the number lock key otherwise al 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.280
 place to type numbers 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.510
 we simply use the functions 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.400
 secondary 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.440
 and finally the control key is a key 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.720
 function that is if pressed in 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.510
 combination with other keys allows 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.760
 activate particular functions for example 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.440
 against c is the keyboard shortcut 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.910
 which allows you to copy in memory 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.730
 any portion of text 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.170
 previously selected as in 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.630
 usually first we press the function key 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.910
 in this case control and then 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.300
 keeping it pressed we press the second one 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.300
 key 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.270
 some of the notions learned in this 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.960
 videos will come in handy in various parts 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.960
 of the course
