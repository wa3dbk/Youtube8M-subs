00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
believe and definitely got a steep

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.040 
believe and definitely got a steep
learning<00:05:47.949> curve<00:05:48.310> though<00:05:48.490> so<00:05:49.360> you<00:05:49.419> may<00:05:49.750> take<00:05:50.020> a

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
learning curve though so you may take a

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.350 
learning curve though so you may take a
couple<00:05:50.280> may<00:05:51.280> take<00:05:51.490> half<00:05:51.669> hour<00:05:51.880> maybe<00:05:52.090> an<00:05:52.270> hour

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
couple may take half hour maybe an hour

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.870 
couple may take half hour maybe an hour
to<00:05:52.599> really<00:05:53.229> get<00:05:53.380> the<00:05:53.680> hang<00:05:53.889> of<00:05:54.009> this<00:05:54.159> because

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
to really get the hang of this because

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.450 
to really get the hang of this because
you<00:05:55.300> can't<00:05:55.479> just<00:05:55.630> run<00:05:55.810> a<00:05:55.840> gun<00:05:56.169> like<00:05:56.560> in<00:05:56.740> Halo

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
you can't just run a gun like in Halo

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.879

call<00:05:57.729> of<00:05:57.849> duty<00:05:58.120> or<00:05:58.360> gears<00:05:58.780> or<00:05:59.050> whatever<00:05:59.289> you

00:05:59.879 --> 00:05:59.889 
call of duty or gears or whatever you

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:01.830

can't<00:06:00.099> just<00:06:00.219> running<00:06:00.520> gun<00:06:00.729> because<00:06:01.180> if<00:06:01.479> you<00:06:01.659> do

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
you'll just get cluttered because you

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.300 
you'll just get cluttered because you
can't<00:06:03.699> shoot<00:06:03.940> so<00:06:04.659> you<00:06:04.990> gotta<00:06:05.500> sit<00:06:05.800> still<00:06:06.039> and
