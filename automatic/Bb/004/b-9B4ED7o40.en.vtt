00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
but it's really just a lot of hard work

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.250 
but it's really just a lot of hard work
in<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.670> gym<00:00:53.760> with<00:00:54.120> my<00:00:54.300> dad<00:00:54.480> with<00:00:54.719> my<00:00:54.870> brothers

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
in the gym with my dad with my brothers

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.950 
in the gym with my dad with my brothers
and<00:00:55.520> just<00:00:56.520> being<00:00:56.670> consistent<00:00:57.480> that's

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
and just being consistent that's

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.360 
and just being consistent that's
something<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.379> take<00:00:58.559> pride<00:00:58.710> in<00:00:58.859> my<00:00:59.070> shot

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
something I take pride in my shot

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.590 
something I take pride in my shot
whether<00:00:59.699> it's<00:00:59.940> from<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.149> free-throw<00:01:00.359> line

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
whether it's from the free-throw line

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.290 
whether it's from the free-throw line
from<00:01:00.989> three<00:01:01.320> inside<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.190> art<00:01:02.370> off<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
from three inside the art off the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.640 
from three inside the art off the
dribble<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:03.870> it's<00:01:03.989> really<00:01:04.199> something<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.530> I

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
dribble so it's really something that I

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.890 
dribble so it's really something that I
put<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.830> lot<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.070> work<00:01:05.220> into<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.729> it's<00:01:06.510> paid<00:01:06.720> off

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900

second-chance points so we've been

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.430
