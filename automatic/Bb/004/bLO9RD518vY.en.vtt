00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.410 
there were so many models I thought it
would<00:01:57.039> be<00:01:57.100> nicer<00:01:57.490> for<00:01:57.520> me<00:01:57.729> and<00:01:57.850> Sonic<00:01:58.149> to<00:01:58.270> both

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
would be nicer for me and Sonic to both

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.300 
would be nicer for me and Sonic to both
key<00:01:58.659> the<00:01:58.810> show<00:01:58.960> together<00:01:59.140> for<00:01:59.890> the<00:01:59.979> Indian<00:02:00.219> and

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
key the show together for the Indian and

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.559 
key the show together for the Indian and
the<00:02:00.369> Western<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.819> makeup<00:02:01.090> was<00:02:01.149> more<00:02:01.359> or<00:02:01.450> less

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:01.569 
the Western the makeup was more or less

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:03.359 
the Western the makeup was more or less
the<00:02:01.659> same<00:02:01.810> except<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:02.350> eyes<00:02:02.469> for<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:02.979> Western

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
the same except the eyes for the Western

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.520 
the same except the eyes for the Western
bit<00:02:03.579> we<00:02:03.729> thought<00:02:03.939> we'll<00:02:04.119> do<00:02:04.299> black<00:02:04.600> and<00:02:04.960> for

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
bit we thought we'll do black and for

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.899 
bit we thought we'll do black and for
the<00:02:05.590> Indian<00:02:05.829> we<00:02:05.920> kept<00:02:06.100> it<00:02:06.189> clean<00:02:06.460> which

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
the Indian we kept it clean which

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.309 
the Indian we kept it clean which
usually<00:02:07.179> is<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.600> other<00:02:07.719> way<00:02:07.869> around

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
usually is the other way around

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:09.800 
usually is the other way around
but<00:02:08.740> I<00:02:08.770> think<00:02:08.860> it<00:02:09.070> just<00:02:09.250> worked<00:02:09.430> out

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
but I think it just worked out

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.449 
but I think it just worked out
because<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.410> Indian<00:02:10.709> clothes<00:02:10.920> were<00:02:11.160> heavier

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
because the Indian clothes were heavier

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.040 
because the Indian clothes were heavier
to<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.819> clean<00:02:12.090> look<00:02:12.270> kind<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.630> worked<00:02:12.840> really

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
to the clean look kind of worked really

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.979 
to the clean look kind of worked really
well<00:02:13.170> it's<00:02:14.130> only<00:02:14.400> done<00:02:14.670> on<00:02:14.880> half<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.330> ISO<00:02:15.720> we

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
well it's only done on half the ISO we

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.300 
well it's only done on half the ISO we
start<00:02:16.230> right<00:02:16.410> from<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.739> center<00:02:17.040> of<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.280> eye

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
start right from the center of the eye

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.670 
start right from the center of the eye
and<00:02:17.700> we<00:02:17.849> are<00:02:17.910> doing<00:02:18.090> like<00:02:18.270> black<00:02:18.900> graphic

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
and we are doing like black graphic

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.890 
and we are doing like black graphic
shape<00:02:20.220> which<00:02:20.760> is<00:02:20.790> very<00:02:21.150> very<00:02:21.270> blended<00:02:21.690> at<00:02:21.810> the

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
shape which is very very blended at the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.979 
shape which is very very blended at the
edges<00:02:22.200> but<00:02:22.349> it's<00:02:22.410> still<00:02:22.770> a<00:02:22.950> very<00:02:23.130> strong

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
edges but it's still a very strong

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.000 
edges but it's still a very strong
rectangular<00:02:24.989> shape<00:02:25.290> which<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.709> there<00:02:25.860> it's

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
rectangular shape which is there it's

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.650 
rectangular shape which is there it's
almost<00:02:26.190> like<00:02:26.459> a<00:02:26.489> stain<00:02:26.910> on<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.269> eye<00:02:27.300> which<00:02:27.630> is

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
almost like a stain on the eye which is

00:02:27.660 --> 00:03:54.540 
almost like a stain on the eye which is
like<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.930> black<00:02:28.170> stain<00:02:28.440> in<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.680> graphic<00:02:29.069> shape

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.460 

it's<00:03:55.060> like<00:03:55.210> a<00:03:55.240> family<00:03:55.810> you<00:03:55.960> know<00:03:56.080> you<00:03:56.140> hate

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
it's like a family you know you hate

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.560 
it's like a family you know you hate
each<00:03:56.650> other<00:03:56.890> you<00:03:57.220> love<00:03:57.490> each<00:03:57.700> other<00:03:57.850> you<00:03:58.420> know

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
each other you love each other you know

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.360 
each other you love each other you know
you<00:03:58.630> have<00:03:58.930> little<00:03:59.230> bits<00:03:59.470> of<00:03:59.620> everything<00:04:00.160> going

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
you have little bits of everything going

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.730 
you have little bits of everything going
on<00:04:00.610> so<00:04:00.940> it's<00:04:01.150> pretty<00:04:01.420> much<00:04:01.630> like<00:04:01.690> that<00:04:01.960> and<00:04:02.290> we

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
on so it's pretty much like that and we

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:03.990 
on so it's pretty much like that and we
need<00:04:02.890> to<00:04:02.980> find<00:04:03.190> the<00:04:03.340> right<00:04:03.490> balance<00:04:03.700> between

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
need to find the right balance between

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.300 
need to find the right balance between
it<00:04:04.390> all<00:04:04.540> for<00:04:05.020> this<00:04:05.140> industry<00:04:05.620> to<00:04:05.740> grow<00:04:05.860> and<00:04:06.280> to

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
it all for this industry to grow and to

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.280 
it all for this industry to grow and to
realize<00:04:07.090> that<00:04:07.120> it's<00:04:07.390> a<00:04:07.510> business<00:04:07.930> at<00:04:08.050> the<00:04:08.170> end
