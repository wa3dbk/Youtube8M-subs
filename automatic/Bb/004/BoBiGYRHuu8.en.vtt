00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.080
 Hello there 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.620
 I like to listen to my radio. 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.680
 I heard about the battle. 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:38.820
 Sometimes, if I get up early, I will listen to things about Cox when I have breakfast. 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.090
 I can't find a clear channel, Roger 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.030
 When it hasn’t taken nutrition yet, it’s a bit unknowingly thick. 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.940
 What is this strange sound? 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.340
 Am I having an unpleasant broadcast? 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.800
 What is this saying, Roger? 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.080
 I hope this has nothing to do with me. 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.270
 People can't cope with these unpleasant frequencies. 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.030
 I saw that I was sitting in this safety cabinet and waiting for it to leave. 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.120
 "Where are you going today, Penny Petel?" 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.290
 "I am going to the market to buy some raspberry jam." 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.100
 "I won't sell it to you!" said the market merchant. 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.480
 "The legs are made of cotton and it's too long!" 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.030
 Oh, I didn’t lose everything, Penny Peitel. 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.870
 I found a special hair. 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.910
 You look good together together [Note 1] 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.680
 Looks so happy 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.940
 a delightful little quint singing in the breeze 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.520
 There are three people in bed, and the youngest guy says, "Go over!" [Note 2] 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.320
 Immediately wipe me off the dirty mud, Sherbert Compaldale 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.080
 I won't let dirty immigrants stay in my house. 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.860
 Roger, I don’t want you to bark these frequencies at this time. 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.270
 This has made my heart uncomfortable and worried my thoughts. 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.410
 I think it’s a good idea to ask you to get out. 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:00.030
 It’s rude to hide one of my hair. 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.040
 If there is no problem, I want to bring it back. 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:07.880
 Excuse me? 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.190
 This house is really dirty. 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.900
 Clean me up 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.900
 But this time it’s not my turn. 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.600
 And this is a bad job, I don't want, can't and won't do it! 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.780
 Do it now! Do it now! Do it now! Do it now!
