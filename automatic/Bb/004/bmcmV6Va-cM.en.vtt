00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.839
 hello everyone with you chris and now I 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.030
 I'll show you one hit fish which 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.730
 allow you to hide the chests in the walls 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.889
 general I walk around the world of minecraft 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.260
 this one is detecting some strange 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.510
 suspicious construction she me 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.060
 interested and I decided to go inside 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.550
 see what is here except 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.369
 cobwebs seemingly nothing but really 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.429
 it's not that easy if I start to get bored 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.040
 on the walls so to speak to look for some 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.680
 laying then sooner or later I stumbled 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.710
 on some chest which is 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.930
 wherever he is literally in the wall 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.879
 see if i click on this one 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.559
 in particular it really will open 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.289
 chest and discovered what is here 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.450
 there is a bow a whole stack of arrows a book and 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.789
 some strange thing but this already 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.129
 rather spoiler to the next mod review 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.739
 here you are interested so what is 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.989
 if we fly up now and see 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.500
 then we will see 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.010
 the fact that there really is a chest and 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.589
 Besides 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.630
 those walls that we saw from that side 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.850
 really are the steps 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.860
 that now I will try the day will be by 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.080
 the neighborhood to portray something like that and 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.270
 show how does this bug 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.400
 in general we need to start 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.380
 any blocks but for masking the ears 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.110
 take stone bricks 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.280
 next we need steps one 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.710
 set and in this way 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.750
 and the other is rotated 90 degrees 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.479
 so we have a corner here 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.770
 well and further for decency already we finish 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.090
 wall for a couple of blocks in breadth and height and 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.939
 Now watch ka 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.940
 if we put our chest in here 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.340
 plot where we rounded up a step 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.710
 and let's say the ball is already something in the inside 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.230
 from the back we can this chest 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.540
 easily open that look where ka 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.560
 we have that little hole 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.300
 about here 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.730
 if we are sudan and chrome then really 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.500
 we can open the chest and get say 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.690
 from here the web is really very 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.240
 comfortable and this is a great disguise 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:07.200
 I also want to say that through this 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.229
 hole can also put the blocks but it 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.390
 Of course, it does not always work but by 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.260
 most likely I donâ€™t have it now 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.390
 Did not work out 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.520
 There is some chance that you this 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.070
 fails to do this does not always work 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.200
 very much if you see such a characteristic 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.790
 gesture so wait a minute that's for sure 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.630
 look now this block is not here 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.640
 it was and then bam 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.920
 he was put well, that's not always 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.360
 works but sometimes it turns out so what 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.460
 Well friends, I hope you enjoyed this 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.650
 Bug I do not hope that you write what 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.480
