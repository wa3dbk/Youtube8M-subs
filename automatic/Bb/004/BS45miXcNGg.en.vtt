hello everybody this is toasty x3 here I
was<00:00:03.810> just<00:00:03.840> playing<00:00:04.200> Ori<00:00:04.440> in<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:04.710> blind<00:00:04.920> forest

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
was just playing Ori in the blind forest

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.930 
was just playing Ori in the blind forest
and<00:00:05.670> I<00:00:05.970> came<00:00:06.240> across<00:00:06.359> a<00:00:06.540> gamebreaking<00:00:07.080> glitch

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:07.940 
and I came across a gamebreaking glitch

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.190 
and I came across a gamebreaking glitch
if<00:00:08.940> you<00:00:09.059> see<00:00:09.269> here<00:00:09.480> this<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:09.660> in<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.990> moon

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
if you see here this is in the moon

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.110 
if you see here this is in the moon
grotto<00:00:10.530> before<00:00:11.070> we<00:00:11.219> actually<00:00:11.400> get<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.820> double

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
grotto before we actually get the double

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:26.530 
grotto before we actually get the double
jump<00:00:12.950> just<00:00:13.950> take<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.190> look

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:26.540 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.930 

now<00:00:27.540> on<00:00:27.690> this<00:00:27.840> part<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.320> force<00:00:28.770> of<00:00:29.100> the<00:00:29.400> stone

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:29.940 
now on this part the force of the stone

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.900 
now on this part the force of the stone
actually<00:00:30.420> pushes<00:00:31.110> you<00:00:31.230> through<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.680> map<00:00:31.950> and

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
actually pushes you through the map and

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.150 
actually pushes you through the map and
spawns<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.660> further<00:00:33.930> down<00:00:34.260> right<00:00:34.590> before<00:00:35.040> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
spawns you further down right before the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.010 
spawns you further down right before the
cutscene<00:00:35.670> where<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.030> actually<00:00:36.450> receive<00:00:36.840> the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
cutscene where you actually receive the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:59.610 
cutscene where you actually receive the
water<00:00:37.170> gem

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.620 

now<00:01:00.620> because<00:01:00.950> of<00:01:01.130> this<00:01:01.250> glitch<00:01:01.580> the<00:01:02.030> cutscene

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.630 
now because of this glitch the cutscene

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.590 
now because of this glitch the cutscene
where<00:01:02.900> the<00:01:03.670> monster<00:01:04.670> pulls<00:01:04.940> the<00:01:05.150> lever<00:01:05.300> to

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
where the monster pulls the lever to

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.190 
where the monster pulls the lever to
make<00:01:05.930> the<00:01:06.080> bridge<00:01:06.290> fall<00:01:06.560> never<00:01:07.400> played<00:01:08.200> and

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
make the bridge fall never played and

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:39.730 
make the bridge fall never played and
because<00:01:09.530> of<00:01:09.680> this<00:01:10.030> I'll<00:01:11.030> see<00:01:11.270> what<00:01:11.420> happens

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.529 

now<00:01:40.740> because<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.250> cutscene<00:01:41.670> never<00:01:41.939> happened

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
now because the cutscene never happened

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.830 
now because the cutscene never happened
the<00:01:43.350> cutscene<00:01:44.100> trigger<00:01:44.460> on<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.149> left<00:01:45.450> half<00:01:45.689> of

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
the cutscene trigger on the left half of

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.469 
the cutscene trigger on the left half of
the<00:01:45.929> bridge<00:01:46.159> will<00:01:47.159> not<00:01:47.310> go<00:01:47.490> away<00:01:47.789> so<00:01:48.329> it's

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
the bridge will not go away so it's

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.510 
the bridge will not go away so it's
impossible<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:49.049> progress<00:01:49.439> past<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:50.220> after

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
impossible to progress past that after

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.569 
impossible to progress past that after
retrieving<00:01:50.789> the<00:01:51.060> water<00:01:51.240> gem<00:01:52.340> after<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.399> fall

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
retrieving the water gem after you fall

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.389 
retrieving the water gem after you fall
down<00:01:53.789> to<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.000> bottom<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.539> you<00:01:54.960> die<00:01:55.369> the<00:01:56.369> game

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
down to the bottom and you die the game

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:04.350 
down to the bottom and you die the game
responds<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.509> you're<00:01:57.600> unable<00:01:57.720> to<00:01:57.840> move

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.789 

also<00:02:05.360> if<00:02:05.479> you<00:02:05.600> drop<00:02:05.840> down<00:02:06.049> to<00:02:06.259> the<00:02:06.350> right-hand

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
also if you drop down to the right-hand

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.430 
also if you drop down to the right-hand
side<00:02:06.950> here<00:02:07.460> you<00:02:08.209> also<00:02:08.869> trigger<00:02:09.140> another

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
side here you also trigger another

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.800 
side here you also trigger another
cutscene<00:02:09.739> that<00:02:10.700> has<00:02:10.879> the<00:02:11.120> character<00:02:11.510> model

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
cutscene that has the character model

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:39.240 
cutscene that has the character model
for<00:02:11.989> the<00:02:12.050> monster<00:02:12.470> missing

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.920 

I'm<00:02:40.250> jumping<00:02:40.489> over<00:02:40.849> to<00:02:40.970> my<00:02:41.090> second<00:02:41.510> save<00:02:41.720> where

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
I'm jumping over to my second save where

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.320 
I'm jumping over to my second save where
I<00:02:41.959> initially<00:02:42.410> encountered<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.950> glitch<00:02:43.330> this

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
I initially encountered the glitch this

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.210 
I initially encountered the glitch this
was<00:02:44.510> actually<00:02:44.690> after<00:02:45.019> I<00:02:45.230> went<00:02:45.470> through<00:02:45.890> and

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
was actually after I went through and

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.850 
was actually after I went through and
completed<00:02:46.849> the<00:02:46.940> entirety<00:02:47.450> of<00:02:47.480> this<00:02:47.810> level<00:02:48.050> got

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
completed the entirety of this level got

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.530 
completed the entirety of this level got
the<00:02:49.040> double<00:02:49.340> jump<00:02:49.610> and<00:02:49.790> did<00:02:50.330> everything

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
the double jump and did everything

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:58.449 
the double jump and did everything
possible<00:02:50.870> in<00:02:51.319> this<00:02:51.470> area<00:02:57.040> like<00:02:58.040> mentioned

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
possible in this area like mentioned

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:59.949 
possible in this area like mentioned
before<00:02:58.489> the<00:02:58.880> cutscene<00:02:59.269> triggered<00:02:59.630> never

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
before the cutscene triggered never

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.530 
before the cutscene triggered never
actually<00:03:00.260> played<00:03:00.769> so<00:03:01.670> you're<00:03:01.819> unable<00:03:02.360> to

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
actually played so you're unable to

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.680 
actually played so you're unable to
progress<00:03:02.750> past<00:03:02.959> the<00:03:03.410> bridge<00:03:04.239> at<00:03:05.239> this<00:03:05.420> point

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
progress past the bridge at this point

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.050 
progress past the bridge at this point
when<00:03:06.140> you<00:03:06.170> fall<00:03:06.470> down<00:03:06.739> your<00:03:07.489> character<00:03:07.940> gets

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
when you fall down your character gets

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.660 
when you fall down your character gets
stuck<00:03:08.450> in<00:03:08.630> the<00:03:08.750> air<00:03:08.930> and<00:03:09.349> then<00:03:09.709> automatically

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
stuck in the air and then automatically

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.330 
stuck in the air and then automatically
walks<00:03:11.030> forward<00:03:11.829> eventually<00:03:12.829> gets<00:03:12.980> stuck<00:03:13.190> on

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
walks forward eventually gets stuck on

00:03:13.340 --> 00:04:00.160 
walks forward eventually gets stuck on
the<00:03:13.459> spike<00:03:13.700> and<00:03:13.970> can't<00:03:14.360> move

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.750 

unfortunately<00:04:01.170> this<00:04:01.380> is<00:04:01.650> a<00:04:01.680> very<00:04:02.130> easy<00:04:02.220> glitch

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
unfortunately this is a very easy glitch

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.810 
unfortunately this is a very easy glitch
to<00:04:02.940> replicate<00:04:03.450> as<00:04:03.690> seen<00:04:03.960> here<00:04:04.700> hopefully<00:04:05.700> the

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
to replicate as seen here hopefully the

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.430 
to replicate as seen here hopefully the
developers<00:04:06.240> are<00:04:06.360> able<00:04:06.390> to<00:04:06.600> patch<00:04:06.810> this<00:04:07.050> fairly

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
developers are able to patch this fairly

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.980 
developers are able to patch this fairly
quickly<00:04:07.710> because<00:04:08.310> this<00:04:08.430> is<00:04:08.610> a<00:04:08.900> pretty<00:04:09.900> early

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
quickly because this is a pretty early

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.440 
quickly because this is a pretty early
on<00:04:10.290> area<00:04:10.710> in<00:04:10.860> the<00:04:10.980> game<00:04:11.190> and<00:04:11.760> if<00:04:12.120> you<00:04:12.270> actually

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
get into this by accident like I did

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.520 
get into this by accident like I did
originally<00:04:15.030> you're<00:04:15.780> gonna<00:04:15.900> have<00:04:16.080> to<00:04:16.200> restart

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
originally you're gonna have to restart

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:25.700 
originally you're gonna have to restart
