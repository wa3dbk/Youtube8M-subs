 especially for you very nice that was one 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.660
 Surprise in American sport 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.489
 they are always the most popular movie 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.590
 girls cheerleader these are the 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.840
 with dance lifts and of course with 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.309
 to cheer this team up in the team 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.620
 this is the basketballer of the 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.420
 barmer tv the valentines is the name of the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.559
 troop we took care of now 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.409
 from different age groups 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.720
 which are all formed between 9 and 31 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.070
 years because somehow the offspring 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.290
 missing and now we are live at 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.299
 Training together with China East of China 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.770
 That looks like hard work that is 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.640
 probably more than just this 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.500
 puzzle wobble or absolutely so who 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.600
 believes that the cheerleader actually 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.240
 just in sync with the candies 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.740
 waffles would have to and it gives me one 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.909
 write would it really wrong 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.189
 Wrapped that's a really hard one 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.409
 Training what the boys and girls here 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.450
 twice a week under 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.520
 Other trained by stefanie 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.280
 ranseder roseneck what will be here now 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.320
 just turned , the opposite train 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.540
 A plaster of sand is made up of five 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.829
 people together and I think that we 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.380
 now an alley weather speak the 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.689
 elevator will be seen 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.229
 the world what has a chili in it 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.119
 can 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.520
 for the different elements 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.479
 Of course you also do things like that 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.729
 everyday feeling for the dancing force for that 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.579
 dance and of course for the taboo 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.079
 thank you the very first cheerleader 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.659
 I did not know that before 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.039
 that were men in america and also 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.970
 here with the waves partly play the 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.860
 I think men play a big role 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.660
 Michael Baumann is one of those who 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.060
 then, is your task in the team we are 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.410
 mainly bought space so pay 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.299
 downstairs and usually just brought her 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.709
 are the supporting force but this has 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.239
 me, of course, also direct touch 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.459
 to say something with all the pretty girls 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.269
 because somehow friends to his 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.560
 hobby so mostly and envies but 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.599
 as I said after the time loses that 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.769
 too and it's just a whole 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.390
 normal sport like everyone else and 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.000
 Muckis, of course, does it right 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.920
 All right then keep on making fun 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.720
 the special thing about this cheerleader 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.099
 Troupe is that's really out 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.349
 has formed two and thereby the 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:49.049
 age span is the youngest 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.360
 up there for example how rebecca is 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.250
 but only nine years old are here too 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.569
 31-year-old girls and me 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.280
 of course interested in a thing 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.620
 that should ultimately sound as well as moderate 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.510
 but that was a tight outfit 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.010
 You have to be pretty cheerleading 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.329
 or will you say cute animal love 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.569
 you just have to feel good in 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:08.040
 his skin is what makes the pupil 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.139
 And he does in any case and that 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.630
 is also homemade or it was 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:13.739
 from an aspired one I know 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.780
 unfortunately not by whom 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.790
 but what was spun there super 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.290
 thank you very much 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.639
 Julia Vegas is one of the trainers 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.349
 I start it now always on 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:24.930
 while it's shivering around me and 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.340
 you're scary since you started here 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.500
 I think it is now synonymous right now 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.060
 again and now just that 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.920
 command for the music but that is 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.840
 okay, all right 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.430
 works great you have that 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.049
 two groups joined together why 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.680
 it was so difficult for chillida 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.660
 to find 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.990
 So we are very different from 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.300
 age ago the youngest are nine years old 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.250
 and the oldest around thirty 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.350
 and why, of course, a big one 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.480
 Group of 25 persons 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.220
 Of course it is difficult here too 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.020
 to cope with some are pure 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.860
 beginner we have to somehow 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.560
 bring up 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.320
 Some have already brought china to China 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.270
 Of course, that is a thing of the past 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.510
 somehow the level must be reasonably 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.460
 to lead with everyone and as we do 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.310
 now look here too 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.200
 acrobatic elements with us so that 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.530
 is called gymnastics also belongs to course 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.540
 to 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.790
 that is relatively delicate that is then 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.320
 they also often have to hear a word like 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.380
 is that how it works with this now 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.390
 merge yes so that works 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.310
 meanwhile you have a good start 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.360
 Of course our difficulties are 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.670
 were two groups 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.230
 but now we are really stuck 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.240
 Team and that is really very very 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.980
 important so that nothing goes wrong with it 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.590
 no one injured no one falls down 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:40.010
 we partly build three meters of pyramids 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.640
 on and that is still the beginning now 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.740
 water 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.080
 what is important because this pyramid is 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.610
 so important is that really up 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.530
 command is heard that's all 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.930
 counted on yours 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.610
 Accounts really listen to everything 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.930
 recorded with the music is like you 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.730
 right now can see here 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.400
 and that they know exactly 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:01.010
 when to do what and i know what i do 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.180
 Now we have to do our nana 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.180
 shut up please 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.240
 I did it and now I am 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:16.639
 easy at a height with jasmine 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.979
 scheffczyk she can not talk 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.919
 she still can not talk ok I have to 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:25.310
 nana pushes me very slowly yes 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:29.270
 is that still I'm sitting so stupid jasmin 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:34.729
 is it better felt up there how long 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:36.949
 it could all go through all right now 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:38.690
 then build again because we build 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:39.949
 that is, you can take it off again 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.080
 you let me down or will that 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:43.610
 already the massacre so I have to 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.139
 say I have given everything again or 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.680
 marco tell me honestly 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:50.509
