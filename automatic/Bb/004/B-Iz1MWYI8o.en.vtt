00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
our hair out like I said I'm keeping

our hair out like I said I'm keeping
this<00:02:26.920> finger<00:02:27.840> tight<00:02:28.840> I<00:02:29.140> thought<00:02:29.830> about

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
this finger tight I thought about

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.860 
this finger tight I thought about
actually<00:02:30.280> taping<00:02:30.760> it<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.030> my<00:02:31.270> hands<00:02:31.540> but<00:02:31.750> then

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
actually taping it to my hands but then

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:32.970 
actually taping it to my hands but then
I'd<00:02:31.960> have<00:02:31.990> to<00:02:32.140> get<00:02:32.350> rid<00:02:32.440> of<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.620> tape<00:02:32.800> residue

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
I'd have to get rid of the tape residue

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.370 
I'd have to get rid of the tape residue
and<00:02:33.370> that's<00:02:33.520> terrible<00:02:33.970> so<00:02:34.690> we're<00:02:35.020> just<00:02:35.050> gonna

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
and that's terrible so we're just gonna

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.020 
and that's terrible so we're just gonna
brush<00:02:35.680> everything<00:02:36.480> back<00:02:38.070> this<00:02:39.070> is<00:02:39.310> going<00:02:39.670> to

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
brush everything back this is going to

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.780 
brush everything back this is going to
start<00:02:42.510> this<00:02:43.510> is<00:02:43.750> kind<00:02:44.140> of<00:02:44.350> a<00:02:44.470> mix<00:02:44.950> between<00:02:45.250> a

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
start this is kind of a mix between a

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.190 
start this is kind of a mix between a
nautilus<00:02:46.420> and<00:02:46.800> a<00:02:47.800> not<00:02:48.070> bun<00:02:48.430> but<00:02:49.270> with<00:02:49.570> no<00:02:49.840> pull

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
nautilus and a not bun but with no pull

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.550 
nautilus and a not bun but with no pull
through<00:02:50.500> sore<00:02:50.740> anything<00:02:51.220> and<00:02:52.180> a<00:02:53.140> pretzel<00:02:53.380> bun

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
through sore anything and a pretzel bun

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.880 
through sore anything and a pretzel bun
I<00:02:53.680> guess<00:02:53.980> anyway<00:02:54.610> so<00:02:55.450> we<00:02:55.930> have<00:02:56.140> our<00:02:56.410> hair<00:02:56.650> as

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
I guess anyway so we have our hair as

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.040 
I guess anyway so we have our hair as
smooth<00:02:57.250> as<00:02:57.490> we<00:02:57.730> can<00:02:57.940> get<00:02:58.150> it<00:02:58.300> now<00:02:58.480> you<00:02:58.540> need<00:02:58.900> to

use this hand as our bun builder as in

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.990 
use this hand as our bun builder as in
put<00:03:24.730> it<00:03:24.820> atop<00:03:25.120> your<00:03:25.390> ponytail<00:03:26.019> you<00:03:26.400> want<00:03:27.400> to<00:03:27.519> go

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.300 
around and then bring it to the right
and<00:03:30.580> then<00:03:31.420> we<00:03:31.870> are<00:03:32.170> going<00:03:32.500> to<00:03:32.709> simply<00:03:33.100> wrap

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
and then we are going to simply wrap

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.890 
and then we are going to simply wrap
around<00:03:33.760> and<00:03:33.970> around<00:03:34.290> this<00:03:35.290> is<00:03:35.500> how<00:03:35.620> we<00:03:35.680> get<00:03:36.190> by

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
around and around this is how we get by

without the use of our thumb all right

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.920 
without the use of our thumb all right
like<00:03:41.920> I<00:03:42.070> said<00:03:42.310> a<00:03:42.519> little<00:03:42.790> bit<00:03:42.940> like<00:03:43.720> the

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
like I said a little bit like the

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.660 
like I said a little bit like the
Nautilus<00:03:44.410> in<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.800> fact<00:03:45.010> that<00:03:45.130> it's<00:03:45.370> a<00:03:45.459> wrapped

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
Nautilus in the fact that it's a wrapped

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.470 
Nautilus in the fact that it's a wrapped
bun<00:03:46.000> but<00:03:46.900> it's<00:03:47.440> just<00:03:47.709> a<00:03:47.860> little<00:03:48.040> easier<00:03:48.480> all

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
bun but it's just a little easier all

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.050 
bun but it's just a little easier all
right<00:03:50.080> we<00:03:50.290> have<00:03:50.500> our<00:03:50.530> ends<00:03:51.160> we<00:03:51.340> actually<00:03:51.880> have

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
right we have our ends we actually have

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.170 
right we have our ends we actually have
to<00:03:52.239> pin<00:03:52.890> because<00:03:53.890> we<00:03:54.250> can't<00:03:54.519> kind<00:03:54.730> of<00:03:54.880> grasp

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
to pin because we can't kind of grasp

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.960 
to pin because we can't kind of grasp
them<00:03:55.510> all<00:03:55.750> together<00:03:56.610> but<00:03:57.610> what<00:03:57.730> we're<00:03:57.940> going

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
them all together but what we're going

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.300 
them all together but what we're going
to<00:03:58.120> do<00:03:58.300> is<00:03:58.600> the<00:03:59.290> ends<00:03:59.739> we're<00:03:59.920> gonna<00:04:00.010> pull<00:04:00.280> over

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
to do is the ends we're gonna pull over

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.340 
to do is the ends we're gonna pull over
here<00:04:02.790> just<00:04:03.790> hold<00:04:04.060> as<00:04:04.300> best<00:04:04.570> we<00:04:04.690> can

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
here just hold as best we can

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.380 
here just hold as best we can
grab<00:04:06.220> a<00:04:06.250> pin<00:04:07.500> and<00:04:08.500> pin<00:04:08.709> these<00:04:08.860> ends<00:04:09.340> down<00:04:09.519> you

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
grab a pin and pin these ends down you

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.880 
grab a pin and pin these ends down you
don't<00:04:10.570> really<00:04:10.870> have<00:04:11.140> to<00:04:11.320> worry<00:04:11.500> about<00:04:11.739> your

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
don't really have to worry about your

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.590 
don't really have to worry about your
pin<00:04:12.130> showing<00:04:12.459> because<00:04:12.670> it<00:04:12.880> will<00:04:13.030> be<00:04:13.120> covered

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.719 

but<00:04:16.600> that<00:04:16.660> will<00:04:16.959> keep<00:04:17.109> our<00:04:17.549> ends<00:04:18.549> from

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
but that will keep our ends from

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.920 
but that will keep our ends from
escaping<00:04:19.150> while<00:04:19.479> we<00:04:19.690> manipulate

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
escaping while we manipulate

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.450 
escaping while we manipulate
this<00:04:21.680> ball<00:04:21.949> this<00:04:22.729> loop<00:04:23.560> alright<00:04:24.560> pull<00:04:25.280> your

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
this ball this loop alright pull your

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.060 
this ball this loop alright pull your
hand<00:04:25.699> out<00:04:25.940> of<00:04:25.970> the<00:04:26.240> loop<00:04:26.650> the<00:04:27.650> thumb<00:04:27.860> that

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
hand out of the loop the thumb that

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.860 
hand out of the loop the thumb that
works<00:04:28.280> and<00:04:28.669> guess<00:04:28.940> you<00:04:29.210> kind<00:04:29.449> of<00:04:29.479> just<00:04:29.660> want<00:04:29.810> to

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:30.779 
works and guess you kind of just want to
grasp<00:04:30.110> it

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
grasp it

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:33.400

over and then use your faulty hand just

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.050 
over and then use your faulty hand just
kind<00:04:37.729> of<00:04:37.820> flatten<00:04:38.300> it<00:04:38.620> see<00:04:39.620> like<00:04:40.009> this<00:04:40.280> now<00:04:40.729> I'm

going to take my stick put it in the

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.870 
going to take my stick put it in the
loop<00:04:43.580> right<00:04:43.820> here<00:04:43.880> and<00:04:45.009> then<00:04:46.009> send<00:04:46.490> it<00:04:46.699> through

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
loop right here and then send it through

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.070 
loop right here and then send it through
the<00:04:47.240> other<00:04:47.930> side<00:04:49.270> and<00:04:50.270> as<00:04:50.360> you<00:04:50.509> can<00:04:50.630> see<00:04:50.840> our

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
out but that's still no problem you can

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.800 
out but that's still no problem you can
always<00:06:02.150> just<00:06:02.509> add<00:06:02.720> a<00:06:02.750> few<00:06:02.900> more<00:06:03.050> pins<00:06:03.699> if<00:06:04.810> you

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
always just add a few more pins if you

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.920 
always just add a few more pins if you
would<00:06:05.930> like<00:06:06.080> it<00:06:06.259> to<00:06:06.289> be<00:06:06.560> a<00:06:06.770> little<00:06:07.099> more

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
would like it to be a little more

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.260 
would like it to be a little more
contained

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.530 

as<00:06:13.270> such<00:06:13.660> or<00:06:14.500> just<00:06:15.220> more<00:06:15.370> stable<00:06:15.880> so<00:06:16.180> you<00:06:16.210> don't

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:16.540 
as such or just more stable so you don't

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.170 
as such or just more stable so you don't
have<00:06:16.750> to<00:06:16.900> worry<00:06:17.080> about<00:06:17.350> it<00:06:17.610> popping<00:06:18.610> down<00:06:18.790> or

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
have to worry about it popping down or

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.960 
have to worry about it popping down or
rounds<00:06:19.930> or<00:06:20.170> being<00:06:20.380> weird

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:20.970 
rounds or being weird

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:28.290 
rounds or being weird
so<00:06:23.370> let's<00:06:24.370> see<00:06:26.310> yeah<00:06:27.310> I<00:06:27.670> think<00:06:27.820> it<00:06:28.120> looks

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300

pretty<00:06:28.540> and<00:06:29.050> I<00:06:29.470> think<00:06:29.500> it<00:06:29.830> looks<00:06:30.010> professional

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.250

the use of one thumb and was nothing but

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.150 
the use of one thumb and was nothing but
a<00:06:36.100> few<00:06:36.310> pins<00:06:36.550> in<00:06:36.760> one<00:06:36.880> stick<00:06:37.500> by<00:06:38.500> all<00:06:38.710> means<00:06:38.950> if

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.160
