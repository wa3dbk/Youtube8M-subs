00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
game it reminds me a little bit of what

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.509 
game it reminds me a little bit of what
I<00:00:25.019> would<00:00:25.199> imagine<00:00:25.289> Eve<00:00:25.830> would<00:00:26.010> be<00:00:26.070> like<00:00:26.310> if<00:00:26.460> it

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
I would imagine Eve would be like if it

I would imagine Eve would be like if it
was<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.699> little<00:00:27.060> bit<00:00:27.470> more<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.830> guess<00:00:29.189> accessible

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
was a little bit more I guess accessible

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.450 
was a little bit more I guess accessible
a<00:00:30.060> little<00:00:30.240> easier<00:00:30.599> for<00:00:30.660> newer<00:00:30.929> players<00:00:31.460> you

exploring<00:01:12.090> alright<00:01:12.960> here<00:01:13.110> we<00:01:13.140> go<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.590> just<00:01:13.619> left

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
exploring alright here we go I just left

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.440 
exploring alright here we go I just left
the<00:01:14.189> docking<00:01:14.549> station<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.060> I'm<00:01:15.270> running

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
the docking station and I'm running

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.679 
the docking station and I'm running
around<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.590> WASD<00:01:17.340> movement<00:01:17.790> W<00:01:18.420> means<00:01:18.540> I'm

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
around it is WASD movement W means I'm

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.719 
around it is WASD movement W means I'm
gonna<00:01:18.780> accelerate<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.560> then<00:01:20.220> s<00:01:20.549> is

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
gonna accelerate and then s is

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.070 
gonna accelerate and then s is
decelerate<00:01:21.360> eventually<00:01:21.720> can<00:01:21.810> even<00:01:21.990> move

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
decelerate eventually can even move

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.990 
decelerate eventually can even move
backwards<00:01:22.560> space<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.130> just<00:01:23.340> make<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.520> full<00:01:23.759> stop

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
backwards space is just make a full stop

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.179 
backwards space is just make a full stop
the<00:01:24.180> space<00:01:24.360> bar<00:01:24.590> and<00:01:25.590> then<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:25.860> have<00:01:25.979> left

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
the space bar and then you have left

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.770 
the space bar and then you have left
click<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.490> shoot<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.970> didn't<00:01:27.479> actually<00:01:27.570> see<00:01:27.750> I

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
click to shoot I didn't actually see I

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.310 
click to shoot I didn't actually see I
used<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.080> right-click<00:01:28.290> yet<00:01:29.930> this<00:01:30.930> starting

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
used to right-click yet this starting

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.010 
used to right-click yet this starting
ship<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.560> not<00:01:31.799> all<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.040> fast<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:33.000> kind<00:01:33.990> of

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
ship is not all that fast so kind of

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.399 
ship is not all that fast so kind of
move<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.200> little<00:01:34.320> bit<00:01:34.439> slowly<00:01:35.840> at<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:37.049> point<00:01:37.290> I

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
move a little bit slowly at this point I

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.810 
move a little bit slowly at this point I
actually<00:01:37.560> haven't<00:01:38.009> really<00:01:39.829> done<00:01:40.829> missions<00:01:41.579> so

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
actually haven't really done missions so

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.940 
actually haven't really done missions so
I<00:01:41.880> don't<00:01:42.030> know<00:01:42.180> what<00:01:42.299> I'm<00:01:42.420> doing<00:01:42.810> I'm<00:01:43.799> also

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
I don't know what I'm doing I'm also

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.440 
I don't know what I'm doing I'm also
making<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.310> mistake<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.700> getting<00:01:45.030> away<00:01:45.270> from

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
making a mistake of getting away from

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.010 
making a mistake of getting away from
this<00:01:45.899> little<00:01:46.560> station<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.939> station<00:01:48.479> kind<00:01:48.750> of

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
this little station that station kind of

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.920 
this little station that station kind of
is<00:01:49.170> your<00:01:49.409> hub<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.509> at<00:01:51.509> first<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.899> probably

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
is your hub and at first you probably

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.530 
is your hub and at first you probably
won't<00:01:52.290> stay<00:01:52.439> near<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:53.310> do<00:01:53.430> see<00:01:53.640> Q<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.390> E

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
won't stay near it you do see Q and E

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.120 
won't stay near it you do see Q and E
are<00:01:54.750> used<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.110> rotate<00:01:55.259> your<00:01:55.500> camera<00:01:55.680> just<00:01:56.009> like

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
are used to rotate your camera just like

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.319 
are used to rotate your camera just like
that<00:01:58.100> you<00:01:59.100> can<00:01:59.130> still<00:02:00.000> pull<00:02:00.149> up<00:02:00.240> your

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
that you can still pull up your

that you can still pull up your
interface<00:02:00.600> even<00:02:00.750> while<00:02:01.020> flowing<00:02:01.380> around<00:02:01.469> we

in<00:03:19.340> this<00:03:19.489> screen<00:03:19.849> so<00:03:20.239> it's<00:03:20.359> a<00:03:20.389> good<00:03:20.480> thing<00:03:20.599> that

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
in this screen so it's a good thing that

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.960 
in this screen so it's a good thing that
has<00:03:20.840> nice<00:03:21.049> little<00:03:21.230> see-through<00:03:21.530> overlay<00:03:22.160> but

just keep that in mind before you go and

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.259 
just keep that in mind before you go and
hit<00:03:25.010> an<00:03:25.130> asteroid<00:03:25.400> your<00:03:25.669> ship<00:03:25.940> can<00:03:26.239> take

damage which I can only assume means

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.620
