pin with the mixer wagon right here

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.480 
pin with the mixer wagon right here
beside<00:01:56.100> me<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:57.170> one<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.320> water<00:01:58.530> tanks<00:01:58.680> of

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
beside me is one of the water tanks of

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.040 
beside me is one of the water tanks of
course<00:01:59.729> we<00:01:59.850> got<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.030> make<00:02:00.270> sure<00:02:00.330> every<00:02:00.720> morning

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
course we got to make sure every morning

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.740 
course we got to make sure every morning
and<00:02:01.140> night<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.680> water<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.220> open<00:02:02.750> of

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
and night that the water is open of

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.810 
and night that the water is open of
course<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.320> it's<00:02:04.649> about<00:02:04.860> five<00:02:05.460> degrees

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
course it is it's about five degrees

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.020 
course it is it's about five degrees
below<00:02:06.240> zero<00:02:06.720> right<00:02:06.960> now<00:02:07.140> so<00:02:07.920> water<00:02:08.580> freezing

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
below zero right now so water freezing

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.479 
below zero right now so water freezing
up<00:02:09.179> can<00:02:09.360> be<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.509> serious<00:02:09.869> issue<00:02:10.100> but<00:02:11.100> if<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.370> got

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
up can be a serious issue but if you got

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.070 
up can be a serious issue but if you got
a<00:02:11.519> decent<00:02:11.700> lid<00:02:12.090> on<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.330> tank<00:02:12.570> makes<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.930> big

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
a decent lid on the tank makes a big

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.449 
a decent lid on the tank makes a big
difference<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:13.680> we<00:02:13.739> don't<00:02:13.920> have<00:02:14.100> very<00:02:14.250> many

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
difference so we don't have very many

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.580 
difference so we don't have very many
issues<00:02:15.150> with<00:02:15.540> with<00:02:15.900> this<00:02:16.080> tank<00:02:16.290> here<00:02:16.500> we<00:02:16.560> a

issues with with this tank here we a
very<00:02:16.830> little<00:02:17.100> issue

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
very little issue

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.520 
very little issue
here's<00:02:18.150> another<00:02:18.330> water<00:02:18.750> tank<00:02:19.049> this<00:02:19.230> water

wind<00:03:34.260> break<00:03:34.470> with<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.800> water<00:03:34.980> in<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.340> corner

wind break with the water in the corner

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.970 
wind break with the water in the corner
that<00:03:36.690> helps<00:03:37.050> keep<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.440> wind<00:03:37.590> off<00:03:37.770> the<00:03:37.830> water

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
that helps keep the wind off the water

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.280 
that helps keep the wind off the water
keep<00:03:38.430> it<00:03:38.610> thought<00:03:38.819> out<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.720> of<00:03:39.870> course<00:03:39.900> the

wind<00:03:40.650> break<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:41.069> cattle<00:03:41.400> can<00:03:41.550> get<00:03:41.700> in<00:03:41.850> there

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
wind break the cattle can get in there

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.470 
wind break the cattle can get in there
behind<00:03:42.150> that<00:03:42.390> and<00:03:42.780> in<00:03:43.260> a<00:03:43.380> windy<00:03:43.680> day<00:03:44.330> stay<00:03:45.330> out

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480

behind that and in a windy day stay out
of<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.690> wind<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:46.019> stay<00:03:46.170> a<00:03:46.200> lot<00:03:46.410> warmer<00:03:46.940> right

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
of the wind and stay a lot warmer right

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.490 
of the wind and stay a lot warmer right
now<00:03:48.150> there<00:03:48.390> isn't<00:03:48.540> much<00:03:48.870> wind<00:03:49.140> so<00:03:49.290> it's<00:03:49.380> not

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
now there isn't much wind so it's not

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.839 
now there isn't much wind so it's not
bothering<00:03:49.769> them<00:03:50.099> but<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.370> temperature<00:03:50.819> is

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
bothering them but the temperature is

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.580

about<00:03:51.120> five<00:03:51.330> degrees<00:03:51.510> below<00:03:51.720> zero<00:03:52.260> so<00:03:52.470> it's

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
about five degrees below zero so it's

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.900
