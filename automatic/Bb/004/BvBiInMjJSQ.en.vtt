00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello kids today I bring you a new 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.570
 video again of the hunger games 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.720
 but this time is a guide for those who 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:13.019
 you like the games of hunger and not 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.750
 you know very well as well as playing 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.860
 they do not listen to me either your ball 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.140
 this is the first video I'm going to do 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.590
 four or five teaching different 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.810
 things in these would teach you register 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:31.519
 block us and the most useful commands 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.519
 what could we need 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:39.260
 to put the server we will only need 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:43.120
 copy the ip that I will put you down in the 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.739
 description where it says server address or 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.620
 server address if you have it in 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.659
 Spanish and we can enter this safely 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.690
 that you already know but for those who do not 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:57.059
 you know not know it there you have it 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.550
 to register we just have to 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.980
 put bar register and repeat our 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.820
 password twice because if we do not 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.820
 echaran 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.009
 when we re-enter so alone 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.409
 we will have to put bar login our 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.509
 password and repeat it again as is 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.479
 as we did before the 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.429
 register between the commands that 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.740
 we will have at our disposal 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:27.360
 we will have the spawn bar that by putting it 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.770
 will take us directly to spam but 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.100
 we can not use it during the game 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.219
 we will also have to choose our 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.899
 kit put bar kit and they will appear 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:39.899
 All the kits we can choose 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.210
 to get information about the kit 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.250
 that we want we will have to put kit 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.980
 info all together 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.110
 space the name of the kit and there we 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.340
 they will say everything we need to know 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.340
 about this kit 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.840
 we will also have the barranc that we 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.720
 will tell our rank that it does not work for 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.539
 nothing but it is our range so we are 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.110
 cool and how much we have left to go up 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.110
 next level 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.240
 and finally the most important will be 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.880
 bar kit and the name of our kit 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.640
 to select that kit to play 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.710
 during the rest of the game we can 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.460
 change it when we want before 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.010
 start the game obviously 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.820
 well this has been all for this video 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:39.220
 I hope you liked to like 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:43.030
 you know is the most important thing in the world 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:46.360
 and then then I'll do it in the next 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:50.040
 video that is going to be about classes like this 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.040
 that until the next kid video
