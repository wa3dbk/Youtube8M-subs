00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.590
 today we are going to talk about how to use the 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.560
 pistols at risk and first we go on 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.950
 the basics to buy in the round of 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:29.020
 pistols there are two very viable options the 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:31.490
 first is to buy a vest and a coi 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:35.170
 and the second is to buy three grenades 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.230
 smoke flash and explosive 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.000
 so 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.980
 what to do with each of these options 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.190
 with a vest is when you're going to do something and 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.989
 you want to hold bullets you know and with the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.390
 with the grenades is because you're going to be 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.040
 supporting your team from behind this is 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.220
 sniffing positions blocking the 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.220
 enemies 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.210
 and good now the important thing to kill 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.100
 with the pistols there are three factors 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.720
 essential when using the 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.950
 pistols for that place in motion and 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.990
 shot rhythm 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.829
 If you do not have one of these factors to 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:16.250
 your favor you will not be able to kill correctly 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:18.140
 with the guns yes then we're going to 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.990
 start first of all decent 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.670
 placement always at the level of the head and 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.049
 what I like about crochet placement at 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.909
 time to use guns write no 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.259
 I need to be moving micros already there 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.850
 many people who to find the 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.590
 head of the enemy pass it 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.110
 looking for it like that and that only makes it more 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.560
 difficult I just have to leave my 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.700
 quiet heart and let's say this 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.360
 triangulito is the head of an enemy 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.690
 A) Yes 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:47.210
 I let micro be at the level of the head 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.800
 and I do not need to be moving mikes or 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.720
 to find them I just have myself 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.890
 to move and this is where the other one comes in 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.560
 factor the movement 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.450
 what is the usp and the glock do not have 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.570
 so much penalty what allows me 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.300
 to be moving and shooting moving 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.479
 in the right way then there is a 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.160
 step that is called we go step and the wing 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.580
 you are simply moving tea 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.930
 of the village of at then I have micros 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.030
 or from the level of the head and I want 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.900
 find the enemy's head if there 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:23.870
 it's done I did not need to do this myself 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.870
 I just need to do this or see me 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.270
 I'm not seeing a micro being the 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.750
 movement is doing it and that's just 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.750
 makes it easier 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.530
 more easily 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.610
 well now every gun has a rhythm 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.870
 shooting 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.520
 that is the third factor 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.520
 the firing rate 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.560
 let's say if I wait for the usp 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.900
 that is not your rhythm then the bullets 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.380
 they will go anywhere 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.670
 if I use the correct rhythm that is a lot 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.670
 slower in this way 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.030
 the bullets go one place then 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.220
 imagine that I control doing 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.020
 placement movement and the rhythm of 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.760
 shot I'm a killing machine because 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.310
 I'm just going to be hitting headsets the 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.900
 Bullets go to one place 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.660
 there are many people who do not realize 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.050
 of that now not with all the guns 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.370
 you are going to have freedom of a movement 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:29.080
 with the code you can not be promoting 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:32.080
 the best we go step if more or less for 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.730
 there but if I'm moving there 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.340
 many times where you are going to go be a 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.720
 little deviated the bullet then to 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.290
 be more often more secure with the 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:45.390
 I say I do it the safety of what 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:48.150
 we talked in the video number 36 step 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:51.510
 and they are basically the same rules just 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.069
 that the firing rate of the code is 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.720
 much slower 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.730
 you have that shooting rhythm is a lot 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.640
 slower 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:03.400
 and say then I spam 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.450
 the bullets were going nowhere if I 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.450
 I do to the rhythm that is 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.220
 I know it's very slow but it must 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.890
 be 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.500
 and good always take into account these 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.380
 Three factors crochet rhythm placement 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.900
 of the shot and movement I hope has them 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.049
 helped I am Mexican to attack change and 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.049
 outside
