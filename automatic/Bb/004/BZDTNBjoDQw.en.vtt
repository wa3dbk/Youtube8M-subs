and<00:00:03.889> this<00:00:04.069> is<00:00:04.250> a<00:00:04.279> GM<00:00:04.730> adapters<00:00:05.390> for<00:00:05.420> the<00:00:05.720> GM

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:06.109 
and this is a GM adapters for the GM

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.720 
and this is a GM adapters for the GM
transmission<00:00:07.120> and<00:00:08.120> what<00:00:08.299> I<00:00:08.330> made<00:00:09.520> was<00:00:10.520> as

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
transmission and what I made was as

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.570 
transmission and what I made was as
planned<00:00:11.290> this<00:00:12.290> plans<00:00:12.710> accepts<00:00:13.429> the

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
planned this plans accepts the

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.420 
planned this plans accepts the
Mitsubishi<00:00:14.150> down<00:00:14.540> inside<00:00:15.049> here<00:00:15.410> and<00:00:15.679> it

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
Mitsubishi down inside here and it

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.120 
Mitsubishi down inside here and it
accepts<00:00:17.029> the<00:00:17.180> GM<00:00:17.599> fly<00:00:17.930> we<00:00:18.110> allow<00:00:18.349> it<00:00:18.500> here<00:00:18.770> and

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
accepts the GM fly we allow it here and

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.859 
accepts the GM fly we allow it here and
in<00:00:20.000> the<00:00:20.090> meantime<00:00:20.300> these<00:00:20.960> fingers<00:00:21.730> Center<00:00:22.869> the

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
in the meantime these fingers Center the

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.170 
in the meantime these fingers Center the
torque<00:00:24.169> cover<00:00:24.470> for<00:00:24.860> the<00:00:24.950> standard<00:00:25.430> GM<00:00:25.849> fly

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
torque cover for the standard GM fly

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.700 
torque cover for the standard GM fly
with<00:00:26.480> a<00:00:26.630> torque<00:00:27.230> converter<00:00:28.270> on<00:00:29.270> the<00:00:29.390> back<00:00:29.710> this

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
with a torque converter on the back this

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.370 
with a torque converter on the back this
is<00:00:30.770> laid<00:00:31.130> off<00:00:31.309> just<00:00:31.610> like<00:00:31.820> a<00:00:31.880> stick<00:00:32.599> ship

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
is laid off just like a stick ship

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.310 
is laid off just like a stick ship
so<00:00:34.070> now<00:00:34.219> that's<00:00:34.460> centered<00:00:35.060> and<00:00:35.450> all<00:00:36.170> these

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
so now that's centered and all these

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.880 
so now that's centered and all these
bolts<00:00:36.710> are<00:00:36.980> centered<00:00:38.290> and<00:00:39.290> I<00:00:39.440> used<00:00:39.680> a

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
bolts are centered and I used a

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
bolts are centered and I used a
Mitsubishi<00:00:42.820> automatic<00:00:43.820> transmission<00:00:44.890> mm-hmm

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.620 

flywheel<00:00:49.910> bolts<00:00:50.570> I<00:00:50.750> did<00:00:51.230> not<00:00:51.440> use<00:00:52.390> the<00:00:53.390> manual

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
flywheel bolts I did not use the manual

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:00.040 
flywheel bolts I did not use the manual
transmission<00:00:53.989> stuff<00:00:56.710> this<00:00:57.710> plant<00:00:58.720> did<00:00:59.720> not

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
transmission stuff this plant did not

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.430 
transmission stuff this plant did not
deport<00:01:00.890> it's<00:01:01.760> gone<00:01:02.390> it<00:01:02.690> should<00:01:02.930> go<00:01:03.110> out<00:01:03.260> here

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
deport it's gone it should go out here

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.039 
deport it's gone it should go out here
nice<00:01:03.649> and<00:01:03.680> easy<00:01:04.180> it's<00:01:05.180> just<00:01:05.540> that<00:01:05.750> there<00:01:05.960> are

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
nice and easy it's just that there are

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:11.050 
nice and easy it's just that there are
so<00:01:06.350> many<00:01:06.409> surfaces<00:01:07.420> that<00:01:08.420> it's<00:01:08.630> aligned<00:01:09.050> to<00:01:10.060> as

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
so many surfaces that it's aligned to as

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.750 
so many surfaces that it's aligned to as
in<00:01:11.450> that<00:01:11.630> it's<00:01:11.810> flat<00:01:12.140> on<00:01:12.409> a<00:01:12.530> back<00:01:12.890> space<00:01:13.310> and

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
in that it's flat on a back space and

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.200 
in that it's flat on a back space and
then<00:01:13.880> you<00:01:14.030> have<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:16.250> circular<00:01:17.500> capture<00:01:19.210> that

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
then you have the circular capture that

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.020 
then you have the circular capture that
and<00:01:21.080> these<00:01:21.440> bolt<00:01:21.740> holes<00:01:21.860> are<00:01:22.280> exactly<00:01:22.820> the

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
and these bolt holes are exactly the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.380 
and these bolt holes are exactly the
right<00:01:23.060> size<00:01:23.570> they're<00:01:24.110> not<00:01:25.150> oversized<00:01:26.150> at<00:01:26.510> all

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
right size they're not oversized at all

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.090 
right size they're not oversized at all
see<00:01:29.390> that<00:01:29.780> that<00:01:30.049> is<00:01:30.229> just<00:01:30.260> right<00:01:30.860> straight

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
see that that is just right straight

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.149 
see that that is just right straight
down<00:01:31.580> in<00:01:32.060> there

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
down in there

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.460 
down in there
the<00:01:34.159> next<00:01:34.520> piece<00:01:34.729> I<00:01:34.970> had<00:01:35.270> to<00:01:35.420> make<00:01:36.040> was<00:01:37.040> the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
the next piece I had to make was the

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.230 
the next piece I had to make was the
adapter<00:01:39.470> plate<00:01:39.770> now<00:01:40.070> this<00:01:40.400> is<00:01:40.610> for<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.030> wide

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
adapter plate now this is for the wide

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.020 
adapter plate now this is for the wide
block<00:01:41.600> only<00:01:41.990> I<00:01:42.500> would<00:01:43.010> have<00:01:43.100> liked<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:43.520> make<00:01:43.760> it

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
block only I would have liked to make it

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.660 
block only I would have liked to make it
for<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.080> wide<00:01:45.290> block<00:01:45.619> and<00:01:45.950> a<00:01:46.159> narrow<00:01:46.369> block

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
for the wide block and a narrow block

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.480 
for the wide block and a narrow block
but<00:01:46.970> they're<00:01:47.299> not<00:01:47.479> doing<00:01:48.159> now<00:01:49.159> in<00:01:49.369> this

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
but they're not doing now in this

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.310 
but they're not doing now in this
particular<00:01:49.790> setup<00:01:50.360> because<00:01:50.720> this<00:01:51.140> is<00:01:51.290> a

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
particular setup because this is a

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.160 
particular setup because this is a
prototype<00:01:51.650> that<00:01:52.250> I<00:01:52.310> had<00:01:52.490> add<00:01:52.820> 3/16<00:01:53.750> of<00:01:53.930> an<00:01:54.020> inch

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
prototype that I had add 3/16 of an inch

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.980 
prototype that I had add 3/16 of an inch
onto<00:01:54.530> this<00:01:54.799> half-inch<00:01:55.310> plate<00:01:55.750> half-inch<00:01:56.750> was

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
onto this half-inch plate half-inch was

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.359 
onto this half-inch plate half-inch was
not

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
not

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.620 
not
it's<00:01:57.880> tough<00:01:58.119> on<00:01:58.799> these<00:01:59.799> dolls<00:02:00.450> there<00:02:01.450> are

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
it's tough on these dolls there are

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.120 
it's tough on these dolls there are
exactly<00:02:01.960> 13<00:02:02.649> millimeter<00:02:03.630> this<00:02:04.630> half<00:02:04.869> inch<00:02:05.200> is

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
exactly 13 millimeter this half inch is

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.690 
exactly 13 millimeter this half inch is
a<00:02:06.189> little<00:02:06.640> bit<00:02:06.819> wider<00:02:07.149> than<00:02:07.509> 13<00:02:07.960> millimeter<00:02:08.700> so

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
a little bit wider than 13 millimeter so

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.729 
a little bit wider than 13 millimeter so
I<00:02:09.729> want<00:02:10.030> you<00:02:10.179> to<00:02:10.239> just<00:02:10.479> cut<00:02:10.899> off<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.080> edge<00:02:11.560> of

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
I want you to just cut off the edge of

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.410 
I want you to just cut off the edge of
though<00:02:11.920> it's<00:02:12.099> just<00:02:12.340> a<00:02:12.459> little<00:02:12.700> bit<00:02:12.879> to<00:02:13.120> sink

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
though it's just a little bit to sink

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.220 
though it's just a little bit to sink
them<00:02:13.569> down<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:15.340> make<00:02:16.209> sure<00:02:16.239> that<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:16.690> bolt<00:02:16.930> has

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
them down to make sure that the bolt has

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:26.660 
them down to make sure that the bolt has
a<00:02:17.260> good<00:02:17.530> tight<00:02:17.830> grip<00:02:22.470> now<00:02:23.470> there's<00:02:23.739> my<00:02:24.010> setup<00:02:24.370> I

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
a good tight grip now there's my setup I

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.460 
a good tight grip now there's my setup I
use<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:28.090> starter<00:02:28.599> from<00:02:28.780> Jegs

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
use the starter from Jegs

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:36.630 
use the starter from Jegs
and<00:02:29.680> I<00:02:30.549> made<00:02:30.790> my<00:02:31.000> own<00:02:31.030> piece<00:02:31.480> on<00:02:31.780> here<00:02:35.519> and<00:02:36.519> I

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
and I made my own piece on here and I

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.780 
and I made my own piece on here and I
used<00:02:36.880> a<00:02:37.000> flywheel<00:02:37.540> that<00:02:37.599> as<00:02:37.989> a<00:02:38.019> standard<00:02:38.790> 153

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
used a flywheel that as a standard 153

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.740 
used a flywheel that as a standard 153
tooth<00:02:41.280> internally<00:02:42.280> balanced<00:02:42.879> engine<00:02:43.299> setup

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
tooth internally balanced engine setup

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.210 
tooth internally balanced engine setup
and<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:43.959> reason<00:02:44.230> I<00:02:44.290> went<00:02:44.410> with<00:02:44.590> internally

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
and the reason I went with internally

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.680 
and the reason I went with internally
balanced<00:02:45.670> is<00:02:45.849> because<00:02:46.180> this<00:02:46.360> oughta<00:02:46.599> be

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
balanced is because this oughta be

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.140 
balanced is because this oughta be
neutrally<00:02:47.349> balanced<00:02:47.950> if<00:02:48.069> that's<00:02:48.340> true<00:02:48.670> and

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
neutrally balanced if that's true and
