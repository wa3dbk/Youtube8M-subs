00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
more of these pads it's a good idea to

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.840 
more of these pads it's a good idea to
put<00:03:01.430> these<00:03:01.640> pads<00:03:02.560> cross-grain<00:03:03.590> like<00:03:03.980> you<00:03:04.730> know

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
you look on the side see the thing and

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.080 
you look on the side see the thing and
that<00:03:07.940> way<00:03:08.120> it's<00:03:08.630> much<00:03:08.900> more<00:03:09.230> secure<00:03:10.040> okay<00:03:11.030> so

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
that way it's much more secure okay so

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.990 
that way it's much more secure okay so
you<00:03:11.330> got<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:11.690> record<00:03:12.080> you<00:03:12.230> got<00:03:12.440> all<00:03:13.040> five<00:03:13.970> of
