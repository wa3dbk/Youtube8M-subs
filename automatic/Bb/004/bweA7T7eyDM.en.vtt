the<00:00:22.890> future<00:00:23.039> if<00:00:23.340> you're<00:00:23.490> watching<00:00:23.609> this<00:00:23.820> like

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
the future if you're watching this like

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.450 
the future if you're watching this like
in<00:00:24.269> 2013<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.350> it's<00:00:25.949> probably<00:00:26.220> going<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.400> be

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
in 2013 and it's probably going to be

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.890 
in 2013 and it's probably going to be
the<00:00:26.580> same<00:00:26.910> exact<00:00:27.150> thing<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.449> what's<00:00:27.689> in<00:00:27.810> this

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900

17<00:00:30.449> or<00:00:30.630> something<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.140> might<00:00:31.650> look<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:32.009> little

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
17 or something it might look a little

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.950 
17 or something it might look a little
different<00:00:32.550> but<00:00:32.700> if<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.120> go<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.329> my<00:00:33.450> channel<00:00:33.870> or

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
different but if you go to my channel or

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.200 
different but if you go to my channel or
look<00:00:34.200> at<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.380> like<00:00:34.620> thumbnail<00:00:35.190> user<00:00:35.640> like<00:00:36.090> at

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
look at the like thumbnail user like at

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.630 
look at the like thumbnail user like at
the<00:00:36.329> bottom<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.690> my<00:00:36.809> videos<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.829> can<00:00:37.980> see<00:00:38.280> that

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
the bottom of my videos you can see that

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.500 
the bottom of my videos you can see that
there<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.329> um<00:00:39.840> like<00:00:40.230> triangles<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.730> for<00:00:42.329> one

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
there is um like triangles and I for one

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.850 
there is um like triangles and I for one
I<00:00:42.540> think<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:42.899> actually<00:00:43.230> really<00:00:43.260> cool<00:00:43.559> fed

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
I think this is actually really cool fed

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.979 
I think this is actually really cool fed
dislike<00:00:44.250> space<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.300> background<00:00:45.690> with

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
dislike space in the background with

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.510 
dislike space in the background with
like<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.289> rainbow<00:00:46.710> letters<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.280> then<00:00:47.370> like

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
like the rainbow letters and then like

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.100 
like the rainbow letters and then like
triangles<00:00:48.000> different<00:00:48.420> patterns<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.989> stuff

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
triangles different patterns and stuff

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.930 
triangles different patterns and stuff
different<00:00:49.469> colors<00:00:49.770> oh<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.489> think<00:00:50.640> that's<00:00:50.910> a

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
different colors oh I think that's a

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.000 
different colors oh I think that's a
really<00:00:51.149> good<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.629> know<00:00:51.660> concept<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.649> person

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
really good you know concept the person

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.380 
really good you know concept the person
