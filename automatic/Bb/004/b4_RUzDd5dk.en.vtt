00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.440
 mobile games reviews from mob yue 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.080
 today we have to look after 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.599
 cows fight monsters run around 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.910
 the city of the future collect colored cubes in 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.360
 row on be a superhero and fly in 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.360
 space 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.880
 the first game is called farmville 2 and this 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.340
 exactly what you thought farm 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.320
 pretty funny by ratings first 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.480
 part of the game is considered almost the best 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.360
 a farm in the world and maybe it is 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.310
 mean and 2 is good however to talk about it 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.800
 we will not because well how can 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.380
 these companies are a whole horde and everything is in principle 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.870
 look alike question only in 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.430
 quality and here quality is on top so 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.950
 what if you're a mobile fan 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.750
 farming then this is for you by the way here 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.420
 no need internet connection 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.430
 the next one is kingdom and 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.710
 dragon's action rpg genre 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.059
 although generally more like hear 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.010
 Well, that is, you chop up fast 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.440
 shoot or burn crowds of enemies 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.870
 bosses and in general all who behave 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.610
 uncivilized you chop or you shoot 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.560
 burn up them depending on 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.310
 selected character class which 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.860
 by the way 3 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.140
 who would have thought but this is a warrior archer and 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.420
 magician how original this creation 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.970
 Japanese developers and it left 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.550
 your mark anime panache big balls 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.590
 and nyashka witch that is interesting in the game 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.040
 there is an element construction initially 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.840
 we have 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.180
 poor village and we have to 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.300
 pump it to the full population 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.690
 point 3 game for today is called wounds 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.580
 wow runner is about the robot and all 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.980
 the design is made in a futuristic style 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.170
 besides there are quite large 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.210
 open spaces that combined with 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.700
 good graphics even slightly impressive 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.950
 in general, the runnerâ€™s idea remained here in 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.650
 its original character runs 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.240
 forward collecting along the way things usually this 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.310
 coins but this time some 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.790
 incomprehensible figoviny but the essence in general 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.920
 also 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.230
 during the race there are obstacles 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.630
 who need to run and jump 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.310
 scrambling fly around and so on and in 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.240
 intervals between races can be 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.700
 improve the robot 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.099
 runner is basically beautiful and playable 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.119
 Dove let's look at the game and cubis 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.670
 degtev pasler 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.920
 This is essentially a puzzle in which you need to assemble 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.090
 3 or more single color cubes in a row 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.010
 make them disappear 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.560
 but unlike most such games 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.390
 it's three-dimensional and the cubes are piled up here 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.849
 layered so it is not necessary to collect 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.099
 three breaths can be two above and one below 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.760
 there are still all sorts of explosives and others 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.349
 bonuses 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.330
 and all this is done in some kind 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.430
 addict style playing field 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.269
 located on the back of an elephant 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.670
 someone's mouth 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.290
 the background is also very funny sausage and 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.250
 In general, the game has its own 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.220
 the atmosphere 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.950
 kirish 3d game so called our 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.569
 the next game is runner but it is felt 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.480
 he somehow as a platformer 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.730
 play to be for 1 of 4 superheroes 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.430
 Well, the main goal of course struggle with 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.290
 evil in our arsenal there are shuriken 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.670
 freezing bombs and other 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.590
 superhero gadgets 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.690
 besides each character has and 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.790
 your ability to pass the game can 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.400
 both alone and in co-op in 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.079
 principle pretty fun last on 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.799
 today the game is called star 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.260
 wanderers 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.909
 and if someone from the audience is enough 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.859
 old to remember cosmic 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.989
 rangers then this is something on them 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:19.299
 It seems you have a ship and around 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.159
 a large unknown space with different 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.290
 races tasks and enemies 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.599
 how to behave and what to do depends on 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.400
 player can be friends with one and send on 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.440
 three letters of the other can be pumped 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.750
 characters your ship can get 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.569
 minerals and space junk 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.340
 In short options many fights by the way 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.590
 step by step despite the fact that all 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.049
 the rest is real-time besides 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.940
 present here and the plot so i don't 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.919
 I see no reason why not 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.599
