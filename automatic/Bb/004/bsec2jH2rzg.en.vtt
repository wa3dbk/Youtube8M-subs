00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.369
 iowa mom 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.869
 let's start with the verse it is worth 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.900
 of four chords it is in F sharp minor 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.500
 in C Sharp Minor 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.140
 E Major and B Major 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.940
 in F sharp minor we take on the ninth year 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:39.910
 pinching the bar on the fourth string 11 fret 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:43.720
 play the fifth string fourth fourth 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:46.360
 do guys hitting the little finger of the 12th fret 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.450
 and doing frustrating this technique also call 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:53.559
 called a hammer and pull off 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:57.059
 we will call it legato you must 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.059
 get this 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.010
 then you go to chord C sharp 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.309
 minor 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.860
 barre on the fourth fret 4 strings on 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.130
 the sixth year and the second string on the fifth 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.170
 fret 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.689
 play the fifth fourth second 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.340
 and go through my cards this bars on 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:20.490
 7th fret and 4 countries will need 9 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.290
 being played fifth string fourth 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.040
 and the first as in the first chord 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.909
 do legato strikes the ninth fret 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.909
 and tear 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.200
 go to chord c 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:42.240
 also borey on the seventh fret 5 string on 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.030
 9 and 3 wall on the eighth fret play 6 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.909
 string five 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.679
 3 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.310
 now let's play this piece 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:50.310
 wholly 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:06.210
 further next part win first 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.670
 chord just like the first 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:15.170
 2 times the same 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:17.290
 here at me you play quint ie 9 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.650
 fourth string simultaneously 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.099
 slide one and a half down 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.099
 up 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.460
 go to chord c 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.330
 it is not necessary to clamp the bars here 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.180
 because only three strings are needed 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.730
 6 5 3 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.799
 you also play them all at once 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:46.200
 slide down 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:49.650
 half a tone and again up the fourth second and 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:53.510
 you can drown the first string just 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.240
 dash of their forefinger 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.150
 so they don't sound 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.870
 let's play 2 this second piece 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.870
 wholly 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.010
 now both fragments 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:36.440
 then they repeat and you go to 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:41.120
 chorus chorus consists of three main 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.420
 chord this is the basis minor makeup burn and si 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.420
 major 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:03.480
 for the first time you play two cool 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.730
 punch down at chord position and 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.620
 go to the chord me 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.760
 watch your right hand to understand 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.760
 I will play rhythm slowly 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.539
 on a phase map of 3 short 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.539
 it turns out blow down 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:42.910
 at the end i do reception i mean i 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:47.020
 get away pol make up at cabaret and 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.970
 after that do legato with two fingers 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:58.780
 immediately hitting the fourth string on the 1st 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:05:01.139
 fret and the second string 10 watts I will order in 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.139
 chords 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.850
 followed by the second verse, it is identical 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.370
 first 2 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.240
 chorus all repeats after that 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.700
 follow bridge 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.470
 let me show you now before 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:38.690
 you play the same chords 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:41.010
 as in the couplet the first half is played 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:49.440
 short blows two blows down 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:52.460
 about each chord just wear it turns out 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.460
 the rhythm changes a little 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.900
 and again 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:10.040
 followed by the second half where the rhythm 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.040
 already constant without pauses 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:27.330
 and then you go to the chorus 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.730
