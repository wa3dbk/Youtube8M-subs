 country accompanying mainly the soybean campaign we were also 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:22.579
 accompanying the producers of the colony 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:27.300
 because the cooperative of this district was organizing a field day 

00:00:27.299 --> 00:00:30.799
 where it seems companies participated to show their news 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.570
 and its services to producers 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.990
 lüthi suter what the floor presented by finally university cooperative ni 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.000
 they work 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.420
 options of the highest dad that it stings me in terms of soybeans and 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.360
 zafriña corn 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.270
 a diversity of products for the different stages of cultivation and 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.880
 practical technical recommendations for producers could be observed 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.360
 on time everything that stigarribia in a field day organized by the 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.000
 cooperative submitted 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.639
 the goal of these p 

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:05.639
 for now they keep learning French 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.540
 min in the cicca in 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.560
 meanwhile your fears 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.240
 laredo 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.210
 the sporty lara 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.340
 here you can see so many decades of melilla seed 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.560
 Application of zeta insecticide fungicides 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.190
 until the end that you can come clarity and with the festival g 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.690
 some that do not go well for him is not well located for the sound 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:26.780
 monsoon 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.620
 Popular has opted for others some were both with 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.980
 I am very sorry not 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.980
 Juan for that purpose that proposes to learn some things 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.620
 in terms of corn varieties 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.430
 The biggest operation to some options for this inia harvest are materials from 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.390
 agro this traditional of our country 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.710
 within the market of its perpetuation 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.200
 you have available for 15 48 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.990
 it was second in nostrum ay super precoces an endorsed curriculum 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.910
 specific for cold merchants that have the same quality of grain and 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.659
 where or how there are times when working in Paraguay with low density of 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.729
 55 my emilia emilia 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.069
 you have a corn that the one that has excellent impaling will be made of it 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.999
 pointed the ear and if there is a batting disk with corn they have the 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:24.169
 Protabaco this because something corn who misses a half percent is not going to 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:27.719
 have sprouted grain problem going to the side will not pay 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:29.889
 for the present campaign where 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:32.859
 which represents the Spanish seed in Paraguay 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:37.090
 presented several materials and emphasized in a system that consists 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:41.889
 in combining typical to minimize risks and ensure a good 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:44.199
 productivity 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:47.569
 is to combine genetics and technology to extract more frustrated 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:52.430
 we know that in a single world product in a single corn a 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.609
 no care and corn 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.929
 We do not have all the desirable characteristics of the producer 

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:03.949
 giselle precocity a fast hybrid with autism productive potential and 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:05.349
 extremely holy 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.329
 it is not possible to have these three characteristics within a single 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:09.049
 event 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.179
 So what we have today is a package of products 

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:16.419
 for different sowing dates for different levels of icahn technology 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:20.159
 in different levels of productive potential different levels of 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.159
 precocity and also of produced 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:27.489
 So what we are talking about are scripts adapted for this environment 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.759
 of corn oil we have here in Paraguay 

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:32.169
 the company read it 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:34.939
 derosa and soup materials that they presented 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:38.379
 they gave main emphasis to the parity field morán 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:41.069
 which has a very good adaptation 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.069
 and very good productive parameters of our country 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:48.339
 and we have another variety that today 

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:52.429
 to the number of Paraguay this is sown not much as much as the north as the south 

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:53.330
 from Paraguay 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.999
 which is called brownfield 

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:56.450
 today that's why he's staying 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.249
 the most important variety of the portfolio of 

00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:01.859
 hence, I quote and added that here in Paraguay 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:05.809
 talavera that has a good noam good quality of health 

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:09.679
 is going to have a good performance both in droughts and enclave plan 

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:10.759
 study norm 

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:14.509
 we do not have problems in a measure that has a good initial development 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.219
 a good bearing of works 

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:18.109
 behave 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.889
 for sure a lieutenant may have a smaller amount and good performance than 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.050
 contain the highest pressure 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.980
 in the present soybean campaign 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.980
 the climatic factor has caused the appearance of diseases 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.520
 in this aspect 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.230
 adopt the first some recommendations 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.270
 for better control 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.949
 you attract a lot of experience in systems because the company markets and a lot and 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:47.310
 that disease of disaster a knowledge bonbon like candle until the 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.849
 cultivate what moment 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:52.229
 and that happens because of the very strong case of culture so that it makes its control of 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.169
 preventive form that does not neglect its past 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:00.680
 i want to entertain me and your knowledge that alan works very aggressively and that 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.750
 after he lost control really the prism this is true 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:08.139
 and within that is our product leader another step to recommendations 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.699
 as only goats were placed to go 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:14.360
 and also as the PSOE doubts the management of their disease 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:18.669
 then I die option of the young cadets so that soon I can 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.710
 change the active ingredients to use implicit klum of assets 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.580
 and with a very strong follow-up at the executory level with a team of 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.940
 agronomists 30 the preparations so you can identify them and 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.199
 You can also guide farmer to do it control 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:35.960
 alchemy on the other hand 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.229
 offered a series of options to the most common problems of the 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:40.159
 producers 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:43.439
 with its complete line of products 

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:45.689
 we are trying to give a solution 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:48.689
 an antenna have to solve it to the producers 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:51.530
 in different types of HIV-AIDS 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.509
 a policeman if you would like 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:57.949
 the one that we are as you notice in the one that said 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:00.949
 efe from 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.210
 the drying part with slack 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.569
 authority and danny 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:10.379
 the post-emergency part with 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:12.139
 panther 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:15.680
 In the line of insecticides to control some components 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.279
 It is also common for the night insecurity but with toast 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.080
 hilda what is physiological with resign 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:25.950
 We are maintaining 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:30.780
 ogier what in the treatment line percent the golán or 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.039
 offensive silicone 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:35.300
 that did not tarnish before 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.969
 dispersant 

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:39.969
 that we are having taking commission 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.289
 the product penetrates 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:45.900
 really in av 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.900
 in a product makes one hundred percent of silicone 

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:50.619
 what 

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:52.930
 let's see as a tool for dairy products 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.699
 be a solution 

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:56.639
 in this field day 

00:06:56.639 --> 00:07:00.639
 He was also active in the machinery sector in which several 

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:03.930
 companies presented the highest technology in this task 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:10.679
 and well are roberto momo or not what started modules as a carrier 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.610
 especially when all the time 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.360
 federer when controlled mdd we were already participating 

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:23.689
 p rennes percent 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:26.059
 talking 

00:07:26.059 --> 00:07:29.429
 to 2 93 what we started to 

00:07:30.089 --> 00:07:33.089
 four of the most loved a lot of light 

00:07:34.559 --> 00:07:37.559
 pd to offer out we are 

00:07:38.229 --> 00:07:39.369
 and always 

00:07:39.369 --> 00:07:42.119
 colon martínez that played very well 

00:07:42.119 --> 00:07:45.119
 very well accepted to everything and live 

00:07:47.289 --> 00:07:49.569
 is a maximum of 100 

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:51.339
 what's wrong with it 

00:07:51.339 --> 00:07:52.509
 Lead Chinese or not
