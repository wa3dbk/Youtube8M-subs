is<00:02:35.080> gonna<00:02:35.230> be<00:02:35.410> a<00:02:35.440> secondary<00:02:35.980> which<00:02:36.340> means

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
is gonna be a secondary which means

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.740 
is gonna be a secondary which means

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
you'd have to choose it like set up a

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.140 
you'd have to choose it like set up a
pistol<00:02:38.459> so<00:02:39.459> you<00:02:39.550> wouldn't<00:02:39.730> be<00:02:39.790> able<00:02:39.850> to<00:02:39.970> knife

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150
