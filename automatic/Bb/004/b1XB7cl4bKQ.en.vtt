mechanism<00:02:46.270> it<00:02:47.140> opens<00:02:47.500> very<00:02:47.740> easy<00:02:48.010> because<00:02:48.610> you

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
mechanism it opens very easy because you

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.180 
mechanism it opens very easy because you
can<00:02:48.880> imagine<00:02:49.120> this<00:02:49.600> thick<00:02:49.930> ceramic<00:02:50.530> top

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
assisted lid opening device it actually

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.130 
assisted lid opening device it actually
opens<00:03:01.870> and<00:03:02.080> closes<00:03:02.350> very<00:03:02.860> easily
