00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.710 
Lee Kip just fill it with the green nose
and<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.410> disintegrated<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.279> put<00:00:26.490> some<00:00:26.730> kind

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
and it disintegrated and I put some kind

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.169 
and it disintegrated and I put some kind
of<00:00:27.930> almost<00:00:28.439> caulking<00:00:29.220> on<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.699> special<00:00:30.000> kind

so<00:00:32.790> it's<00:00:33.000> just<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.329> case<00:00:33.540> what<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.840> don't<00:00:34.050> think

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
so it's just in case what I don't think

there<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.350> any<00:00:34.500> danger<00:00:34.680> but<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.040> did<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.399> just

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
there is any danger but I did that just

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.450 
there is any danger but I did that just
in<00:00:35.730> case

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
in case

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.200

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:39.260 

it's<00:01:30.960> not<00:01:34.700> so<00:01:36.050> I<00:01:37.640> mean<00:01:38.640> if<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.910> call<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.210> a

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
it's not so I mean if you call that a

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.640 
it's not so I mean if you call that a
protrusion<00:01:39.660> that's<00:01:39.960> fine<00:01:40.200> because<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.470> mean

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
protrusion that's fine because I mean

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.600 
protrusion that's fine because I mean
you<00:01:40.710> can<00:01:40.860> always<00:01:40.979> just<00:01:41.130> pick<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.370> down<00:01:41.580> a

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
you can always just pick it down a

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.540 
you can always just pick it down a
little<00:01:41.760> bit<00:01:45.770> most<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.830> time<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.190> speak<00:01:47.369> will

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
little bit most the time you speak will

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.219 
little bit most the time you speak will
be<00:01:47.580> here<00:01:47.820> anyway<00:01:48.060> these<00:01:48.240> ones<00:01:48.540> are<00:01:48.690> mostly<00:01:49.020> to

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
be here anyway these ones are mostly to

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.730 
be here anyway these ones are mostly to
tip<00:01:49.440> it<00:01:49.700> so<00:01:50.700> when<00:01:50.850> you're<00:01:50.910> going<00:01:51.119> upwind<00:01:51.740> these

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
tip it so when you're going upwind these

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.390 
tip it so when you're going upwind these
ones<00:01:52.979> are<00:01:53.100> obviously<00:01:53.220> when<00:01:53.700> you're<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:54.240> back

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
ones are obviously when you're in back

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.050 
ones are obviously when you're in back
planing<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:57.950> when<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.100> are<00:01:59.250> thinking<00:01:59.520> of

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
planing and when you are thinking of

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.700 
planing and when you are thinking of
planning<00:02:01.310> our<00:02:02.310> planning<00:02:02.790> obviously<00:02:03.710> you'll

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
planning our planning obviously you'll

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.109 
planning our planning obviously you'll
have<00:02:04.740> their<00:02:04.979> mass<00:02:05.130> truck<00:02:05.369> at<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.610> back<00:02:05.759> this

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
have their mass truck at the back this

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.700 
have their mass truck at the back this
is<00:02:06.180> not<00:02:06.450> just<00:02:06.660> your<00:02:06.810> mom's<00:02:07.020> truck<00:02:07.229> on<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.470> fly

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
is not just your mom's truck on the fly

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:21.160 
is not just your mom's truck on the fly
so<00:02:17.060> and<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.420> don't<00:02:18.660> really<00:02:18.989> like<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.590> mass<00:02:19.800> base

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
so and I don't really like the mass base

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.570 
so and I don't really like the mass base
enough<00:02:22.170> bits<00:02:22.380> that<00:02:22.560> are<00:02:22.709> very<00:02:22.890> practical<00:02:23.489> in

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
enough bits that are very practical in

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.030 
enough bits that are very practical in
the<00:02:23.640> sense<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.910> put<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:24.930> in<00:02:25.080> turn<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:25.860> you

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
the sense that put it in turn it you

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.830 
the sense that put it in turn it you
hear<00:02:26.190> clutch<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.730> it's<00:02:26.880> in<00:02:27.060> it's<00:02:27.480> not<00:02:27.600> gonna

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
hear clutch and it's in it's not gonna

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.920 
hear clutch and it's in it's not gonna
part<00:02:28.400> I<00:02:29.400> don't<00:02:30.030> find<00:02:30.239> this<00:02:30.420> one<00:02:30.750> very

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
part I don't find this one very

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.110 
part I don't find this one very
practical<00:02:31.280> this<00:02:32.280> is<00:02:32.489> one<00:02:32.640> extremely

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
practical this is one extremely

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.580 
practical this is one extremely
practical<00:02:33.299> you<00:02:33.690> can<00:02:33.750> adjust<00:02:34.170> your<00:02:34.260> down<00:02:34.560> a

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
practical you can adjust your down a

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.949 
practical you can adjust your down a
loop<00:02:35.070> I<00:02:35.400> mean<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.060> millimeter<00:02:36.420> practically

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
loop I mean the millimeter practically

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.380 
loop I mean the millimeter practically
if<00:02:37.049> you<00:02:37.170> want<00:02:37.350> to<00:02:37.580> and<00:02:38.580> you<00:02:38.760> can<00:02:38.790> take<00:02:39.120> things

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
if you want to and you can take things

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.890

them<00:02:55.320> here<00:02:56.480> I<00:02:58.400> built<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.519> board<00:02:59.760> holding<00:03:00.360> it<00:03:00.540> I

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
them here I built the board holding it I

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.699 
them here I built the board holding it I
push<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.769> it's<00:03:01.920> that<00:03:02.100> as<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:02.850> can<00:03:03.000> see<00:03:03.060> I<00:03:03.709> prefer

push a it's that as you can see I prefer
the<00:03:05.070> US<00:03:05.340> base<00:03:06.950> and<00:03:07.950> I<00:03:08.100> could<00:03:09.410> Chinook<00:03:10.410> base

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
the US base and I could Chinook base

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.580 
the US base and I could Chinook base
with<00:03:10.860> this<00:03:11.190> up<00:03:11.370> nice<00:03:12.360> place

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
with this up nice place

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.030 
with this up nice place
and<00:03:14.569> it's<00:03:15.569> adjustable<00:03:16.050> obviously<00:03:16.590> not<00:03:16.770> on<00:03:16.800> the

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
and it's adjustable obviously not on the

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.530 
and it's adjustable obviously not on the
fly<00:03:17.250> so<00:03:17.280> I<00:03:18.770> typically<00:03:19.770> write<00:03:20.069> it<00:03:20.300> pretty<00:03:21.300> much

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
fly so I typically write it pretty much

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.949 
fly so I typically write it pretty much
in<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.780> middle<00:03:22.790> and<00:03:23.790> if<00:03:24.270> I<00:03:24.390> know<00:03:24.450> I'm<00:03:24.630> gonna<00:03:24.810> be

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959
