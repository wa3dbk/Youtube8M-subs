we start winning football games those
kids<00:02:33.560> over<00:02:33.770> another<00:02:34.550> thing<00:02:34.760> I<00:02:34.880> feel<00:02:35.090> like<00:02:35.239> the

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
kids over another thing I feel like the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.470 
kids over another thing I feel like the
reason<00:02:35.540> why<00:02:35.750> we<00:02:35.870> have<00:02:35.959> kids<00:02:36.200> buy-in<00:02:36.590> so<00:02:36.800> much

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
reason why we have kids buy-in so much

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.400 
reason why we have kids buy-in so much
is<00:02:38.480> because<00:02:39.430> there<00:02:40.430> you<00:02:40.670> go<00:02:40.910> we<00:02:41.840> go<00:02:41.959> above<00:02:42.260> and

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
is because there you go we go above and
