00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
the bones are beautiful like a lot of my

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.769 
the bones are beautiful like a lot of my
work

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
work

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.069 
work
let<00:00:27.050> us<00:00:27.170> try<00:00:27.320> and<00:00:27.439> get<00:00:27.529> people<00:00:27.650> to<00:00:27.890> to<00:00:28.730> get<00:00:28.970> a

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:29.079 
let us try and get people to to get a

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:31.240 
let us try and get people to to get a
deeper<00:00:30.079> connection<00:00:30.230> with<00:00:30.649> the<00:00:30.710> natural<00:00:30.860> world

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
deeper connection with the natural world

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.760 
deeper connection with the natural world
and<00:00:32.029> if<00:00:32.300> you<00:00:32.419> can<00:00:32.540> see<00:00:32.750> beauty<00:00:33.140> and<00:00:33.260> bones<00:00:33.500> I

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
and if you can see beauty and bones I

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.200 
and if you can see beauty and bones I
think<00:00:33.800> in<00:00:34.100> you<00:00:34.220> a<00:00:34.250> long<00:00:34.430> way<00:00:34.610> towards<00:00:34.970> scenes

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
think in you a long way towards scenes

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.799 
think in you a long way towards scenes
using<00:00:35.600> them<00:00:35.930> in<00:00:36.110> a<00:00:36.170> live<00:00:36.380> animal<00:00:40.630> when<00:00:41.630> I<00:00:41.720> was

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
using them in a live animal when I was

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.290 
using them in a live animal when I was
about<00:00:41.899> 8<00:00:42.110> I<00:00:42.290> started<00:00:42.590> collecting<00:00:42.710> bones<00:00:43.300> my

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
about 8 I started collecting bones my

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.910 
about 8 I started collecting bones my
parents<00:00:44.600> are<00:00:44.690> both<00:00:44.750> scientists<00:00:45.290> and<00:00:45.620> we<00:00:45.800> used

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
parents are both scientists and we used

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.980 
parents are both scientists and we used
to<00:00:45.980> go<00:00:46.160> away<00:00:46.280> a<00:00:46.370> lot<00:00:46.610> and<00:00:47.300> on<00:00:47.690> some<00:00:47.840> of<00:00:47.930> these

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:47.990 
to go away a lot and on some of these

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.880 
to go away a lot and on some of these
trips<00:00:48.580> those<00:00:49.580> click<00:00:49.850> up<00:00:49.970> bones<00:00:50.210> and<00:00:50.890> parrots

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
trips those click up bones and parrots

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.140 
trips those click up bones and parrots
are<00:00:51.980> also<00:00:52.070> collecting<00:00:52.580> things<00:00:52.790> at<00:00:52.910> the<00:00:52.970> same

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 
are also collecting things at the same

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.850 
are also collecting things at the same
time<00:00:53.420> so<00:00:53.660> it<00:00:53.750> seemed<00:00:53.930> natural<00:00:54.110> to<00:00:54.350> start

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
time so it seemed natural to start

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:03.580 
time so it seemed natural to start
collecting<00:00:55.190> things<00:01:01.960> as<00:01:02.960> you<00:01:03.110> can<00:01:03.170> see<00:01:03.380> don't

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
collecting things as you can see don't

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.039 
collecting things as you can see don't
really<00:01:03.829> find<00:01:04.040> many<00:01:04.250> bones<00:01:04.549> sort<00:01:04.850> of<00:01:05.049> pristine

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
really find many bones sort of pristine

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.240 
really find many bones sort of pristine
on<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:06.650> beach<00:01:07.090> occasionally<00:01:08.090> you<00:01:08.180> do<00:01:08.360> but

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
on the beach occasionally you do but

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.310 
on the beach occasionally you do but
usually<00:01:10.250> you've<00:01:11.149> got<00:01:11.420> a<00:01:11.450> door<00:01:11.750> it'll<00:01:11.899> work<00:01:12.110> to

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
usually you've got a door it'll work to

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.310 
usually you've got a door it'll work to
get<00:01:12.470> them<00:01:12.590> up<00:01:12.710> and<00:01:12.740> good<00:01:13.390> this<00:01:14.390> has<00:01:14.540> been<00:01:14.780> under

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
get them up and good this has been under

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.110 
get them up and good this has been under
the<00:01:15.439> rocks<00:01:15.649> for<00:01:15.860> a<00:01:15.950> better<00:01:16.189> month<00:01:16.460> so<00:01:17.030> you

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
the rocks for a better month so you

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.149 
the rocks for a better month so you
still<00:01:17.360> see<00:01:17.390> a<00:01:17.570> lot<00:01:17.690> of<00:01:17.720> flesh<00:01:17.960> on<00:01:18.110> it<00:01:18.140> stuff<00:01:18.500> but

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
still see a lot of flesh on it stuff but

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:20.980 
still see a lot of flesh on it stuff but
you<00:01:19.250> can<00:01:19.310> just<00:01:19.490> pick<00:01:19.670> the<00:01:19.820> bones<00:01:20.000> out<00:01:20.690> of<00:01:20.930> the

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
you can just pick the bones out of the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.970 
you can just pick the bones out of the
skin<00:01:23.770> so<00:01:24.770> some<00:01:24.979> feathers

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:26.980 
skin so some feathers

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.639 
skin so some feathers
feathers<00:01:27.580> feathers<00:01:27.760> feathers

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.940 

got<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> backbone<00:01:33.119> all<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.229> backbones<00:01:34.469> here

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
got a backbone all the backbones here

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.319 
got a backbone all the backbones here
which<00:01:35.100> are<00:01:35.249> very<00:01:35.399> nice<00:01:35.549> always<00:01:35.880> like<00:01:36.030> making

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
which are very nice always like making

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.779 
which are very nice always like making
things<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.780> these<00:01:36.899> little<00:01:37.020> backgrounds<00:01:37.789> I've

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
things of these little backgrounds I've

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:41.020 
things of these little backgrounds I've
started<00:01:39.119> sort<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.450> seeing<00:01:39.600> bones<00:01:39.899> is<00:01:40.200> like

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
started sort of seeing bones is like

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:48.020 
started sort of seeing bones is like
paint<00:01:45.289> we<00:01:46.289> started<00:01:46.829> thinking<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.399> making

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
paint we started thinking of making

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.809 
paint we started thinking of making
these<00:01:48.299> sculptures<00:01:48.630> as<00:01:48.959> paintings<00:01:49.679> so<00:01:50.459> I<00:01:50.490> cut

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
these sculptures as paintings so I cut

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.449 
these sculptures as paintings so I cut
carve<00:01:51.200> I'd<00:01:52.200> like<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.530> be<00:01:52.619> able<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.979> but<00:01:53.219> I<00:01:53.369> don't

00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:53.459 
carve I'd like to be able to but I don't

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:55.160 
carve I'd like to be able to but I don't
know<00:01:53.609> how<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.789> do<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.630> bones<00:01:54.840> give<00:01:55.079> you

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
know how to do it so the bones give you

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.449 
know how to do it so the bones give you
a<00:01:55.200> quick<00:01:55.789> fast<00:01:56.789> track<00:01:57.179> to<00:01:57.560> an<00:01:58.560> object<00:01:59.099> that<00:01:59.219> has

00:01:59.449 --> 00:01:59.459 
a quick fast track to an object that has

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:01.849 
a quick fast track to an object that has
a<00:01:59.700> lot<00:01:59.909> of<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.079> appearance<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.229> carving<00:02:01.679> and

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:01.859 
a lot of the appearance of a carving and

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:04.130 
a lot of the appearance of a carving and
to<00:02:02.700> get<00:02:02.849> that<00:02:02.939> at<00:02:03.060> their<00:02:03.209> fix<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.929> three

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
to get that at their fix of the three

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.440 
to get that at their fix of the three
dimensionality<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.979> by<00:02:05.700> layering<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.239> bones

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
dimensionality is by layering the bones

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.089 
dimensionality is by layering the bones
like<00:02:06.810> paintings<00:02:07.319> so<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.469> start<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.860> think<00:02:07.890> of

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
like paintings so I start to think of

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.729 
like paintings so I start to think of
like<00:02:08.250> undercoats<00:02:08.759> mid<00:02:09.569> coats<00:02:09.840> overcoats<00:02:10.470> and

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
like undercoats mid coats overcoats and

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.160 
like undercoats mid coats overcoats and
layering<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.579> bone<00:02:11.790> like<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.870> sort<00:02:13.140> of

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
layering the bone like it is a sort of

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.490 
layering the bone like it is a sort of
high-value<00:02:13.560> organic<00:02:14.489> paint<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:16.170> once<00:02:16.349> again

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
high-value organic paint and once again

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.710 
high-value organic paint and once again
I'm<00:02:16.709> trying<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.250> keep<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:17.940> human<00:02:18.239> hand<00:02:18.450> out<00:02:18.690> of

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
I'm trying to keep the human hand out of

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.839 
I'm trying to keep the human hand out of
the<00:02:18.870> work<00:02:19.049> so<00:02:19.799> it's<00:02:19.950> not<00:02:20.010> like<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.549> straight

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
the work so it's not like the straight
