00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:07.440
 hello people and I have been here too 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.130
 on youtube channel will everything possible 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.370
 About tears and nutrition and I became 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:19.500
 asked how to mist properly 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.060
 I was absolutely against dare 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.699
 because of it is just pointless my 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.090
 opinion there had to be something much more 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.970
 weighs as drives and when unmotivated 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.309
 is because you increase weight when you 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.219
 strength training does that on the 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.489
 nonsense because you take for the duel 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.250
 only with muscle in the way 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.430
 but still you try on 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:49.670
 extent and that's why I'm going today 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:01:09.330
 show how you can measure yourself correctly 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:01:12.510
 you have the first one here somehow 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:21.020
 entrepreneur stain and have you that you 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:21.020
 the names preferred to have longer 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:36.600
 77 burnt down therefore oriented 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.320
 I remember the object and I know that 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:44.479
 Always measure here in the same interview 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.920
 then we have to come to the thighs 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.180
 I also have the liver spot here 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.259
 that is why i will always go to the 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:55.079
 liver spot so definitely the 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.259
 widest part of the one you should 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:02.369
 measure and that is with me stands 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.680
 luckily a liver spot then I have 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.229
 here 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:21.840
 54 I'll just say it in the for now 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:23.790
 I also have myself here too 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.879
 then the object is something like us too 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.879
 to have 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:47.900
 ok now comes with it tremendously so you 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:49.970
 again, please, the travel agency 26 so 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:59.000
 So I here again strength training 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:03:01.700
 I used to think 38 years old 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:10.660
 and only by weight training today only 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:10.660
 even 27 jumps all weighted 27 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.800
 so important is not that here 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.690
 only your computer will then always the 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.820
 do not exercise that left with that 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:30.860
 your right only for example two kilo 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:34.000
 and on the left a kilo it should always be small 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:53.920
 functions are not the one 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:58.700
 others are so again so parts 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.930
 here and best you never to hers 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.930
 liver patch have it 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.829
 not slip with the dimensions then here 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.900
 becomes the widest part of the legs 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:12.489
 and the broad layers right here 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.829
 just over the upper arm 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.630
 I wish you much fun 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:19.820

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.620
 swiss rivals the stuhleck the 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.110
 looks at me work is always 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.740
 good to lie down just around 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:30.949
 are quite update to have but I like 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:38.630
