00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:05.200
 people what is going on and cordial 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.580
 welcome to another video and 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.240
 he sits down and I 'm back 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.730
 marcel at secondary market you are here 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.139
 workspace and yes I'm just one 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.290
 week with him must something 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:19.090
 tell 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.890
 and yes, we will probably be strong 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.720
 reallife all the time here you see 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.610
 now hardly any monitor on the status 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.840
 you with the main work area so 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.050
 must yes what we really do 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.670
 We will of course, much go out to 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.619
 has already two hours after start something 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.140
 So think this week is unfortunately 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.649
 sweaty so you can not do much 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.719
 do 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:41.440
 You can also see it on the table 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:43.539
 He still had a little extra 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.949
 electrical appliances on the table and yes that 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:46.629
 also our diet for the next 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.729
 week is probably the angle 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.170
 from tenant exactly that is the backup 

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:51.699
 monitor if somehow 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.159
 should fail here you see, by the way 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.859
 people how much I have explained on the 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:59.100
 you suddenly feel so completely 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:03.159
 exactly what was there, I think came here 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.809
 121 121 exactly I think overall I 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:08.140
 I am so over 500 I have more often 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.820
 reset that one so and exactly people 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.730
 So on friday will definitely the 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.530
 24 hours stream start with marcel 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.760
 together 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.780
 we will probably become us there 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:22.930
