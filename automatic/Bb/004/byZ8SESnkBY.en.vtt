it was this morning when I took it down
why<00:02:36.209> because<00:02:36.840> it<00:02:37.230> doesn't<00:02:37.560> have<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.680> lot<00:02:37.920> of

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
why because it doesn't have a lot of

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.759 
why because it doesn't have a lot of
hole<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.970> keep<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.570> stretch<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.230> it's<00:02:40.530> going

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
hole to keep the stretch so it's going

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.620 
hole to keep the stretch so it's going
to<00:02:40.920> shrink<00:02:41.190> plus<00:02:41.640> it's<00:02:41.850> kind<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.150> warm<00:02:42.390> outside

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
to shrink plus it's kind of warm outside

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.160 
to shrink plus it's kind of warm outside
so<00:02:43.560> all<00:02:43.860> of<00:02:44.040> those<00:02:44.190> factors<00:02:44.700> in<00:02:44.880> together<00:02:45.330> it's

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
so all of those factors in together it's

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.680 
so all of those factors in together it's
going<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.560> cause<00:02:46.860> it<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.580> shrink<00:02:48.030> is<00:02:48.209> not<00:02:48.450> going

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
going to cause it to shrink is not going

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.220 
going to cause it to shrink is not going
to<00:02:48.810> stay<00:02:49.050> straight<00:02:49.410> every<00:02:49.950> single<00:02:50.910> time<00:02:51.230> it

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
to stay straight every single time it

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.530 
to stay straight every single time it
doesn't<00:02:52.620> even<00:02:52.709> matter<00:02:53.010> every<00:02:53.910> time<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.180> come

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
doesn't even matter every time I come

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.920 
doesn't even matter every time I come
sit<00:02:54.780> here<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.140> record<00:02:58.519> this<00:02:59.519> happens<00:03:00.060> every

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
sit here and record this happens every

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.070 
sit here and record this happens every
single<00:03:01.680> time<00:03:01.860> I<00:03:02.310> wanted<00:03:03.269> to<00:03:03.360> come<00:03:03.660> back<00:03:03.810> and

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
single time I wanted to come back and

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.770 
single time I wanted to come back and
show<00:03:04.380> you<00:03:04.410> guys<00:03:04.769> a<00:03:05.250> few<00:03:05.580> hours<00:03:06.030> later<00:03:06.360> because

show you guys a few hours later because
when<00:03:06.959> I<00:03:07.019> went<00:03:07.320> out<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.620> house<00:03:07.829> I<00:03:08.130> definitely

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
when I went out the house I definitely

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.819 
when I went out the house I definitely
noticed<00:03:09.390> that<00:03:09.570> my<00:03:09.720> hair<00:03:10.019> was<00:03:10.290> starting<00:03:10.680> to

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
noticed that my hair was starting to

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.100 
noticed that my hair was starting to
shrink<00:03:11.190> I<00:03:11.489> don't<00:03:11.700> want<00:03:11.880> to<00:03:11.970> just<00:03:12.209> say<00:03:12.510> oh<00:03:12.840> it

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
shrink I don't want to just say oh it

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.140 
shrink I don't want to just say oh it
doesn't<00:03:13.170> have<00:03:13.440> a<00:03:13.530> lot<00:03:13.769> of<00:03:13.799> hole<00:03:14.100> and<00:03:14.549> then<00:03:14.970> not

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
doesn't have a lot of hole and then not

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.390 
doesn't have a lot of hole and then not
really<00:03:15.180> show<00:03:15.690> you<00:03:15.750> what<00:03:15.959> I<00:03:16.680> mean<00:03:17.220> by<00:03:17.370> that

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
really show you what I mean by that

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.699 
really show you what I mean by that
sometimes<00:03:18.269> in<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.510> summer<00:03:18.720> I<00:03:18.900> tend<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.440> come

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
sometimes in the summer I tend to come

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.520 
sometimes in the summer I tend to come
alike<00:03:20.150> you<00:03:21.150> know<00:03:21.299> just<00:03:21.600> letting<00:03:21.840> my<00:03:22.049> hair<00:03:22.260> do

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
alike you know just letting my hair do

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.800 
alike you know just letting my hair do
what<00:03:22.650> it<00:03:22.769> does<00:03:22.950> because<00:03:23.250> it's<00:03:23.730> very<00:03:23.910> humid<00:03:24.510> in

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
what it does because it's very humid in

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.199 
what it does because it's very humid in
this<00:03:25.079> part<00:03:25.410> of<00:03:25.650> Virginia<00:03:26.100> where<00:03:26.459> I<00:03:26.519> live<00:03:26.790> and

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
this part of Virginia where I live and

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.009 
this part of Virginia where I live and
trying<00:03:28.019> to<00:03:28.230> fight<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.709> humidity<00:03:29.810> kind<00:03:30.810> of

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
trying to fight the humidity kind of

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.840 
trying to fight the humidity kind of
sometimes<00:03:31.260> it's<00:03:31.739> pointless<00:03:32.130> because<00:03:32.640> it's

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
sometimes it's pointless because it's

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.360 
sometimes it's pointless because it's
going<00:03:33.120> to<00:03:33.180> happen<00:03:33.329> so<00:03:34.170> to<00:03:34.230> kind<00:03:34.739> of<00:03:34.799> just<00:03:35.010> go

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
going to happen so to kind of just go

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.400 
going to happen so to kind of just go
out<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:35.940> just<00:03:36.060> kind<00:03:36.299> of<00:03:36.359> live<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:37.109> just<00:03:37.170> let

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
out and just kind of live and just let

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.990 
out and just kind of live and just let
your<00:03:37.560> hair<00:03:37.769> do<00:03:37.980> what<00:03:38.100> it<00:03:38.220> does<00:03:38.400> but<00:03:38.730> it's<00:03:38.910> not

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
your hair do what it does but it's not

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.960 
your hair do what it does but it's not
going<00:03:39.329> to<00:03:39.390> be<00:03:39.540> dried<00:03:39.870> out<00:03:40.160> it's<00:03:41.160> great<00:03:41.549> because

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
going to be dried out it's great because

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.000 
going to be dried out it's great because
you<00:03:42.209> basically<00:03:42.480> need<00:03:43.079> doing<00:03:43.440> those<00:03:43.799> two

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
you basically need doing those two

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.789 
you basically need doing those two
strand<00:03:44.400> twist<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:45.090> bantu<00:03:45.959> knots<00:03:46.200> for<00:03:46.590> two

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
strand twist and bantu knots for two

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.940 
strand twist and bantu knots for two
days<00:03:47.010> waiting<00:03:47.640> for<00:03:47.790> it<00:03:47.880> to<00:03:47.970> dry<00:03:48.299> and<00:03:48.810> set<00:03:49.140> was

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
days waiting for it to dry and set was

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.780 
days waiting for it to dry and set was
pointless<00:03:51.380> it<00:03:52.380> was<00:03:52.650> pointless<00:03:53.040> because<00:03:53.519> this

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
pointless it was pointless because this

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.849 
pointless it was pointless because this
is<00:03:53.940> what<00:03:54.090> I<00:03:54.120> ended<00:03:54.510> up<00:03:54.630> with<00:03:54.690> so<00:03:55.290> I<00:03:55.320> really

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
is what I ended up with so I really

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.580 
is what I ended up with so I really
wasted<00:03:56.340> my<00:03:56.459> time<00:03:56.510> doing<00:03:57.510> two<00:03:57.930> strand<00:03:58.290> twists

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
wasted my time doing two strand twists

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.270 
wasted my time doing two strand twists
because<00:03:58.829> there's<00:03:59.340> not<00:04:00.079> hardly<00:04:01.079> any<00:04:01.470> hold<00:04:01.920> this

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
because there's not hardly any hold this

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.849 
because there's not hardly any hold this
product<00:04:02.750> which<00:04:03.750> is<00:04:03.930> great<00:04:04.260> it<00:04:04.380> doesn't<00:04:04.530> claim

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
product which is great it doesn't claim

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:08.449 
product which is great it doesn't claim
