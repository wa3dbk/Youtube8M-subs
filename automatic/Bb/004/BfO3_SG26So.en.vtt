00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
we got to see a different type of

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.330 
we got to see a different type of
engineer<00:01:49.539> and<00:01:49.780> different<00:01:50.739> thinking<00:01:51.099> than

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
engineer and different thinking than

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.419 
engineer and different thinking than
what<00:01:52.209> we<00:01:52.420> normally<00:01:52.599> do<00:01:53.140> on<00:01:53.349> a<00:01:53.380> wide<00:01:54.190> open

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
what we normally do on a wide open

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:55.760 
what we normally do on a wide open
development<00:01:54.880> project

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
development project

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.139 
development project
the<00:01:56.770> Tesla<00:01:57.039> engineers<00:01:57.489> have<00:01:57.670> a<00:01:57.729> different<00:01:58.060> way

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
the Tesla engineers have a different way

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.240 
the Tesla engineers have a different way
of<00:01:58.179> thinking<00:01:58.300> and<00:01:58.840> so<00:01:59.410> it<00:01:59.470> was<00:01:59.590> interesting<00:02:00.130> to

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
of thinking and so it was interesting to

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:07.449 
of thinking and so it was interesting to
see<00:02:00.280> how<00:02:01.179> they<00:02:01.360> do<00:02:01.420> problem-solving

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:12.320 

those<00:02:08.459> guys<00:02:08.670> are<00:02:09.259> really<00:02:10.259> smart<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:11.209> what<00:02:12.209> you

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
those guys are really smart and what you

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.150 
those guys are really smart and what you
find<00:02:12.599> is<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.959> guys<00:02:13.110> that<00:02:13.230> work<00:02:13.530> at<00:02:13.680> Tesla<00:02:13.920> not

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
find is the guys that work at Tesla not

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.740 
find is the guys that work at Tesla not
only<00:02:14.400> know<00:02:14.519> their<00:02:14.730> parts<00:02:15.120> but<00:02:15.540> they<00:02:15.599> know

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
only know their parts but they know

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.540 
only know their parts but they know

that<00:02:37.049> innovative<00:02:37.470> approach<00:02:38.280> how<00:02:38.549> is<00:02:38.730> Tesla

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
that innovative approach how is Tesla

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.880 
that innovative approach how is Tesla
moving<00:02:39.360> as<00:02:39.450> quickly<00:02:39.660> as<00:02:39.840> they<00:02:40.049> are<00:02:40.200> certainly

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
moving as quickly as they are certainly

moving as quickly as they are certainly
Tesla<00:02:41.310> has<00:02:41.489> shown<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.360> world<00:02:42.390> that<00:02:42.750> they

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
Tesla has shown to the world that they

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.449 
Tesla has shown to the world that they
are<00:02:43.049> very<00:02:43.319> capable<00:02:43.560> there<00:02:44.130> was<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.280> lot<00:02:44.430> of

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
are very capable there was a lot of

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.120 
are very capable there was a lot of
give-and-take<00:02:44.700> there's<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.569> lot<00:02:45.780> of<00:02:45.980> we<00:02:46.980> see

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
give-and-take there's a lot of we see

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.460 
give-and-take there's a lot of we see
how<00:02:47.280> they<00:02:47.430> do<00:02:47.489> things<00:02:47.819> and<00:02:48.180> vice-versa<00:02:49.049> and

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
how they do things and vice-versa and

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.920 
how they do things and vice-versa and
and<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:50.489> think<00:02:50.640> that<00:02:51.000> we're<00:02:51.450> all<00:02:51.630> we're<00:02:51.900> all

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
and and I think that we're all we're all

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:59.150 
and and I think that we're all we're all
better<00:02:52.349> for<00:02:52.709> this<00:02:52.890> experience<00:02:57.709> as<00:02:58.709> we<00:02:58.860> move

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
better for this experience as we move

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.680 
better for this experience as we move
through<00:02:59.370> development<00:02:59.849> I<00:02:59.970> think<00:03:00.209> we<00:03:00.360> started

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
through development I think we started

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.630 
through development I think we started
to<00:03:00.810> understand<00:03:01.319> each<00:03:01.500> other's<00:03:01.829> needs<00:03:02.069> and<00:03:02.459> in

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
to understand each other's needs and in

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.240 
to understand each other's needs and in
each<00:03:02.970> other's<00:03:03.599> areas<00:03:04.049> of<00:03:04.170> expertise<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:05.130> we

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
each other's areas of expertise and we

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.830 
each other's areas of expertise and we
kind<00:03:05.489> of<00:03:05.610> fed<00:03:05.790> on<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:06.329> it<00:03:06.390> helped<00:03:06.750> us

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
kind of fed on that and it helped us

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.630 
kind of fed on that and it helped us
move<00:03:07.079> this<00:03:07.290> project<00:03:07.560> along<00:03:07.980> fairly<00:03:08.400> quickly

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
move this project along fairly quickly

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.640 
move this project along fairly quickly
you<00:03:09.420> know<00:03:09.510> they<00:03:09.690> have<00:03:09.840> great<00:03:10.049> software

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
you know they have great software

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.080 
you know they have great software
development<00:03:11.130> there<00:03:11.310> and<00:03:11.459> from<00:03:11.579> there<00:03:11.730> we<00:03:11.940> were

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
development there and from there we were

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.020 
development there and from there we were
able<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.390> quickly<00:03:12.989> modify<00:03:13.769> our<00:03:14.310> software

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
able to quickly modify our software

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.970 
able to quickly modify our software
development<00:03:15.060> in<00:03:15.750> many<00:03:15.989> iterations<00:03:16.230> to

only do we have to reconsider the

only do we have to reconsider the

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
and did not need but then we can

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.939 
and did not need but then we can
consider<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.579> new<00:04:12.540> technology<00:04:13.049> and<00:04:13.079> the<00:04:13.350> new

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
engineers that worked on this it gave

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.500 
engineers that worked on this it gave
them<00:04:41.550> an<00:04:41.610> opportunity<00:04:41.700> to<00:04:42.270> really<00:04:42.330> think

outside<00:04:43.140> the<00:04:43.170> box<00:04:43.470> something<00:04:43.980> different<00:04:44.460> that

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
outside the box something different that

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.920 
outside the box something different that
you<00:04:44.580> don't<00:04:44.820> find<00:04:45.060> in<00:04:45.240> a<00:04:45.330> normal<00:04:45.660> vehicle

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
you don't find in a normal vehicle

development<00:04:46.500> and<00:04:47.280> I<00:04:47.370> think<00:04:47.610> that<00:04:47.760> was<00:04:47.910> great

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
development and I think that was great

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.960 
development and I think that was great
our<00:04:48.360> engineers<00:04:48.810> were<00:04:49.020> so<00:04:49.920> enthusiastic<00:04:50.250> so

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
our engineers were so enthusiastic so

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.340 
our engineers were so enthusiastic so
energetic<00:04:51.330> I'm<00:04:51.600> working<00:04:51.900> on<00:04:51.990> this<00:04:52.170> and<00:04:52.320> I

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
energetic I'm working on this and I

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.110 
energetic I'm working on this and I
think<00:04:52.380> they<00:04:52.650> did<00:04:52.710> a<00:04:52.860> heck<00:04:53.430> of<00:04:53.550> a<00:04:53.640> job<00:04:53.880> and

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
think they did a heck of a job and

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.610 
think they did a heck of a job and
working<00:04:54.420> together<00:04:54.540> with<00:04:54.810> Tesla<00:04:55.170> to<00:04:55.290> provide
