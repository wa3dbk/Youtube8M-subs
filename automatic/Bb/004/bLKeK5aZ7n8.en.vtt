shape that I put on the ends of mine it

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.730 
shape that I put on the ends of mine it
doesn't<00:01:55.570> really<00:01:55.660> matter<00:01:55.900> you<00:01:56.020> can<00:01:56.229> do<00:01:56.350> a<00:01:56.380> long

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
doesn't really matter you can do a long

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.990 
doesn't really matter you can do a long

I<00:01:58.030> like<00:01:58.869> this<00:01:59.020> short<00:01:59.320> paper<00:01:59.560> because<00:01:59.890> it

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
I like this short paper because it

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.500 
I like this short paper because it
leaves<00:02:00.220> it<00:02:00.369> fat<00:02:00.640> and<00:02:00.850> I<00:02:00.910> can<00:02:01.060> still<00:02:01.300> put<00:02:01.479> a

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
leaves it fat and I can still put a

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.859 
leaves it fat and I can still put a
fastener<00:02:02.110> in<00:02:02.290> here<00:02:02.530> at<00:02:02.619> the<00:02:02.740> end<00:02:03.540> if<00:02:04.540> you<00:02:04.630> get<00:02:04.840> a

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
fastener in here at the end if you get a

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.140 
fastener in here at the end if you get a
too<00:02:05.140> thin<00:02:05.530> you<00:02:05.890> put<00:02:06.130> a<00:02:06.160> fastener<00:02:06.670> in<00:02:06.820> here<00:02:07.030> it

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
too thin you put a fastener in here it

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.150 
too thin you put a fastener in here it
just<00:02:07.300> splits<00:02:07.660> it<00:02:07.840> so<00:02:09.330> yeah<00:02:10.560> anyways<00:02:11.560> this<00:02:11.860> will

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
just splits it so yeah anyways this will

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.720 
just splits it so yeah anyways this will
be<00:02:12.280> dry<00:02:12.520> in<00:02:12.550> a<00:02:13.150> couple<00:02:13.630> minutes<00:02:14.320> here<00:02:14.620> or<00:02:15.220> tacky

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
be dry in a couple minutes here or tacky

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.380 
be dry in a couple minutes here or tacky
in<00:02:16.000> a<00:02:16.030> couple<00:02:16.270> minutes<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.720> I'll<00:02:16.870> put<00:02:17.200> it<00:02:17.260> on
