00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
because it's inconvenient to do that

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.380 
because it's inconvenient to do that
it'll<00:00:38.010> take<00:00:38.219> up<00:00:38.370> too<00:00:38.489> much<00:00:38.520> inventory<00:00:38.910> space

and it's greatly annoying i have a

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.030 
and it's greatly annoying i have a
feeling<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.140> question<00:00:43.500> will<00:00:43.649> be<00:00:43.680> asked

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
feeling that that question will be asked

a<00:00:44.100> lot<00:00:44.219> on<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.489> video<00:00:44.820> therefore<00:00:45.329> i<00:00:45.360> figured

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
a lot on this video therefore i figured

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.690 
a lot on this video therefore i figured
i'd<00:00:45.750> just<00:00:45.899> answer<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.620> video<00:00:46.890> now<00:00:47.640> the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
i'd just answer in the video now the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.490 
i'd just answer in the video now the
reason<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.360> i<00:00:48.480> recommend<00:00:48.930> buying<00:00:49.230> these

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
reason that i recommend buying these

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.200 
reason that i recommend buying these
with<00:00:49.739> carm<00:00:50.010> instead<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.550> actually<00:00:50.879> spending

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
with carm instead of actually spending

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.180 
with carm instead of actually spending
the<00:00:51.329> four<00:00:51.600> silver<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.079> takes<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.469> buy<00:00:52.680> them<00:00:52.980> is

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
the four silver it takes to buy them is

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.520 
the four silver it takes to buy them is
because<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.239> will<00:00:54.449> save<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.719> lot<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:55.199> money

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
because you will save a lot of money

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.010 
because you will save a lot of money

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
doing so and karma just is not that hard

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.650 
doing so and karma just is not that hard
to<00:00:58.079> get<00:00:58.379> each<00:00:59.100> time<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.670> complete<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.210> daily

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.969 
380 k karma just stashed up from all of
the<00:01:36.509> events<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.020> constantly<00:01:37.500> do<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.890> I

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
the events that I constantly do and I

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.679 
the events that I constantly do and I
just<00:01:38.159> have<00:01:38.310> really<00:01:38.520> nothing<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.210> do<00:01:39.360> with<00:01:39.540> it

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
just have really nothing to do with it

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.539 
just have really nothing to do with it
so<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.290> have<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> feeling<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.070> lot<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.430> other

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
so I have a feeling that a lot of other

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.160 
so I have a feeling that a lot of other
people<00:01:41.759> out<00:01:41.970> there<00:01:42.240> will<00:01:42.420> have<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.899> similar

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
people out there will have the similar

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.289 
people out there will have the similar
not<00:01:44.009> an<00:01:44.189> issue<00:01:44.430> but<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:45.090> similar<00:01:46.729> big<00:01:47.729> stash<00:01:48.060> of

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
not an issue but a similar big stash of

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.389 
not an issue but a similar big stash of
karma<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.720> guess<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.079> could<00:01:49.229> say<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.710> if<00:01:50.280> you

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
karma I guess you could say and if you

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.490 
karma I guess you could say and if you
do<00:01:50.549> have<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.759> big<00:01:50.939> stash<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.360> karma<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.869> I

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
do have a big stash of karma I I

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.710 
do have a big stash of karma I I
strongly<00:01:53.040> recommend<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.700> do<00:01:54.000> use<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.509> to

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
strongly recommend you do use that to

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.530 
strongly recommend you do use that to
buy<00:01:54.899> these<00:01:55.710> two<00:01:55.979> different<00:01:56.329> gathering<00:01:57.329> tools

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
buy these two different gathering tools

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.870 
buy these two different gathering tools
because<00:01:58.350> if<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.619> do<00:01:58.799> you'll<00:01:59.100> wind<00:01:59.340> up<00:01:59.460> saving

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
because if you do you'll wind up saving

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.120 
because if you do you'll wind up saving
a<00:02:00.000> ton<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.540> money<00:02:00.869> in<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.229> long<00:02:01.469> run<00:02:01.500> I've

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
a ton of money in the long run I've

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.340 
a ton of money in the long run I've
probably<00:02:02.490> saved<00:02:02.909> about<00:02:03.090> four<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.719> five<00:02:03.750> gold

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
probably saved about four to five gold

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.530 
probably saved about four to five gold
from<00:02:04.619> buying<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.460> gathering<00:02:05.850> tools<00:02:06.060> with<00:02:06.360> my

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
from buying the gathering tools with my

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.600 
from buying the gathering tools with my
karma<00:02:07.020> rather<00:02:07.590> than<00:02:07.799> actually<00:02:08.280> spending

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
karma rather than actually spending

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.210 
karma rather than actually spending
money<00:02:08.879> on<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.270> because<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:10.319> know<00:02:10.440> for<00:02:10.830> silver

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
money on it because you know for silver

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.970 
money on it because you know for silver
for<00:02:11.430> 100<00:02:11.849> uses<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.540> blow

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
for 100 uses and you blow

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.880 
for 100 uses and you blow
3<00:02:13.099> 100<00:02:13.550> use<00:02:13.730> is<00:02:13.940> extremely<00:02:14.599> fast<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:15.200> mean<00:02:15.739> in
