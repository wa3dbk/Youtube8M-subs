 do you think so or do you change right? 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.549
 or else you stay there for no more 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.860
 is complicated and expensive because it is 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:51.670
 complicated if you see some things in the 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.470
 youtube you see you do 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.500

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.200
