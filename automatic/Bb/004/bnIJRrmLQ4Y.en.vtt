00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.109
this is mike levine from pickup trucks
com and we're here at fords proving

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.519
grounds and Romeo Michigan to test five
trucks that cost thirty thousand dollars

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:12.570
or less

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.060
we have the chevy silverado 1500 the
toyota tundra the nissan titan the ram

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.480
1500 and the ford f150 we put the trucks
through several tests

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.170
first we put a thousand pounds of
ballast in their cargo boxes and measure

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.789
them up at seven percent great

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.540
next we put them through a timed ride
and handling course

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.890
and finally we measured 60 mile an hour
2 0 breaking

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:47.550
let's take a look at our top three
finishers in third place is 2011 ford

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.579
f150 regular cab with a new 5-liter v8

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.149
this was a difficult decision because
while the f-150 an excellent

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.530
acceleration numbers

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.280
the best fuel economy

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.329
and tons of community timers

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.480
couldn't overlook the fact that this
truck wouldn't carry as many passengers

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.430
as we might need training space for
content doesn't make sense to us and for

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.240
thirty thousand dollars we want a few
functional trade-offs as possible

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.240
wishing for a super cab f-150 instead

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.189
in second place is a 2011 toyota tundra
double cab with a 5.7 liter v8 the

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.640
tender was well-equipped has tested and
posted excellent performance numbers

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.729
even when loaded with a thousand pounds
of ballast in the cargo box

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.679
we think the tundra we tested is a very
good ratio of content capability for the

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:37.250
money that we wish it had better fuel
economy and an updated instrument panel

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:45.289
in first place after long and hard
fought battle is a 2011 ram 1500 quad

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:50.630
cab with a 5.7 liter Hemi VA hands down
the half-ton ram offer the best

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.670
combination of fuel economy carrying
capacity performance interior room and

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.600
value

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.100
we especially liked all the power
features and the spray in bed liner and

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.390
although it's not perfect

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.950
the ram 1500 did offer the most bang for
our buck solidly competing in most of

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.950
our testing categories

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.770
so there you have a part top three
finishers in a very different type of

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.090
character

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.480
the good news is you can still get
creature comforts enough seating and

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.030
solid truck capability for thirty
thousand dollars

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.720
unfortunately the challenging news is
that if you're locked into that price

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.390
point there will be some very nice
options and capabilities

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.470
you're likely have to do without
