already<00:00:23.970> have<00:00:24.119> so<00:00:24.359> our<00:00:24.480> shock<00:00:24.720> absorbers

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
already have so our shock absorbers

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.640 
already have so our shock absorbers
obviously<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.619> singles<00:00:26.010> doubles<00:00:26.220> gnana<00:00:27.090> just

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
performance area so we've had a lot of

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.780 
performance area so we've had a lot of
requests<00:00:33.750> from<00:00:33.840> dealers<00:00:34.739> consumers<00:00:35.550> or

distributors everybody's saying you know
can<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:37.920> pair<00:00:38.340> your<00:00:38.610> shock<00:00:38.940> absorbers<00:00:39.480> and

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
can you pair your shock absorbers and

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.420 
can you pair your shock absorbers and
spring<00:00:40.020> combinations<00:00:40.620> with<00:00:40.829> some<00:00:41.010> fabricated

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
spring combinations with some fabricated

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.819 
spring combinations with some fabricated
components<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:42.809> in<00:00:42.930> January<00:00:43.350> we<00:00:43.469> kind<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.710> went

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
components so in January we kind of went

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.279 
components so in January we kind of went
back<00:00:44.010> my<00:00:44.910> luck<00:00:45.180> would<00:00:45.329> have<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.510> we<00:00:45.750> purchased

back my luck would have it we purchased

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.290 
back my luck would have it we purchased
a<00:00:46.469> fabrication<00:00:47.370> facility<00:00:47.879> right<00:00:47.969> next<00:00:48.270> door

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
a fabrication facility right next door

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.049 
a fabrication facility right next door
to<00:00:48.420> us<00:00:48.539> about<00:00:48.719> 12,000<00:00:49.469> square<00:00:49.649> foot<00:00:49.920> we<00:00:50.910> also

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
to us about 12,000 square foot we also

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.029 
to us about 12,000 square foot we also
acquired<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.690> Edelbrock<00:00:52.260> suspension<00:00:52.890> line

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
acquired the Edelbrock suspension line

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.950 
acquired the Edelbrock suspension line
and<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.579> cap<00:00:53.789> on<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.000> mortal<00:00:54.270> suspension<00:00:54.780> line

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
and the cap on a mortal suspension line

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.170 
and the cap on a mortal suspension line
that<00:00:55.829> allowed<00:00:56.010> us<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.340> kind<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.640> branch<00:00:56.910> out

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
that allowed us that kind of branch out

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.170 
that allowed us that kind of branch out

putting a huge emphasis on we brought in
some<00:01:37.530> more<00:01:37.710> engineering<00:01:38.400> staff<00:01:39.650> making<00:01:40.650> sure

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
some more engineering staff making sure

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.620 
some more engineering staff making sure
that<00:01:41.100> we<00:01:41.189> put<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.430> focus<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:42.030> building<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.479> best

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630
