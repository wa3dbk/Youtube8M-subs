00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.290
 hello how about friends of the bargaining process Carlos four times per 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.240
 the East 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.020
 this video 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.210
 and well, I'm responding to nothing 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.590
 some people who for some time already of the state asking 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.470
 percent 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.370
 two programs one that is the clone of dd 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.520
 I can understand 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.520
 that these two together are good for 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.030
 to burn a movie 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.700
 the original movie 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.700
 take away all the restrictions to be able to clone the 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.530
 but good yo 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.550
 and I found a program to play it since I arrived as consultants 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.220
 videos on youtube about the duty of clones 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.510
 seven points 20 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.290
 percent 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.290
 I know what will happen on cable 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.170
 because there is for me it is easier to have it to walk face that I walk 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.170
 nor looking for us to arrive 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.560
 and well I will pass the one of collapse 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.560
 so you can make your movie copies 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.560
 they have already been mounted once they bring restriction 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.730
 with padlock 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.939
 josé mo do not bring 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.440
 after the jump 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.250
 the copy this movie 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.250
 percent the lynx leave in the description of the video 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.640
 so you can download it 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.640
 these will pass a long file 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.110
 i darker since they are there then 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.110
 two download wait a few seconds 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.240
 you do me right now we're all going like 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.579
 and well I recommend this program because I was made 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:11.649
 Program 

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:13.219
 very good 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:14.660
 and you do not have to 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.449
 install 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:19.339
 two programs 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:22.949
 the interpreter to have the restriction removed 

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:26.299
 and the clone to sell to make the copy 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.809
 and good this program the duty of thrones seven points 20 in its portable version 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:33.979
 does exactly the same one more than 

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:36.639
 do both 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:39.629
 in one only one must have interest 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:40.459
 installed 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:41.869
 have to install 

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:43.939
 the two programs these 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:45.949
 I mentioned them 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:50.949
 once past the 15 the 25 the seconds that it asks 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:52.099
 Wolf 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.969
 they keep the uar / file 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:56.819
 they wait for this 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.819
 is the necessary time that you ask for this depends 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.530
 the honesty of his flesh 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.089
 that have 

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:07.529
 I canceled it because it constitutes something whatever it is here 

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:11.339
 and good to open a file so try 

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:15.979
 since they have the right tic and decompress it pipones bring here and be able 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:18.179
 bring in must detonate 

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:19.969
 I put it is to bring here 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:22.789
 and he's going to bring you a folder 

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:24.709
 what is this 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.859
 since the penalty after they open it 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.509
 and here comes the 

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:30.129
 the application 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:35.029
 they simply give you double click or right click and run as administrator 

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:37.759
 and wait for it to open 

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.759
 as you can see here is the program 

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:44.639
 here is the moma movex press 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:48.249
 the model express easier and simpler to use because it simply 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:51.939
 they give you a click here tablet opens your tray 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:57.119
 to insert the disc inserted mestre of their babies 

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:59.189
 original movie 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:01.699
 i the lec and fell protection 

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:05.729
 He begins to follow the steps that must be followed in which he feels 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.349
 and to this one 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.349
 the moment came when he asked them to 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.000
 insert a blank disk 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.699
 he expelled him 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:18.919
 the original and asks them to insert the blank disk 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.830
 publish as you want to call 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.849
 and at the same time that they insert the disk in white because 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.659
 start paying 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:29.789
 to create a copy 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:33.099
 percent in expert mode because that will be a bit 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.099
 here is copied from baby 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:41.400
 the film from to a little green is like the mode després 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:47.479
 is to combine two movies still only should 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:50.779
 this is the truth, not what 

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:52.939
 do not embellish me as 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:54.840
 honestly not 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.320
 not only can it be explained as fast as undoubted samples 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:02.349
 This is when you already have a 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.229
 gómez c a movie already 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.249
 it is a more lethal Antillean computer 

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:13.499
 and here they choose where this film wants to work 

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:15.870
 here the music 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.029
 the movie file 

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:19.289
 let's hold 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:21.090
 it's no longer valid because 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.370
 ii to the company put the disk p 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.599
 blank and the company 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:28.589
 he has recorded 

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:31.400
 percent tragsa 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.719
 good to put it in Spanish I've seen or some 

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:37.800
 as there are not as two or three videos where 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.219
 says you can not put in Spanish 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:42.960
 but you can speculate more than a thousand click here 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.719
 to this 

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:46.729
 this button 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:48.589
 ileana Spanish 

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:52.069
 the pp finished well in English but he proposes you Spanish 

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:54.879
 if it's easier 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:57.279
 and you are already going to espanyol 

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:00.189
 so that employment is a bit more here as you see 

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:01.749
 he already says he loves 

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:03.080
 percent 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.099
 on hard disk the movie 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:07.279
 it will be a green tea 

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:10.479
 this is copying from a bp movie to 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:12.589
 to a disk 

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:15.089
 and this is to combine 12 st 

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:18.069
 two movies still not only should 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:20.490
 good as I repeat them p 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:21.960
 It is very easy to use 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.770
 they really do not have much 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.080
 complication av 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.080
 I recommend you press for faster 

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:32.830
 because here simply as I said 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.830
 insert the original movie you want to burn 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:38.009
 i 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:40.759
 and let's hope that the last 

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:44.939
 it takes a certain time villa after the peace to catch nothing more 

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:46.180
 he expels her 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.180
 and asks them for a disc or blank source 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.499
 to be able to do it 

00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:52.599
 the copy 

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:55.999
 and it's all a simpleton are very simple steps 

00:06:55.999 --> 00:07:00.279
 and then the stars of this team to learn a little more to use it 

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:01.300
 there 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.389
 check the internet in a moment 

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:05.580
 minute moments 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.029
 I just simply passed them to him 

00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:10.029
 and if we are seeing 

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:11.809
 in another video 

00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:12.779
 i 

00:07:12.779 --> 00:07:13.509
 until next time
