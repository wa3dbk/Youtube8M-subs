00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:07.080
 hello guys welcome to my channel let's go 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.330
 to do a makeup tutorial 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.610
 super intense but as you can see it's very 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.620
 elegant and the rest of the face is very 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.379
 softly let's start in the eyes 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.370
 preparing us with a primer so that 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.470
 shadows last longer and no folds are made 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:24.020
 we will go on to create our first base 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.180
 of color I will use a color first 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.500
 of es click in brown color and 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.300
 I will apply it all over the mobile eyelid 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.370
 blurring it with the fingers is that the 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.070
 banana 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.080
 let's spend the first shadow we take 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.640
 a tip pencil volleyball brush 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.800
 tip of a pen we are going to take a shadow 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.660
 brown mocha let's start to apply it 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.220
 on the outside of the eye and we 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.140
 we will center a little halfway 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.910
 of the mobile eyelid leaving in the area 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.250
 internal totally free of product 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.560
 blur the edge the cut to start 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.200
 to control the color intensifies everything 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.030
 you want, let's start creating a 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.760
 kind of triangle exit the part 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.350
 external to be our basis for 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.940
 the eyeliner that we will apply a little more 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.559
 ahead 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.420
 little by little you go applying and going 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.780
 blurring to be able to control the 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.780
 colour 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.460
 let's move on to pick up a little bit of tone 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.619
 more clarito of the same range and we're going 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.479
 to use to blur the cut to 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.909
 start creating a more gradient 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.130
 uniform 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.840
 once we have this well created we go 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.359
 to catch the first black shadow is a 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.920
 shadow that has a little bristle and 

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:28.850
 let's start creating our eyeliner 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.290
 on the outside and blur we've 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.900
 conformed ascending 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.030
 little by little and blur as you go 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.640
 applying we are going to take a shadow 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.490
 rosita to create a gradient for all 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.630
 the upper zone and intensifies a 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.630
 little bit more if you feel like it 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.350
 and with a matte shadow we are going to give the 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.140
 point of light in the upper area 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.510
 reaching the arch of the eyebrow we have already 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.730
 finishing that is easy and everything is true 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.110
 let's give the lighting touch that 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.060
 I have done that we have left free in the 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.170
 mobile eyelid the inner part using 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.170
 a golden shadow 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.770
 we take the same shadow that we have used 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.170
 at the beginning and we will apply it to lenny's 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.760
 eyelash fair not up to the inter 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.120
 to the inner zone leaving a little 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.709
 free the inner zone and we're going to give the 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.470
 intense touch on the water line 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.380
 applying a brown pencil resistant to 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.080
 water we think the eyelashes and apply 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.150
 our favorite mask one or two layers 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.590
 but we are going to apply tabs 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.170
 false is that you do not worry 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.390
 will be much more intense make your eyebrows 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.670
 with your pencil or your favorite shade 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.250
 and we move to a face first apply a 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.770
 prebase was to use a pass of water 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.250
 so that it lasts longer in summer and then you 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.040
 favorite base 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.520
 and until I'm going to wear it withstands sweat 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.260
 there is the touch was written and applied 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.630
 in the forehead area in the line of 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.010
 neck and do not forget we went to 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.960
 corrector 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.050
 one to cover the eye area 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.640
 and also to cover the imperfections 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.530
 and with a more clear corrector we are going to 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.780
 use above the cheekbones as a touch of 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.700
 lighting if you need a little bit of 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.080
 integration uses the base the brush that 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.080
 have you used for the base for the most 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.880
 integral and would be the face are not the 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.190
 translucent powders to give us 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.500
 color and we went to apply the blusher 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.970
 we have also done it is going to be very natural 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.150
