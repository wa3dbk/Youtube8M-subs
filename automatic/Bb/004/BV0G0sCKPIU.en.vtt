00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
champions as well as the brook heads one

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.620 
champions as well as the brook heads one
of<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.490> things<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.790> was<00:01:35.880> really<00:01:36.119> important

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
of the things that was really important

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.230 
of the things that was really important
for<00:01:36.780> us<00:01:36.869> was<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.740> we<00:01:37.799> offered<00:01:38.310> both<00:01:38.549> shoes<00:01:38.970> in

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
for us was that we offered both shoes in

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.270 
for us was that we offered both shoes in
both<00:01:39.420> men's<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.780> women's<00:01:39.900> sizes<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.070> think

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
both men's and women's sizes and I think

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.550 
both men's and women's sizes and I think
that<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.790> general<00:01:42.360> or<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:42.720> history<00:01:42.900> I<00:01:43.470> think

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
that in general or in history I think

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.940 
that in general or in history I think
that<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.670> champion<00:01:45.290> seemed<00:01:46.290> like<00:01:46.530> more<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.920> a

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
that the champion seemed like more of a

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.430 
that the champion seemed like more of a
women's<00:01:47.460> shoe<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.180> as<00:01:48.509> Pro<00:01:48.720> cast<00:01:48.930> seemed<00:01:49.229> like

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
women's shoe and as Pro cast seemed like

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.050 
women's shoe and as Pro cast seemed like
more<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.830> men's<00:01:50.039> shoe<00:01:50.369> but<00:01:50.580> I<00:01:50.610> think<00:01:50.909> in

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
more of a men's shoe but I think in

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.710 
more of a men's shoe but I think in
reality<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.799> company's<00:01:53.190> history

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
reality and in the company's history

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.710 
reality and in the company's history
you've<00:01:54.720> seen<00:01:55.080> both<00:01:55.619> worn<00:01:56.039> by<00:01:56.250> by<00:01:57.210> men<00:01:57.509> and

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
women and that was really important to

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.670 
women and that was really important to
bring<00:01:59.789> out<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.240> collection<00:02:00.590> we<00:02:01.590> were
