00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
it's Colt is his first name so we get a

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.190 
it's Colt is his first name so we get a
first<00:03:53.940> and<00:03:54.090> goal<00:03:54.150> and<00:03:54.510> Mayer<00:03:54.720> EOTech

scrambles it in I'm happy I put Mariota
in<00:03:57.840> because<00:03:58.590> actually<00:03:58.950> starting<00:03:59.250> in<00:03:59.340> real

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
in because actually starting in real

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.430 
in because actually starting in real
life<00:03:59.640> now<00:03:59.850> so<00:04:00.030> that's<00:04:00.180> pretty<00:04:00.390> cool<00:04:00.570> through

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
life now so that's pretty cool through

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.410 
life now so that's pretty cool through
two<00:04:01.590> games<00:04:01.830> in<00:04:02.070> real<00:04:02.250> life<00:04:02.430> there<00:04:02.670> -<00:04:02.790> no<00:04:03.000> happy

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
two games in real life there - no happy

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.290 
two games in real life there - no happy
about<00:04:03.480> that<00:04:04.010> but<00:04:05.010> I<00:04:05.070> think<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.459> big<00:04:05.700> play<00:04:06.000> at

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
about that but I think the big play at

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.810 
about that but I think the big play at
the<00:04:06.390> start<00:04:06.660> of<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:06.810> fourth<00:04:07.310> big<00:04:08.310> play<00:04:08.519> all<00:04:08.730> the

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
the start of the fourth big play all the

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.630 
the start of the fourth big play all the
way<00:04:08.910> down<00:04:09.120> inside<00:04:09.480> the<00:04:09.600> 10th<00:04:09.870> 3rd<00:04:10.170> and<00:04:10.350> goal<00:04:10.640> we

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
way down inside the 10th 3rd and goal we

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.190 
way down inside the 10th 3rd and goal we
get<00:04:11.760> to<00:04:11.880> stop<00:04:12.150> I<00:04:12.330> believe<00:04:12.600> that<00:04:12.810> pass<00:04:12.989> is

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
get to stop I believe that pass is

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.610 
get to stop I believe that pass is
tipped<00:04:13.850> so<00:04:14.850> focusing<00:04:15.360> goal<00:04:15.600> or<00:04:16.169> force<00:04:16.470> the

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
tipped so focusing goal or force the

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.610 
tipped so focusing goal or force the
field<00:04:16.859> goal<00:04:17.160> and<00:04:17.450> not<00:04:18.450> get<00:04:18.600> through<00:04:18.810> so<00:04:19.470> it's

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
field goal and not get through so it's

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.800 
field goal and not get through so it's
nice<00:04:19.830> 17<00:04:20.400> 17<00:04:20.910> I<00:04:21.030> didn't<00:04:21.239> think<00:04:21.299> this<00:04:21.479> game<00:04:21.660> was

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
nice 17 17 I didn't think this game was

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.719
