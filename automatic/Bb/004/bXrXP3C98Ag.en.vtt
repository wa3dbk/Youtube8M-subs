00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.350 
she finds out I think that triggers a
reaction<00:01:59.770> of<00:01:59.829> sorts<00:02:00.130> how<00:02:00.819> do<00:02:00.880> I<00:02:01.000> talk<00:02:01.060> about

hasn't Callie moved on I think she's

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.970 
hasn't Callie moved on I think she's
trying<00:02:11.440> and<00:02:11.799> I<00:02:11.950> think<00:02:12.250> that<00:02:12.430> she's<00:02:12.700> um<00:02:13.060> I<00:02:13.980> think

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
trying and I think that she's um I think

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.070 
trying and I think that she's um I think
that<00:02:15.370> she<00:02:15.879> is<00:02:15.910> this<00:02:16.269> is<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.540> mother<00:02:16.720> of<00:02:16.959> her

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
that she is this is the mother of her

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.100 
that she is this is the mother of her
child<00:02:17.349> I<00:02:17.709> think<00:02:18.069> that<00:02:18.340> this<00:02:18.580> has<00:02:18.790> been<00:02:19.780> a<00:02:19.870> very

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
child I think that this has been a very

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.410 
child I think that this has been a very
difficult<00:02:20.670> process<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:21.700> go<00:02:21.970> through<00:02:22.269> the

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
difficult process to go through the

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.900 
difficult process to go through the
process<00:02:22.599> of<00:02:23.049> separation<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:24.010> trying<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.400> find

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
process of separation and trying to find

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.789 
process of separation and trying to find
yourself<00:02:25.390> again<00:02:25.690> and<00:02:26.049> what<00:02:26.290> makes<00:02:26.470> you<00:02:26.590> tick

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
a chapter is closing in a sense yeah for

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.500 
a chapter is closing in a sense yeah for
me<00:05:31.250> personally<00:05:31.580> I<00:05:31.850> can't<00:05:32.030> speak<00:05:32.210> for<00:05:32.300> anybody

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
me personally I can't speak for anybody

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.270 
me personally I can't speak for anybody
else<00:05:32.780> but<00:05:32.870> for<00:05:33.139> me<00:05:33.290> yes<00:05:33.530> and<00:05:33.860> part<00:05:34.100> of<00:05:34.220> the

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
else but for me yes and part of the

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.770 
else but for me yes and part of the
reason<00:05:34.490> is<00:05:34.610> because<00:05:34.760> I<00:05:35.030> started<00:05:35.479> watching<00:05:35.570> the

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
reason is because I started watching the

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.810 
reason is because I started watching the
show<00:05:35.810> because<00:05:36.260> of<00:05:36.440> she's<00:05:37.190> one<00:05:37.340> of<00:05:37.400> the<00:05:37.460> reasons

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
show because of she's one of the reasons

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.150 
show because of she's one of the reasons
that<00:05:38.090> I<00:05:38.240> started<00:05:38.540> watching<00:05:38.690> the<00:05:38.960> show<00:05:39.040> so<00:05:40.040> it

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
that I started watching the show so it

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.879 
that I started watching the show so it
feels<00:05:40.400> like<00:05:40.639> an<00:05:40.910> era<00:05:41.510> has<00:05:41.840> ended<00:05:41.870> or<00:05:42.530> something

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
feels like an era has ended or something

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:45.010 
feels like an era has ended or something
it<00:05:43.070> does<00:05:43.220> feel<00:05:43.460> like<00:05:43.490> a<00:05:43.639> new<00:05:43.850> chapter<00:05:44.090> and
