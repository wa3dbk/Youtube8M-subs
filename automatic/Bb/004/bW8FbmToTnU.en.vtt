I'll post links below and so how about
we<00:00:18.390> just<00:00:18.420> start<00:00:19.400> with<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.490> one<00:00:20.520> what<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:20.910> can

eco-drive<00:00:25.699> Divus<00:00:26.730> Professional<00:00:27.240> Darts<00:00:27.359> watch

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
eco-drive Divus Professional Darts watch

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.720 
eco-drive Divus Professional Darts watch
which<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.170> echo<00:00:28.320> Zilla<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.830> let's<00:00:29.550> just

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
which is the echo Zilla and let's just

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.049 
which is the echo Zilla and let's just
make<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.939> comparison<00:00:30.769> to<00:00:31.769> let's<00:00:32.309> say<00:00:32.489> okay<00:00:32.940> this

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
make a comparison to let's say okay this

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.080 
make a comparison to let's say okay this
is<00:00:33.149> Louie<00:00:33.300> zero<00:00:34.280> so<00:00:35.280> let's<00:00:35.489> just<00:00:35.670> compare<00:00:35.969> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
is Louie zero so let's just compare the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.360 
is Louie zero so let's just compare the
size<00:00:37.160> okay<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:39.559> then<00:00:40.559> my<00:00:40.800> new<00:00:40.980> favorite

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
size okay and then my new favorite

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.069 
size okay and then my new favorite
watches<00:00:42.020> do<00:00:43.020> migas<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.520> 300m<00:00:45.030> so<00:00:45.780> both

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
watches do migas so this is 300m so both

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.900 
watches do migas so this is 300m so both
are<00:00:46.289> divers<00:00:46.530> watches<00:00:46.680> three<00:00:47.460> higher<00:00:47.610> meters

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
are divers watches three higher meters

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.850 
are divers watches three higher meters
but<00:00:48.480> obviously<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:48.930> can<00:00:49.079> see<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.500> difference

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
but obviously you can see the difference

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.150 
but obviously you can see the difference
in<00:00:50.329> size<00:00:51.649> comparing<00:00:52.649> them<00:00:53.420> okay<00:00:54.420> then<00:00:55.160> let's

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
in size comparing them okay then let's

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.439 
in size comparing them okay then let's
just<00:00:56.280> compare<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.739> two<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.770> psycho<00:00:59.309> v<00:00:59.850> FK<00:01:00.149> and

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
just compare the two the psycho v FK and

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.520 
just compare the two the psycho v FK and
kinetic<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:02.329> again<00:01:03.329> divers<00:01:03.809> watches<00:01:03.989> both

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
kinetic and again divers watches both

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.280 
kinetic and again divers watches both
this<00:01:04.920> one<00:01:05.070> 200<00:01:05.460> meters<00:01:05.670> kinetic<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:07.110> one

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
this one 200 meters kinetic and this one

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.200 
this one 200 meters kinetic and this one
quartz<00:01:08.270> again<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.360> see<00:01:09.570> 3<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:09.960> M<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.260> more<00:01:11.210> Phil

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
quartz again you see 3 on M is more Phil

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.480 
quartz again you see 3 on M is more Phil
Gramm<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:13.260> one<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.530> more<00:01:13.920> bulky<00:01:14.430> in

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
Gramm and this one is more bulky in

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.590 
Gramm and this one is more bulky in
bigger<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.390> heavier<00:01:16.280> then<00:01:17.280> we<00:01:18.060> can<00:01:18.210> compare

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
bigger and heavier then we can compare

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.560 
bigger and heavier then we can compare
to<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.200> sir<00:01:19.650> Tina<00:01:22.460> again<00:01:23.460> 200<00:01:24.119> meters<00:01:24.299> this

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
to the sir Tina again 200 meters this

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.630 
to the sir Tina again 200 meters this
one<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.780> course<00:01:24.990> again<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:26.220> again<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.520> can

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
one of course again and again you can

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.929 
one of course again and again you can
see<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:27.680> bigger<00:01:28.680> than<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.040> Omega<00:01:30.860> then

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
see it's bigger than the Omega then

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.100 
see it's bigger than the Omega then
that's<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.060> classic

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
that's a classic

you and again you can see it's bigger

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.219 
you and again you can see it's bigger
the<00:01:46.470> psycho<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.860> bigger<00:01:47.630> then<00:01:48.630> we<00:01:48.810> have<00:01:48.960> the

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
the psycho is bigger then we have the

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.520 
the psycho is bigger then we have the
pellet<00:01:50.009> aura<00:01:50.689> that's<00:01:51.689> not<00:01:51.930> really<00:01:52.170> diverse

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
pellet aura that's not really diverse

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
direct right kinetic and again very big

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.580 
direct right kinetic and again very big
okay<00:02:02.759> here<00:02:03.060> now<00:02:03.210> here<00:02:03.420> one<00:02:04.079> watch<00:02:04.259> which<00:02:04.439> is

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
okay here now here one watch which is

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.050 
okay here now here one watch which is
way<00:02:05.189> smaller<00:02:05.490> which<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.820> citizen<00:02:06.360> eco-drive

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
way smaller which is citizen eco-drive

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.790 
way smaller which is citizen eco-drive
stiletto<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.300> obviously<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.379> one<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.679> it

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
stiletto and obviously that one is it

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.830 
stiletto and obviously that one is it
really<00:02:11.280> small

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
really small

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.880 
really small
but<00:02:13.840> this<00:02:14.260> one<00:02:14.439> is<00:02:14.620> not<00:02:14.830> really

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
but this one is not really

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.550 
but this one is not really
water-resistant<00:02:15.760> so<00:02:15.879> you<00:02:15.939> can<00:02:16.269> truly<00:02:16.569> take<00:02:17.530> a

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
water-resistant so you can truly take a

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.710 
water-resistant so you can truly take a
shower<00:02:17.739> with<00:02:17.980> that<00:02:18.099> one<00:02:18.360> but<00:02:19.360> it's<00:02:19.480> a<00:02:19.540> really

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
shower with that one but it's a really

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.210 
shower with that one but it's a really
beautiful<00:02:19.989> watch<00:02:20.319> if<00:02:20.500> you<00:02:20.620> have<00:02:20.709> days<00:02:20.920> where

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
beautiful watch if you have days where

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.380 
beautiful watch if you have days where
you<00:02:21.280> don't<00:02:21.459> want<00:02:21.579> to<00:02:21.670> wear<00:02:21.819> and<00:02:22.090> one<00:02:22.209> of<00:02:22.299> the

you don't want to wear and one of the
heavy<00:02:22.540> ones<00:02:22.950> then<00:02:23.950> this<00:02:24.310> is<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:24.640> new<00:02:25.030> monster

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
heavy ones then this is the new monster

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
heavy ones then this is the new monster
or<00:02:26.049> nail<00:02:26.260> monster<00:02:26.739> or<00:02:26.980> baby<00:02:27.189> monster<00:02:28.860> again

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
or nail monster or baby monster again

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:38.210 
or nail monster or baby monster again
very<00:02:30.159> very<00:02:30.370> big<00:02:30.549> one<00:02:33.060> okay<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:36.430> casio<00:02:37.150> g-shock

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
very very big one okay the casio g-shock

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.160 
very very big one okay the casio g-shock
again<00:02:39.220> that's<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.269> other<00:02:40.420> thing<00:02:40.629> about<00:02:40.810> this

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
again that's the other thing about this

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.929 
again that's the other thing about this
watch<00:02:41.379> you<00:02:41.560> can<00:02:41.709> just<00:02:41.920> drop<00:02:42.099> it<00:02:42.280> I<00:02:42.459> would<00:02:42.790> never

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:42.939 
watch you can just drop it I would never

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.949 
watch you can just drop it I would never
do<00:02:43.180> that<00:02:43.299> with<00:02:43.450> this<00:02:43.569> one<00:02:44.159> okay<00:02:45.159> and<00:02:45.310> then

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
do that with this one okay and then

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.390 
do that with this one okay and then
comparison<00:02:46.959> to<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:48.150> Aqua<00:02:49.150> Terra<00:02:50.280> right<00:02:51.280> there

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
comparison to the Aqua Terra right there

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.550 
comparison to the Aqua Terra right there
is<00:02:51.549> a<00:02:51.579> little<00:02:51.849> bit<00:02:52.030> bigger<00:02:52.349> point<00:02:53.349> five

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
is a little bit bigger point five

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:01.110 
is a little bit bigger point five
millimeter<00:02:54.310> millimeter<00:02:58.980> okay<00:02:59.980> so<00:03:00.090> let<00:03:01.090> me

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
millimeter millimeter okay so let me

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.000 
millimeter millimeter okay so let me
just<00:03:01.239> randomly<00:03:01.810> my<00:03:01.989> picks<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:02.409> watches<00:03:02.739> so

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
just randomly my picks and watches so

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.920 
just randomly my picks and watches so
you<00:03:03.069> can<00:03:03.340> compare<00:03:03.639> them<00:03:03.760> in<00:03:03.879> size<00:03:04.060> okay<00:03:04.659> let's

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
you can compare them in size okay let's

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.699 
you can compare them in size okay let's
take<00:03:05.079> the<00:03:05.230> biggest<00:03:05.409> and<00:03:05.709> smallest<00:03:10.379> then<00:03:11.379> let's

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
take the biggest and smallest then let's

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:12.119 
take the biggest and smallest then let's
do<00:03:11.950> it

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129 
do it

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:18.960 
do it
compare<00:03:12.670> it<00:03:12.730> with<00:03:12.760> a<00:03:12.879> g-shock

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:28.039 

let's<00:03:19.810> compare<00:03:20.080> the<00:03:20.230> g-shot<00:03:20.380> to<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:22.150> kinetic

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:38.300 

and<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.430> monster

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.030 

just<00:03:39.310> compared<00:03:39.640> an<00:03:40.319> old<00:03:41.319> monster<00:03:41.500> with<00:03:41.860> a<00:03:41.920> new

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
just compared an old monster with a new

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:51.140 
just compared an old monster with a new
one<00:03:47.819> okay

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:58.809 

and<00:03:51.780> these<00:03:52.049> two

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:04.309 

and<00:04:00.830> let's<00:04:01.830> take<00:04:02.160> this<00:04:02.599> loser<00:04:03.599> are<00:04:03.780> dressed

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
and let's take this loser are dressed

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:11.830 
and let's take this loser are dressed
kind<00:04:04.620> of<00:04:04.680> watch

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.930 

basically<00:04:12.710> these<00:04:12.860> two<00:04:12.920> dress<00:04:13.280> watches<00:04:13.490> both

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
basically these two dress watches both

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:26.220 
basically these two dress watches both
wiped<00:04:14.240> out

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.140 

what<00:04:27.230> else<00:04:27.350> can<00:04:27.500> we<00:04:27.560> compare<00:04:27.860> let's<00:04:28.730> take<00:04:28.970> the

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
what else can we compare let's take the

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.900 
what else can we compare let's take the
direct<00:04:29.690> rice<00:04:29.950> with<00:04:30.950> the<00:04:31.040> other<00:04:31.190> kinetic<00:04:31.610> so

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
direct rice with the other kinetic so

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.990 
direct rice with the other kinetic so
both<00:04:32.300> kinetics<00:04:32.780> so<00:04:33.370> they<00:04:34.370> are<00:04:34.460> not<00:04:34.610> so<00:04:34.850> all

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
both kinetics so they are not so all

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.440 
both kinetics so they are not so all
adjusted<00:04:35.480> to<00:04:35.570> the<00:04:35.690> correct<00:04:35.720> time<00:04:37.420> though

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
adjusted to the correct time though

00:04:38.450 --> 00:05:01.840 
adjusted to the correct time though
actually<00:04:38.900> this<00:04:38.960> ones<00:04:39.200> are<00:04:39.380> is

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.510 

okay<00:05:02.850> so<00:05:03.390> if<00:05:04.260> you<00:05:04.410> want<00:05:04.590> to<00:05:04.620> see<00:05:04.800> any<00:05:05.250> of<00:05:05.400> the

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
okay so if you want to see any of the
