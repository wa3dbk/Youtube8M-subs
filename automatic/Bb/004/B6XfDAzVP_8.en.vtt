00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.960
 hello basket so we have a 

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:10.750
 part more so in this part we're going to 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.059
 hunt ryan the princess of the monster 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.070
 hunter so nothing quickly founded you 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.230
 the state the good skills forgiveness 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.210
 is the state the armor and the 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.130
 skills that by the way I've got 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.189
 a new combination let's say the 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.020
 good cutka weapon that becomes average 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.369
 mind with quite difficult materials 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.619
 but hey, he has arranged a 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.689
 little bit and I got it and this time 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.149
 they give us a rare skill as well 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:37.810
 say it's bomber bomber 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:40.480
 the damage of the barrels increases 50% 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.760
 explosives and if you have also ammunition 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.770
 explosives with crossbow and you have 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.829
 explosive ammunition also increases the 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.110
 damage then I do not know if it's in the 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.360
 monster hunter one also makes 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.090
 when you combine the necessary materials 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.520
 to combine them to make bombs that 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.280
 come out with a 100% margin this does not 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.890
 sexist in stenosis and others but I for 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.690
 if I mention it as something 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.159
 just pretty important to have 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.210
 all these skills you have to have 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.440
 the two pieces that increase the torso 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.840
 fix there increase the torso and others 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.610
 so nothing gets in quickly and 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.710
 that is something that I recommend 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.990
 completely when you fight with ryan is 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.030
 that you do it in the desert because 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.860
 because in the desert it is the most 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.930
 easy to fight with her just like 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.300
 rat is very easy to fight with him in 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.540
 the forest because it appears in places 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.700
 Extremely spacious at the start 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.950
 and if you do it right you can kill it before 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.479
 that you take the first flight in this 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.240
 I do not know if I will give me time to 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.729
 kill him before but I try 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.229
 as always you already know if you can wait 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.119
 a moment no no no I will not use 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.190
 the skills because I do not have the 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.679
 this armor because it has more defense 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.450
 that of the thieves and I did not leave 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.880
 completely expensive 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.220
 we recorded quickly that's important 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.910
 with this dragon if you can have come 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.950
 with elements of the weapons evidently 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.990
 with dragon or electric elements 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.770
 better than better because it is what most 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.659
 it affects 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.940
 then he's out there behind in third 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.890
 place 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.600
 There is not much difference between the 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.010
 sky and electricity depending on that 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.260
 weapons up to even also issues the 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.520
 sorry to come with an ace or with others already 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.410
 you know there are some weapons so that 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.810
 have more or less elements 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.700
 element still depends on the blissful 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.490
 weapon and good as it is the first time 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.630
 we come to hunt this little box 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.330
 we have to be very careful with 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.610
 two very dangerous attacks that the 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.260
 first is the one in the queue the one in the queue 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.400
 is the attack that removes most of this 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.849
 bicharraco 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.620
 but but we feel but without difference 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.480
 of the others and then on then 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.220
 also when it hits the born games 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.690
 but at a time that I charged these the 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.030
 bichi because it is that yes no 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.880
 for still and you threw it to the ground 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.690
 Well almost that better because at least 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.080
 a pair was removed 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.760
 the run and then another thing that 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.980
 you have to be very careful is 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.620
 when they do the games born let's say 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.630
 that stays still and shoots you have to 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.520
 be careful because this difference of 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.340
 rat I know sometimes three shots ago 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.760
 there is indeed very soon and it reaches 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.530
 be quite unpredictable and good we 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.290
 can catch for your little bit with your ass 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:24.600
 Well, that's a bit badly positioned 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:26.760
 to see there is yes true to say no 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.830
 You start me spinning daughter stuck 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.450
 read and give to italy and there we are going 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.820
 to give him the head that is more the point 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.710
 weakest element to see there 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:39.570
 quickly 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:43.200
 come more than time I'm here 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:45.510
 adjusting to mother games of mine 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.310
 there we are come and if you complain 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.160
 little will leave us even more time 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.330
 power to the head uncovered but 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.330
 to show photos to shoot rockets 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.359
 there we are, there is always 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.760
 take advantage when you make that nibble 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:06.099
 up close to take advantage to give you two 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.530
 blows to the head or at least one that 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:09.670
 always as it comes to you but let's go 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.250
 risk jce 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.220
 there you see it three blows ago 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.389
 three shots of fire unlike 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.579
 rat not if that can be 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.979
 you can rely on that 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.979
 throw one or throw three or that is that 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:27.789
 already gives his taste sometimes two years ago 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:29.680
 three years ago or not at all but we are going to 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:31.780
 see if it ever does to him only one 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.580
 because this one so you can see that 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.770
 has nothing no mystery just 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.330
 throws one and has more distances to 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.349
 travel more distance the game was born and 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.000
 little more 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:43.360
 there's the tail attack with this 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.979
 you have to be careful but let's go 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.560
 since but extreme because apart from being 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:50.020
 the attack more you remove it 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.330
 poisons and is not a poison anybody is 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.009
 a poison that is there very present 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.470
 for half an hour worth there 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:59.870
 quietly a 9 I want to stick with the 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:02.910
 legs because good nothing with the 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.210
 and we are already with the tail blows 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.210
 rare 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.770
 with record to see who shoots there 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.300
 it is now well only one you see it or 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.250
 you have to be quite careful with it 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.220
 but come on I think that depending on the 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.800
 shots for him whether or not he is 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.170
 pissed off so if she's pissed off there 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.450
 Trust ye ye ye throw or joke to 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.170
 head expect the three to launch 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.890
 shots 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:30.510
 meana you are that play with the stone 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:33.480
 this we say that always if you have to 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:36.210
 hunt them always have the 4 moves 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:39.450
 from 4 to 7 but he always goes to sleep 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.880
 to number 3 or number 3 in this in 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.950
 this area in the desert is the nest is 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.620
 the nest where all the dragoncitos 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:53.910
 they will rest and good where are they 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:56.190
 executed at the end but let's go to the 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.200
 butchery for them there will be and the 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:01.080
 cemetery 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:03.270
 to see there we will not pass between her 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.409
 so we do not have problems to see if 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.110
 shoot 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:08.879
 bone also serves you there we are 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.949
 perfect and as you can see is a dragon 

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:12.779
 pretty simpleton that you also have to 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:15.209
 say that the element affects you 

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:18.179
 too much and if you attack the weak point that 

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:20.999
 is the head even more so if he wins 

00:06:18.179 --> 00:06:23.309
 we cut quickly there is bag of flames 

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:25.589
 that only opens if it can be cut 

00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:27.820
 three times and one that says three months 

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:32.020
 of all is therefore constantly 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:34.560
 he has not promised that dragon is if it is 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:37.870
 medium if it's big or if it's a 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:41.100
 legendary so to speak you can 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:43.630
 cut from three to four up to even 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:48.280
 there is one that can be cut until 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:51.010
 ends the time I hope to have a 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:53.320
 of two I hope to have them betis and the team 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:56.080
 to teach you what is the most epic dragon 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.520
 of this this monster hunter but not the 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.920
 I like the món the most 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.620
 like clearly tells those that is a 

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.970
 mix everything that you like pretty well 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.500
 that nothing beats the cut here I hope that 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:07.630
 you liked it and if so , you know 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.640
 comment to subscribe and those things do not 

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:14.490
 the most important thank you for following me 

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.490
 goodbye be happy happy
