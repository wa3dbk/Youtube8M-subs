started quite often what I will do is I

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.619 
started quite often what I will do is I
try<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.010> figure<00:00:41.460> out<00:00:41.579> my<00:00:41.760> color<00:00:42.030> palette<00:00:42.329> that

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
try to figure out my color palette that

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.959 
try to figure out my color palette that
I'm<00:00:42.750> going<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.170> use<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:44.219> what<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.430> did<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.850> I

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
I'm going to use so what I did is I

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.400 
I'm going to use so what I did is I
pulled<00:00:45.239> out<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.390> few<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.629> my<00:00:45.719> pins<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.350> I

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
pulled out a few of my pins that I

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.470 
pulled out a few of my pins that I
thought<00:00:46.710> might<00:00:46.890> work<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.789> scribbled<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.360> on

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
thought might work and I scribbled it on

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.729 
thought might work and I scribbled it on
paper<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.260> have<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> bTW<00:00:49.920> for<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.910> BT<00:00:51.360> 3<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.989> BT

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
paper so I have a bTW for the BT 3 a BT

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.090 
paper so I have a bTW for the BT 3 a BT
2<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.610> BT<00:00:54.090> 1<00:00:54.420> these<00:00:55.140> two<00:00:55.199> are<00:00:55.590> pretty<00:00:55.800> close

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
2 and a BT 1 these two are pretty close

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.740 
2 and a BT 1 these two are pretty close
together<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:56.910> don't<00:00:57.149> think<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.480> I'm<00:00:57.660> gonna

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
together so I don't think that I'm gonna

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.139 
together so I don't think that I'm gonna
need<00:00:58.050> both<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.379> them<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.460> I'm<00:00:59.640> gonna<00:00:59.820> go<00:01:00.030> ahead

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
need both of them so I'm gonna go ahead

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.930 
need both of them so I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:01:00.300> use<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.750> for<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.710> three<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.730> one

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
and use the for the three and the one

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.299 
and use the for the three and the one
but<00:01:03.660> obviously<00:01:04.199> if<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.470> don't<00:01:04.680> have<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.949> three

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
but obviously if you don't have a three

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.789 
but obviously if you don't have a three
I'm<00:01:05.460> sure<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> two<00:01:06.090> would<00:01:06.270> work<00:01:06.450> just<00:01:06.479> fine<00:01:06.900> so

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
I'm sure a two would work just fine so

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.440 
I'm sure a two would work just fine so
I'm<00:01:08.159> gonna<00:01:08.310> go<00:01:08.490> ahead<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.729> get<00:01:08.909> started<00:01:09.060> on

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450

Nebel I do

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:20.780 
Nebel I do
especially<00:02:11.880> for<00:02:12.090> large<00:02:12.270> areas<00:02:19.430> you<00:02:20.430> can<00:02:20.580> see

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
especially for large areas you can see

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.420 
especially for large areas you can see
it<00:02:20.910> didn't<00:02:21.180> blend<00:02:21.360> very<00:02:21.480> well<00:02:21.720> because<00:02:22.260> my<00:02:22.530> bt4

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
it didn't blend very well because my bt4

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.990 
it didn't blend very well because my bt4
had<00:02:23.820> already<00:02:24.030> dried<00:02:24.480> not<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:24.960> problem<00:02:25.820> it<00:02:26.820> is<00:02:26.970> a

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.890 
had already dried not a problem it is a
large<00:02:27.330> area<00:02:28.640> so<00:02:29.640> when<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:29.790> go<00:02:29.940> back<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.480> add<00:02:30.660> one

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
large area so when I go back and add one

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.220 
large area so when I go back and add one
more<00:02:31.050> layer<00:02:31.260> in<00:02:31.530> here<00:02:35.660> you<00:02:36.660> get<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.810> little<00:02:37.140> bit

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
more layer in here you get a little bit

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.630 
more layer in here you get a little bit
of<00:02:37.350> wicking<00:02:37.650> into<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:37.980> front<00:02:38.220> layer<00:02:38.400> that's

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
of wicking into the front layer that's

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.230 
of wicking into the front layer that's
okay<00:02:39.060> we<00:02:39.930> can<00:02:39.960> cover<00:02:40.290> that<00:02:40.440> up<00:02:40.590> later<00:02:41.240> you

right up next to the edge this is still

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.130 
right up next to the edge this is still
diluting<00:03:38.220> as<00:03:38.400> long<00:03:39.060> as<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.360> ink<00:03:39.570> is<00:03:39.720> wet<00:03:39.959> it's

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
diluting as long as the ink is wet it's

thing<00:04:00.810> by<00:04:01.110> adding<00:04:01.500> in<00:04:01.590> my<00:04:01.680> darkest<00:04:02.130> color

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
thing by adding in my darkest color

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:09.560 
thing by adding in my darkest color
first<00:04:02.640> and<00:04:07.730> don't<00:04:08.730> color<00:04:08.940> this<00:04:09.120> one<00:04:09.330> because

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
first and don't color this one because

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.660 
first and don't color this one because
that's<00:04:09.690> his<00:04:09.930> leg

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:21.490 

I<00:04:13.700> made<00:04:14.420> that<00:04:14.569> mistake<00:04:14.630> already<00:04:15.230> once<00:04:20.500> okay

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
I made that mistake already once okay

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.500 
I made that mistake already once okay
there's<00:04:21.680> my<00:04:21.859> darkest<00:04:22.280> color<00:04:22.310> this<00:04:23.240> is<00:04:23.420> gonna

go<00:04:23.690> much<00:04:23.840> quicker<00:04:23.900> because<00:04:24.380> the<00:04:24.620> areas<00:04:24.950> are

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
go much quicker because the areas are

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:32.680 
go much quicker because the areas are
much<00:04:25.220> smaller<00:04:25.630> here's<00:04:26.630> my<00:04:26.840> BT<00:04:27.260> 3<00:04:30.580> and<00:04:31.580> then<00:04:32.570> I'm
