that you don't know about here's one

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.170 
that you don't know about here's one
option<00:00:58.379> right<00:00:58.620> here<00:00:58.680> plug<00:00:59.250> an<00:00:59.399> ethernet<00:00:59.850> cable

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
option right here plug an ethernet cable

option right here plug an ethernet cable
into<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.449> computer<00:01:00.780> well<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.170> know<00:01:01.289> what

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
into this computer well you know what

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.770 
into this computer well you know what
I'm<00:01:02.430> not<00:01:02.699> worried<00:01:03.030> about<00:01:03.090> an<00:01:03.329> Ethernet<00:01:03.629> cable

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
I'm not worried about an Ethernet cable

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.570 
I'm not worried about an Ethernet cable
in<00:01:04.019> fact<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.470> don't<00:01:04.739> even<00:01:05.010> want<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.189> use<00:01:05.430> an

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
in fact I don't even want to use an

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.179 
in fact I don't even want to use an
Ethernet<00:01:06.090> cable<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.869> want<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.170> use<00:01:07.290> Y<00:01:07.500> Wireless

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
Ethernet cable I want to use Y Wireless

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.940 
Ethernet cable I want to use Y Wireless
so<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:08.580> isn't<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.450> problem<00:01:09.780> right<00:01:10.619> here<00:01:10.860> so

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
so this isn't the problem right here so

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.179 
so this isn't the problem right here so
I'm<00:01:11.070> going<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.280> choose<00:01:11.430> skip<00:01:11.760> this<00:01:11.909> step<00:01:12.150> and

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
I'm going to choose skip this step and

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.280 
I'm going to choose skip this step and
look<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.310> says<00:01:14.460> well<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.939> Wi-Fi<00:01:15.360> adapter<00:01:16.110> is

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
look it says well the Wi-Fi adapter is

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.090 
look it says well the Wi-Fi adapter is
disabled<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.540> this<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.920> repair<00:01:19.920> that

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
disabled so this is a repair that

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.039 
disabled so this is a repair that
requires<00:01:20.430> administrator<00:01:21.330> approval<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:21.930> I'll

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
requires administrator approval so I'll

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.410 
requires administrator approval so I'll
click<00:01:22.259> administrator<00:01:25.939> it's<00:01:26.939> going<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.240> work

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420
