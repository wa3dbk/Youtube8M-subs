photographs so in this first video what
I<00:03:24.680> want<00:03:24.889> to<00:03:24.949> talk<00:03:25.099> about<00:03:25.280> is<00:03:25.669> how<00:03:26.150> we<00:03:26.180> can<00:03:26.449> go

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
I want to talk about is how we can go

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.390 
I want to talk about is how we can go
ahead<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:26.930> use<00:03:27.019> our<00:03:27.139> on-camera<00:03:27.769> flash<00:03:27.799> in

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
ahead and use our on-camera flash in

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.939 
ahead and use our on-camera flash in
ways<00:03:28.969> more<00:03:29.389> creatively<00:03:29.870> maybe<00:03:30.469> we've<00:03:30.680> even

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:30.949 
ways more creatively maybe we've even

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:32.920 
ways more creatively maybe we've even
thought<00:03:30.980> about<00:03:31.310> to<00:03:32.000> actually<00:03:32.150> get<00:03:32.750> these

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
thought about to actually get these

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.300 
thought about to actually get these
photons<00:03:33.409> that<00:03:33.620> are<00:03:33.769> coming<00:03:34.010> out<00:03:34.099> of<00:03:34.219> this

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
photons that are coming out of this

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.949 
photons that are coming out of this
flash<00:03:34.669> head<00:03:34.909> instead<00:03:35.239> of<00:03:35.299> just<00:03:35.540> going<00:03:35.719> right

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
flash head instead of just going right

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.170 
flash head instead of just going right
into<00:03:36.169> our<00:03:36.319> bride<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:36.799> groom<00:03:37.040> may<00:03:37.609> be<00:03:37.669> bouncing

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
into our bride and groom may be bouncing

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.670 
into our bride and groom may be bouncing
them<00:03:38.299> off<00:03:38.389> a<00:03:38.419> wall<00:03:38.689> over<00:03:38.719> here<00:03:39.019> then<00:03:39.349> coming

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
them off a wall over here then coming

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.619 
them off a wall over here then coming
back<00:03:39.709> hitting<00:03:40.370> our<00:03:40.579> bride<00:03:40.790> and<00:03:40.819> groom<00:03:41.150> to<00:03:41.449> put

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:41.629 
back hitting our bride and groom to put

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:43.059 
back hitting our bride and groom to put
a<00:03:41.659> beautiful<00:03:42.079> directional<00:03:42.620> light<00:03:42.769> on<00:03:42.949> our

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
a beautiful directional light on our

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.800 
a beautiful directional light on our
subject<00:03:43.489> whether<00:03:44.090> some<00:03:44.359> of<00:03:44.419> the<00:03:44.510> other<00:03:44.629> things

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
subject whether some of the other things

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.000 
subject whether some of the other things
we<00:03:45.019> can<00:03:45.169> do<00:03:45.260> what<00:03:45.409> we're<00:03:45.530> going<00:03:45.650> to<00:03:45.709> see<00:03:45.829> how

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
we can do what we're going to see how

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.709 
we can do what we're going to see how
much<00:03:46.129> creativity<00:03:46.430> we<00:03:46.939> can<00:03:47.120> wring<00:03:47.359> out<00:03:47.510> of<00:03:47.629> our

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:47.719 
much creativity we can wring out of our

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:50.020 
much creativity we can wring out of our
lighting<00:03:48.109> with<00:03:48.530> our<00:03:48.650> on-camera<00:03:49.099> flash<00:03:49.189> that's

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
lighting with our on-camera flash that's

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.590 
lighting with our on-camera flash that's
the<00:03:50.269> topic<00:03:50.659> of<00:03:50.810> this<00:03:51.049> video<00:03:51.379> tutorial
