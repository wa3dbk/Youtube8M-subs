00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
them so they make up to and that was

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:43.059 
them so they make up to and that was
pretty<00:04:40.940> much<00:04:41.060> this<00:04:41.389> episode<00:04:41.930> I<00:04:42.139> got<00:04:42.800> to<00:04:42.889> say<00:04:43.039> I

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:43.069 
pretty much this episode I got to say I

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:44.350 
pretty much this episode I got to say I
didn't<00:04:43.310> really<00:04:43.340> care<00:04:43.669> much<00:04:43.759> for<00:04:43.909> this<00:04:44.120> one<00:04:44.330> I

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
didn't really care much for this one I

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.700 
didn't really care much for this one I
thought<00:04:44.569> it<00:04:44.659> was<00:04:44.750> kind<00:04:44.960> of<00:04:45.020> boring<00:04:47.710> yeah

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
thought it was kind of boring yeah

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.140 
thought it was kind of boring yeah
there's<00:04:48.919> really<00:04:49.039> nothing<00:04:49.400> to<00:04:49.430> say<00:04:49.699> about<00:04:49.819> this

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
there's really nothing to say about this

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.959 
there's really nothing to say about this
this<00:04:50.930> was<00:04:51.229> more<00:04:51.500> like<00:04:51.830> your<00:04:52.129> typical<00:04:52.400> eat

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:52.969 
this was more like your typical eat

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:55.450 
this was more like your typical eat
channel<00:04:53.449> shows<00:04:53.719> like<00:04:54.169> the<00:04:54.319> Kardashians<00:04:54.770> and

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
channel shows like the Kardashians and

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.059 
channel shows like the Kardashians and
whatever<00:04:56.270> else<00:04:56.360> is<00:04:56.690> on<00:04:56.840> this<00:04:56.990> channel<00:04:57.319> this

00:04:58.059 --> 00:04:58.069 
whatever else is on this channel this

00:04:58.069 --> 00:04:59.860 
whatever else is on this channel this
episode<00:04:58.280> was<00:04:58.759> more<00:04:59.030> like<00:04:59.210> those<00:04:59.449> than<00:04:59.750> the

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
episode was more like those than the

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.689 
episode was more like those than the
others<00:05:00.169> so<00:05:00.440> maybe<00:05:01.069> that's<00:05:01.250> why<00:05:01.430> I<00:05:01.460> didn't

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 
others so maybe that's why I didn't

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:03.640 
others so maybe that's why I didn't
really<00:05:01.789> care<00:05:01.879> for<00:05:02.090> it<00:05:02.360> but<00:05:02.780> I<00:05:03.080> guess<00:05:03.440> as<00:05:03.620> long

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
really care for it but I guess as long

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.830 
really care for it but I guess as long
as<00:05:03.949> it<00:05:04.069> continues<00:05:04.310> to<00:05:04.789> do<00:05:04.909> good<00:05:05.120> ratings<00:05:05.599> then

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
as it continues to do good ratings then

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.959 
as it continues to do good ratings then
there's<00:05:06.050> not<00:05:06.199> really<00:05:06.440> a<00:05:06.740> problem<00:05:07.370> I<00:05:07.819> mean

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:07.969 
there's not really a problem I mean

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:10.300 
there's not really a problem I mean
they're<00:05:08.120> trying<00:05:08.389> to<00:05:08.509> get<00:05:08.629> a<00:05:08.690> new<00:05:08.930> audience<00:05:09.860> and

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
they're trying to get a new audience and

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.890 
they're trying to get a new audience and
so<00:05:10.580> far<00:05:10.849> that's<00:05:11.000> working<00:05:11.449> at<00:05:11.539> least<00:05:11.719> four

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
so far that's working at least four

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.300 
so far that's working at least four
total<00:05:12.169> divas<00:05:12.500> I<00:05:12.590> don't<00:05:12.770> know<00:05:12.860> if<00:05:12.979> that's<00:05:13.129> going

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
total divas I don't know if that's going

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.230 
total divas I don't know if that's going
to<00:05:13.490> translate<00:05:13.729> to<00:05:14.409> wrestling<00:05:15.729> to<00:05:16.729> be<00:05:16.849> honest<00:05:17.150> I

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
to translate to wrestling to be honest I

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.520 
to translate to wrestling to be honest I
think<00:05:17.300> a<00:05:17.479> lot<00:05:17.629> of<00:05:17.659> the<00:05:17.780> wrestling<00:05:18.169> fans<00:05:18.379> the
