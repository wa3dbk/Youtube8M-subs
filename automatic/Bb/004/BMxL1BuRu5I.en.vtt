collect oh no Joe in to be in which

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.470 
collect oh no Joe in to be in which
other<00:02:58.500> F<00:02:58.680> easily<00:02:59.100> like<00:02:59.550> dolly<00:02:59.790> wink<00:03:00.030> when<00:03:00.270> it

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
other F easily like dolly wink when it

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.800 
other F easily like dolly wink when it
dries<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:00.870> captain's<00:03:01.440> into<00:03:01.740> this<00:03:01.920> rubber<00:03:02.480> so<00:03:03.480> I

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
dries it captain's into this rubber so I

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.270 
dries it captain's into this rubber so I
guess<00:03:04.020> that<00:03:04.560> makes<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:04.800> easier<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.220> get<00:03:05.580> it<00:03:05.730> out

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
guess that makes it easier to get it out

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.710
