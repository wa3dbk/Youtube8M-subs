00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
again iPhone you know I think it also

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.330 
again iPhone you know I think it also
works<00:00:45.390> as<00:00:45.539> an<00:00:45.660> Android<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.200> free<00:00:46.590> flight<00:00:46.890> path

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
works as an Android the free flight path

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.150 
works as an Android the free flight path
I<00:00:47.879> don't<00:00:48.450> think<00:00:48.719> they've<00:00:48.989> made<00:00:49.500> an<00:00:49.680> official

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
I don't think they've made an official

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.979 
I don't think they've made an official
one<00:00:50.340> yet<00:00:50.640> for<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.920> surface<00:00:52.920> pro<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.969> anyway<00:00:54.960> I

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
one yet for the surface pro so anyway I

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.779 
one yet for the surface pro so anyway I
found<00:00:55.230> an<00:00:55.469> app<00:00:55.649> there<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.250> like<00:00:56.399> I'm<00:00:56.610> gonna

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
found an app there it's like I'm gonna

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.479 
found an app there it's like I'm gonna
test<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.539> out<00:00:57.660> see<00:00:57.719> if<00:00:58.020> it'll<00:00:58.199> work<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.739> it

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
test it out see if it'll work and it

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.660 
test it out see if it'll work and it
looks<00:00:59.670> like<00:00:59.730> this<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.329> indoor<00:01:01.050> hole<00:01:01.670> yeah

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
looks like this is the indoor hole yeah

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.039 
looks like this is the indoor hole yeah
if<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.850> can<00:01:02.910> just<00:01:03.120> figure<00:01:03.270> out<00:01:03.449> how<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.719> get<00:01:03.930> this

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
if I can just figure out how to get this

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.160 
if I can just figure out how to get this
thing<00:01:04.110> off<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.769> bet<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.189> can<00:01:05.869> plug<00:01:06.869> in<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
thing off I bet I can plug in the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.090 
thing off I bet I can plug in the
battery<00:01:08.030> okay<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.119> there<00:01:09.619> it<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.770> guess<00:01:11.010> I

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
battery okay so there it is I guess I

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.890 
battery okay so there it is I guess I
don't<00:01:11.189> want<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.460> tweak<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.880> camera<00:01:12.390> off<00:01:12.570> so

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
don't want to tweak that camera off so

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.719 
don't want to tweak that camera off so
looks<00:01:13.530> like<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.040> camera<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:14.549> the

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
looks like this is the camera on the

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.560 
looks like this is the camera on the
front<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.920> the<00:01:16.920> battery<00:01:17.430> here<00:01:17.759> battery<00:01:18.299> pack

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
front and the battery here battery pack

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.260 
front and the battery here battery pack
it's<00:01:18.869> not<00:01:19.110> connected<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.280> I'm<00:01:20.880> gonna<00:01:21.000> go<00:01:21.180> ahead

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.080 
it's not connected so I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:01:21.390> just<00:01:21.600> connect<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.140> up<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:23.689> turn<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.960> on

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
experience this is not my second

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.999 
experience this is not my second
experience<00:01:44.520> with<00:01:44.700> an<00:01:44.820> RC<00:01:45.329> aircraft<00:01:46.110> I'll<00:01:46.770> see

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
experience with an RC aircraft I'll see

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.499 
experience with an RC aircraft I'll see
if<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.159> can<00:01:47.340> get<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.700> work<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.060> not<00:01:48.210> wreck

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
if I can get it to work and not wreck

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.080 
if I can get it to work and not wreck
something<00:01:48.780> here<00:01:49.110> in<00:01:49.170> my<00:01:49.259> house<00:01:49.470> okay<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:50.460> I've

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
something here in my house okay so I've

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.550 
something here in my house okay so I've
turned<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.509> on<00:01:51.600> looks<00:01:51.899> like<00:01:52.049> there's<00:01:52.229> some<00:01:52.350> red

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
turned it on looks like there's some red

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.679 
turned it on looks like there's some red
lights<00:01:52.799> there<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.399> think<00:01:54.119> they're<00:01:54.329> supposed<00:01:54.450> to

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
lights there I think they're supposed to

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.139 
lights there I think they're supposed to
turn<00:01:54.869> green<00:01:55.170> when<00:01:55.409> it's<00:01:55.560> ready<00:01:55.920> okay<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:56.820> I'll

only<00:06:22.770> kind<00:06:23.770> that<00:06:23.979> that<00:06:24.430> works<00:06:25.210> with<00:06:25.539> this<00:06:25.690> app

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
only kind that that works with this app

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.890 
only kind that that works with this app
on<00:06:26.259> the<00:06:26.409> windows<00:06:26.860> surface<00:06:27.130> pro<00:06:27.729> but<00:06:28.599> we<00:06:28.690> just

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:28.900 
on the windows surface pro but we just

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.059 
on the windows surface pro but we just
did<00:06:29.050> our<00:06:29.080> first<00:06:29.440> flight<00:06:30.370> tests<00:06:30.909> with<00:06:31.569> it<00:06:31.810> and

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:32.069 
did our first flight tests with it and

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:34.800 
did our first flight tests with it and
it<00:06:33.069> looked<00:06:33.340> like<00:06:33.430> it<00:06:33.669> worked<00:06:33.880> okay<00:06:34.419> I<00:06:34.449> didn't

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:34.810 
it looked like it worked okay I didn't

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.330 
it looked like it worked okay I didn't
damage<00:06:34.960> anything<00:06:35.349> in<00:06:35.530> the<00:06:35.590> house<00:06:35.740> and<00:06:36.099> didn't

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
damage anything in the house and didn't

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.200 
damage anything in the house and didn't
appear<00:06:36.639> to<00:06:36.759> damage<00:06:37.150> the<00:06:37.530> drone<00:06:38.530> either<00:06:39.210> so

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
appear to damage the drone either so

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.550 
appear to damage the drone either so
overall<00:06:40.479> my<00:06:40.599> experience<00:06:40.960> was<00:06:41.440> pretty

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:41.560 
overall my experience was pretty

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.070 
overall my experience was pretty
positive<00:06:41.830> with<00:06:42.370> the<00:06:42.520> air<00:06:42.669> drone<00:06:42.940> 1.0<00:06:43.479> and<00:06:43.840> the

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 
positive with the air drone 1.0 and the

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.320 
positive with the air drone 1.0 and the
windows<00:06:44.500> surface<00:06:44.800> pro<00:06:44.979> tablet<00:06:45.220> I<00:06:45.639> would<00:06:46.150> say

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330 
windows surface pro tablet I would say

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.480 
windows surface pro tablet I would say
that<00:06:46.630> you<00:06:47.139> know<00:06:47.229> the<00:06:47.349> one<00:06:47.530> thing<00:06:47.740> on<00:06:48.039> the

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.490 
that you know the one thing on the

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.210 
that you know the one thing on the
controls<00:06:48.940> is<00:06:49.240> that<00:06:49.449> seemed<00:06:49.659> to<00:06:49.780> be<00:06:49.840> of<00:06:49.960> just

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:50.220 
controls is that seemed to be of just

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.219 
controls is that seemed to be of just
not<00:06:51.220> as<00:06:51.400> responsive<00:06:51.880> as<00:06:52.150> I<00:06:52.690> would<00:06:52.870> have<00:06:52.960> liked

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:53.229 
not as responsive as I would have liked

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:55.890 
not as responsive as I would have liked
and<00:06:53.979> I<00:06:54.669> almost<00:06:54.789> crashed<00:06:55.210> into<00:06:55.509> something<00:06:55.870> that

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:55.900 
and I almost crashed into something that

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.140 
and I almost crashed into something that
you<00:06:56.289> know<00:06:56.409> maybe<00:06:56.710> I<00:06:56.860> shouldn't<00:06:57.130> record<00:06:57.759> videos

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:58.150 
you know maybe I shouldn't record videos

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.700 
you know maybe I shouldn't record videos
while<00:06:58.509> trying<00:06:58.870> to<00:06:58.960> use<00:06:59.139> it<00:06:59.259> for<00:06:59.289> the<00:06:59.500> first

00:06:59.700 --> 00:06:59.710 
while trying to use it for the first

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.070 
while trying to use it for the first
time<00:06:59.889> but<00:07:00.759> I<00:07:01.090> think<00:07:01.360> this<00:07:01.539> is<00:07:01.659> something<00:07:01.870> that

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080 
time but I think this is something that

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.589 
time but I think this is something that
you<00:07:03.009> know<00:07:03.070> I<00:07:03.099> might<00:07:03.340> clear<00:07:04.060> out<00:07:04.210> a<00:07:04.240> little<00:07:04.419> bit

00:07:04.589 --> 00:07:04.599 
you know I might clear out a little bit

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:06.659 
you know I might clear out a little bit
more<00:07:04.719> of<00:07:04.840> the<00:07:04.930> room<00:07:05.169> and<00:07:05.469> and<00:07:05.710> let<00:07:06.370> the<00:07:06.490> kids

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:06.669 
more of the room and and let the kids

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:09.240 
more of the room and and let the kids
use<00:07:06.880> it<00:07:06.909> and<00:07:07.330> with<00:07:08.289> my<00:07:08.440> finger<00:07:08.740> pretty<00:07:08.979> close

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:09.250 
use it and with my finger pretty close

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.240 
use it and with my finger pretty close
to<00:07:09.460> the<00:07:09.580> emergency<00:07:10.060> stop<00:07:10.300> button<00:07:10.800> but<00:07:11.800> I<00:07:11.860> think

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.250 
to the emergency stop button but I think

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.089 
to the emergency stop button but I think
it<00:07:12.340> it<00:07:12.610> looks<00:07:12.849> pretty<00:07:13.120> easy<00:07:13.300> to<00:07:13.509> use<00:07:13.719> and<00:07:14.650> like

00:07:15.089 --> 00:07:15.099 
it it looks pretty easy to use and like

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:17.550 
it it looks pretty easy to use and like
on<00:07:15.280> the<00:07:15.370> you<00:07:15.699> know<00:07:15.789> the<00:07:15.909> surface<00:07:16.090> pro<00:07:16.539> you<00:07:17.469> know

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:17.560 
on the you know the surface pro you know

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.620 
on the you know the surface pro you know
the<00:07:17.650> 10<00:07:17.830> inch<00:07:18.009> screen<00:07:18.250> it's<00:07:18.849> fairly<00:07:19.120> big<00:07:19.419> the

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:19.630 
the 10 inch screen it's fairly big the

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.430 
the 10 inch screen it's fairly big the
resolution<00:07:20.199> isn't<00:07:20.560> as<00:07:20.650> good<00:07:20.889> as<00:07:21.159> the<00:07:21.240> 2.0<00:07:22.440> and

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:23.440 
resolution isn't as good as the 2.0 and

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.050 
resolution isn't as good as the 2.0 and
there<00:07:23.949> are<00:07:24.009> a<00:07:24.069> couple<00:07:24.219> other<00:07:24.460> features<00:07:24.819> i

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:25.060 
there are a couple other features i

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.999 
there are a couple other features i
think<00:07:25.389> with<00:07:25.599> the<00:07:25.750> 2.0<00:07:26.469> that<00:07:26.650> lets<00:07:26.800> you<00:07:26.889> do<00:07:26.979> a

00:07:26.999 --> 00:07:27.009 
think with the 2.0 that lets you do a

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:29.249 
think with the 2.0 that lets you do a
few<00:07:27.250> acrobatics<00:07:27.969> and<00:07:28.090> things<00:07:28.300> but<00:07:28.599> you<00:07:29.199> know

00:07:29.249 --> 00:07:29.259 
few acrobatics and things but you know

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:32.040 
few acrobatics and things but you know
this<00:07:29.409> is<00:07:29.590> at<00:07:29.740> least<00:07:29.770> a<00:07:30.340> start<00:07:30.490> and<00:07:31.180> we'll<00:07:31.840> see

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:32.050 
this is at least a start and we'll see

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:35.309 
this is at least a start and we'll see
if<00:07:32.169> anybody<00:07:32.530> develops<00:07:32.949> a<00:07:33.099> an<00:07:33.490> app<00:07:33.880> for<00:07:34.330> the<00:07:34.569> 2.0

00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:35.319 
if anybody develops a an app for the 2.0

00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:38.339 
if anybody develops a an app for the 2.0
as<00:07:35.500> well<00:07:35.710> for<00:07:36.190> the<00:07:36.669> windows<00:07:36.940> surface<00:07:37.120> so<00:07:38.020> i'll

00:07:38.339 --> 00:07:38.349 
as well for the windows surface so i'll

00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:39.899 
as well for the windows surface so i'll
definitely<00:07:38.560> download<00:07:39.219> it<00:07:39.370> and<00:07:39.490> probably<00:07:39.669> go

00:07:39.899 --> 00:07:39.909 
definitely download it and probably go

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:44.310 
definitely download it and probably go
out<00:07:40.060> and<00:07:40.300> upgrade<00:07:40.840> my<00:07:41.080> AR<00:07:41.650> Drone<00:07:41.889> as<00:07:42.099> well
