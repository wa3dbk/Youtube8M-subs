okay<00:00:01.829> here<00:00:02.129> we<00:00:02.280> have<00:00:02.310> an<00:00:02.730> MEP<00:00:03.210> zero<00:00:04.080> zero<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.470> a

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
okay here we have an MEP zero zero to a

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.509 
okay here we have an MEP zero zero to a
five<00:00:05.549> five<00:00:06.420> kilowatt<00:00:06.930> generator<00:00:07.340> with<00:00:08.340> the

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
five five kilowatt generator with the

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.030 
five five kilowatt generator with the
acoustic<00:00:09.090> sound<00:00:09.420> suppression<00:00:10.260> kit<00:00:10.590> removed

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
acoustic sound suppression kit removed

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.519 
acoustic sound suppression kit removed
and<00:00:11.570> set<00:00:12.570> off<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.929> one<00:00:13.049> side<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:15.109> the<00:00:16.109> problem

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
and set off to one side and the problem

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.640 
and set off to one side and the problem
I<00:00:16.680> had<00:00:16.920> with<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.279> was<00:00:19.130> the<00:00:20.130> regulator<00:00:20.670> went<00:00:20.939> bad

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
I had with it was the regulator went bad

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.529 
I had with it was the regulator went bad
at<00:00:22.650> first<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:23.070> wasn't<00:00:23.220> sure<00:00:23.490> what<00:00:23.699> went<00:00:23.939> bad<00:00:24.180> but

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
at first I wasn't sure what went bad but

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.960 
at first I wasn't sure what went bad but
the<00:00:24.689> charge<00:00:24.960> regulator<00:00:25.500> went<00:00:25.740> bad<00:00:25.970> normally

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
the charge regulator went bad normally

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.220 
the charge regulator went bad normally
this<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.390> what<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.689> would<00:00:27.779> normally<00:00:27.840> see

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
this is what you would normally see

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.980 
this is what you would normally see
there<00:00:28.680> this<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.580> get<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.150> tag<00:00:30.359> right<00:00:30.539> side<00:00:30.810> up

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
there this is get the tag right side up

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.150 
there this is get the tag right side up
can<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.320> see<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.650> tag<00:00:33.020> almost<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.739> this<00:00:34.950> is

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
can you see the tag almost so this is

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.700 
can you see the tag almost so this is
what<00:00:35.340> would<00:00:35.489> normally<00:00:35.670> be<00:00:35.940> there<00:00:36.500> but<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.590> was

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
what would normally be there but it was

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:45.229 
what would normally be there but it was
no<00:00:37.890> good<00:00:39.320> so<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:42.469> looked<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.620> up<00:00:43.710> online<00:00:43.950> for<00:00:44.489> 150

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
no good so I looked it up online for 150

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.750 
no good so I looked it up online for 150
bucks<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.719> could<00:00:45.899> buy<00:00:46.110> one<00:00:46.350> but<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.280> was<00:00:47.520> just

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
bucks I could buy one but I was just

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.880 
bucks I could buy one but I was just
appalled<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.329> spend<00:00:48.600> 150<00:00:49.140> dollars<00:00:49.680> for

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
appalled to spend 150 dollars for

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.740 
appalled to spend 150 dollars for
something<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.520> simple<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.180> apparently<00:00:51.629> of

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
something so simple and apparently of

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.660 
something so simple and apparently of
inferior<00:00:52.289> quality<00:00:52.620> since<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.340> seems

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
inferior quality since it seems

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.330 
inferior quality since it seems
everybody<00:00:54.090> has<00:00:54.510> problems<00:00:55.050> with<00:00:55.260> them<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:56.309> I

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
everybody has problems with them so I

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.700 
everybody has problems with them so I
made<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.699> home-built<00:00:57.149> one<00:00:57.390> what<00:00:57.930> we<00:00:58.079> have<00:00:58.320> here

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
made a home-built one what we have here

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.520 
made a home-built one what we have here
is<00:00:58.890> a<00:01:01.190> linear<00:01:02.190> voltage<00:01:02.460> regulator<00:01:03.290> capable<00:01:04.290> of

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
one-and-a-half amps this output drives

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.090 
one-and-a-half amps this output drives
the<00:01:08.310> base<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.689> power<00:01:09.990> transistor<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:10.830> I

don't<00:01:11.820> know<00:01:11.939> if<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.180> can<00:01:12.299> see<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.600> over<00:01:12.780> here

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
don't know if you can see it over here

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:19.100 
don't know if you can see it over here
in<00:01:14.240> there<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.650> to3<00:01:16.650> package<00:01:17.840> okay<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.990> power

is<00:01:23.460> kind<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.790> marginal<00:01:24.210> but<00:01:24.450> it's<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.930> is

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
is kind of marginal but it's it is

wind blowing here that heatsink ought to

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.600 
wind blowing here that heatsink ought to
be<00:01:29.640> pretty<00:01:29.820> good<00:01:30.229> okay<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:32.280> course<00:01:32.490> you

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
be pretty good okay and of course you

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.370 
be pretty good okay and of course you
got<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.820> rectify<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.299> first<00:01:33.630> before<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.140> can

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
got to rectify it first before you can

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.319 
got to rectify it first before you can
regulate<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.369> just<00:01:35.700> happen<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.240> have

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
regulate it so I just happen to have

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.060 
regulate it so I just happen to have
this<00:01:36.689> board<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.140> didn't<00:01:37.409> make<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:37.740> board<00:01:38.009> just

couldn't I'd read all over to figure out

what that fuse was supposed to be and I

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.589 
what that fuse was supposed to be and I
ended<00:02:52.849> up<00:02:52.970> putting<00:02:53.209> on<00:02:53.480> a<00:02:53.750> GC<00:02:54.650> 15<00:02:55.280> amp<00:02:55.489> fuse<00:02:56.359> in

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
ended up putting on a GC 15 amp fuse in

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:02.500 
ended up putting on a GC 15 amp fuse in
there<00:02:58.329> so<00:02:59.329> there<00:02:59.540> you<00:02:59.659> go<00:03:00.219> $150<00:03:01.219> and<00:03:01.489> I<00:03:02.150> made<00:03:02.389> it

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
there so there you go $150 and I made it

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.270 
there so there you go $150 and I made it
last<00:03:02.689> night<00:03:03.019> and<00:03:03.319> put<00:03:03.469> it<00:03:03.560> in<00:03:03.709> this<00:03:03.829> morning

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
last night and put it in this morning

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.280 
last night and put it in this morning
and<00:03:04.790> it's<00:03:05.480> still<00:03:05.750> early<00:03:05.780> morning<00:03:06.469> so<00:03:06.709> I<00:03:07.069> think

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
and it's still early morning so I think

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.069 
and it's still early morning so I think
$450<00:03:09.290> it'll<00:03:10.159> work<00:03:10.389> it's<00:03:11.389> kind<00:03:11.719> of<00:03:11.810> rinky-dink

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
$450 it'll work it's kind of rinky-dink

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.860 
$450 it'll work it's kind of rinky-dink
but<00:03:12.560> it'll<00:03:12.799> work<00:03:12.829> I<00:03:13.189> just<00:03:13.519> tested<00:03:14.000> it<00:03:14.120> it<00:03:14.540> seems

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
but it'll work I just tested it it seems

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:15.610 
but it'll work I just tested it it seems
to<00:03:15.079> function

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620

I<00:03:16.150> tested<00:03:17.150> last<00:03:17.329> night<00:03:17.659> on<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:18.019> table<00:03:18.440> to<00:03:18.560> make

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
I tested last night on the table to make

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.349 
I tested last night on the table to make
sure<00:03:18.769> it<00:03:19.040> was<00:03:19.190> regulating<00:03:19.790> right<00:03:20.030> and<00:03:20.269> I<00:03:20.329> just

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
sure it was regulating right and I just

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.420 
sure it was regulating right and I just
tested<00:03:21.109> it<00:03:21.229> in<00:03:21.349> operation<00:03:21.949> just<00:03:22.220> now<00:03:22.370> for

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
tested it in operation just now for

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.939 
tested it in operation just now for
about<00:03:22.849> two<00:03:23.060> minutes<00:03:23.419> about<00:03:23.989> all<00:03:24.409> you<00:03:24.590> can<00:03:24.769> run

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:24.949 
about two minutes about all you can run

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:31.869 
about two minutes about all you can run
without<00:03:25.159> the<00:03:26.949> proper<00:03:27.949> crowling<00:03:28.220> on<00:03:28.989> so<00:03:30.879> it

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:31.879 
without the proper crowling on so it

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.179 
without the proper crowling on so it
seems<00:03:32.239> to<00:03:32.329> work<00:03:32.389> fine<00:03:32.780> heatsink<00:03:33.769> didn't<00:03:34.069> even

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:34.189 
seems to work fine heatsink didn't even

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:36.580 
seems to work fine heatsink didn't even
get<00:03:34.340> warm<00:03:34.639> I<00:03:34.970> think<00:03:35.689> we're<00:03:35.870> good<00:03:36.049> to<00:03:36.079> go<00:03:36.199> I'm

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
get warm I think we're good to go I'm

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.429 
get warm I think we're good to go I'm
going<00:03:36.769> to<00:03:36.829> put<00:03:37.069> everything<00:03:37.310> back<00:03:37.699> together

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:38.439 
going to put everything back together

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:42.459 
going to put everything back together
