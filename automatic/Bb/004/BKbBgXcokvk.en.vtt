weeks I felt like I got to know a lot of

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.620 
weeks I felt like I got to know a lot of
them<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.040> I<00:01:05.040> saw<00:01:05.850> some<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.090> them<00:01:06.299> three<00:01:06.570> or

them and I saw some of them three or
four<00:01:06.720> times<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.860> kind<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.100> tells<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.580> just

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
four times so it kind of tells you just

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.280 
four times so it kind of tells you just
a<00:01:09.600> little<00:01:09.780> bit<00:01:09.869> when<00:01:09.990> primary<00:01:10.350> cares<00:01:10.560> about<00:01:12.290> so

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
a little bit when primary cares about so

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.200 
a little bit when primary cares about so
that<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.530> one<00:01:13.680> aspect<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.250> Primerica<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.150> I

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
searching for jobs is you should really

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.050 
searching for jobs is you should really
