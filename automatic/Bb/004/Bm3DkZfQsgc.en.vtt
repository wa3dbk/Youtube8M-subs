00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.609
 my challenge 50 people my goal 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:07.609
 50 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.760
 day 10 in the sf game level 50 challenge 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.740
 from shilling today with a short one 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.860
 but it is well known in 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.660
 In the short term, the seasoning has that too 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.430
 my professors always said that 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.320
 I meant to talk more about the hot 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.060
 mush around in the tests but that has 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.000
 no vote whatever that 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.669
 is now another topic in the near future 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.180
 is the seasoning and I have a lot 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:39.900
 spicy and a curcuma curry chicken 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.650
 tikka masala with rice pretty 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.660
 funny in the diary of me 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.910
 ever played with the thought 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.649
 hey own game trend server bit 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.010
 such a huge community that would be 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.720
 but pretty cool , I have to say and 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.250
 I also have a lot of positive feedback 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.370
 get for this idea 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.649
 We have the stars with double 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.579
 attacked not to change with the 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.049
 stars with 3 times and with an a and me 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:09.180
 I got an answer 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.999
 already my mailbox purely at once 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.219
 see who of playa games answer and 

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:16.679
 In general, they found the idea right 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:18.539
 cool and also with the videos and such and 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:21.719
 the community here we all there 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:26.100
 do on youtube and then have 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:27.899
 meant that they were not branded in general 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.429
 server so that's what you call that 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:30.659
 example of buffed server or there is 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:33.270
 the ingame server of this 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.719
 game portal ingame or there is the rtl 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.249
 server rtl2 server the 123 play games 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:41.939
 in greece gives his game portal 

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:45.299
 there are different such servers and those 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:49.439
 But they are more likely to extinction 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.789
 because yes it's true on sf game.de 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.299
 on the start page you can only see the 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:56.639
 german server 1 to 22 now and 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.310
 these others too but not those you can 

00:01:56.639 --> 00:02:01.079
 just just about their website to find 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.779
 example of buffed but the advertise 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.979
 not as active as then and 

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:07.709
 That's why someday the dying dies 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:11.220
 server out and the argument is correct 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:13.680
 but probably there is one too 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.480
 The other side of the coin is the good one 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.090
 page 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.400
 he meant playa games 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.720
 he answered that it was the 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.129
 opportunity give for example now at 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.720
 next server that we practically 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:30.209
 fade in sf game somehow so have 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.569
 for example, play trend point sf 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.799
 game.de and that's how it leads you 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.720
 does not guide that shows then 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.629
 just when you give that one 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.940
 latest server to server 23 on and in 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.620
 his head area there where shakes and 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.319
 fidget game stands and impressum and such 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.920
 continue the scrapbook already again 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.360
 found 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.060
 but if you need it then it comes 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.190
 not that is clear and to be in the head 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.989
 area somehow that's playing games 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.370
 trend so the logo and maybe 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.069
 somehow a link to youtube or 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.250
 something like that just fades sf game 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.650
 after all, is cooler than nothing at all 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.980
 I say that then, for example, all the shakes and 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.049
 fidget players the newly playing trend 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.549
 know about this page then go on it 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.590
 and somehow a little bit different 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.000
 have the header there anyway 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.769
 I still have to look there now 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.819
 replied today and am around 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.500
 I definitely have to write 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.480
 very happy that the idea is not the same 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.489
 It could be shot in the wind 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.720
 also somehow understand the argument 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.420
 that maybe the server 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.160
 would eventually die out and then yes 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.569
 It would be boring for the people 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.310
 then have played for months 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:36.239
 but no competition can be gotten that way 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.790
 in the way so jo so much for this 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:41.220
 theme the sf game challenge i have it 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.709
 unfortunately again not to the highest level 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.730
 42 steer again 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.709
 a lead 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.470
 But I have to say I was unlucky 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:53.370
 unfortunately this was the last quest 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.750
 namely no bonus quest so at the 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.760
 last quest if you manage to 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.099
 two and a half minutes if you like that 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.599
 somehow single and then lucky has 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.739
 Maybe a tough quest that 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.060
 I did not have this time 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.069
 I had one as the last quest 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.519
 bad five minutes yes it can 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.410
 to run 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.299
 that was only in between the 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.859
 small updates for your own games 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.660
 disconnect server I'm curious 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.959
 what will come there as I said there 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.609
 I will definitely still the 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.650
 news first hand always report 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.419
 probably then in the warrior diary 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.690
 but of the challenge first I am 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:26.219
 out hope that I can still catch up 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.960
 It's really the last days now 

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:30.240
 I think the forecast is 14 days 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.849
 as I said at the beginning 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.499
 more 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:34.379
 grab a broken relationship kite 

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:37.509
 depending on how good or bad it is 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:39.969
 you will not need to look easy 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:44.589
 please be luck with the quests 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:47.459
 spell let the dog's circuit 

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:47.459
 faster Faster
