00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.430
 sissi 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:14.759
 ebay rents 1 kataweb logo 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.999
 hey tachometer port 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:22.829
 a rather special video that impresses with Stefano alde '94 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:26.169
 humor on the psn capaldo 94 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:29.239
 a little and asked me to do 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:32.239
 the explanation is a post on how to do rallies 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.350
 so here I am apart from the word the antidote site has not chosen the top 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.830
 important if you want advice 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.120
 take a Japanese car and possibly a subaru impreza or one 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.380
 mitsubishi evo in this case even the rally car then 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.679
 and even better though 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:54.459
 any one on the air recovery excellent for levels at least to start 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:02.430
 % important veils and modify them then modify your self modifications 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.620
 therefore 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.659
 yes and then there are indications 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.619
 set limits to your car 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.070
 there is limited power and so by normal mail you use the rumors 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.000
 pears and then first regiment coconut to do is watch your track for 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.800
 dogs in this case as you see 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.070
 the track is almost all straight so I stretched and reports 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.530
 because otherwise your car does not go 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.040
 - this tarcento 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.700
 we begin to see 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.030
 how can you make a good rally? 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.979
 I tell you that this was in short UFO registered immediately on the first attempt 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.670
 so it's not a great race or not but anyway 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.980
 it's a good race 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.210
 so first of all, never start by holding the accelerator in throttle 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.859
 wide open ok 

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:56.850
 why try to stay d 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.220
 depart holding it grandmother out of speed 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.530
 because otherwise you play a little slower don't miss singing but in short 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.230
 we know they don't grow 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.230
 a tenth is enough to win nothing here will help 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.699
 then corman pearls must always be taken from wide narrow like in a track but with 

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:16.839
 a trick 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:19.229
 beds start spinning first 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:23.479
 which starts bend obviously not a mile before but since you're not 

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:26.580
 on the asphalt the high will put us a little to 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.449
 follow 

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:30.099
 what you say 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.799
 so start with the collar always 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.109
 a little bit before nakuru ok 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:38.559
 hey that here or still bent too late and anyway I was born a little 

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:39.989
 off-road then network 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.819
 however start with the sea 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.819
 perished first of the curve 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.619
 so that you always have time to correct 

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:51.539
 if you fail to correct yourself 

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:54.599
 always finish in a bit first 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.519
 so this is the first piece of advice I can give you is how to make a 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.319
 brothels book 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.229
 so here I arrived first if I'm not mistaken I don't sing hell 

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:09.259
 the types of plus and seconds 

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:12.259
 and then we pass the second race 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:17.169
 so the second race as you can see a little more torture let's say 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:22.119
 therefore, I shorten relationships slightly not as badly as usual 

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:23.329
 of a 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.389
 20 working with a child 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:30.180
 also there is another trick if you are quite lara vb recommends 

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:31.199
 to reduce 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:36.079
 the traction control this because in the curves if your car skids the 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.229
 traction control if you look at the indicator 

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:42.909
 Accelerator is never at most this because there is control of 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:44.229
 active traction 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:45.569
 and therefore 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.589
 it is true that it helps me not to go into a spin 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:52.439
 but first and foremost the most difficult 4 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:53.979
 and then 

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:55.129
 the 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:57.349
 and anyway hehe 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.799
 a power limiter because it is still limited when you exit the 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:02.739
 curve 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:07.949
 15 values ​​win winning rimmel. this is the limitation 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:12.169
 winnie who always starts to turn before the curve 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:15.349
 is 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:20.239
 you see that the limiting cell who is active does not sign me all blue but me 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.030
 this bank marks a piece. I will limit myself to power output from the 

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:26.300
 curve because the other is not completely straight 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.620
 so the second tip is when I made a curve 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.520
 slowly try to straighten out 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.530
 your steering angle is why you also need to start reading 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.960
 before so that 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.900
 coming out of the know more and more straight 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.560
 as soon as possible and you can start accelerating as soon as possible see in 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.849
 around a little earlier 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:48.029
 now they are already almost entirely hegel 

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:52.139
 clash etration practically in the next active was there from mobile much earlier 

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:57.939
 so put the lilly together and start turning the first hill straight 

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:59.979
 the steering angle so that 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:02.879
 the traction encounter is not very active 

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:07.580
 and allows you to accelerate with more power when exiting the curve 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.240
 then ok, I comment here I fight an error because 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:16.949
 s ... I'm looking at my opponents that I was convinced I reached kiss 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:17.439
 kiss 

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:20.439
 cdc there was a curve so book you estimate google 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.370
 and then this is a small mistake that anyway 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.729
 it compromises the race a little but allows me to comment on the advantages that vote 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:34.729
 after intervention, however, dinner managing to maintain 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.039
 the first position 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:41.039
 we therefore hope the third day of competition 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.870
 here it is 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.520
 and where the circuit is 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.319
 cort ts unique curve 

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:55.400
 long then ratios he wiped his wings because in any case he is not a screen not 

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:58.610
 can for a throttle because there will be against the tracks momò 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.490
 again reduced traction control for you surely I will not go in 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.490
 spinning because in any case it is not a curve born of power 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.379
 eeee will be anyway 

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:10.949
 hum 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:16.099
 given by the author high speed so they didn't send me into a spin 

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:19.650
 if there was against too active retraction you should have me the power 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:25.860
 so if I don't take care of it I reduce it a little meeting reproach so that I can 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.520
 hotel keep 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.089
 the high ratio 

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:32.619
 let's take a look at the control of the car, you see that it is still anyway 

00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:36.069
 a little active, however, much less than before 

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:39.289
 it is activated only when the car starts to go a little sideways 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.680
 here is the goal 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:49.810
 and audio notes these little tips if you want others out unical a little more 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.430
 advanced we say 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.090
 h it is enough that - you do pears and I do the video 

00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:59.189
 okay for release 

00:06:59.189 --> 00:06:59.879
 beautiful girl
