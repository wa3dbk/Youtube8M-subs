life<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.470> hookers<00:02:17.250> here'sa<00:02:18.290> number<00:02:19.430> yes

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
life and hookers here'sa number yes

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.680 
life and hookers here'sa number yes
number<00:02:20.880> 18<00:02:21.270> this<00:02:21.420> is<00:02:21.600> a<00:02:21.630> long<00:02:21.930> hold<00:02:22.260> like<00:02:23.690> 450

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
number 18 this is a long hold like 450

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.320 
number 18 this is a long hold like 450
meters<00:02:25.110> so<00:02:25.710> something<00:02:26.130> like<00:02:26.160> that<00:02:26.520> so<00:02:26.760> like

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
meters so something like that so like

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.450 
meters so something like that so like
and<00:02:27.720> it's<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.930> little<00:02:28.050> bit<00:02:28.170> uphill<00:02:28.410> around<00:02:29.370> this

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
and it's a little bit uphill around this

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.600 
and it's a little bit uphill around this
water<00:02:29.760> here<00:02:30.350> so<00:02:31.350> it's<00:02:31.470> like<00:02:31.710> close<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.100> 500

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
water here so it's like close to 500

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.570 
water here so it's like close to 500
yard<00:02:32.850> par-4<00:02:33.300> so<00:02:33.840> it's<00:02:34.050> a<00:02:34.110> big<00:02:34.290> hole<00:02:34.500> i<00:02:34.740> guess

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
yard par-4 so it's a big hole i guess

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.240 
yard par-4 so it's a big hole i guess
some<00:02:35.790> of<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:36.090> leaderboards<00:02:37.100> getting<00:02:38.100> me

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
some of the leaderboards getting me

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.560 
some of the leaderboards getting me
