00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:33.539
 I could say that you have known me for 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.539
 more than a thousand years 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.760
 everything now you can see everything that 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.699
 you hear you smell and feel it's part of you 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.670
 your blood of your traditions of your 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:51.339
 way to see things your ancestors 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.559
 they started it fruit of intense 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:56.229
 cultural exchange between 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:59.229
 feudal Christianity and conceptions 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:01.930
 medieval muslim a grandiose 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:05.059
 man's adaptation effort to a 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:08.270
 difficult and abrupt physical environment 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:11.270
 my gaze extends between the southern part 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.120
 of sierra nevada and the noble zone of the river 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.670
 andarax 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.070
 each and every one of the peoples that I 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.280
 they inhabit have been made in the same way 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.920
 and almost at the same time with work 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.560
 of the people who populate their neighborhoods and 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.250
 the whitewashed houses that hold 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.980
 slopes by a thousand steep devils and that 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.470
 they have given me this personality that creates 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.610
 a perfect symbiosis of man with 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.610
 medium in which he lives 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.439
 not rush 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.509
 here things go slowly between a 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.850
 labyrinth of streets that take you to 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.170
 all sites without leaving any 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.659
 part 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.930
 the now quiet voices fill the 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.370
 laundry space in the low placeta 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.760
 the end 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:07.150
 everything is up or down everything is a 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.770
 hand and everything is possible because everything is 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.880
 in harmony 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.280
 in the now quiet I can remember 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.040
 the hullabaloo of each end of harvest 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.140
 when everything met and was in threshing 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.930
 and I found is the strength of the 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.260
 tradition 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.140
 the water runs almost placidly 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:32.550
 taken by the acequias 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:36.080
 the simas fishing pools and cisterns 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.610
 next to starter mills dams 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.130
 accompanies a complex network of acequias 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.490
 with a distribution of water that 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:48.030
 adjust to precise rules every 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:51.690
 road is carihuela or bridge takes us 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.660
 for a vintage landscape decorated before 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.780
 forest and dotted with endless terraces 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.650
 of crops supported by balates that 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:04.400
 give shape and soul to my space 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.220
 in the stops olive and fruit trees 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.930
 they give food and shelter to the gardens and 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.989
 crops 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.560
 an ingenious use of gas 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.780
 terraces that give me character and that 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.769
 from the times where silk wore 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:24.920
 owners and houses have not changed giving use 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:28.370
 to the chestnut holm oaks 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.230
 igic ares woven and crops 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.230
 fresh foods 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.290
 today you can walk between balates that 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.049
 limit each crop by hearing the rumor of 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.140
 water and feeling the same presence that 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.030
 thousand years ago present in the air and in 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.050
 the mood 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:51.140
 Today those who inhabit me are others but the 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:54.650
 essence is the same work and love 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.590
 for each stone each tree each drop is 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.160
 the same 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:03.220
 in these thousand years my essence has 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:07.300
 remained imperturbable solid 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:10.300
 Celine quiet my desire remain intact 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.480
 and my light comes out every morning with the same 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:16.140
 force illuminating everything so that everything 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.140
 follow its course 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:26.620
 in these thousand years I have not stopped being 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.620
 who am I because I am alpujarra 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:36.749

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:39.560
