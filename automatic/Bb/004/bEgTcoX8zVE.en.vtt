three times Timothy extraction we have a

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.580 
three times Timothy extraction we have a
schedule<00:05:26.590> for<00:05:26.860> these<00:05:27.250> exercises<00:05:28.080> we<00:05:29.080> exercise

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
schedule for these exercises we exercise

schedule for these exercises we exercise
four<00:05:30.250> days<00:05:30.430> a<00:05:30.460> week<00:05:31.260> but<00:05:32.260> each<00:05:32.410> one<00:05:32.680> is<00:05:32.980> only

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
done three out of the four days so it's

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.160 
done three out of the four days so it's
not<00:05:38.230> like<00:05:38.440> he<00:05:38.680> works<00:05:38.920> himself<00:05:39.130> to<00:05:39.520> death<00:05:40.170> the

it<00:05:51.299> away<00:05:52.259> OH&amp;S<00:05:52.769> we<00:05:53.009> do<00:05:53.129> this<00:05:53.279> eight<00:05:53.579> times<00:05:54.409> the

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:55.409 
it away OH&amp;S we do this eight times the

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:58.539 
it away OH&amp;S we do this eight times the
distance<00:05:55.619> between<00:05:56.419> the<00:05:57.419> pipes<00:05:57.719> has<00:05:58.199> kept

00:05:58.539 --> 00:05:58.549 
distance between the pipes has kept

00:05:58.549 --> 00:06:02.389 
distance between the pipes has kept
increasing<00:05:59.549> as<00:06:00.119> we've<00:06:00.329> gone<00:06:00.479> along<00:06:01.249> when<00:06:02.249> I

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:02.399 
increasing as we've gone along when I

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:04.539 
increasing as we've gone along when I
pick<00:06:02.579> up<00:06:02.789> to<00:06:02.999> nine<00:06:03.209> and<00:06:03.419> a<00:06:03.479> half<00:06:03.509> inches<00:06:03.869> now

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:04.549 
pick up to nine and a half inches now

00:06:04.549 --> 00:06:07.189 
pick up to nine and a half inches now
the<00:06:05.549> idea<00:06:05.699> is<00:06:05.969> to<00:06:06.179> really<00:06:06.599> make<00:06:06.779> him<00:06:06.929> drive

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 
the idea is to really make him drive

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:09.169 
the idea is to really make him drive
through<00:06:07.619> an<00:06:07.739> agility<00:06:08.069> course<00:06:08.309> again<00:06:09.029> which

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:09.179 
through an agility course again which

00:06:09.179 --> 00:06:11.089 
through an agility course again which
all<00:06:09.299> things<00:06:09.479> straight<00:06:09.869> I<00:06:09.989> don't<00:06:10.199> exercise<00:06:10.499> is

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:11.099 
all things straight I don't exercise is

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:13.039 
all things straight I don't exercise is

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:13.049 
that I want to ramp it's a sit up and

00:06:13.049 --> 00:06:16.879 
that I want to ramp it's a sit up and
beg<00:06:13.639> and<00:06:14.639> he<00:06:15.089> does<00:06:15.269> it<00:06:15.479> 10<00:06:16.259> times<00:06:16.589> each

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:16.889
