between<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:47.070> and<00:02:47.310> your<00:02:47.790> computer<00:02:48.510> animators

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
between you and your computer animators

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.410 
between you and your computer animators
so<00:02:49.950> it's<00:02:50.130> not<00:02:50.310> like<00:02:50.580> front<00:02:50.940> mission<00:02:51.240> where<00:02:51.390> you

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
so it's not like front mission where you

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.360 
so it's not like front mission where you
just<00:02:51.690> move<00:02:51.870> all<00:02:52.050> of<00:02:52.080> your<00:02:52.290> robots<00:02:52.500> at<00:02:52.920> once<00:02:53.130> and

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
just move all of your robots at once and

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.730 
just move all of your robots at once and
unload<00:02:53.880> everything<00:02:54.450> on<00:02:54.810> your<00:02:54.990> opponent's<00:02:55.560> you

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
unload everything on your opponent's you

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.100 
unload everything on your opponent's you
move<00:02:56.310> piece<00:02:56.610> by<00:02:56.910> piece<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.450> your<00:02:57.720> opponent

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
move piece by piece and your opponent

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.110 
move piece by piece and your opponent
does<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.560> same<00:02:58.800> so<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.070> can<00:02:59.280> attack<00:02:59.610> someone

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
does the same so you can attack someone

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.820 
does the same so you can attack someone
but<00:03:00.300> they<00:03:00.420> can<00:03:00.600> also<00:03:00.720> just<00:03:01.020> move<00:03:01.290> out<00:03:01.440> of<00:03:01.470> the

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
but they can also just move out of the

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.890 
but they can also just move out of the
way<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:02.310> this<00:03:03.150> makes<00:03:03.390> for<00:03:03.510> really

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
way and this makes for really

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.560 
way and this makes for really
interesting<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.860> fun<00:03:05.100> strategy<00:03:05.730> because<00:03:06.480> I

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
interesting and fun strategy because I

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.080 
interesting and fun strategy because I
think<00:03:06.780> it<00:03:06.870> forces<00:03:07.080> you<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:07.470> play<00:03:08.090> defensively

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
think it forces you to play defensively

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.570 
think it forces you to play defensively
what<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.480> would<00:03:09.690> do<00:03:09.840> is<00:03:10.050> move<00:03:10.380> a<00:03:10.709> piece<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.489> then

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
what I would do is move a piece and then

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.490 
what I would do is move a piece and then
wait<00:03:11.820> to<00:03:12.239> see<00:03:12.420> what<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.660> enemy<00:03:12.810> does<00:03:12.989> and<00:03:13.410> when

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
wait to see what the enemy does and when

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.979 
wait to see what the enemy does and when
they<00:03:13.650> move<00:03:13.890> a<00:03:14.160> little<00:03:14.790> e<00:03:14.940> appears<00:03:15.570> over<00:03:15.720> their

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
they move a little e appears over their

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.540 
they move a little e appears over their
unit<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.410> means<00:03:16.620> they've<00:03:16.830> moved<00:03:17.070> for<00:03:17.430> their

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
unit that means they've moved for their

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.970 
unit that means they've moved for their
turn<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:18.060> then<00:03:18.660> you<00:03:18.780> can<00:03:18.930> just<00:03:19.110> wail<00:03:19.470> on<00:03:19.500> them

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
turn and then you can just wail on them

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.890 
turn and then you can just wail on them
remembering<00:03:20.760> that<00:03:20.880> your<00:03:21.030> pieces<00:03:21.390> also<00:03:21.570> have

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
remembering that your pieces also have

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.509 
remembering that your pieces also have
the<00:03:22.050> same<00:03:22.230> issue<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:22.709> can<00:03:22.830> be<00:03:22.920> left<00:03:23.130> wide<00:03:23.489> open

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
the same issue and can be left wide open

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.000 
the same issue and can be left wide open
and<00:03:24.180> one<00:03:24.780> thing<00:03:24.989> you<00:03:25.110> got<00:03:25.260> to<00:03:25.290> keep<00:03:25.500> in<00:03:25.650> mind<00:03:25.830> a

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
and one thing you got to keep in mind a

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.070 
and one thing you got to keep in mind a
big<00:03:26.400> thing<00:03:26.670> actually<00:03:26.880> is<00:03:27.239> that<00:03:27.450> if<00:03:27.570> your<00:03:27.720> hero

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
big thing actually is that if your hero

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.120 
big thing actually is that if your hero
is<00:03:28.170> killed<00:03:28.650> you<00:03:29.489> lose<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:30.810> battle

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
is killed you lose the battle

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.680 
is killed you lose the battle

and<00:03:36.550> that<00:03:37.550> can<00:03:37.760> really<00:03:37.940> be<00:03:38.180> a<00:03:38.210> weak<00:03:38.450> point<00:03:38.750> in

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
and that can really be a weak point in

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.480 
and that can really be a weak point in
your<00:03:39.200> strategy<00:03:39.560> it<00:03:39.980> took<00:03:40.100> me<00:03:40.220> a<00:03:40.250> while<00:03:40.430> to

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
your strategy it took me a while to

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.130 
your strategy it took me a while to
figure<00:03:40.760> this<00:03:41.000> out<00:03:41.180> because<00:03:41.360> typically<00:03:41.870> in

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
figure this out because typically in

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.410 
figure this out because typically in
strategy<00:03:42.920> games<00:03:43.160> I<00:03:43.310> make<00:03:43.520> the<00:03:43.730> main<00:03:43.940> character

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
strategy games I make the main character

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.750 
strategy games I make the main character
the<00:03:44.540> most<00:03:44.750> powerful<00:03:45.380> and<00:03:45.560> destroy<00:03:46.460> the<00:03:46.610> most

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
the most powerful and destroy the most

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.160 
the most powerful and destroy the most
enemies<00:03:47.180> with<00:03:47.360> them<00:03:47.540> like<00:03:47.690> I<00:03:47.810> do<00:03:47.870> in<00:03:48.020> front

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
enemies with them like I do in front

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.200 
enemies with them like I do in front
mission<00:03:48.530> but<00:03:48.650> that<00:03:48.830> can<00:03:48.980> totally<00:03:49.160> backfire<00:03:49.910> on

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.210 
mission but that can totally backfire on

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.140 
mission but that can totally backfire on
you<00:03:50.450> in<00:03:50.570> vandal<00:03:50.960> hearts<00:03:51.110> -<00:03:51.590> was<00:03:52.550> groovy<00:03:53.120> I

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
you in vandal hearts - was groovy I

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.960 
you in vandal hearts - was groovy I
haven't<00:03:53.630> seen<00:03:53.900> him<00:03:54.080> for<00:03:54.110> a<00:03:54.590> great<00:03:55.160> while<00:03:55.520> so<00:03:55.940> I

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
haven't seen him for a great while so I

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.580 
haven't seen him for a great while so I
went<00:03:56.210> with<00:03:56.270> a<00:03:56.330> different<00:03:56.870> strategy<00:03:57.140> in<00:03:57.470> this

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
went with a different strategy in this

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.800 
went with a different strategy in this
game<00:03:57.800> that<00:03:57.950> I<00:03:58.010> really<00:03:58.400> liked<00:03:58.610> where<00:03:59.330> I<00:03:59.360> made<00:03:59.780> my

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
game that I really liked where I made my

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
game that I really liked where I made my
hero<00:04:00.440> the<00:04:01.280> healer<00:04:01.850> so<00:04:02.540> groovy<00:04:02.870> just<00:04:03.290> hangs<00:04:03.590> out

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
hero the healer so groovy just hangs out

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.160 
hero the healer so groovy just hangs out
in<00:04:03.950> the<00:04:04.040> back<00:04:04.250> and<00:04:04.610> heals<00:04:05.390> everybody<00:04:05.870> while

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
in the back and heals everybody while

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.930 
in the back and heals everybody while
gaining<00:04:06.380> experience<00:04:07.010> points<00:04:07.070> and<00:04:07.520> never

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
gaining experience points and never

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.790 
gaining experience points and never
taking<00:04:08.330> any<00:04:08.450> damage<00:04:08.630> it's<00:04:09.140> brilliant

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
taking any damage it's brilliant

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.290 
taking any damage it's brilliant
can't<00:04:10.370> believe<00:04:10.460> it<00:04:10.670> took<00:04:10.760> me<00:04:10.820> this<00:04:10.970> long<00:04:11.030> to

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
can't believe it took me this long to

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.630 
can't believe it took me this long to
figure<00:04:11.510> that<00:04:11.630> out<00:04:12.050> vandal<00:04:12.650> hearts<00:04:12.830> 2<00:04:13.190> is<00:04:13.400> also

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
figure that out vandal hearts 2 is also

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.090 
figure that out vandal hearts 2 is also
a<00:04:13.820> massive<00:04:14.690> game<00:04:15.050> with<00:04:15.290> like<00:04:15.440> hundreds<00:04:15.950> of

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
a massive game with like hundreds of

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.160 
a massive game with like hundreds of
hours<00:04:16.430> of<00:04:16.459> gameplay<00:04:16.880> and<00:04:17.390> that<00:04:17.720> you<00:04:17.989> may

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.170 
hours of gameplay and that you may

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.720 
hours of gameplay and that you may
choose<00:04:18.380> to<00:04:18.560> play<00:04:18.739> it<00:04:18.860> that<00:04:19.010> long<00:04:19.250> because

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
choose to play it that long because

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.910 
choose to play it that long because
there's<00:04:19.940> multiple<00:04:20.150> endings<00:04:20.750> and<00:04:20.989> it's<00:04:21.560> fun<00:04:21.770> to

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
there's multiple endings and it's fun to

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.190
