completely worked out so I started

skis and that came to claw and this been
about<00:01:14.759> five<00:01:15.000> years<00:01:15.030> ago<00:01:15.860> we<00:01:16.860> have<00:01:16.979> three<00:01:17.190> times

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
about five years ago we have three times

about five years ago we have three times
more<00:01:17.580> damping<00:01:17.940> than<00:01:18.090> any<00:01:18.240> other<00:01:18.479> scheme<00:01:18.780> and

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
more damping than any other scheme and

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.370 
more damping than any other scheme and
it<00:01:20.070> really<00:01:20.250> works<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:21.020> watching<00:01:22.020> people<00:01:22.050> come

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
it really works and watching people come

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.540 
it really works and watching people come
off<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.619> hill<00:01:22.800> and<00:01:22.890> being<00:01:23.070> able<00:01:23.190> to<00:01:23.340> ski<00:01:23.490> in

of his company first when I show you the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.450 
of his company first when I show you the
difference<00:01:31.289> between<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.039> scheme<00:01:32.310> with
