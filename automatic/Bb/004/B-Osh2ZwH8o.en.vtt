side<00:01:48.600> profile<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.890> leaves<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.220> little<00:01:50.490> bit<00:01:50.610> of

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
side profile and leaves a little bit of

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.580 
side profile and leaves a little bit of
space<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.149> back<00:01:51.329> side<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.470> i<00:01:52.500> can

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
space on the back side so that i can

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.859 
space on the back side so that i can
line<00:01:52.950> up<00:01:52.979> right<00:01:53.159> here<00:01:53.430> with<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.420> 30<00:01:54.750> pin

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
line up right here with the 30 pin

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.929 
line up right here with the 30 pin
connector<00:01:55.189> you<00:01:56.189> can<00:01:56.250> see<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.549> right<00:01:56.880> there

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
connector you can see that right there

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.830 
connector you can see that right there
see<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.899> little<00:01:57.960> space<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:59.630> that's<00:02:00.630> what<00:02:00.750> it

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
see the little space and that's what it

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.110 
see the little space and that's what it
looks<00:02:01.020> like<00:02:01.140> from<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.469> back<00:02:02.719> just<00:02:03.719> like<00:02:03.840> that

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
looks like from the back just like that

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.440 
looks like from the back just like that
and<00:02:06.490> so<00:02:07.490> I'm<00:02:07.550> just<00:02:07.700> going<00:02:07.820> to<00:02:07.880> go<00:02:08.030> ahead<00:02:08.119> and

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
and so I'm just going to go ahead and

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:16.330 
and so I'm just going to go ahead and
slide<00:02:08.869> it<00:02:08.900> on<00:02:09.140> in<00:02:13.900> just<00:02:14.900> push<00:02:15.140> it<00:02:15.170> on<00:02:15.410> down<00:02:15.620> that

slide it on in just push it on down that

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.460 
slide it on in just push it on down that
lines<00:02:16.580> right<00:02:16.880> up<00:02:17.060> and<00:02:17.750> that<00:02:17.870> lights<00:02:18.080> right<00:02:18.320> up

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
lines right up and that lights right up

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.830 
lines right up and that lights right up
you<00:02:18.590> can<00:02:18.740> see<00:02:18.890> that<00:02:18.940> it<00:02:19.940> immediately<00:02:20.330> began<00:02:20.690> to
