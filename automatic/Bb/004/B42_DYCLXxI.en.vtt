I keep saying it I just for whatever
reason<00:02:00.430> I<00:02:00.490> just<00:02:00.520> think<00:02:00.940> Marquez<00:02:01.630> isn't<00:02:01.930> coming

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
reason I just think Marquez isn't coming

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.560 
reason I just think Marquez isn't coming
to<00:02:02.260> dance<00:02:02.470> around<00:02:02.650> and<00:02:03.100> make<00:02:03.880> this<00:02:04.030> a<00:02:04.090> boxing

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
to dance around and make this a boxing

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.600 
to dance around and make this a boxing
match<00:02:04.600> and<00:02:04.930> I<00:02:05.170> think<00:02:05.650> Marquez<00:02:05.980> has<00:02:06.280> already

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
match and I think Marquez has already

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.760 
match and I think Marquez has already
had<00:02:06.880> bad<00:02:07.060> luck<00:02:07.090> he<00:02:07.600> thinks<00:02:08.260> that<00:02:08.290> he's<00:02:08.470> had<00:02:08.619> bad

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
had bad luck he thinks that he's had bad

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.980 
had bad luck he thinks that he's had bad
luck<00:02:08.800> with<00:02:09.010> with<00:02:09.490> the<00:02:09.580> judges<00:02:09.940> before<00:02:10.060> so<00:02:10.750> he's

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
luck with with the judges before so he's

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.330 
luck with with the judges before so he's
going<00:02:11.170> to<00:02:11.230> come<00:02:11.380> in<00:02:11.530> with<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.740> intentions<00:02:12.220> of

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
going to come in with the intentions of

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.280 
going to come in with the intentions of
not<00:02:12.610> letting<00:02:12.820> this<00:02:12.940> go<00:02:13.150> to<00:02:13.210> the<00:02:13.390> judges<00:02:13.600> and<00:02:13.840> I

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
not letting this go to the judges and I

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.750 
not letting this go to the judges and I
