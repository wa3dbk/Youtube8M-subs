00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
that's how you do it though

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.690 
that's how you do it though
I<00:01:23.700> recommend<00:01:24.620> putting<00:01:25.620> earphones<00:01:26.250> in<00:01:26.490> your

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
I recommend putting earphones in your

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.800 
I recommend putting earphones in your
laptop<00:01:27.590> um<00:01:28.620> because<00:01:29.250> when<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.270> first<00:01:30.450> do<00:01:30.630> this

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
laptop um because when you first do this

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.050 
laptop um because when you first do this
in<00:01:31.440> the<00:01:31.620> laptop<00:01:31.830> without<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> earphones<00:01:32.880> it

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
in the laptop without a earphones it

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.650 
in the laptop without a earphones it
will<00:01:33.180> be<00:01:33.360> very<00:01:33.780> echoey<00:01:35.150> so<00:01:36.150> if<00:01:36.330> you<00:01:36.450> want<00:01:36.600> to

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
will be very echoey so if you want to

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.450 
will be very echoey so if you want to
fix<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.140> use<00:01:37.350> earphones<00:01:37.650> it's

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
fix that this use earphones it's

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.150 
fix that this use earphones it's
optional<00:01:38.970> but<00:01:39.120> it's<00:01:39.420> like<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.200> recommend<00:01:41.010> it

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
optional but it's like I recommend it

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.630 
optional but it's like I recommend it
and<00:01:41.970> don't<00:01:42.300> use<00:01:42.660> the<00:01:42.690> stereo<00:01:43.380> mix<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:44.130> use<00:01:44.430> it

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
and don't use the stereo mix I use it

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
and don't use the stereo mix I use it
really<00:01:45.330> Eckles<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:46.020> lot<00:01:46.410> and<00:01:46.970> even<00:01:47.970> with<00:01:48.450> your
