 to our 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.979
 vacuum clutch technology make 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:21.649
 nokian hakkapeliitta 7 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.959
 silent such a result is possible 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:24.679
 thanks to the air shock absorber and 

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:27.170
 spikes 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:29.450
 new type near each spikes 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.389
 there is a hole in the shape of a drop 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.139
 which reduce vibration and soften 

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:35.619
 kick and tires 

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:35.619
 and the road

 anchor spikes 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.350
 six edges with beveled corners 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.320
 diamond shows stability when 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.540
 lateral resistance and slopes so it 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.820
 winter tire gives better grip 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.460
 during acceleration and braking and lateral 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.040
 sliding besides thanks to the system 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.010
 ecosse here resources to the maximum 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.140
 increased how it works look under

 cushion the blows of thorn droplets tassel 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.070
 really deserves respect and and 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.590
 worth choosing for excellent grip so 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.500
 in slushy so on ice and wet

 claw protrusion on the tread surface 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.350
 which more tightly holds the spike in 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.630
 upright taking on 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.940
 most of the load during braking 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:38.190
 all this at times increased brake 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.840
 and acceleration and grip please you 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.040
