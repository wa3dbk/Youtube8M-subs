00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
transplants for 12 years now I got into

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.490 
transplants for 12 years now I got into
it<00:00:04.259> out<00:00:04.410> of<00:00:04.560> her<00:00:04.740> out<00:00:05.370> of<00:00:05.549> my<00:00:06.120> own<00:00:06.500> medical

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
it out of her out of my own medical

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.799 
it out of her out of my own medical
practice<00:00:08.040> where<00:00:08.280> I<00:00:08.309> saw<00:00:08.610> some<00:00:08.849> transplants<00:00:09.630> I

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
practice where I saw some transplants I

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.990 
practice where I saw some transplants I
got<00:00:10.440> interested<00:00:10.769> in<00:00:11.219> some<00:00:11.670> of<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.849> results

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
got interested in some of the results

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.749 
got interested in some of the results
they<00:00:12.389> had<00:00:12.719> came<00:00:13.679> down<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.250> found<00:00:14.429> that<00:00:14.580> there

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
they had came down and found that there

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.240 
they had came down and found that there
was<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.910> place<00:00:15.210> for<00:00:15.570> me<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:16.080> learn<00:00:16.529> how<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.830> do<00:00:17.100> it

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
was a place for me to learn how to do it

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.439 
was a place for me to learn how to do it
and<00:00:17.600> it's<00:00:18.600> fun<00:00:18.840> you<00:00:19.439> know<00:00:19.560> it's<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:20.119> it's<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.240> fun

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
and it's fun you know it's a it's a fun

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.980 
and it's fun you know it's a it's a fun
way<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.660> do<00:00:21.900> procedural<00:00:23.390> medicine<00:00:24.390> makes

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
way to do procedural medicine makes

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.929 
way to do procedural medicine makes
patients<00:00:25.949> happy<00:00:27.380> you<00:00:28.380> know<00:00:28.529> it's<00:00:29.070> it's<00:00:29.789> the

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
patients happy you know it's it's the

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.590 
patients happy you know it's it's the
kind<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.330> thing<00:00:30.539> that's<00:00:32.300> aesthetic<00:00:33.300> rather

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
kind of thing that's aesthetic rather

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.540 
kind of thing that's aesthetic rather
than<00:00:33.840> life-threatening<00:00:34.500> which<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.160> tends<00:00:35.430> to

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
than life-threatening which is tends to

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.860 
than life-threatening which is tends to
be<00:00:35.670> more<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.030> what<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.210> do<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.570> my<00:00:36.600> other

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
be more of what I do in my other

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.740 
be more of what I do in my other
practice<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.270> so<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.300> get<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.540> lot<00:00:39.719> of

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
practice and and so I get a lot of

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.500 
practice and and so I get a lot of
satisfaction<00:00:39.989> out<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:42.210> think<00:00:42.420> the

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
satisfaction out of that and I think the

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.830 
satisfaction out of that and I think the
most<00:00:42.690> common<00:00:43.079> question<00:00:43.500> we<00:00:43.530> see<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.719> coming<00:00:45.719> is

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
most common question we see is coming is

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.130 
most common question we see is coming is
is<00:00:46.140> will<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.770> look<00:00:47.010> natural<00:00:47.750> you<00:00:48.750> know<00:00:48.870> people

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
is will it look natural you know people

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.869 
is will it look natural you know people
are<00:00:49.350> concerned<00:00:49.680> about<00:00:49.890> density<00:00:50.280> but<00:00:50.670> they're

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
are concerned about density but they're

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.880 
are concerned about density but they're
far<00:00:51.090> more<00:00:51.120> concerned<00:00:51.629> about<00:00:51.870> whether<00:00:52.620> they're

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
far more concerned about whether they're

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.529 
far more concerned about whether they're
going<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.160> get<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.309> natural<00:00:53.610> look<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.590> that

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
going to get a natural look that that

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.389 
going to get a natural look that that
you<00:00:57.539> know<00:00:57.870> people<00:00:57.899> cannot<00:00:58.590> tell<00:00:58.920> as<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.129> hair

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
you know people cannot tell as a hair

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.650 
you know people cannot tell as a hair
transplant<00:00:59.840> but<00:01:00.840> rather<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.410> just<00:01:01.649> some<00:01:02.660> mild

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
transplant but rather is just some mild

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.410 
transplant but rather is just some mild
thinning<00:01:04.939> probably<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.000> second<00:01:06.390> most

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
thinning probably the second most

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.330 
thinning probably the second most
question<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.110> what<00:01:07.260> kind<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.530> density<00:01:08.040> can<00:01:08.220> you

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
question is what kind of density can you

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
question is what kind of density can you
get<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.729> that's<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.000> most<00:01:09.150> difficult

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
get and that's the most difficult

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.539 
get and that's the most difficult
question<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.170> answer<00:01:10.290> because<00:01:10.799> it's<00:01:11.189> it's

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
question to answer because it's it's

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.280 
question to answer because it's it's
very<00:01:11.790> dependent<00:01:12.240> upon<00:01:12.299> how<00:01:12.450> much<00:01:12.750> area<00:01:12.990> you

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
very dependent upon how much area you

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.249 
very dependent upon how much area you
have<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.650> fill<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.640> quality<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.540> the

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
have to fill the quality of the the

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.620 
have to fill the quality of the the
donor<00:01:16.500> area<00:01:17.420> and<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:19.170> know<00:01:19.320> how<00:01:19.500> much

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
donor area and you know how much

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.060 
donor area and you know how much
honestly<00:01:21.630> much<00:01:21.960> money<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.409> patient<00:01:22.770> has<00:01:22.890> to

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
honestly much money the patient has to

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.999 
honestly much money the patient has to
spend<00:01:23.369> through<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.869> philly<00:01:25.140> area<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.799> needs

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
spend through the philly area that needs

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.850 
spend through the philly area that needs
to<00:01:26.159> be<00:01:26.220> filled<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:27.049> that's<00:01:28.049> probably<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.680> most

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
to be filled so that's probably the most

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.929 
to be filled so that's probably the most
difficult<00:01:29.100> question<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.909> answer<00:01:31.939> yeah

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
difficult question to answer yeah

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.140 
difficult question to answer yeah
everybody<00:01:33.689> asks<00:01:34.079> if<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.290> hurts<00:01:35.090> it<00:01:36.090> really

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
everybody asks if it hurts it really

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.600 
everybody asks if it hurts it really
doesn't<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.200> know<00:01:37.229> more<00:01:37.530> people<00:01:37.890> are<00:01:38.040> upset

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
doesn't you know more people are upset

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.330 
doesn't you know more people are upset
with<00:01:39.150> how<00:01:39.329> long<00:01:39.570> they<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:40.229> know<00:01:40.259> they<00:01:40.650> have<00:01:41.159> to

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
with how long they you know they have to

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.639 
with how long they you know they have to
sit<00:01:41.579> still<00:01:41.759> rather<00:01:42.270> than<00:01:42.630> how<00:01:42.840> much<00:01:43.079> the

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
sit still rather than how much the

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.450 
sit still rather than how much the
actual<00:01:44.220> procedure<00:01:44.430> hurts<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:46.250> we<00:01:47.250> let<00:01:47.430> people

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
actual procedure hurts and we let people

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.179 
actual procedure hurts and we let people
stand<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.360> move<00:01:48.810> around<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.590> get<00:01:49.770> up<00:01:49.950> and

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
stand and move around and get up and

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.850 
stand and move around and get up and
stretch<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.990> actually<00:01:52.380> doesn't<00:01:52.590> become

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
stretch so that actually doesn't become

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.429 
stretch so that actually doesn't become
an<00:01:53.159> issue<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.090> think<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.570> hardest<00:01:54.930> thing<00:01:55.229> is

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
an issue so I think the hardest thing is

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.630 
an issue so I think the hardest thing is
to<00:01:55.470> make<00:01:55.740> sure<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:56.130> everybody's

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
to make sure that everybody's

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.429 
to make sure that everybody's
expectations<00:01:57.360> are<00:01:58.020> lined<00:01:58.290> up<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.829> so<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:01.200> sit

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
expectations are lined up and so to sit

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.950 
expectations are lined up and so to sit
there<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.680> just<00:02:01.860> recommend<00:02:02.399> go<00:02:02.820> for<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.240> you

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
there and just recommend go for it you

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.959 
there and just recommend go for it you
know<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.320> not<00:02:04.350> always<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.219> right<00:02:05.250> answer<00:02:05.460> it

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
know is not always the right answer it
