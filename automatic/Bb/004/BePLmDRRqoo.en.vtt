00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.400
 brazilian soccer team 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.679

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.439
 and this friendly between Brazil x will be the 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.850
 fifth game felipe ahead of the selection 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.039
 Brazilian after the exit of the hand 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.410
 Menezes then let's get to it 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.510
 there are more details about Brazil 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.090

 time at 10 pm brazilian time 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.219
 It's very important there to go to 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.860
 states that do not have time zone 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.350
 different from Brasilia time 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.570
 probably as usual because it is a 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.120
 great game there a classic South American 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.399

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.660

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.850
 From the next 22 hours in 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.080
 Staff as Brazil-Chile subject nothing 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.960
 fairer to comment a little 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.720
 on the retrospection of the two teams 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.890

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:17.040

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.840
 number 66 to date 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.939

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.729
 46 wins for Brazil and seven 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.970
 victories for the xvii as we see there is a 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.340
 gigantic advantage for the selection 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.060

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.979

 presented against the xi said that 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.960
 last friendly against bolivia a 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.490
 poor selection brazil finished thrashing 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.460
 so this is personal 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.530
 Brazil and Chile on April 24 fourth 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.960
