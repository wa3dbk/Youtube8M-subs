right never seen anything like it and I
was<00:01:48.410> talking<00:01:48.710> to<00:01:48.740> a<00:01:48.830> resident<00:01:49.310> that<00:01:49.729> was

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
was talking to a resident that was

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.400 
was talking to a resident that was
around<00:01:50.149> the<00:01:50.300> corner<00:01:50.330> and<00:01:50.720> he<00:01:51.080> told<00:01:51.259> me<00:01:51.380> that

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
around the corner and he told me that

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.960 
around the corner and he told me that
he's<00:01:51.619> been<00:01:51.740> in<00:01:51.860> for<00:01:51.950> 25<00:01:52.250> years<00:01:52.429> and<00:01:52.610> never<00:01:52.700> seen

anything<00:01:53.179> like<00:01:53.330> it<00:01:53.450> either<00:01:53.630> so<00:01:53.960> I<00:01:54.250> take<00:01:55.250> it

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
anything like it either so I take it

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:56.950 
anything like it either so I take it
it's<00:01:55.490> highly<00:01:55.729> unusual<00:01:55.880> of<00:01:56.300> course<00:01:56.360> related<00:01:56.750> to

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
it's highly unusual of course related to

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.380 
it's highly unusual of course related to
the<00:01:57.110> hurricane<00:01:57.649> activity<00:01:57.800> I<00:01:58.369> must<00:01:58.970> really<00:01:59.179> be

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
the hurricane activity I must really be

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.570 
the hurricane activity I must really be
