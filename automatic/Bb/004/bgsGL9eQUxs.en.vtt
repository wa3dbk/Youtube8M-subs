problem with this car which is not
uncommon<00:00:37.739> now<00:00:38.370> with<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:39.030> many<00:00:39.270> years<00:00:39.890> but

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
uncommon now with this many years but

uncommon now with this many years but
it's<00:00:41.040> very<00:00:41.399> dramatic<00:00:41.809> so<00:00:42.809> we're<00:00:42.989> going<00:00:43.079> to

we're this is a 1969 unknown mile I

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.270 
we're this is a 1969 unknown mile I
don't<00:01:12.780> know<00:01:13.020> what<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.290> odometer<00:01:13.560> says<00:01:14.100> we

don't know what the odometer says we
can't<00:01:14.549> trust<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:15.000> anyway<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:16.080> we're<00:01:16.290> gonna

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
can't trust it anyway so we're gonna

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.469 
can't trust it anyway so we're gonna

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
movement now this really doesn't

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.440 
movement now this really doesn't
evidence<00:01:40.560> itself<00:01:41.009> when<00:01:41.250> you're<00:01:41.400> driving<00:01:41.909> when

something's wrong with the front end but
you<00:01:49.049> know<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.320> whole<00:01:49.350> weight<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.340> car<00:01:50.640> is

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
you know the whole weight of the car is

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.469 
you know the whole weight of the car is
on<00:01:51.930> this<00:01:52.170> front<00:01:52.470> suspension<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:54.149> doesn't

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
on this front suspension so it doesn't

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.810 
on this front suspension so it doesn't
really<00:01:54.570> slip<00:01:55.079> around<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.649> whole<00:01:55.829> lot<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.310> isn't

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
really slip around a whole lot it isn't

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.209 
really slip around a whole lot it isn't
anywhere<00:01:57.149> nearly<00:01:57.479> as<00:01:57.630> obvious<00:01:58.170> when<00:01:58.890> it's<00:01:59.040> on

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
anywhere nearly as obvious when it's on

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.639 
anywhere nearly as obvious when it's on
the<00:01:59.340> ground<00:01:59.579> is<00:02:00.030> now<00:02:00.780> when<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.259> when<00:02:01.530> the

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
the ground is now when that when the

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
interestingly kurt pointed out to me and

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.140 
interestingly kurt pointed out to me and
trevor<00:02:40.860> is<00:02:41.010> going<00:02:41.130> to<00:02:41.220> come<00:02:41.459> back<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:41.910> take<00:02:42.090> a

trevor is going to come back and take a

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.890 
trevor is going to come back and take a
look<00:02:42.300> we<00:02:42.900> can<00:02:43.110> see<00:02:43.350> that<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.650> pan<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:45.090> pan

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
look we can see that the pan the the pan

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.400 
look we can see that the pan the the pan
here<00:02:46.260> of<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:47.040> of<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.700> engine<00:02:48.180> sits<00:02:48.570> almost

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
here of the of the engine sits almost

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.920 
here of the of the engine sits almost
almost<00:02:49.830> right<00:02:50.489> on<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.910> crossmember<00:02:51.780> and

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
almost right on the crossmember and

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.680 
almost right on the crossmember and
that's<00:02:52.580> twofold<00:02:53.580> one<00:02:53.940> of<00:02:54.120> course<00:02:54.360> as<00:02:54.540> the

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
that's twofold one of course as the

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.570 
that's twofold one of course as the
engine<00:02:55.050> mounts<00:02:55.350> have<00:02:55.470> probably<00:02:55.890> slipped<00:02:56.370> a

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
engine mounts have probably slipped a

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.000 
engine mounts have probably slipped a
little<00:02:57.180> bit<00:02:57.330> and<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:58.290> other<00:02:58.440> one<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:58.860> that

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
little bit and the other one is that

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.900 
little bit and the other one is that
these<00:02:59.160> pads<00:02:59.519> are<00:02:59.819> arsenal<00:03:00.510> faulty<00:03:00.989> so<00:03:01.910> anyway

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
these pads are arsenal faulty so anyway

probably twelve dollars you know and the
rest<00:03:46.079> of<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.380> 350<00:03:47.220> goes<00:03:47.400> for<00:03:47.730> a<00:03:47.760> row<00:03:47.970> for<00:03:48.690> the

labor involved then of course once

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.199 
labor involved then of course once
that's<00:03:52.650> done<00:03:52.950> you<00:03:53.130> have<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:53.310> we<00:03:53.700> have<00:03:53.880> to<00:03:54.030> reach

that's done you have to we have to reach
him<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.660> rack<00:03:54.840> because<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.799> rack<00:03:56.010> and<00:03:56.280> pinion

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
him the rack because the rack and pinion

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.069 
him the rack because the rack and pinion
is<00:03:56.790> going<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.030> pick<00:03:57.239> up<00:03:57.390> a<00:03:57.600> different<00:03:57.959> angle

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
is going to pick up a different angle

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.560 
is going to pick up a different angle
once<00:03:58.829> we<00:03:58.980> get<00:03:59.100> Pat's<00:03:59.459> underneath<00:04:00.000> there<00:04:00.269> and

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
once we get Pat's underneath there and

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.780 
once we get Pat's underneath there and
then<00:04:00.930> there<00:04:01.109> are<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.380> camber<00:04:01.859> adjusting<00:04:02.489> pads

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
then there are the camber adjusting pads

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.280 
then there are the camber adjusting pads
which<00:04:03.570> you<00:04:03.720> can<00:04:03.900> use<00:04:04.109> to<00:04:04.500> reduce<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:06.290> the

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
which you can use to reduce the the the

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.009 
which you can use to reduce the the the
caster<00:04:07.799> of<00:04:07.829> the<00:04:08.010> caster<00:04:08.459> introducing<00:04:09.180> pads<00:04:09.450> to

caster of the caster introducing pads to

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.830 
caster of the caster introducing pads to
