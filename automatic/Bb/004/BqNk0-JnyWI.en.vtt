00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.710
 Spanish is on the official website of gta 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.119

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.949
 will try to put it so good i'm going to 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.789

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.829
 live 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.689
 I feel unfortunate because a lot of 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.980
 you already have seen it and I 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.350
 I still do not know how good I am going to give to 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:39.210
 already play a damn time and good bone 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:42.320
 in the play but 18 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.320
 good just a little music 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.060
 basically bife of good the other in 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.060
 Spanish 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.380
 basically wanting to do a way in 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.380
 alive 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.870
 impressive as of history inside 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:14.820
 of the multiplayer 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.770
 the mechanics are very similar to those of 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.420
 max payne 3 is very very much like me 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.030
 like it a lot because it's a very 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.130
 well that works pretty well you can 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.259
 make pulses too 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.060
 go on a motorcycle jump on a parachute 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.140
 a lot of people is 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.140
 impressively handsome 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.870
 we see tennis I do not know if we can also 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.480
 do something there is a talk also about having 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.700
 that get money to spend it 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.510
 which will assume the money will 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.510
 serve for something 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.740
 you can form a band 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.740
 and steal stores and such 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.680
 here we see a faint or something by the 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.930
 style is very handsome reminds me a lot 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.860
 the marquis painters and cool a lot because 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.840
 It's a game that happened a lot 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.640
 unnoticed 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.600
 look at the reputation that I suppose 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.600
 will serve to level up 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.510
 good if money can be spent 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.200
 leveling things up by taking your 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.290
 weapons and customize them and such 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.400
 You can buy an apartment too 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.640
 from multiplayer and bojan your 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.130
 friends is too big to buy a garage 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.020
 we see an impressive car 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.490
 my mother the air races are 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.490
 gorgeous for what as a duty 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.440
 well basically if we go up from 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.220
 level we meet new characters and in 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.770
 new missions 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.570
 come on, it's not a shit multiplayer 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.990
 is a multiplayer focused on the 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.990
 history too 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.019
 well you can design your careers a 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.819
 lots of cross so we see from 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.980
 mates we can create games in this 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.270
 game makes very big 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.980
 m 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.900
 I was worried that the multicolored 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.730
 was stuck like in the 4 but I see 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.730
 he is not very handsome 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.380
 very good reminds me a little bit of what 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.870
 it is burnout paradise in a certain sense the 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.670
 power and it was great online photo so so 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.430
 quickly and such I did not like 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.860
 very much to bring you truth I loved it 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.720
 I really liked it, I think I'm going to continue 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.060
 enough follies with josemi league just 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.349
 be in this game I really liked it a lot 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.060
 a lot although maybe my reaction is not 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.349
 you see it like that is because I was 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.900
 attending a little the video but after 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.760
 of what finish I love I do not like it 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.800
 very much the truth is very very very handsome 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.300
 The truth is that I buy insured already 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.340
 I had it but well I think that already in 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.690
 multiplayer have pretty embroidered and not 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.620
 We were filled in the next video 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.670
 remember that the video you have 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.569
 description and nothing we see in the 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.569
 next video you approach
