 channel sponsor thermaltake 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.230
 thermaltake play even easier 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.200
 Hello, I'm with them again 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.750
 techno-kitchen 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.870
 snowy and very beautiful understood me 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.760
 while we are free team so we can 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.519
 afford non-standard reviews 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.590
 so here let's start with the end 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:51.500
 thermaltake frio ks new cherries kept 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.269
 the temperature at 59 degrees is not the most 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.670
 the best result is worse than him only 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:58.100
 small cooler from gel from but is it 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.080
 reason to turn away from the cooler he keeps 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:05.089
 according to jordan even six-core 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:07.340
 Processors generally behind the other and 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.869
 super coolers but takes its toll 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.869
 rotary fans up to 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:15.290
 speeds up to 2100 per minute stated 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.540
 the ability to draw away 240 watts inspires but 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.200
 the main thing is of course appearance 2 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.549
 this is not very beautiful and cute 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.979
 perfectly fit into the entourage of white 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.650
 enclosures where there is also a white power supply then 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.780
 there is a cooler image cooler style by the way we 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.210
 have already tested such a cooler but in another 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.429
 color track thermal track first 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.140
 according to produced white cases and then 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:39.560
 decided it would be nice if there were a cooler and 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.030
 Actually, the model appeared device 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.920
 is a tower cooler 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.899
 construction based on 6 copper 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.090
 heat pipes with 2 sectional 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.070
 radiator and plastic cover with two 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:58.100
 fans mounted on the breath 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:59.990
 exhale radiator consists of two sections in 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.530
 each of which 45 aluminum 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.420
 plates 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.920
 the distance between which is sufficient 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.360
 big 2 millimeters are not very good 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.940
 performance because the model resembles 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.069
 outdated prolema those mega halens 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.040
 since then technologies including u 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.230
 thermaltake went far ahead for example 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.390
 heat pipes are already being delivered and 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.830
 line up to more evenly 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.220
 distribute heat over the surface 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.220
 plates 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.780
 device height is 15.8 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.260
 centimeters it fit in any 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.209
 body 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.910
 although it will prevent the installation of memory with 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.880
 high radiators west one kilogram 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.740
 93 gamma big and law ear and two 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.640
 fans 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.320
 plastic cover with fans 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.630
 it's pretty easy to shoot 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.370
 pushed to the slits from its sides and 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.550
 fans can be removed from it 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.959
 I will turn off only four screws of self-tapping screws 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.100
 thermaltake when oks new bischin 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.220
 compatible with all without exception 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.470
 modern platforms it distinguishes 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.270
 him from the usual at ag in which at that 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.340
 time there was no support for juice then 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.380
 2011 and 2012 3 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.550
 the price of the cooler starts from two seconds 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.769
 half thousand rubles 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.660
 what can you say is possible to build 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.420
 white beautiful computer with transparent 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.160
 window is worth it though we hope 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:19.470
 thermaltake will release cheaper 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:21.750
 models how he adjacent cooler advise 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.290
 look at him and you laryn 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.290
 bye Bye
