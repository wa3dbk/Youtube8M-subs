00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:07.160
 all beings have a mission I have passed and they all want to put on this planet 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.470
 life that inhabits the land that the conditions of life of all 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:16.710
 species so any kind of cease to exist will bring these are the 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.949
 others 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:21.419
 dove a very important mission 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:26.210
 contributed to the lives of humans that animals six years ago she was withdrawn 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.529
 of an NGO to be treated by an animal protection volunteer who 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.089
 moved with her situation she was on the verge of death 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.620
 but started very malnourished could not stop standing and could hardly 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.680
 to feed 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.800
 but love brings it back 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.870
 were at least 15 days before she started to improve 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.530
 she suffered for being abandoned by the people she loves 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.520
 when to recover from her participated in a campaign to help an NGO 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.469
 pasquitÃ£o actions to be able to continue his work with abandoned animals 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.350
 were at least ten points of astori in curitiba 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.620
 to answer madrid 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.590
 fifteen people who wanted to make any kind of donations the result 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.180
 it was a success 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.310
 so that even people from outside Brazil described how they had 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.610
 story 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.120
 on June 7, 2010 she left this world plus her brand remained 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.530
 sousense was very felt 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.360
 but we know that everything is that you bid farewell to the planet leaving its mark 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.090
 is involved in a larger plan 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.910
 not always the being that only stays dove suffered children and cross the path of 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.600
 back in your favor there are many pigeons out there walking animals 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.090
 the streets will remain in it 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.440
 Someone thinks that they abandon the home to the owner. 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.840
 to be human all that is needed these efforts 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.920
 we need water feed 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.920
 with the same physical needs the animals 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.510
 the mandate is considered the national capital because it has the capacity and 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.880
 society plan things 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.920
 animals are considered international because they do not have the same 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.949
 ability to reason 

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:11.370
 national currency 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.359
 why there are so many abandoned animals on the street 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:16.709
 passing hunger passing cold 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.009
 many humans have not murdered care 

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:25.019
 there are people who abandon animals and tried to justify themselves by saying that 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.589
 knows how to turn 

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:31.469
 Someone already stopped to think how the street animals can turn around 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:32.839
 alone 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:37.169
 will be that the person who abandoned guided his carousel home about how 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:40.169
 protect himself from attacks by humans and other animals 

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:44.809
 where to protect yourself from the rain and the cold messed up money you can get 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:49.649
 food where he will get his side when he feels it and the lack of affection 

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:51.519
 the animals also feel 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.919
 they also deserve to be respected because they are often their lives 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:03:00.449
 People who love will think they abandoned it. Someone will have to 

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:02.839
 to collect the course is just one more 

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:04.849
 millions of animals on the street 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.900
 passing need dying for lack of love and respect 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:11.889
 I did not ask for an 'animal' 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:16.829
 abandonment is a crime that the perpetrator is responsible for all the consequences 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.459
 may this animal come stroll down the street 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.709
 every day some animals are collected in only five volunteers 

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:28.959
 they give preference to the most debilitated but many do not resist and 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:29.979
 die 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:32.519
 because they are not rescued in time 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.200
 because they suffered something and there was no one for adventurers 

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:41.509
 leaves shelters and volunteers do not receive support from the government and does not even 

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:43.639
 salary to help animals 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:47.989
 all are heavily indebted, many abandonments have been taking place for a long time 

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.320
 living in shelters is difficult 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.050
 because all are overcrowded there are no survivors stronger if you can 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.490
 to dispute the food the most debilitated palace die 

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:04.849
 without counting when he needed to deliver in which yes there is no way to occur and he 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.669
 if killed there is no way to stop living on the street is very bad 

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:14.469
 There is no certainty of gaining terol dryness food like pc 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:18.340
 there is no way to protect yourself from the rain and the cold and still risk being 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.120
 ran over 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.660
 5 is just an 'animal' as a nation are not humans and are not the most 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.189
 important than other beings 

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:31.759
 all are a reaction and have one important thing you need to know 

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:37.899
 of the abandoned animals a very small percentage was rescued from those who 

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:39.330
 remain on the street 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.659
 a large percentage higher 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:44.669
 peter cech the corpses go around decomposing 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.710
 through rainwater or, in other words, these animals are brought to the 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.249
 water sheets contaminate water 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:56.719
 the same as people use to drink take a shower 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:05:00.860
 kerber can not eliminate the substances that accumulate in the 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.400
 organism that arise diseases like cancer diarrhea 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.819
 hepatitis and respiratory infection and many others 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.419
 this substance ingested for a long time is not eliminated by the body 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:16.599
 we all run this risk there are always exceptions 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.280
 this can happen to you the worst that can happen to someone you love 

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:24.120
 can be your son 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.069
 your father your brother from your mother 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:31.629
 we must have the awareness of an abandoned animal means all this and he 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:35.960
 there is no culture to punctuate the men who practice these acts and who 

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:39.109
 should realize that it is not just the animal 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.860
 costinha jose who will always be present 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.050
 when the man has no one wants to make talk and walk 

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:51.979
 he will always be with you and giving and appreciating your affection was important 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.490
 It's always being by your side. 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.970
 do not abandon the animal it depends on you while many people are 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.419
 with a calm conscience for getting rid of a problem 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:07.569
 there are highs who lose sleep trying to help that animal leaving behind 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.910
 it's not fair they do not know how to defend 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.729
 nor turn around and carry the suffering and pulp fingers abandonment 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:19.699
 the hand if animals have the same needs 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.939
 are unequal 

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:24.270
 You're not immune to this. 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.450
 who lives for a better world to participate in this transformation 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:32.509
 the fair becomes open when the person is known to make a difference 

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:36.139
 the animals without ever abandoning you 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:39.520
 they are another opportunity to seize weapons 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.379
 help us save the planet sowing is free but harvesting is mandatory 

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:46.090
 think about it
