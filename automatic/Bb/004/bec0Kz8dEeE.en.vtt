gotta<00:01:33.240> have<00:01:33.479> these<00:01:33.890> clicked<00:01:34.890> off<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.310> you

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
gotta have these clicked off and you

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.859 
gotta have these clicked off and you
have<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.000> most<00:01:36.210> important<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.810> have

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
have to the most important is you have

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.890 
have to the most important is you have
to<00:01:37.020> allow<00:01:37.200> your<00:01:37.409> PSP<00:01:38.150> to<00:01:39.150> use<00:01:39.390> your<00:01:39.570> location

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
to allow your PSP to use your location

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.440 
to allow your PSP to use your location
now<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.439> has<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.680> be<00:01:40.770> on<00:01:41.479> sharing<00:01:42.479> settings

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
now so it has to be on sharing settings

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.969 
now so it has to be on sharing settings
if<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.570> want<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.990> share<00:01:46.140> your<00:01:46.200> idea<00:01:46.649> on<00:01:46.710> here

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
if you want to share your idea on here

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.340 
if you want to share your idea on here
you<00:01:47.130> can<00:01:47.430> but<00:01:48.090> for<00:01:48.659> example<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.110> don't<00:01:49.140> really

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
you can but for example you don't really

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.600 
you can but for example you don't really
have<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:51.290> you<00:01:52.290> can<00:01:52.470> pick<00:01:52.740> over<00:01:53.100> here<00:01:53.399> on

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
have to and you can pick over here on

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.880 
have to and you can pick over here on
private<00:01:54.479> games<00:01:54.689> what<00:01:55.049> games<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.560> want<00:01:55.799> to

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
private games what games you want to

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.740 
private games what games you want to
share<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.939> don't<00:01:57.090> really<00:01:57.210> have<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.540> share

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
share so you don't really have to share

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.840
