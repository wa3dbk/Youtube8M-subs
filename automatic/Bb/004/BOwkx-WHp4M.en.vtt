dual rates that are given here actually
dual<00:00:41.629> rates<00:00:41.989> actually<00:00:42.430> increase<00:00:43.430> or<00:00:43.820> decrease

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
dual rates actually increase or decrease

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.020 
dual rates actually increase or decrease
the<00:00:44.390> amount<00:00:44.870> of<00:00:45.260> a<00:00:45.379> travel<00:00:45.860> of<00:00:46.070> a<00:00:46.280> server<00:00:46.640> in

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
the amount of a travel of a server in

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.750 
the amount of a travel of a server in
each<00:00:47.629> direction<00:00:47.989> this<00:00:48.920> means<00:00:49.160> if<00:00:49.370> you<00:00:49.520> want

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
each direction this means if you want

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.260 
each direction this means if you want
maximum<00:00:50.600> steering<00:00:51.290> then<00:00:52.040> you<00:00:52.370> can<00:00:52.610> actually

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
maximum steering then you can actually

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.130 
maximum steering then you can actually
move<00:00:53.600> this<00:00:53.960> dial<00:00:54.770> to<00:00:55.130> write<00:00:56.060> to<00:00:56.600> the<00:00:56.720> maximum

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
move this dial to write to the maximum

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.700 
move this dial to write to the maximum
position<00:00:57.500> if<00:00:57.980> you<00:00:58.610> want<00:00:58.850> minimum<00:00:59.710> steering

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
position if you want minimum steering

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.790 
position if you want minimum steering
you<00:01:01.220> can<00:01:01.430> actually<00:01:02.000> move<00:01:02.329> the<00:01:02.690> dual<00:01:03.020> rate<00:01:03.380> dial

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
you can actually move the dual rate dial

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.109 
you can actually move the dual rate dial
to<00:01:04.580> adjust<00:01:05.509> to<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:06.170> left<00:01:06.410> to<00:01:07.070> adjust<00:01:07.550> to<00:01:08.000> the

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
to adjust to the left to adjust to the

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.210 
to adjust to the left to adjust to the
minimum<00:01:08.509> steering<00:01:08.990> let's<00:01:09.470> check<00:01:09.770> the

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
minimum steering let's check the

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.040 
minimum steering let's check the
controls<00:01:10.670> effect<00:01:13.060> at<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:14.210> moment<00:01:14.570> you<00:01:14.840> can

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
controls effect at the moment you can

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.800 
controls effect at the moment you can
see<00:01:15.440> paying<00:01:16.310> attention<00:01:16.850> to<00:01:16.970> the<00:01:17.060> steering<00:01:17.570> you

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
see paying attention to the steering you

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.900 
see paying attention to the steering you
can<00:01:17.990> see<00:01:18.259> I<00:01:18.440> have<00:01:18.470> got<00:01:18.830> the<00:01:19.009> full<00:01:19.399> clearance

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
can see I have got the full clearance

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.990 
can see I have got the full clearance
that<00:01:20.690> is<00:01:20.869> maximum<00:01:21.380> steering<00:01:21.740> now<00:01:22.220> if<00:01:22.490> I<00:01:22.670> want

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
that is maximum steering now if I want

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.030 
that is maximum steering now if I want
if<00:01:23.210> I'm<00:01:23.360> having<00:01:23.540> difficulties<00:01:24.380> driving<00:01:24.920> on

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
if I'm having difficulties driving on

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.210 
if I'm having difficulties driving on
this<00:01:25.220> steering<00:01:25.640> I<00:01:25.880> came<00:01:26.360> here<00:01:26.979> adjust<00:01:27.979> the

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
this steering I came here adjust the

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.289 
this steering I came here adjust the
dual<00:01:28.850> rates<00:01:29.299> and<00:01:30.549> decrease<00:01:31.549> the<00:01:31.580> steering

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
dual rates and decrease the steering

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.840 
dual rates and decrease the steering
travel<00:01:32.750> you<00:01:32.900> can<00:01:33.080> see<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:34.159> steering<00:01:34.640> doesn't

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
travel you can see the steering doesn't

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.980 
travel you can see the steering doesn't
turn<00:01:35.570> that<00:01:35.840> much<00:01:36.140> it's<00:01:36.439> kind<00:01:36.770> of<00:01:36.890> soft<00:01:37.990> turning

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
turn that much it's kind of soft turning

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.100 
turn that much it's kind of soft turning
it<00:01:39.110> to<00:01:39.290> the<00:01:39.409> right<00:01:39.590> and<00:01:40.330> you<00:01:41.330> can<00:01:41.510> see<00:01:41.750> this<00:01:41.930> is

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
it to the right and you can see this is

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.020 
it to the right and you can see this is
full<00:01:42.380> steering<00:01:42.860> when<00:01:43.040> I'm<00:01:43.189> decreasing<00:01:43.909> the

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
full steering when I'm decreasing the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.160 
full steering when I'm decreasing the
dual<00:01:44.240> rates<00:01:44.600> you<00:01:45.500> can<00:01:45.530> see<00:01:46.010> the<00:01:46.580> steering

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
dual rates you can see the steering

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.359 
dual rates you can see the steering
decreases<00:01:48.170> now<00:01:49.159> I<00:01:49.400> don't<00:01:49.520> have<00:01:50.090> full<00:01:50.509> steering

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
decreases now I don't have full steering

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.580 
decreases now I don't have full steering
if<00:01:52.369> I<00:01:52.820> want<00:01:53.090> maximum<00:01:53.600> steering<00:01:54.140> I<00:01:54.350> can

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
if I want maximum steering I can

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.090 
if I want maximum steering I can
increase<00:01:55.040> do<00:01:55.610> dual<00:01:56.150> rates<00:01:56.390> and<00:01:57.080> get<00:01:57.560> as<00:01:57.799> much

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
increase do dual rates and get as much

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.270 
increase do dual rates and get as much
steering<00:01:58.670> as<00:01:59.090> I<00:01:59.420> want<00:01:59.920> according<00:02:00.920> to<00:02:00.950> my

endpoint<00:02:15.860> actually<00:02:16.549> decides<00:02:17.060> how<00:02:17.900> much<00:02:17.930> a

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
endpoint actually decides how much a

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.710 
endpoint actually decides how much a
server<00:02:18.799> should<00:02:19.130> travel<00:02:19.430> in<00:02:19.730> each<00:02:19.940> direction<00:02:20.180> n

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
server should travel in each direction n

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.100 
server should travel in each direction n
points<00:02:21.560> actually<00:02:21.709> limit<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.910> treble<00:02:23.390> off<00:02:23.570> a

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
points actually limit the treble off a

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.460 
points actually limit the treble off a

so<00:02:27.070> I'm<00:02:27.460> going<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:27.760> add<00:02:27.910> just<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.470> endpoints

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
so I'm going to add just the endpoints

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.090 
so I'm going to add just the endpoints
of<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.970> steering<00:02:30.970> here<00:02:31.390> first<00:02:32.140> remember

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
of the steering here first remember

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.880 
of the steering here first remember
clockwise<00:02:34.650> movement<00:02:35.730> means<00:02:36.730> increase<00:02:37.480> and

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
clockwise movement means increase and

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.010 
clockwise movement means increase and
anti-clockwise<00:02:38.890> means<00:02:39.550> decrease<00:02:40.210> let's<00:02:40.840> see

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
anti-clockwise means decrease let's see

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.240 
anti-clockwise means decrease let's see
the<00:02:41.230> results<00:02:41.890> of<00:02:42.010> these<00:02:42.640> controls<00:02:44.250> adjusting

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
the results of these controls adjusting

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.570 
the results of these controls adjusting
the<00:02:45.940> right<00:02:46.270> endpoint<00:02:47.110> you<00:02:47.650> can<00:02:47.830> see<00:02:48.160> I<00:02:48.370> have

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
the right endpoint you can see I have

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.350 
the right endpoint you can see I have
full<00:02:49.210> movement<00:02:50.140> but<00:02:50.770> when<00:02:51.070> I<00:02:51.340> adjust<00:02:52.120> the

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
full movement but when I adjust the

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.280 
full movement but when I adjust the
endpoint<00:02:52.990> I<00:02:53.320> can<00:02:53.890> actually<00:02:54.390> tell<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.750> servo

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
endpoint I can actually tell the servo

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.310 
endpoint I can actually tell the servo
where<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.280> actually<00:02:57.880> stop<00:02:58.270> this<00:02:58.540> means<00:02:58.780> i<00:02:59.110> can

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
where to actually stop this means i can

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.880 
where to actually stop this means i can
set<00:02:59.740> a<00:02:59.980> limit<00:03:00.400> on<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:01.420> right<00:03:01.630> term<00:03:01.959> while<00:03:02.530> I

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
set a limit on the right term while I

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.810 
set a limit on the right term while I
have<00:03:03.340> told<00:03:04.030> pork<00:03:04.480> set<00:03:05.440> to<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:06.010> left<00:03:06.310> hand<00:03:06.610> as

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
have told pork set to the left hand as

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.260 
have told pork set to the left hand as
well<00:03:07.060> I<00:03:07.360> can<00:03:08.020> actually<00:03:08.620> make<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:09.610> full<00:03:09.940> or

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
well I can actually make the full or

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.250 
well I can actually make the full or
maximum<00:03:11.020> left<00:03:11.320> turn<00:03:11.650> and<00:03:11.970> I<00:03:12.970> can<00:03:13.660> make<00:03:13.959> a

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
maximum left turn and I can make a

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.699 
maximum left turn and I can make a
little<00:03:15.070> amount<00:03:15.400> of<00:03:15.610> right<00:03:16.270> turn<00:03:16.600> this<00:03:17.380> means

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
little amount of right turn this means

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.630 
little amount of right turn this means
by<00:03:18.070> setting<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:19.209> steering<00:03:19.810> endpoints<00:03:20.770> I<00:03:20.890> can

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
by setting the steering endpoints I can

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.080 
by setting the steering endpoints I can
actually<00:03:21.910> tell<00:03:22.690> the<00:03:23.020> steering<00:03:23.440> servo<00:03:23.950> on<00:03:24.160> each

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
actually tell the steering servo on each

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.710 
actually tell the steering servo on each
direction<00:03:25.540> where<00:03:26.500> it<00:03:26.920> should<00:03:27.550> end<00:03:27.700> its<00:03:28.180> travel

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
direction where it should end its travel

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.530 
direction where it should end its travel
setting<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.770> end<00:03:29.950> points<00:03:30.580> on<00:03:30.790> the<00:03:31.330> throttle

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
setting the end points on the throttle

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.490 
setting the end points on the throttle
will<00:03:32.320> actually<00:03:32.830> do<00:03:33.100> the<00:03:33.640> same<00:03:33.940> thing<00:03:34.500> coming

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
will actually do the same thing coming

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.490 
will actually do the same thing coming
down<00:03:35.709> to<00:03:36.190> total<00:03:37.000> and<00:03:37.500> with<00:03:38.500> steering<00:03:38.800> reverse

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
down to total and with steering reverse

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.259 
down to total and with steering reverse
just<00:03:41.500> in<00:03:41.680> case<00:03:41.890> if<00:03:42.190> you<00:03:42.310> find<00:03:42.610> by<00:03:42.910> turning

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
just in case if you find by turning

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.330 
just in case if you find by turning
right<00:03:43.600> your<00:03:43.959> heart<00:03:44.290> turns<00:03:44.590> left<00:03:44.890> and<00:03:45.160> by

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
right your heart turns left and by

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.540 
right your heart turns left and by
turning<00:03:45.610> left<00:03:46.060> your<00:03:46.420> car<00:03:46.660> turns<00:03:46.959> right<00:03:47.550> you

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
turning left your car turns right you

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.050 
turning left your car turns right you
can<00:03:48.760> easily<00:03:49.300> solve<00:03:49.600> this<00:03:49.810> problem<00:03:50.350> by

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
can easily solve this problem by

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.890 
can easily solve this problem by
reversing<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.360> channel<00:03:53.170> one<00:03:53.410> or<00:03:53.820> this

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
reversing the channel one or this

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.350 
reversing the channel one or this
steering<00:03:55.900> channel<00:03:56.500> here<00:03:57.220> it<00:03:57.430> is<00:03:57.459> the<00:03:58.000> steering

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
steering channel here it is the steering

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.240 
steering channel here it is the steering
channel<00:03:58.750> reverse<00:03:59.440> I'm<00:04:00.280> gonna<00:04:00.610> reverse<00:04:01.090> it<00:04:01.330> and

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
channel reverse I'm gonna reverse it and

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.020 
channel reverse I'm gonna reverse it and
now<00:04:03.250> you<00:04:03.519> guess<00:04:04.350> you're<00:04:05.350> staring<00:04:05.860> going<00:04:06.489> into

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
now you guess you're staring going into

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.120 
now you guess you're staring going into
the<00:04:07.299> right<00:04:07.510> direction<00:04:07.750> when<00:04:08.380> you<00:04:08.560> pull<00:04:09.100> the

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
the right direction when you pull the

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.300 
the right direction when you pull the
throttle<00:04:09.580> and<00:04:09.880> your<00:04:10.390> car<00:04:10.660> goes<00:04:10.870> in<00:04:10.900> reverse

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
throttle and your car goes in reverse

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.240 
throttle and your car goes in reverse
you<00:04:12.310> can<00:04:12.549> actually<00:04:12.820> reverse<00:04:13.570> the<00:04:14.350> throttle

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
you can actually reverse the throttle

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.420 
you can actually reverse the throttle
reverse<00:04:15.489> switch<00:04:15.910> and<00:04:16.260> make<00:04:17.260> your<00:04:17.500> car<00:04:17.769> move<00:04:18.130> in

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
reverse switch and make your car move in

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.789 
reverse switch and make your car move in
the<00:04:18.790> right<00:04:18.970> direction<00:04:19.080> that<00:04:20.080> is<00:04:20.200> forward<00:04:20.650> or

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
the right direction that is forward or

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.350 
the right direction that is forward or
backward<00:04:21.370> so<00:04:21.940> remember<00:04:22.650> pushing<00:04:23.650> up<00:04:24.070> break<00:04:25.030> or

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
backward so remember pushing up break or

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.530 
backward so remember pushing up break or
your<00:04:26.140> car<00:04:26.380> should<00:04:26.590> move<00:04:26.830> backward<00:04:27.700> if<00:04:27.880> it<00:04:28.390> is

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
your car should move backward if it is

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.200 
your car should move backward if it is
electric<00:04:28.960> if<00:04:29.290> it<00:04:29.650> is<00:04:29.770> Nitro<00:04:30.250> your<00:04:30.669> car<00:04:30.970> will

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
electric if it is Nitro your car will

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.680 
electric if it is Nitro your car will
help<00:04:31.419> break<00:04:31.660> on<00:04:31.930> pushing<00:04:32.860> well<00:04:33.550> that's<00:04:34.060> it<00:04:34.300> for

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
help break on pushing well that's it for

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:35.690 
help break on pushing well that's it for
this<00:04:34.930> too

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700
