00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello to all of us we find ourselves 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:12.690
 for a new video I had you 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:16.320
 said that I was going to do on the map 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.710
 I like I'm going to go there they go 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:24.949
 do not like hello to youtube what 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:27.830
 is pretty cool here's that way 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:32.460
 moubarak is twenty years old 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:34.500
 versailles 8 the job here and a lot of 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.559
 jump years old who knows well there are ten wounds 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.280
 and bumps pc it's a very server 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.579
 cool so here is the first jump that is 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.440
 pretty easy sorry if you do not hear 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.899
 from the beginning my keyboard I'm 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.449
 really sorry I just heard that 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.620
 approach to the first giant video 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.629
 while you hear my keyboard 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.480
 and then that's a little disappointed I 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.210
 not want to redo the video but when 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.300
 even that was a little bit smooth and that's it 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.659
 he wants then there are levels 2 gt 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.950
 difficult and easy but really he 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.140
 ya it's pretty easy this especially does not 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.970
 not being fooled by this block I had 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.130
 to have many times in difficulty 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.780
 normal level 1 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.380
 you had to be a little too easy 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.380
 for me so yes sometimes there was 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.840

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.200

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.479
 door 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.549
 finally what I teleport to you this 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.970
 that we can stepper employment we can 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.509
 teleport 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.380
 this block is very hard I can not do it 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.600
 all the time it's a bit of a pity 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.630
 then madness full full of young people 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:50.369

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:54.119

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.010
 that they want to pvp with that the 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.530
 other pvp ie you are finally without 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.670
 killing are realizing the snowboards 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.900

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:36.050

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.860
 sent a gg geris I already managed a 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.710
 times the whole map 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.720
 which was a little bit there so 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.000
 that they refine resources a source 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.490
 Turkish ihh who chicken I not why he 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.600

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.760
 yeah that's right no need for beauty 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.680
 on a certain john buck race but when 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.680
 even I think it's a little bit pretty 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.600
 see there are lords there are a lot 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.760
 of rats all this is a very server 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:19.580
 cool I always got on 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:19.580
 waiter it was cecile and well then here 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.920
 that's where it started 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:31.819
 difficult very difficult even times 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.799
 they tell you to support guessing that it 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.700
 do it's the boot if you press it press 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:39.379
 that it does what you always have to do 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.209
 come forward director you do not need 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:44.659
 to go on you can directly 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.920
 skip Bayonnais will believe are here 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:48.140
 but stuff 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.290
 especially do not loot it if not the 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.239
 atari 'game will be safe should not be 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.030
 damage finally since I see that 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:59.599
 you do not go back 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:02.440
 Well, it will continue after, but 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:02.440
 I try to do it 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:24.139
 just to do it to show this 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:27.410
 what not to do and I already succeeded 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:29.710
 once but it really good but me 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.710
 feel very good 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.430
 here 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:43.630
 it's really really hard really 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:46.300
 hard this is very much really hard 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.160
 directly hard that we spent during 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.150
 eighteen years old every time we go 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:54.460
 to arrive it had to cost that ofas a 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.069
 technique then every time as soon as we 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.240
 was here even trying to go there and 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:00.400
 as soon as we were there we were teleported 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.199
 someone who stays and there we tried 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.780
 to go there if there was not a 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:11.949
 stepper to the other that was really 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:14.729
 exhausting me I'm Parisian it was 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:14.729
 really really hard 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:30.400
