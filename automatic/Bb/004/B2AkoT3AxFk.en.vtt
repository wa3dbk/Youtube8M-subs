00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
hopefully then what they can eat and

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.850 
hopefully then what they can eat and
then<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.390> waste<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.810> comes<00:01:28.110> out<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.469> that<00:01:28.500> we

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
into that earth tub so that we can

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.639 
into that earth tub so that we can
compost<00:01:41.729> those<00:01:42.000> scraps<00:01:42.359> and<00:01:42.659> that's<00:01:43.079> used<00:01:43.380> by

composting<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.229> what<00:01:49.500> that's<00:01:49.679> done<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:49.950> it's

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
composting and what that's done is it's

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.410 
composting and what that's done is it's
helped<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:51.710> to<00:01:52.710> kind<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.159> divert<00:01:53.549> 40<00:01:53.969> pounds

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
helped to to kind of divert 40 pounds

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.330 
helped to to kind of divert 40 pounds
that<00:01:54.750> would<00:01:54.899> go<00:01:55.049> into<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.350> landfill<00:01:55.920> into

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
that would go into a landfill into

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.279 
that would go into a landfill into
something<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:56.969> can<00:01:57.210> be<00:01:57.270> reused<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.990> closed

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
something that can be reused and closed

something that can be reused and closed
that<00:01:58.469> cycle<00:01:58.859> on<00:01:58.920> campus<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.549> the<00:02:00.060> food<00:02:00.270> we<00:02:00.420> get

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
that cycle on campus of the food we get

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.910 
that cycle on campus of the food we get
in<00:02:00.689> especially<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.350> summer<00:02:01.590> when<00:02:01.799> we're

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
in especially in the summer when we're

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.410 
in especially in the summer when we're
getting<00:02:02.039> it<00:02:02.249> from<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.490> CC<00:02:02.789> student<00:02:02.969> garden

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
getting it from the CC student garden

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.060 
getting it from the CC student garden
we're<00:02:03.869> getting<00:02:04.109> in<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.289> food<00:02:04.499> we're<00:02:04.770> serving

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
we're getting in the food we're serving

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.950 
we're getting in the food we're serving
it<00:02:05.130> here<00:02:05.399> were<00:02:05.759> composting<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.509> waste<00:02:06.689> and

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
it here were composting the waste and

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.660 
it here were composting the waste and
then<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.710> compost<00:02:08.100> is<00:02:08.310> going<00:02:08.520> back

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
then that that compost is going back

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.900 
then that that compost is going back
over<00:02:08.880> to<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.210> garden

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
over to the garden

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.550 
over to the garden
is<00:02:10.060> a<00:02:10.090> really<00:02:10.330> great<00:02:10.540> closed-loop<00:02:11.050> in<00:02:11.440> the

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
is a really great closed-loop in the

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.950 
is a really great closed-loop in the
system
