here thats a wordpress if you have a
shared<00:00:39.149> hosting<00:00:39.750> account<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.980> might<00:00:41.430> have<00:00:41.670> a

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
shared hosting account you might have a

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.970 
shared hosting account you might have a
control<00:00:42.360> panel<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:43.020> looks<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.290> bit<00:00:43.469> like<00:00:43.530> this

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
control panel that looks a bit like this

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.680

a<00:00:44.040> lot<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.700> hosting<00:00:45.660> providers<00:00:46.170> are<00:00:46.379> using<00:00:47.190> a

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
a lot of hosting providers are using a

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.220 
a lot of hosting providers are using a
cheaper<00:00:48.690> version<00:00:49.789> than<00:00:50.789> cpanel<00:00:51.539> if<00:00:51.690> you've

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
cheaper version than cpanel if you've

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.260
