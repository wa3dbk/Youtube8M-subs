00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
okay and so this is what we have after

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.599 
okay and so this is what we have after
we<00:00:03.000> disassembled<00:00:03.720> all<00:00:04.080> the<00:00:04.470> components<00:00:05.069> this

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
we disassembled all the components this

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.940 
we disassembled all the components this
other<00:00:06.029> handle<00:00:06.480> by<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.779> way<00:00:07.020> can<00:00:07.440> also<00:00:07.620> be

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
other handle by the way can also be

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.629 
other handle by the way can also be
unscrewed<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:09.019> taken<00:00:10.019> off<00:00:10.170> this<00:00:10.639> threaded

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
unscrewed and taken off this threaded

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.849 
unscrewed and taken off this threaded
rod<00:00:11.880> so<00:00:13.130> just<00:00:14.130> like<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.820> original<00:00:15.740> and<00:00:16.740> then

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
rod so just like the original and then

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.570 
rod so just like the original and then
we<00:00:16.980> have<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.310> two<00:00:17.520> brass<00:00:18.390> base<00:00:18.900> plates<00:00:19.580> the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
we have the two brass base plates the

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.900 
we have the two brass base plates the
little<00:00:20.820> fastener<00:00:21.710> slide<00:00:22.710> plate<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.189> then

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
little fastener slide plate and then

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.650 
little fastener slide plate and then
this<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:25.189> the<00:00:26.189> internal<00:00:26.580> mechanism<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.480> the

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
this is the internal mechanism of the

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.080 
this is the internal mechanism of the
door<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.109> it's<00:00:28.830> extremely<00:00:29.310> easy<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.760> open

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
door and it's extremely easy to open

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.410 
door and it's extremely easy to open
this<00:00:30.330> up<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.720> just<00:00:30.960> one<00:00:31.700> flat<00:00:32.700> head

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
this up it just one flat head

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.310 
this up it just one flat head
screwdriver<00:00:34.880> do<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.000> drink<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.079> take<00:00:37.290> a

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
screwdriver do the drink so you take a

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:49.760 
screwdriver do the drink so you take a
screwdriver<00:00:45.079> screw<00:00:46.079> this<00:00:46.230> one<00:00:46.469> screw<00:00:48.770> and

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
screwdriver screw this one screw and

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.650 
screwdriver screw this one screw and
then<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.100> just<00:00:50.579> wiggle<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.969> faceplate<00:00:51.510> off

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
then you just wiggle the faceplate off

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.500 
then you just wiggle the faceplate off
simple<00:00:52.620> as<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.059> what<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.360> looks

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
simple as that and this is what it looks

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.700 
simple as that and this is what it looks
like<00:00:54.690> inside<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.530> have<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:56.149> the<00:00:57.469> slide<00:00:58.469> plate

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
like inside you have the the slide plate

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.790 
like inside you have the the slide plate
that<00:00:58.949> comes<00:00:59.190> in<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.550> out<00:01:00.410> when<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:01.590> little

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
that comes in and out when this little

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.960 
that comes in and out when this little
wheel<00:01:02.550> turns<00:01:04.489> it<00:01:05.600> pushes<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.810> plate<00:01:07.970> back

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
wheel turns it pushes this plate back

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.620 
wheel turns it pushes this plate back
and<00:01:09.180> forth<00:01:09.979> you<00:01:10.979> can<00:01:11.010> see<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.270> where<00:01:12.479> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
and forth you can see this is where the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.160 
and forth you can see this is where the
handle<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.500> here's<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.700> key<00:01:15.509> key

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
handle is and here's the key key

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.890 
handle is and here's the key key
mechanism<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:16.979> when<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.909> stick<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.659> and

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
mechanism and when you stick this in and

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.420 
mechanism and when you stick this in and
this<00:01:19.290> turns<00:01:20.150> will<00:01:21.150> slide<00:01:21.509> this<00:01:21.810> well<00:01:22.430> let's

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
this turns will slide this well let's

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.730 
this turns will slide this well let's
have<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.790> face<00:01:24.000> light<00:01:24.299> there<00:01:24.540> but<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.470> will

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
have the face light there but it will

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.490 
have the face light there but it will
slide<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:27.000> out<00:01:27.180> let's<00:01:28.140> pick<00:01:28.470> another

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
slide that in and out let's pick another

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.969 
slide that in and out let's pick another
piece<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.759> I'm<00:01:30.150> going<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.450> be<00:01:30.630> just

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
piece so I'm going to be just

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.620 
piece so I'm going to be just
disassembling<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.220> piece<00:01:33.119> by<00:01:33.329> piece

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
disassembling this piece by piece

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.289 
disassembling this piece by piece
those<00:01:34.049> little<00:01:34.350> spring<00:01:34.740> mechanism<00:01:34.890> there<00:01:35.460> and

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
those little spring mechanism there and

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.960 
those little spring mechanism there and
so<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.689> first<00:01:37.110> take<00:01:37.350> off<00:01:37.560> slightly<00:01:39.320> and<00:01:40.970> then

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
so you first take off slightly and then

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.080 
so you first take off slightly and then
they<00:01:42.479> all<00:01:42.689> sort<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.350> just<00:01:43.409> come<00:01:43.770> out<00:01:44.090> this

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
they all sort of just come out this

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:58.440 
they all sort of just come out this
little<00:01:45.390> piece<00:01:45.540> here<00:01:48.290> is<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.409> lock

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.630 

this<00:01:59.450> piece<00:01:59.860> the<00:02:00.860> only<00:02:01.040> piece<00:02:01.280> that<00:02:01.310> really

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
this piece the only piece that really

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.880 
this piece the only piece that really
doesn't<00:02:02.060> you<00:02:02.270> can<00:02:02.630> take<00:02:02.930> this<00:02:03.110> out<00:02:03.320> but<00:02:03.710> this

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
doesn't you can take this out but this

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.100 
doesn't you can take this out but this
is<00:02:03.950> a<00:02:04.130> little<00:02:04.370> spring<00:02:04.820> I'll<00:02:05.450> just<00:02:05.870> leave<00:02:06.080> that

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
is a little spring I'll just leave that

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.410 
is a little spring I'll just leave that
in<00:02:06.440> it's<00:02:06.620> a<00:02:06.680> little<00:02:06.740> more<00:02:06.950> difficult<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:07.670> take

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
in it's a little more difficult to take

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
so after a little bit of work I did get

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.960 
so after a little bit of work I did get
it<00:03:09.060> looking<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.930> lot<00:03:10.050> better<00:03:10.350> a<00:03:11.280> lot<00:03:11.340> better

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
it looking a lot better a lot better

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.470 
it looking a lot better a lot better
than<00:03:12.330> what<00:03:12.540> all<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.320> paint<00:03:13.590> before<00:03:14.420> I'm<00:03:15.420> happy

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
than what all the paint before I'm happy

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.840 
than what all the paint before I'm happy
about<00:03:15.810> that<00:03:16.110> and<00:03:16.350> now<00:03:16.800> I<00:03:17.070> want<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.550> basically

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
about that and now I want to basically

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.790 
about that and now I want to basically
clean<00:03:18.450> off<00:03:18.660> all<00:03:18.870> these<00:03:19.050> little<00:03:19.200> components

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
clean off all these little components

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.380 
clean off all these little components
and<00:03:19.920> I'm<00:03:20.010> just<00:03:20.220> going<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.460> use<00:03:20.610> a<00:03:20.640> nice<00:03:20.970> three

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
and I'm just going to use a nice three

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.350 
and I'm just going to use a nice three
three<00:03:22.050> in<00:03:22.140> one<00:03:22.350> oil<00:03:22.500> and<00:03:22.920> a<00:03:23.670> paper<00:03:23.940> towel<00:03:24.120> and

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
three in one oil and a paper towel and

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.490 
three in one oil and a paper towel and
I'll<00:03:24.900> wipe<00:03:25.170> these<00:03:25.490> clean<00:03:26.490> oil<00:03:26.790> them<00:03:27.120> up<00:03:27.350> to<00:03:28.350> get

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
I'll wipe these clean oil them up to get

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.300 
I'll wipe these clean oil them up to get
it<00:03:28.590> nice<00:03:28.770> and<00:03:29.450> lubricated<00:03:30.680> so<00:03:31.680> I<00:03:31.740> lubricated

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
it nice and lubricated so I lubricated

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.250 
it nice and lubricated so I lubricated
all<00:03:32.460> the<00:03:32.580> parts<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:33.120> so<00:03:33.690> next<00:03:33.990> comes

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
all the parts and so next comes

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260 
all the parts and so next comes
reassembly<00:03:35.190> now<00:03:35.790> I<00:03:35.820> don't<00:03:36.120> necessarily

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
reassembly now I don't necessarily

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.540 
reassembly now I don't necessarily
expect<00:03:36.750> you<00:03:36.990> to<00:03:37.470> remember<00:03:37.770> how<00:03:38.130> everything

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
expect you to remember how everything

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.220 
expect you to remember how everything
went<00:03:38.790> in<00:03:39.060> so<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:39.450> best<00:03:39.600> thing<00:03:39.870> you<00:03:40.050> could

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
went in so the best thing you could

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.010 
went in so the best thing you could
probably<00:03:40.410> do<00:03:40.950> is<00:03:41.400> take<00:03:42.120> a<00:03:42.150> picture<00:03:42.360> before<00:03:42.750> you

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
probably do is take a picture before you

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.320 
probably do is take a picture before you
take<00:03:43.230> all<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:43.500> little<00:03:43.560> parts<00:03:44.040> out<00:03:44.280> they<00:03:45.209> all

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
take all the little parts out they all

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.830 
take all the little parts out they all
generally<00:03:45.840> look<00:03:46.050> the<00:03:46.230> same<00:03:46.500> these<00:03:46.830> these<00:03:47.160> old

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
generally look the same these these old

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.240 
generally look the same these these old
fixtures<00:03:48.840> but<00:03:49.380> there's<00:03:49.590> some<00:03:49.830> subtle

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
fixtures but there's some subtle

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.440 
fixtures but there's some subtle
differences<00:03:50.760> so<00:03:51.060> they<00:03:51.240> they<00:03:51.630> each<00:03:51.900> go<00:03:52.140> come<00:03:52.440> in

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
differences so they they each go come in

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.630 
differences so they they each go come in
reassemble<00:03:54.450> a<00:03:54.570> little<00:03:54.900> bit<00:03:55.050> different<00:03:55.350> and<00:03:56.280> so

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
reassemble a little bit different and so

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.640 
reassemble a little bit different and so
this<00:03:57.120> one<00:03:57.390> I<00:03:57.420> just<00:03:57.750> put<00:03:57.990> in<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.260> locking

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
this one I just put in the locking

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.460 
this one I just put in the locking
mechanism<00:03:59.280> there

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.260 

okay<00:04:04.470> nearly<00:04:04.890> almost<00:04:05.130> got<00:04:05.580> it<00:04:05.700> all<00:04:05.850> complete

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
okay nearly almost got it all complete

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.520 
okay nearly almost got it all complete
now<00:04:06.870> for<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.320> little<00:04:07.530> latch<00:04:09.140> now<00:04:10.140> this<00:04:10.350> could

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
now for the little latch now this could

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.500 
now for the little latch now this could
go<00:04:10.680> on<00:04:10.860> this<00:04:11.010> way<00:04:11.220> or<00:04:11.580> this<00:04:11.850> way<00:04:11.910> you<00:04:12.330> have<00:04:12.450> to

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
go on this way or this way you have to

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.390 
go on this way or this way you have to
remember<00:04:12.989> which<00:04:13.170> way<00:04:13.350> it<00:04:13.470> originally<00:04:13.920> came<00:04:14.130> in

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
remember which way it originally came in

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.240 
remember which way it originally came in
and<00:04:14.610> you<00:04:15.120> wanted<00:04:15.510> to<00:04:15.540> shut<00:04:15.989> properly<00:04:16.500> for<00:04:17.130> your

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
and you wanted to shut properly for your

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.570 
and you wanted to shut properly for your
particular<00:04:17.489> doors<00:04:17.910> so<00:04:18.540> if<00:04:19.320> I<00:04:19.470> recall<00:04:19.769> it<00:04:20.340> goes

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
particular doors so if I recall it goes

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:26.300 
particular doors so if I recall it goes
in<00:04:20.760> this<00:04:20.940> way<00:04:21.180> and<00:04:22.190> then<00:04:24.770> get<00:04:25.770> through<00:04:26.100> here

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
in this way and then get through here

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.340 
in this way and then get through here
and<00:04:26.490> then<00:04:26.669> I<00:04:26.790> assemble<00:04:27.510> put<00:04:27.780> in<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.229> little

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
and then I assemble put in the little

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.520 
and then I assemble put in the little
spring<00:04:28.830> mechanism<00:04:29.100> and<00:04:29.840> there<00:04:30.840> and<00:04:31.080> then<00:04:31.290> you

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
spring mechanism and there and then you

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.790 
spring mechanism and there and then you
kind<00:04:31.770> of<00:04:31.890> move<00:04:32.130> things<00:04:32.640> around<00:04:33.470> make<00:04:34.470> things

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
kind of move things around make things

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.500 
kind of move things around make things
make<00:04:35.250> sure<00:04:35.280> things<00:04:35.790> work<00:04:36.120> properly

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.080 

and<00:04:42.470> everything<00:04:42.860> is<00:04:42.980> good<00:04:43.220> and<00:04:43.460> then<00:04:43.970> you

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
and everything is good and then you

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.750 
and everything is good and then you
could<00:04:44.270> put<00:04:44.420> back<00:04:44.690> the<00:04:45.140> face<00:04:45.410> plate<00:04:45.830> backing

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
could put back the face plate backing

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:54.400 
could put back the face plate backing
plate<00:04:48.670> put<00:04:49.670> back<00:04:49.880> the<00:04:50.060> screw<00:04:52.420> and<00:04:53.420> then<00:04:54.170> just

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
plate put back the screw and then just

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.520 
plate put back the screw and then just
make<00:04:54.590> sure<00:04:54.800> it<00:04:54.980> works<00:04:55.250> properly<00:04:55.400> everything

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
make sure it works properly everything

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:14.950 
make sure it works properly everything
moves<00:04:57.530> around<00:04:58.480> taking<00:04:59.480> this<00:04:59.630> up<00:05:09.040> works<00:05:13.150> and<00:05:14.150> it

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
moves around taking this up works and it

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.380 
moves around taking this up works and it
looks<00:05:15.230> free<00:05:16.930> okay<00:05:17.930> next<00:05:18.500> we<00:05:18.710> go<00:05:19.180> clean<00:05:20.180> these

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
looks free okay next we go clean these

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.660 
looks free okay next we go clean these
up
