00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.639
 hello very good I come to perform in 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.980
 Escapist game is a game that is already 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.260
 revealed a while ago on my channel but 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.360
 As it is an old game it is good 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.100
 from time to time we remember 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.949
 At the end of the video I put a link 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.680
 for the revelation of the game for 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.349
 those who wish to manufacture it or know 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.590
 how do you do it if you buy it in my in 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:33.230
 three point is this game is done with 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.470
 four cards 1 2 3 and 4 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.870
 and one of them 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.160
 is one in fact that's why we use the 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.900
 escapist 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.580
 the story works more or less than this 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:49.000
 way the king was guarded locked 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:51.790
 and guarded in a fortress of agreement 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.250
 so that he did not escape and was watched by 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:58.960
 three guardians who are represented 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:04.119
 for three eights of hearts one 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:06.300
 2 and 3 agree of these three during 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:09.810
 the day this side courtyard of the fortress 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:13.780
 so the rug represents the patio 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.820
 during the day he was watched by one of 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.850
 the three guards lift us guardians to 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.840
 being day did not need to be 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:27.490
 did all but during the night 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:31.329
 for the king's ability to escape this 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.149
 was guarded by two guardians then 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:36.670
 what the two guardians did was 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:40.640
 to keep them from escaping was 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.540
 stand in between 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.300
 the two 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.810
 enjoyed one on each side in between 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.730
 King 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:55.020
 good in the middle but despite the strong 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:56.930
 surveillance this one always got 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.540
 escape 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.460
 and to walk during the night by the patio 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.990
 I hope you liked it as I have already 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:10.149

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.690
