gonna learn about how we can apply

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.939 
gonna learn about how we can apply
radicals<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.280> everyday<00:00:14.610> life<00:00:14.900> now<00:00:15.900> well<00:00:16.740> see

radicals to everyday life now well see

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.010 
radicals to everyday life now well see
when<00:00:17.070> you<00:00:17.130> think<00:00:17.160> about<00:00:17.340> radicals<00:00:17.970> or<00:00:18.330> square

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
when you think about radicals or square

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.779 
when you think about radicals or square
roots<00:00:19.289> or<00:00:19.560> cubic<00:00:19.890> roots<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.340> guess<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:20.760> just

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
roots or cubic roots I guess you just

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.820 
roots or cubic roots I guess you just
think<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.330> boring<00:00:21.689> old<00:00:21.840> algebra<00:00:22.500> textbook

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
think of a boring old algebra textbook

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.370 
think of a boring old algebra textbook
but<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:24.390> doesn't<00:00:24.689> really<00:00:24.779> have<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.109> be<00:00:25.140> that

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
but it doesn't really have to be that

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.200 
but it doesn't really have to be that
way

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
way

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.150 
way
radicals<00:00:27.210> in<00:00:27.300> everyday<00:00:27.630> life<00:00:27.840> are<00:00:28.199> used<00:00:28.680> well

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
radicals in everyday life are used well

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.470 
radicals in everyday life are used well
every<00:00:29.939> day<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:31.189> the<00:00:32.189> eASIC<00:00:32.520> stick<00:00:32.700> isn't<00:00:32.969> the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
every day so the eASIC stick isn't the

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.170 
every day so the eASIC stick isn't the
easiest<00:00:33.840> example<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.770> radical<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.700> we<00:00:36.059> can

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
easiest example of a radical that we can

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.970 
easiest example of a radical that we can
think<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:36.540> everyday<00:00:36.780> life<00:00:37.020> would<00:00:37.290> be<00:00:37.440> to

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
think of in everyday life would be to

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.670 
think of in everyday life would be to
figure<00:00:38.370> out<00:00:38.579> for<00:00:39.420> example<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.050> surface<00:00:40.350> area

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
figure out for example the surface area

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.410 
figure out for example the surface area
of<00:00:40.770> something<00:00:41.100> let's<00:00:41.370> say<00:00:41.610> you're<00:00:41.790> building<00:00:42.000> a

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
of something let's say you're building a

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.069 
of something let's say you're building a
shelf<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.910> this<00:00:44.910> shelf<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.539> gonna<00:00:45.780> look<00:00:45.930> like

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
shelf and this shelf is gonna look like

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.020 
shelf and this shelf is gonna look like
this<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.649> it's<00:00:46.950> gonna<00:00:47.070> have<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.579> certain

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
this and it's gonna have a certain

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.069 
this and it's gonna have a certain
surface<00:00:48.570> area<00:00:49.550> now<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:51.030> order<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.420> figure<00:00:51.870> out

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
surface area now in order to figure out

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.310 
surface area now in order to figure out
the<00:00:52.620> length<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.219> one<00:00:53.610> side<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:55.079> shelf

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
the length of one side of the shelf

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.490 
the length of one side of the shelf
we're<00:00:56.160> gonna<00:00:56.309> have<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.550> take<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.940> square<00:00:57.149> root

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
we're gonna have to take the square root

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.840 
we're gonna have to take the square root
so<00:00:58.500> in<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.710> case<00:00:58.980> we're<00:00:59.280> going<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.460> take<00:00:59.699> the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
so in this case we're going to take the

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.460 
so in this case we're going to take the
square<00:01:00.149> root<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.750> surface<00:01:01.079> area<00:01:03.320> we<00:01:04.320> can

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
square root of the surface area we can

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.410 
square root of the surface area we can
make<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:04.830> example<00:01:05.240> slightly<00:01:06.240> more

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
make this example slightly more

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.060 
make this example slightly more
difficult<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:07.260> let's<00:01:07.619> say<00:01:07.799> we<00:01:08.040> have

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
difficult and let's say we have

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.609 
difficult and let's say we have
something<00:01:08.520> with<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.850> volume<00:01:09.409> we'll<00:01:10.409> have<00:01:10.590> a

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
something with a volume we'll have a

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.190 
something with a volume we'll have a
cube<00:01:11.060> so<00:01:12.060> let's<00:01:12.390> say<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.600> want<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.960> build<00:01:13.080> a

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
cube so let's say you want to build a

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.890 
cube so let's say you want to build a
house<00:01:14.420> for<00:01:15.420> example<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:17.240> the<00:01:18.240> house<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.780> going

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
house for example and the house is going

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.950 
house for example and the house is going
to<00:01:18.990> have<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> certain<00:01:19.500> volume<00:01:20.390> so<00:01:21.390> from<00:01:21.780> this

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
to have a certain volume so from this

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.050 
to have a certain volume so from this
volume<00:01:22.200> you're<00:01:22.979> gonna<00:01:23.159> want<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.610> figure<00:01:23.790> out

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
volume you're gonna want to figure out

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.140 
volume you're gonna want to figure out
the<00:01:24.600> surface<00:01:24.900> area<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.890> house<00:01:26.090> so<00:01:27.090> you

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
the surface area of the house so you

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
the surface area of the house so you
want<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.600> know<00:01:27.720> how<00:01:28.110> tall<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.920> can<00:01:28.950> build<00:01:30.170> the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
want to know how tall you can build the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.460 
want to know how tall you can build the
ceilings<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.340> how<00:01:33.210> big<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.810> house<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.020> going

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
ceilings and how big the house is going

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.780 
ceilings and how big the house is going
to<00:01:34.530> be<00:01:34.710> in<00:01:35.610> terms<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.180> square<00:01:36.570> footage<00:01:37.100> so<00:01:38.100> here

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
to be in terms of square footage so here

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.880 
to be in terms of square footage so here
we're<00:01:39.150> going<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.390> take<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:40.020> cubic<00:01:40.470> root<00:01:40.500> of

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
we're going to take the cubic root of

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.330 
we're going to take the cubic root of
the<00:01:41.009> volume<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:42.740> that's<00:01:43.740> going<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.040> give<00:01:44.189> us

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
the volume and that's going to give us

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.359 
the volume and that's going to give us
the<00:01:45.149> length<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.570> one<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.869> these<00:01:46.020> sides<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:47.130> this

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
the length of one of these sides so this

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.749 
the length of one of these sides so this
side<00:01:47.610> for<00:01:47.850> example<00:01:49.130> from<00:01:50.130> there<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.610> can

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
side for example from there you can

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.840 
side for example from there you can
figure<00:01:50.909> out<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.210> rest<00:01:51.950> now<00:01:52.950> if<00:01:53.399> we<00:01:53.610> want<00:01:53.790> to

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
figure out the rest now if we want to

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.480 
figure out the rest now if we want to
get<00:01:54.000> even<00:01:54.420> more<00:01:54.600> complicated<00:01:56.119> let's<00:01:57.119> say<00:01:57.420> that

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
get even more complicated let's say that

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.940 
get even more complicated let's say that
your<00:01:59.490> physician<00:02:00.259> I'm<00:02:01.259> sorry<00:02:01.530> not<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.740> physician

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
your physician I'm sorry not a physician

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.959 
your physician I'm sorry not a physician
a<00:02:02.369> physics<00:02:03.149> instructor<00:02:03.600> or<00:02:04.909> somebody<00:02:05.909> that

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
a physics instructor or somebody that

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.139 
a physics instructor or somebody that
works<00:02:06.240> on<00:02:06.390> rockets<00:02:06.930> or<00:02:07.170> rates<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.459> have<00:02:08.819> a

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
works on rockets or rates so you have a

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.230 
works on rockets or rates so you have a
flow<00:02:09.690> rate<00:02:09.959> through<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.979> pipe

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
flow rate through a pipe

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.120 
flow rate through a pipe
at<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.870> certain<00:02:13.200> rate<00:02:13.560> let's<00:02:14.070> say<00:02:14.220> it's<00:02:14.780> 30

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
at a certain rate let's say it's 30

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.270 
at a certain rate let's say it's 30
cubic<00:02:17.130> centimeters<00:02:17.730> per<00:02:18.180> minute<00:02:18.650> 30<00:02:19.650> CC's<00:02:20.250> per

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.120 
cubic centimeters per minute 30 CC's per
minute<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.270> that's<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.720> flow<00:02:21.930> rate<00:02:22.170> of<00:02:22.200> fluid

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
minute and that's the flow rate of fluid

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.940 
minute and that's the flow rate of fluid
going<00:02:23.670> through<00:02:23.850> this<00:02:23.970> pipe<00:02:25.100> so<00:02:27.440> if<00:02:28.440> we<00:02:28.710> want<00:02:28.890> to

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
going through this pipe so if we want to

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.130 
going through this pipe so if we want to
figure<00:02:29.250> out<00:02:29.400> for<00:02:29.610> example<00:02:29.850> how<00:02:30.420> fast<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.930> move

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
figure out for example how fast the move

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.380 
figure out for example how fast the move
the<00:02:31.500> fluid<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.130> moving<00:02:32.310> through<00:02:32.700> this<00:02:32.850> pipe<00:02:33.090> in

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
the fluid is moving through this pipe in

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.320 
the fluid is moving through this pipe in
a<00:02:33.540> cross-sectional<00:02:34.320> view<00:02:34.380> or<00:02:34.800> how<00:02:35.610> fast<00:02:35.910> it's

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
a cross-sectional view or how fast it's

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.210 
a cross-sectional view or how fast it's
going<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.540> take<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.900> fluid<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.440> go<00:02:37.560> from<00:02:37.890> this

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
going to take the fluid to go from this

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.430 
going to take the fluid to go from this
part<00:02:38.520> of<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.640> pipe<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:39.150> this<00:02:39.960> part<00:02:40.320> of<00:02:40.380> the

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
part of the pipe to this part of the

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.890 
part of the pipe to this part of the
pipe<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:41.160> this<00:02:41.490> part<00:02:41.820> of<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:41.940> pipe<00:02:42.120> it's

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
pipe to this part of the pipe it's

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.380 
pipe to this part of the pipe it's
taking<00:02:43.410> it<00:02:43.500> from<00:02:43.800> this<00:02:44.250> 3-dimensional<00:02:45.210> view

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
taking it from this 3-dimensional view

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.930 
taking it from this 3-dimensional view
to<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:45.750> two-dimensional<00:02:46.170> view<00:02:46.710> so<00:02:47.460> there<00:02:47.640> we're

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
to a two-dimensional view so there we're

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.000 
to a two-dimensional view so there we're
gonna<00:02:48.060> have<00:02:48.210> to<00:02:48.330> use<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.690> radical<00:02:49.320> once<00:02:49.680> again

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
gonna have to use a radical once again

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.310 
gonna have to use a radical once again
to<00:02:50.340> figure<00:02:50.610> that<00:02:50.850> out<00:02:53.000> so<00:02:54.000> finally<00:02:54.660> I<00:02:54.900> can

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
to figure that out so finally I can

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.410 
to figure that out so finally I can
leave<00:02:55.620> you<00:02:55.800> with<00:02:55.830> this<00:02:56.280> little<00:02:56.520> number<00:02:57.090> and

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
leave you with this little number and

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.200 
leave you with this little number and
that<00:02:58.110> is<00:02:58.290> that<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:59.250> radicals<00:02:59.730> are<00:02:59.850> used<00:03:00.060> in

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
that is that the radicals are used in

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.870 
that is that the radicals are used in
everyday<00:03:00.510> life<00:03:00.780> because<00:03:01.350> our<00:03:01.710> cells<00:03:02.400> and

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
everyday life because our cells and

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.090 
everyday life because our cells and
everything<00:03:03.150> in<00:03:03.420> nature<00:03:03.810> is<00:03:04.080> pretty<00:03:04.740> much<00:03:04.860> made

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
everything in nature is pretty much made

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.810 
everything in nature is pretty much made
up<00:03:05.310> with<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.330> concept<00:03:06.840> of<00:03:07.050> the<00:03:07.820> Fibonacci

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
up with the concept of the Fibonacci

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.050 
up with the concept of the Fibonacci
series<00:03:09.570> sequence<00:03:10.440> or<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:11.190> golden<00:03:11.550> rule<00:03:11.760> and

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
series sequence or the golden rule and

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.900 
series sequence or the golden rule and
that<00:03:12.090> is<00:03:13.670> that<00:03:14.670> everything<00:03:15.090> in<00:03:15.480> life<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:16.910> made

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
that is that everything in life is made

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.240 
that is that everything in life is made
up<00:03:18.090> with<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:20.100> 3/4<00:03:20.760> power<00:03:20.970> rule<00:03:21.330> and<00:03:22.250> let's

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
up with the 3/4 power rule and let's

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.290 
up with the 3/4 power rule and let's
make<00:03:24.210> it<00:03:24.240> more<00:03:24.690> applicable<00:03:25.610> by<00:03:26.610> saying<00:03:26.910> for

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
make it more applicable by saying for

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.420 
make it more applicable by saying for
example<00:03:27.330> working<00:03:28.080> looking<00:03:28.470> either<00:03:28.710> at<00:03:29.070> our

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
example working looking either at our

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.750 
example working looking either at our
veins<00:03:30.090> or<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:31.350> way<00:03:31.500> that<00:03:31.770> trees<00:03:32.100> grow<00:03:32.430> or

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
veins or the way that trees grow or

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.600 
veins or the way that trees grow or
something<00:03:33.150> like<00:03:33.270> that<00:03:33.330> or<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.990> way<00:03:34.260> that

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
something like that or the way that

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.090 
something like that or the way that
snails<00:03:35.610> lay<00:03:35.850> down<00:03:36.030> shells<00:03:36.740> when<00:03:37.740> you<00:03:37.860> look<00:03:38.010> at

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
snails lay down shells when you look at

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.710 
snails lay down shells when you look at
trees<00:03:38.400> for<00:03:38.610> example<00:03:38.700> and<00:03:39.320> when<00:03:40.320> a<00:03:40.350> tree<00:03:40.650> grows

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
trees for example and when a tree grows

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.470 
trees for example and when a tree grows
here's<00:03:42.720> a<00:03:43.170> tree<00:03:43.380> growing<00:03:43.620> when<00:03:44.610> it<00:03:44.820> branches

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
here's a tree growing when it branches

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.740 
here's a tree growing when it branches
from<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:45.960> main<00:03:46.350> trunk<00:03:47.070> here<00:03:47.510> this<00:03:48.510> is<00:03:48.660> the

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
from the main trunk here this is the

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.080 
from the main trunk here this is the
main<00:03:48.900> trunk<00:03:49.170> this<00:03:49.890> branch<00:03:50.250> is<00:03:50.640> going<00:03:51.330> to<00:03:51.390> have

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
main trunk this branch is going to have

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.290 
main trunk this branch is going to have
the<00:03:54.090> volume<00:03:54.600> or<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.260> surface<00:03:55.740> area<00:03:56.070> of<00:03:56.280> 3/4<00:03:57.120> of

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
the volume or the surface area of 3/4 of

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.560 
the volume or the surface area of 3/4 of
the<00:03:57.420> main<00:03:57.600> trunk<00:03:58.160> so<00:03:59.160> if<00:03:59.550> the<00:03:59.850> main<00:04:00.000> trunk<00:04:00.330> has

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
the main trunk so if the main trunk has

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.160 
the main trunk so if the main trunk has
a<00:04:00.600> volume<00:04:00.840> of<00:04:01.260> X<00:04:01.700> this<00:04:02.700> tree<00:04:03.180> limb<00:04:03.390> is<00:04:03.630> going<00:04:04.110> to

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
a volume of X this tree limb is going to

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.930 
a volume of X this tree limb is going to
be<00:04:04.320> slightly<00:04:04.830> smaller<00:04:05.340> by<00:04:06.320> 1/4<00:04:07.320> power<00:04:07.590> so<00:04:08.430> it's

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
be slightly smaller by 1/4 power so it's

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.200 
be slightly smaller by 1/4 power so it's
going<00:04:09.120> to<00:04:09.210> be<00:04:09.330> X<00:04:09.690> to<00:04:09.990> the<00:04:10.140> 3/4<00:04:10.770> power<00:04:11.010> and<00:04:11.430> it's

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210 
going to be X to the 3/4 power and it's

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.000 
going to be X to the 3/4 power and it's
the<00:04:12.330> same<00:04:12.540> if<00:04:12.720> you<00:04:12.870> think<00:04:13.110> about<00:04:13.200> veins<00:04:13.680> for

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
the same if you think about veins for

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.400 
the same if you think about veins for
example<00:04:14.520> your<00:04:15.300> main<00:04:15.540> veins<00:04:15.870> that<00:04:16.109> are<00:04:16.170> going

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
example your main veins that are going

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.830 
example your main veins that are going
from<00:04:16.620> your<00:04:16.830> heart<00:04:17.040> have<00:04:17.489> a<00:04:17.520> very<00:04:17.820> large<00:04:18.120> volume

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
from your heart have a very large volume

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.440 
from your heart have a very large volume
or<00:04:19.080> surface<00:04:19.470> area<00:04:19.770> and<00:04:20.010> when<00:04:20.730> they<00:04:20.850> branch<00:04:21.120> out

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
or surface area and when they branch out

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.189 
or surface area and when they branch out
into<00:04:21.870> your<00:04:22.109> arms<00:04:22.650> or<00:04:22.980> even<00:04:23.910> smaller<00:04:24.180> to

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 
into your arms or even smaller to

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:27.920 
into your arms or even smaller to
bring<00:04:25.800> blood<00:04:26.069> to<00:04:26.129> your<00:04:26.400> cells<00:04:26.810> they're<00:04:27.810> gonna

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
bring blood to your cells they're gonna

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.749 
bring blood to your cells they're gonna
get<00:04:28.139> smaller<00:04:28.500> and<00:04:28.710> smaller<00:04:28.770> and<00:04:29.340> every<00:04:29.580> time

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 
get smaller and smaller and every time

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:31.450 
get smaller and smaller and every time
that<00:04:29.789> they<00:04:29.969> branch<00:04:30.689> out<00:04:30.870> and<00:04:31.050> get<00:04:31.139> smaller

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
that they branch out and get smaller

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.950 
that they branch out and get smaller
they're<00:04:32.460> gonna<00:04:32.580> get<00:04:32.759> smaller<00:04:33.150> with<00:04:33.930> the

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
they're gonna get smaller with the

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.100 
they're gonna get smaller with the
radical<00:04:34.560> of<00:04:34.770> three-quarters<00:04:35.759> so<00:04:36.509> that's<00:04:36.900> the

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
radical of three-quarters so that's the

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.679 
radical of three-quarters so that's the
Fibonacci<00:04:37.560> series<00:04:37.919> now<00:04:38.909> you<00:04:38.969> can<00:04:39.240> see<00:04:39.479> that

00:04:39.679 --> 00:04:39.689 
Fibonacci series now you can see that

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:41.899 
Fibonacci series now you can see that
everyday<00:04:39.990> life<00:04:40.319> the<00:04:40.949> way<00:04:41.069> that<00:04:41.099> we<00:04:41.370> grow<00:04:41.610> the

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:41.909 
everyday life the way that we grow the

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:44.360 
everyday life the way that we grow the
way<00:04:42.030> that<00:04:42.180> nature<00:04:42.360> behaves<00:04:42.990> is<00:04:43.310> actually<00:04:44.310> a

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
way that nature behaves is actually a

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.290 
way that nature behaves is actually a
radical<00:04:44.759> expression<00:04:46.460> so<00:04:47.460> go<00:04:47.729> out<00:04:47.849> there<00:04:48.090> to

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
radical expression so go out there to

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.659 
radical expression so go out there to
nature<00:04:48.659> and<00:04:48.810> think<00:04:49.050> about<00:04:49.229> it<00:04:49.409> there<00:04:50.340> you<00:04:50.490> have

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
nature and think about it there you have

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.610 
nature and think about it there you have
it<00:04:50.819> that's<00:04:51.300> how<00:04:51.509> you<00:04:51.599> can<00:04:51.810> apply<00:04:51.960> radicals<00:04:52.500> to

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
it that's how you can apply radicals to

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.770 
it that's how you can apply radicals to
everyday<00:04:52.919> life<00:04:53.099> thanks<00:04:54.060> for<00:04:54.240> watching<00:04:54.599> I'm
