00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:13.860
 how late are we doing the 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:16.110
 very intense preseason very good well 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.330
 that will work well accommodating us 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:22.530
 to this new job 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.530
 and with the best desire 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.410
 because it is very effective a 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.340
 site taking into account the change of 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.650
 technical body the armed of the establishment is 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.780
 important in terms of names 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.740
 with the best expectation with the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.310
 expectation of being 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:44.160
 the highest in the table 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:47.700
 we are working for that since it has 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.200
 a very intense defensive team to the 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.640
 time to recover the ball and well no 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.920
 we're just training and doing everything 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.780
 what a frank technician asks us is 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.490
 seconding the information that rosario 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.100
 central would buy the other half of your 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.920
 you spend hissing and saving and if you also get 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.440
 I would like this to happen 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.300
 mainly I do not wrap but 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.580
 precisely the other day but 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:12.230
 I do not know very well how is the subject and 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.250
 Obviously the work that can be done 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.860
 specify what they are doing 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.940
 new in these trainings that 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.630
 they study 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:25.400
 we are working with the pressure in the 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:27.700
 tactical system distinct and good to deal with 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.330
 of recovering proteins but we had 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.330
 a very intense team 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.460
 you work like work with a 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.940
 difference that when the work are 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.740
 frequent think like the 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.690
 players who have arrived but already 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.460
 also mauricio caranta stopped fighting 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.500
 important things considering that your 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.780
 environment of 30 where they are enough as 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.509
 Argentina but to see the competition 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.850
 nothing else can fight with what they see 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.530
 and seeing what is being put together that 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.530
 a nice team is assembling 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:08.180
 the players that are asking for a 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:11.510
 technical for the front campus with the 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.820
 field of play so we're not just 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.160
 mentalized that we have to support you 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.130
 up and we're 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.610
 to keep wall francs you spoke 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.040
 of a lobbying work begin with 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.750
 the forwards in this case costs 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.490
 do it the staff 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:34.180
 well you're used to we know 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:36.680
 that gets used to let's see that so 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.680
 how good that 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.269
 no longer stable to a low wine robert was 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.980
 very different from the topic of work 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.000
 they did little tactically but the 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:50.910
 imagine differently 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.910
 and now I'm a little more for the band 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.510
 but do not touch 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.510
 put diagonal 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:07.980
 institute game so is a little less 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.470
 I am some
