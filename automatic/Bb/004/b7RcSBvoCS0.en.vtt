00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
another part of the movie that was a

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.990 
another part of the movie that was a
little<00:01:46.649> bit<00:01:46.829> difficult<00:01:46.979> was<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.609> all<00:01:47.789> the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
little bit difficult was that all the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.149 
little bit difficult was that all the
watching<00:01:48.390> times<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.840> had<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.200> do<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.799> a

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
watching times that I had to do and a

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.980 
watching times that I had to do and a
lot<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.490> other<00:01:50.609> turns<00:01:50.939> were<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.750> left

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
lot of the other turns were to the left

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.139 
lot of the other turns were to the left
and<00:01:52.469> if<00:01:52.950> you're<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.100> dancer<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.579> know<00:01:53.610> that

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
and if you're a dancer you know that

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.539 
and if you're a dancer you know that
it's<00:01:54.990> pretty<00:01:55.259> difficult<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:56.039> pretty<00:01:56.369> awkward

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
it's pretty difficult and pretty awkward

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.359 
it's pretty difficult and pretty awkward
so<00:01:57.119> one<00:01:57.750> day<00:01:57.960> they<00:01:58.649> did<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.829> shot<00:01:59.069> that<00:01:59.250> was

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369

really close to to my feet when I

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.919 
really close to to my feet when I
brought<00:02:02.490> my<00:02:02.549> foot<00:02:02.850> out<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.209> do<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.420> round<00:02:03.630> azam

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
inch away from my toe so I couldn't move

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.410 
inch away from my toe so I couldn't move

the<00:02:12.420> thing<00:02:12.629> about<00:02:12.870> live<00:02:13.560> performance<00:02:14.220> is<00:02:14.549> that

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
the thing about live performance is that

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.360 
the thing about live performance is that
there's<00:02:16.079> a<00:02:16.140> lot<00:02:16.349> more<00:02:16.530> nerves<00:02:16.799> that<00:02:17.010> go<00:02:17.069> along

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
there's a lot more nerves that go along

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.160 
there's a lot more nerves that go along
with<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.730> because<00:02:17.940> you<00:02:18.360> only<00:02:18.480> have<00:02:18.750> one<00:02:18.780> chance

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
with it because you only have one chance

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.020 
with it because you only have one chance
you<00:02:19.500> go<00:02:19.739> out<00:02:19.890> there<00:02:20.069> and<00:02:20.099> whatever<00:02:20.400> happens

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
you go out there and whatever happens

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.850 
you go out there and whatever happens
happens<00:02:21.120> you're<00:02:22.019> never<00:02:22.200> going<00:02:22.410> to<00:02:22.440> get<00:02:22.769> it

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
happens you're never going to get it

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.039 
happens you're never going to get it
back<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.400> know<00:02:23.519> and<00:02:23.790> what<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.569> bring<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:24.900> the

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
back you know and what you bring to the

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.259 
back you know and what you bring to the
stage<00:02:25.349> is<00:02:25.680> is<00:02:25.980> I<00:02:26.370> think<00:02:26.579> something<00:02:27.000> very

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
stage is is I think something very

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.050 
stage is is I think something very
special<00:02:27.540> in<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:27.870> moment<00:02:28.049> if<00:02:28.470> you're

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
special in that moment if you're

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.970 
special in that moment if you're
planning<00:02:30.060> on<00:02:30.150> being<00:02:30.329> a<00:02:30.450> dancer<00:02:30.840> or<00:02:31.410> you<00:02:31.829> are<00:02:31.950> a

to keep yourself healthy that's totally

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.780 
to keep yourself healthy that's totally
normal<00:02:37.440> because<00:02:37.890> everyone<00:02:38.310> goes<00:02:38.489> through

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
normal because everyone goes through

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.789 
normal because everyone goes through
that<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.150> takes<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.510> lot<00:02:39.750> of<00:02:39.780> years<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.470> took<00:02:40.590> me

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
that it takes a lot of years it took me

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.589 
that it takes a lot of years it took me
a<00:02:40.829> lot<00:02:41.040> of<00:02:41.069> years<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.670> find<00:02:41.910> a<00:02:42.000> balance<00:02:42.420> of<00:02:42.540> how

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
a lot of years to find a balance of how

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:43.940 
a lot of years to find a balance of how

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
it comes with growing up to that as you

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.430 
it comes with growing up to that as you
get<00:02:46.200> older<00:02:46.260> you're<00:02:46.920> able<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.640> have<00:02:48.180> more

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.080 

I<00:02:56.209> think<00:02:56.989> in<00:02:57.230> today's<00:02:57.379> culture<00:02:58.069> I<00:02:58.430> think<00:02:58.610> a<00:02:58.939> lot

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
I think in today's culture I think a lot

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.630 
I think in today's culture I think a lot
of<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.299> artistry<00:02:59.720> has<00:02:59.900> gotten<00:03:00.260> lost<00:03:00.439> I<00:03:00.980> I<00:03:01.370> do

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
of the artistry has gotten lost I I do

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.940 
of the artistry has gotten lost I I do
think<00:03:01.879> it's<00:03:02.319> incredibly<00:03:03.319> important<00:03:03.829> to

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
think it's incredibly important to

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.890 
think it's incredibly important to
educate<00:03:04.040> yourself<00:03:04.730> in<00:03:04.939> the<00:03:05.030> arts<00:03:05.420> and<00:03:05.629> in
