00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 yes 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.910
 for people who love 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.240
 astronomical phenomena the next 14 and 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:19.270
 April 15, 2014 will occur the first 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:22.060
 of a group of four is to say a 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:26.850
 treated of total lunar eclipses that 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.850
 will be conjugated between 2014 and 2015 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.350
 a total eclipse of the moon occurs when 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.720
 the moon completely passes through 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.020
 the dark shadow of the earth or zone 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.540
 work 'during this type of eclipse the 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:47.910
 moon will gradually get darker and 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.910
 take a rusty red or blood 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.810
 the eclipse will be visible in the greatest 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.530
 part of north america america 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:02.210
 South and Australia on April 15 will see 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.089
 also on the west coast of 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.090
 southern hemisphere so chili part of 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.930
 argentina all ecuador part of colombia 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.940
 USA Canada Central America and 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.780
 Pacific islands will be the 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.970
 privileged with the complete vision 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.979
 Next I will show you a list of 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.880
 the countries where you can see the 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.880
 total lunar eclipse 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.250
 Next I will show you a list of 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.299
 the countries where you can see part 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.299
 of the total lunar eclipse 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.709
 the following animation shows where 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.090
 this eclipse is visible during the night 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.040
 represented by the dark wave that 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.290
 moves slowly through the 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.019
 Earth's surface 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.120
 the dark areas in the animation are 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:24.909
 approximately what you can see the 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.909
 moon and therefore also the eclipse 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.480
 Lunar eclipses look 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.050
 approximately the same in all the 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.820
 world and at the same time the 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.319
 hours shown can be a 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.329
 minute or two of the real times 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.150
 on our page we will broadcast live 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:51.769
 the total lunar eclipse in the next 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.769
 days we will publish the information
