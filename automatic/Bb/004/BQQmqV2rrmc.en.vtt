00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.500
 and execute content of the same currency 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.720

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.840
 of gift come with one month of gold subscription 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.340
 of free time service 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:08.080
 i all go to point out that equipark these cards work in a console 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.040
 and how do you see how they are configured as being used 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.070
 first let's open it 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.070
 the memory card 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.370
 to see its contents 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.290
 and once opened the mister 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.470
 we can find the usdp memory to the 160 file 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.080
 in fact you tour 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.370
 the card d 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.360
 berners-lee service goal 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.220
 of free equipment 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.680
 If there is good information about the guarantees, minimum requirements of 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.929
 system 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.629
 And everything else 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.749
 let's connect from the outside sive 

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:16.129
 for consoles 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.129
 and we can see 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:24.049
 that we do not feel mom connect them 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.169
 the console detects as a memory unit 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:31.089
 so we do not have to reform create it or anything but it's ready 

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.949
 for 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:34.949
 to install games and to operate directly 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.609
 in this case still a musical test to a young man 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:43.689
 on the memory card 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:55.789
 we select the memory unit 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.099
 but once we were crazy 

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:11.859
 the installation takes a little longer 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.609
 compared to a delay in the full charge since the bus was 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:16.749
 it looks 

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:19.749
 not as fast as the internal console bus 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:24.879
 then we can run a little 

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:37.869
 and can move that works perfectly 

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:40.909
 keep in mind one thing with a mattress murias 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:46.129
 and good min delivery with any memory that yes formatted the 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:47.679
 pipe system 

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:53.119
 since the system itself always reserves about 12 hours a season for 

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:55.999
 own storage 

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:58.999
 then we will never have available 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.349
 all the ability of art the card
