00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
expecting it they so this with this hand

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.810 
expecting it they so this with this hand
I've<00:00:55.530> got<00:00:56.239> the<00:00:57.239> socket<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:57.870> here<00:00:58.289> oops<00:00:58.789> that<00:00:59.789> I

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
I've got the socket in here oops that I

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.240 
I've got the socket in here oops that I
can<00:01:00.239> remove<00:01:00.449> my<00:01:00.660> hand<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.239> comes<00:01:03.420> off<00:01:04.250> so

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
can remove my hand and it comes off so

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.880 
can remove my hand and it comes off so
the<00:01:05.400> hand<00:01:05.580> separates<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.330> here<00:01:07.320> I've<00:01:07.470> got<00:01:07.500> my

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
the hand separates in here I've got my

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.980 
the hand separates in here I've got my
socket<00:01:08.689> there<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.490> pin<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:11.729> there<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.900> I'm

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
socket there is a pin in there that I'm

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.109 
socket there is a pin in there that I'm
trying<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.320> show<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.500> oh<00:01:13.590> there<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.119> that

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
trying to show you oh there it is that

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.679 
trying to show you oh there it is that
pin<00:01:15.479> groups<00:01:16.229> inside<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.400> here<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:18.299> inserts

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
pin groups inside of here that inserts

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.609 
pin groups inside of here that inserts
into<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.530> middle<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.040> my<00:01:20.150> arm<00:01:21.200> my<00:01:22.200> hand<00:01:22.439> rather

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
into the middle of my arm my hand rather

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.880 
into the middle of my arm my hand rather
and<00:01:23.009> that's<00:01:23.729> where<00:01:23.970> all<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.119> signal<00:01:24.570> goes<00:01:24.890> so

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
and that's where all the signal goes so

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.410 
and that's where all the signal goes so
that's<00:01:26.070> how<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.220> control<00:01:26.700> that's<00:01:26.909> that's<00:01:27.240> how<00:01:27.360> I

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
that's how I control that's that's how I

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.090 
that's how I control that's that's how I
get<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.689> from<00:01:28.130> from<00:01:29.130> here<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.430> here<00:01:30.860> aside<00:01:31.860> from

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
get it from from here to here aside from

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.300 
get it from from here to here aside from
that<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:33.500> have<00:01:34.500> on<00:01:35.400> my<00:01:35.820> forearm<00:01:36.829> my<00:01:37.829> charging

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
that I have on my forearm my charging

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.340 
that I have on my forearm my charging
port<00:01:38.579> here<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.299> can<00:01:39.390> recharge<00:01:39.720> my<00:01:39.960> batteries

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
port here so I can recharge my batteries

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.370 
port here so I can recharge my batteries
I<00:01:40.590> have<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.400> little<00:01:41.610> ventilation<00:01:42.119> port<00:01:42.689> here

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
I have a little ventilation port here

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.569 
I have a little ventilation port here
and<00:01:45.020> i<00:01:46.020> have<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.460> small<00:01:48.090> hole<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:49.430> have<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.520> small

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
and i have a small hole I have a small

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.350 
and i have a small hole I have a small
hole<00:01:51.030> here<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:51.990> can<00:01:52.079> adjust<00:01:52.500> my<00:01:52.590> sensors

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
hole here so I can adjust my sensors

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.430 
hole here so I can adjust my sensors
it's<00:01:54.360> more

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
it's more

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.980 
it's more
oops<00:01:56.360> here<00:01:57.360> can't<00:01:57.840> really<00:01:57.990> see<00:01:58.230> that<00:01:59.780> and<00:02:00.780> this

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
oops here can't really see that and this

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.440 
oops here can't really see that and this
is<00:02:01.140> where<00:02:01.260> my<00:02:01.320> socket<00:02:01.800> ends

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:12.059 

so<00:02:06.049> if<00:02:06.170> i<00:02:06.229> take<00:02:06.409> the<00:02:06.590> socket<00:02:07.009> off

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.959 

you<00:02:12.549> can<00:02:12.700> see<00:02:12.879> my<00:02:13.030> arm<00:02:13.209> and<00:02:14.640> inside<00:02:15.640> of<00:02:15.849> my

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:15.969 
you can see my arm and inside of my

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:19.589 
you can see my arm and inside of my
socket<00:02:17.099> you<00:02:18.099> can<00:02:18.249> see<00:02:18.489> one<00:02:18.879> of<00:02:18.999> my<00:02:19.030> sensors

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
socket you can see one of my sensors

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:25.739 
socket you can see one of my sensors
there<00:02:20.489> and<00:02:21.489> there<00:02:22.299> and<00:02:22.769> one<00:02:23.769> there<00:02:23.799> and<00:02:24.749> then

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:25.749 
there and there and one there and then

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:28.920 
there and there and one there and then
it<00:02:25.780> just<00:02:26.019> goes<00:02:26.200> down<00:02:26.560> into<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.420> deep<00:02:28.420> cavern

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
it just goes down into the deep cavern

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.910 
it just goes down into the deep cavern
of<00:02:29.079> my<00:02:29.200> socket<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:32.069> they<00:02:33.069> go<00:02:33.310> together<00:02:34.709> my<00:02:35.709> arm

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
of my socket and they go together my arm

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.699 
of my socket and they go together my arm
here<00:02:36.400> actually<00:02:37.060> you<00:02:37.180> can<00:02:37.389> see<00:02:37.689> I<00:02:38.079> know<00:02:38.319> if<00:02:38.590> you

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
here actually you can see I know if you

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:45.750 
here actually you can see I know if you
can<00:02:38.889> see<00:02:39.069> it<00:02:39.099> I<00:02:42.030> certainly<00:02:43.030> can<00:02:44.489> yep<00:02:45.489> right

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
can see it I certainly can yep right

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.759 
can see it I certainly can yep right
there<00:02:45.790> you<00:02:46.120> can<00:02:46.269> see<00:02:46.299> it<00:02:46.569> now<00:02:46.599> that's<00:02:47.530> where

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
there you can see it now that's where

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.009 
there you can see it now that's where
one<00:02:48.010> of<00:02:48.099> the<00:02:48.159> sensors<00:02:48.370> touches<00:02:48.939> that's<00:02:49.569> about

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
one of the sensors touches that's about

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.119 
one of the sensors touches that's about
as<00:02:50.400> bad<00:02:51.400> as<00:02:51.459> it<00:02:51.790> gets<00:02:51.939> is<00:02:52.500> just<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.709> impression

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
as bad as it gets is just the impression

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.360 
as bad as it gets is just the impression
left<00:02:54.489> from<00:02:54.790> my<00:02:54.819> sensors<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:56.709> i'm<00:02:56.859> not<00:02:57.069> sure<00:02:57.280> if

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
left from my sensors and i'm not sure if

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.500 
left from my sensors and i'm not sure if
you're<00:02:57.489> gonna<00:02:57.579> be<00:02:57.699> able<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:57.909> see<00:02:58.090> this<00:02:58.269> one
