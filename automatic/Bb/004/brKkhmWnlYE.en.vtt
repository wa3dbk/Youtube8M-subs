00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
moving forward the line looks like the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.999 
moving forward the line looks like the
q1<00:00:30.449> which<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.170> replacement<00:00:31.410> for<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.830> team

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
step which is basic functionality the q2

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.220 
step which is basic functionality the q2
which<00:00:34.559> should<00:00:34.770> cover<00:00:35.010> most<00:00:35.730> riders<00:00:36.329> every<00:00:36.510> day

really<00:00:38.040> really<00:00:38.399> well<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.760> then<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.149> g9<00:00:39.719> which

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
really really well and then the g9 which

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.450 
really really well and then the g9 which
is<00:00:40.170> still<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.410> juggernaut<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.010> range<00:00:41.219> up

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
is still the juggernaut in the range up

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.729 
is still the juggernaut in the range up
to<00:00:41.520> 9<00:00:42.090> riders<00:00:42.420> it's<00:00:42.930> just<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.170> different<00:00:43.500> level

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
to 9 riders it's just a different level

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:44.930 
to 9 riders it's just a different level
of<00:00:43.800> functionality<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.370> lot<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.670> pre

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
of functionality a lot of pre

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.119 
of functionality a lot of pre
programmable<00:00:45.629> voice<00:00:45.809> commands<00:00:46.230> but<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.800> big

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
programmable voice commands but the big

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.590 
programmable voice commands but the big
story<00:00:47.520> here<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.879> what<00:00:48.090> you're<00:00:48.239> getting

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
story here is what you're getting

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.540 
story here is what you're getting
different<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.110> q3<00:00:49.559> moving<00:00:49.890> forward<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.309> a

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
different in the q3 moving forward is a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.639 
different in the q3 moving forward is a
big<00:00:50.850> upgrade<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.270> functionality<00:00:51.870> as<00:00:52.020> well<00:00:52.559> as

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
big upgrade and functionality as well as

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.319 
big upgrade and functionality as well as
a<00:00:52.710> big<00:00:52.890> upgrade<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.370> usability<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.149> in<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
a big upgrade in usability and in the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.330 
a big upgrade in usability and in the
past<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:55.199> was<00:00:55.350> my<00:00:55.469> bigger<00:00:55.710> gripe<00:00:56.010> with<00:00:56.160> some

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
past that was my bigger gripe with some

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.189 
past that was my bigger gripe with some
of<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.489> Cardo<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.000> its<00:00:57.120> really<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.360> q2<00:00:57.780> was

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
of the Cardo and its really the q2 was

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.869 
of the Cardo and its really the q2 was
it<00:00:58.350> once<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.800> got<00:00:58.949> into<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.160> heavier<00:00:59.489> glove<00:00:59.730> it

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
it once you got into a heavier glove it

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.459 
it once you got into a heavier glove it
was<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.000> little<00:01:00.329> tougher<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.750> use<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.320> this

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
was a little tougher to use so this

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.510 
was a little tougher to use so this
video<00:01:01.710> I'm<00:01:01.800> gonna<00:01:01.890> walk<00:01:02.070> through<00:01:02.250> kind<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
video I'm gonna walk through kind of the

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.650 
video I'm gonna walk through kind of the
basics<00:01:02.910> but<00:01:03.149> I'm<00:01:03.239> really<00:01:03.359> going<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.600> start

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
basics but I'm really going to start

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.109 
basics but I'm really going to start
with<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.229> lot<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.040> nitty<00:01:05.250> gritty<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.970> lot

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
with a lot of the nitty gritty and a lot

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.550 
with a lot of the nitty gritty and a lot
of<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.360> upgrades<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.170> they've<00:01:07.350> made

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
of the upgrades that they've made

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.899 
of the upgrades that they've made
hopefully<00:01:08.100> will<00:01:08.220> tell<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.460> story<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.790> why

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
hopefully will tell the story of why

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.460 
hopefully will tell the story of why
this<00:01:08.970> could<00:01:09.270> be<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.450> right<00:01:09.570> Bluetooth<00:01:10.080> unit

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
this could be the right Bluetooth unit

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.190 
this could be the right Bluetooth unit

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.090 
using the clamp mount on the side it
still<00:01:24.630> takes<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.960> sticky<00:01:25.259> mount<00:01:25.500> it's<00:01:25.890> still

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
if you look at the base unit which can

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.330 
if you look at the base unit which can
like<00:03:21.840> I<00:03:21.959> said<00:03:21.989> can<00:03:22.290> be<00:03:22.379> sticky<00:03:22.620> mounted<00:03:23.040> or

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
like I said can be sticky mounted or

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.860 
like I said can be sticky mounted or
clamp<00:03:23.699> mounted<00:03:24.000> I'm<00:03:24.090> going<00:03:24.239> to<00:03:24.299> slide<00:03:24.629> it<00:03:24.750> off

here and show you what it looks like

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.619 
here and show you what it looks like
that's<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.669> unit<00:03:26.940> itself<00:03:27.209> that<00:03:27.419> you<00:03:27.510> could

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
that's the unit itself that you could

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.000 
that's the unit itself that you could
pull<00:03:27.810> off<00:03:27.959> you<00:03:28.139> leave<00:03:28.349> this<00:03:28.500> clamp<00:03:28.829> mount

have the ability to do now is they've
really<00:03:35.430> upgraded<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.180> functionality<00:03:36.840> so

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
really upgraded the functionality so

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.210 
really upgraded the functionality so
with<00:03:37.079> a<00:03:37.109> gloved<00:03:37.470> hand<00:03:37.560> it<00:03:37.829> used<00:03:37.979> to<00:03:38.099> be<00:03:38.190> a

series of small buttons next to each

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.599 
series of small buttons next to each
other<00:03:39.810> now<00:03:40.470> it's<00:03:40.680> one<00:03:40.919> button<00:03:41.190> in<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.370> front

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
larger they have raised edges to them

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.819 
larger they have raised edges to them
and<00:03:45.269> then<00:03:45.659> your<00:03:45.780> volume<00:03:46.229> is<00:03:46.349> all<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.709> way<00:03:46.799> on
