liked<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:26.880> portrait<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.750> feels<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.410> little

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
liked this portrait it feels a little

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.830 
liked this portrait it feels a little
bit<00:00:28.890> imbalanced<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:29.939> don't<00:00:30.119> like<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.630> weight

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
bit imbalanced I don't like the weight

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.020 
bit imbalanced I don't like the weight
how<00:00:31.109> this<00:00:31.380> side<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.890> really<00:00:32.099> bright<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.940> then

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
how this side is really bright and then

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.150 
how this side is really bright and then
we<00:00:33.149> have<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.690> wall<00:00:33.930> over<00:00:34.320> here<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.739> want<00:00:35.100> to

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
we have the wall over here I want to

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.069 
we have the wall over here I want to
make<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.489> bit<00:00:35.850> more<00:00:35.899> symmetrical<00:00:36.899> or

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
make this a bit more symmetrical or

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.080 
make this a bit more symmetrical or
uniform<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:38.040> know<00:00:38.399> when<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.760> think<00:00:38.820> about

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
uniform you know when you think about

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.090 
uniform you know when you think about
compositing<00:00:40.050> many<00:00:40.290> times<00:00:40.559> we<00:00:40.739> think<00:00:40.980> about

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
compositing many times we think about

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.670 
compositing many times we think about
how<00:00:41.730> we<00:00:41.790> can<00:00:42.030> composite<00:00:42.480> together<00:00:43.050> different

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
how we can composite together different

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.380 
how we can composite together different
elements<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:44.370> order<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.789> improve<00:00:45.120> our

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
elements in order to improve our

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.990 
elements in order to improve our
photographs<00:00:45.930> often<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:47.010> means<00:00:47.070> using

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
photographs often this means using

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.330 
photographs often this means using
different<00:00:48.360> exposures<00:00:49.050> or<00:00:49.079> frames<00:00:49.739> yet

different exposures or frames yet

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.639 
different exposures or frames yet
sometimes<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:51.600> can<00:00:51.780> improve<00:00:52.140> your<00:00:52.410> overall

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
sometimes you can improve your overall

sometimes you can improve your overall
image<00:00:53.340> by<00:00:53.550> simply<00:00:53.940> compositing<00:00:54.780> with<00:00:55.289> what

this<00:01:13.770> selection<00:01:14.100> doesn't<00:01:14.670> need<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.030> be

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
this selection doesn't need to be

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.600 
this selection doesn't need to be
absolutely<00:01:15.509> perfect<00:01:16.380> because<00:01:17.310> we'll<00:01:17.460> be

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
absolutely perfect because we'll be

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.609 
absolutely perfect because we'll be
using<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.180> just<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.600> protect<00:01:19.110> an<00:01:19.290> area<00:01:19.439> of

using this just to protect an area of
the<00:01:19.740> pictures<00:01:20.130> you'll<00:01:20.369> see<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.700> moment<00:01:20.909> so

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
the pictures you'll see in a moment so

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.789 
the pictures you'll see in a moment so
we'll<00:01:21.810> go<00:01:21.960> ahead<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.290> just<00:01:22.409> click<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.740> drag

we'll go ahead and just click and drag
around<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.549> subject<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.180> then<00:01:24.780> once<00:01:24.990> we've

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
around the subject and then once we've

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.800 
around the subject and then once we've
done<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.530> we<00:01:26.250> want<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.490> go<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.670> refine<00:01:27.420> edge

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
done that we want to go to refine edge

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.649 
done that we want to go to refine edge
in<00:01:28.170> refine<00:01:29.100> edge<00:01:29.310> we<00:01:29.520> can<00:01:29.729> see<00:01:29.970> our<00:01:30.119> edge<00:01:30.329> work

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
in refine edge we can see our edge work

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.240 
in refine edge we can see our edge work
there<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:30.900> I'll<00:01:31.259> go<00:01:31.409> ahead<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.770> zoom<00:01:31.979> in<00:01:32.130> a

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
there so I'll go ahead and zoom in a

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.249 
there so I'll go ahead and zoom in a
little<00:01:32.340> bit<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.909> doing<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.750> what<00:01:34.110> we'll

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
little bit in doing that what we'll

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.140 
little bit in doing that what we'll
typically<00:01:34.710> see<00:01:35.040> with<00:01:35.159> quick<00:01:35.400> select<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:35.970> that

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
typically see with quick select is that

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.210 
typically see with quick select is that
the<00:01:36.299> edges<00:01:36.720> are<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.930> little<00:01:37.079> bit<00:01:37.530> too<00:01:37.740> choppy

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
the edges are a little bit too choppy

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.700 
the edges are a little bit too choppy
well<00:01:39.119> here's<00:01:39.420> where<00:01:39.600> refine<00:01:40.049> edge<00:01:40.259> can<00:01:40.530> help

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
well here's where refine edge can help

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.160 
well here's where refine edge can help
to<00:01:40.950> save<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.579> or<00:01:41.729> correct<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.299> if<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.960> turn

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
to save that or correct that if you turn

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.200 
to save that or correct that if you turn
on<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.350> smart<00:01:43.710> radius<00:01:44.009> option<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.729> then<00:01:44.939> turn

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
on the smart radius option and then turn

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.789 
on the smart radius option and then turn
up<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.509> radius<00:01:45.930> you'll<00:01:46.110> start<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.500> see<00:01:46.649> that

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
up the radius you'll start to see that

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.639 
up the radius you'll start to see that
those<00:01:46.979> edges<00:01:47.490> will<00:01:47.970> look<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.360> ton<00:01:48.720> better<00:01:49.020> let

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
those edges will look a ton better let

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.410 
those edges will look a ton better let
me<00:01:49.740> zoom<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.100> even<00:01:50.220> closer<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.000> we<00:01:51.210> can

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
me zoom in even closer so that we can

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.149 
me zoom in even closer so that we can
see<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.810> perhaps<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.439> detail<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:53.009> this

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
see that perhaps on the detail of this

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.859 
see that perhaps on the detail of this
side<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.520> picture<00:01:53.700> here's<00:01:54.360> before<00:01:54.630> and

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.709 
side of the picture here's before and
now<00:01:55.409> here's<00:01:55.710> after<00:01:55.979> next<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.210> almost<00:01:57.360> always

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
now here's after next I almost always

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.389 
now here's after next I almost always
like<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.170> bring<00:01:58.320> up<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.649> contrast<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.369> little

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
like to bring up the contrast a little

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.429 
like to bring up the contrast a little
bit<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.090> then<00:02:00.329> add<00:02:00.540> perhaps<00:02:00.960> just<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.409> little

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
bit and then add perhaps just a little

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.350 
bit and then add perhaps just a little
teeny<00:02:01.979> bit<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.280> feather<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.729> maybe<00:02:02.969> just<00:02:03.210> a

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
teeny bit of feather and maybe just a

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.420 
teeny bit of feather and maybe just a
touch<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.780> smoothing<00:02:04.170> there<00:02:04.380> all<00:02:05.040> right<00:02:05.250> well

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
touch of smoothing there all right well

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.920 
touch of smoothing there all right well
now<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.610> we've<00:02:05.880> done<00:02:06.090> all<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.270> now<00:02:06.750> that

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
now that we've done all that now that

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.469 
now that we've done all that now that
those<00:02:07.049> edges<00:02:07.530> look<00:02:07.680> good<00:02:08.009> let's<00:02:08.729> output<00:02:09.270> this

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
those edges look good let's output this

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.559 
those edges look good let's output this
to<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.840> new<00:02:10.229> layer<00:02:10.530> with<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.039> mask<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:12.209> in<00:02:12.450> the

hello<00:02:14.099> here<00:02:14.610> gonna<00:02:14.760> choose<00:02:15.120> new<00:02:15.599> layer<00:02:15.870> with<00:02:16.349> a

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
hello here gonna choose new layer with a

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.339 
hello here gonna choose new layer with a
layer<00:02:16.590> mask<00:02:17.150> next<00:02:18.150> click<00:02:18.360> ok<00:02:18.750> in<00:02:18.989> order<00:02:19.260> to

layer mask next click ok in order to
create<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:19.620> layer<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.220> so<00:02:20.940> basically<00:02:21.330> what

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
create that layer and so basically what

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.330 
create that layer and so basically what
we've<00:02:21.750> done<00:02:22.019> here<00:02:22.410> is<00:02:22.470> we've<00:02:22.800> just<00:02:23.040> put<00:02:23.190> the

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
we've done here is we've just put the

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.600 
we've done here is we've just put the
subject<00:02:23.849> by<00:02:24.030> himself<00:02:24.450> on<00:02:24.750> his<00:02:25.260> own<00:02:25.470> layer<00:02:25.739> now

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
subject by himself on his own layer now

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.250 
subject by himself on his own layer now
that<00:02:26.849> we<00:02:26.940> have<00:02:27.209> that<00:02:27.450> we<00:02:27.629> can<00:02:27.840> start<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.230> think

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
that we have that we can start to think

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.869 
that we have that we can start to think
about<00:02:28.500> how<00:02:28.769> we're<00:02:28.920> going<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.069> composite<00:02:29.459> this

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
about how we're going to composite this

the base of this menu now that we've
done<00:03:36.690> that<00:03:36.750> we<00:03:36.959> can<00:03:37.109> see<00:03:37.470> that<00:03:37.590> we<00:03:37.709> could<00:03:37.859> start

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190

moment<00:03:48.989> now<00:03:49.440> that<00:03:49.470> we<00:03:49.799> flip-flop<00:03:50.400> that<00:03:50.639> image

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
moment now that we flip-flop that image

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.180 
moment now that we flip-flop that image
now<00:03:51.060> that<00:03:51.450> we're<00:03:51.600> compositing<00:03:52.500> with<00:03:52.769> what<00:03:53.040> we

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
now that we're compositing with what we

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.530 
now that we're compositing with what we

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.349 
have here in the frame we're going to
composite<00:03:55.200> this<00:03:55.620> in<00:03:55.889> we'll<00:03:56.700> create<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:57.030> mask

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
composite this in we'll create a mask

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.050 
composite this in we'll create a mask
and<00:03:57.599> then<00:03:57.690> we'll<00:03:57.900> mask<00:03:58.200> those<00:03:58.530> details<00:03:59.099> in<00:03:59.459> to

and then we'll mask those details in to

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.030 
and then we'll mask those details in to
do<00:04:00.239> that<00:04:00.269> hold<00:04:01.170> down<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.349> option<00:04:01.470> key<00:04:01.920> on<00:04:01.980> a

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.659 
okay well why did we do all of these
little<00:04:18.750> steps<00:04:19.200> why<00:04:19.530> did<00:04:19.709> we<00:04:19.829> select<00:04:20.099> the<00:04:20.459> guide

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
little steps why did we select the guide

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.510 
little steps why did we select the guide
and<00:04:20.940> put<00:04:21.120> him<00:04:21.329> on<00:04:21.510> his<00:04:21.690> own<00:04:21.840> layer<00:04:22.109> up<00:04:22.349> top<00:04:22.620> well

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
and put him on his own layer up top well

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.149 
and put him on his own layer up top well
we<00:04:23.669> did<00:04:23.970> that<00:04:24.240> so<00:04:24.570> that<00:04:24.599> as<00:04:24.870> we<00:04:25.229> start<00:04:25.560> to<00:04:25.770> paint

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:26.159 
we did that so that as we start to paint

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:27.050 
we did that so that as we start to paint
in<00:04:26.400> the<00:04:26.610> new

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
in the new

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.030 
in the new
background<00:04:27.450> we<00:04:28.050> don't<00:04:28.080> have<00:04:28.380> to<00:04:28.560> worry<00:04:28.830> about

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
background we don't have to worry about

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.700 
background we don't have to worry about
the<00:04:29.370> edge<00:04:29.580> because<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.540> guy<00:04:30.750> or<00:04:31.080> the<00:04:31.230> subject

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
the edge because the guy or the subject

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.550 
the edge because the guy or the subject
of<00:04:31.830> the<00:04:31.919> portrait<00:04:32.400> is<00:04:32.550> above<00:04:33.419> the<00:04:33.840> area<00:04:34.350> that

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.360 
we'll be painting in let me show you
what<00:04:36.600> I<00:04:36.630> mean<00:04:36.870> well<00:04:37.500> here<00:04:37.710> if<00:04:37.800> we<00:04:37.919> turn<00:04:38.160> off<00:04:38.340> the

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
what I mean well here if we turn off the

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.340 
what I mean well here if we turn off the
visibility<00:04:38.790> of<00:04:39.090> all<00:04:39.300> of<00:04:39.510> the<00:04:39.630> layers<00:04:39.840> except

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
visibility of all of the layers except

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.190 
visibility of all of the layers except
for<00:04:40.590> the<00:04:40.710> top<00:04:41.010> two<00:04:41.430> what<00:04:42.180> we<00:04:42.300> can<00:04:42.480> see<00:04:42.750> is<00:04:42.960> that

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
for the top two what we can see is that

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.260 
for the top two what we can see is that
we<00:04:43.470> have<00:04:43.710> the<00:04:43.919> subject<00:04:44.340> there<00:04:44.520> and<00:04:44.760> then

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
we have the subject there and then

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.330 
we have the subject there and then
underneath<00:04:45.810> that<00:04:46.020> we<00:04:46.290> have<00:04:46.320> nothing<00:04:46.919> because

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
underneath that we have nothing because

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.270 
underneath that we have nothing because
our<00:04:47.460> mask<00:04:47.700> is<00:04:47.970> filled<00:04:48.389> with<00:04:48.600> black<00:04:48.830> but<00:04:49.830> if<00:04:50.100> we

that<00:05:11.010> what<00:05:11.160> I<00:05:11.190> can<00:05:11.430> do<00:05:11.639> is<00:05:11.790> I<00:05:11.910> can<00:05:11.970> paint<00:05:12.389> around

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
that what I can do is I can paint around

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.840 
that what I can do is I can paint around
the<00:05:12.900> edge<00:05:13.050> of<00:05:13.260> the<00:05:13.380> subject<00:05:13.860> and<00:05:14.010> here<00:05:14.550> let<00:05:14.729> me

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
the edge of the subject and here let me

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.450 
the edge of the subject and here let me
increase<00:05:15.210> my<00:05:15.330> opacity<00:05:15.780> even<00:05:16.350> more<00:05:16.590> and<00:05:16.800> as<00:05:17.250> I'm

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
increase my opacity even more and as I'm

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.580 
increase my opacity even more and as I'm
doing<00:05:17.790> that<00:05:17.910> it<00:05:18.150> doesn't<00:05:18.570> matter<00:05:18.750> how<00:05:19.020> close<00:05:19.380> I

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
doing that it doesn't matter how close I

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.280 
doing that it doesn't matter how close I
get<00:05:19.650> to<00:05:20.010> the<00:05:20.130> subject<00:05:20.580> because<00:05:21.060> he's<00:05:21.780> above

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
get to the subject because he's above

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.590 
get to the subject because he's above
this<00:05:22.620> layer<00:05:22.889> here<00:05:23.669> you<00:05:23.820> can<00:05:24.000> see<00:05:24.210> how<00:05:24.389> he's

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
this layer here you can see how he's

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.659 
this layer here you can see how he's
sitting<00:05:25.020> above<00:05:25.260> that<00:05:25.500> area<00:05:25.770> that<00:05:26.100> I'm<00:05:26.220> asking

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
sitting above that area that I'm asking

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:29.240 
sitting above that area that I'm asking
in<00:05:26.880> once<00:05:27.720> we<00:05:27.900> turn<00:05:28.139> on<00:05:28.290> all<00:05:28.560> the<00:05:28.590> layers<00:05:28.950> this

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
in once we turn on all the layers this

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.090 
in once we turn on all the layers this
will<00:05:29.430> make<00:05:29.580> even<00:05:29.790> more<00:05:30.090> sense<00:05:30.450> so<00:05:30.750> here<00:05:31.680> as<00:05:31.830> I'm

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
will make even more sense so here as I'm

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.830 
will make even more sense so here as I'm
starting<00:05:32.460> to<00:05:32.550> paint<00:05:32.760> this<00:05:32.970> in<00:05:33.210> again<00:05:33.510> I<00:05:33.539> can

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
starting to paint this in again I can

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.230 
starting to paint this in again I can
just<00:05:34.020> really<00:05:34.200> quickly<00:05:34.530> paint<00:05:35.430> away<00:05:35.550> all<00:05:35.940> of

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
just really quickly paint away all of

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.420 
just really quickly paint away all of
these<00:05:36.419> details<00:05:37.020> here<00:05:37.410> and<00:05:37.530> we'll<00:05:38.190> go<00:05:38.340> ahead

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
these details here and we'll go ahead

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.550 
these details here and we'll go ahead
and<00:05:38.580> just<00:05:38.910> paint<00:05:39.180> over<00:05:39.300> this<00:05:39.660> and<00:05:39.900> what<00:05:40.440> I'm

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
and just paint over this and what I'm

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.620 
and just paint over this and what I'm
doing<00:05:40.590> is<00:05:41.070> I'm<00:05:41.250> replicating<00:05:41.580> the<00:05:42.120> background

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
doing is I'm replicating the background

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.480 
doing is I'm replicating the background
so<00:05:42.870> that<00:05:43.020> I<00:05:43.080> have<00:05:43.260> the<00:05:43.470> same<00:05:43.740> background<00:05:44.010> on

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
so that I have the same background on

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.969 
so that I have the same background on
each<00:05:44.760> side<00:05:45.090> of<00:05:45.270> the<00:05:45.390> image<00:05:45.570> I'm<00:05:46.560> also<00:05:46.710> going<00:05:46.919> to

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
each side of the image I'm also going to

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:48.890 
each side of the image I'm also going to
use<00:05:47.310> the<00:05:47.490> new<00:05:47.610> tracks<00:05:48.000> here<00:05:48.270> because<00:05:48.570> I<00:05:48.600> kind

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
use the new tracks here because I kind

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.360 
use the new tracks here because I kind
of<00:05:48.930> like<00:05:49.050> the<00:05:49.200> angle<00:05:49.710> of<00:05:49.830> that<00:05:49.979> side<00:05:50.220> of<00:05:50.310> the

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
of like the angle of that side of the

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.250 
of like the angle of that side of the
tracks<00:05:50.640> a<00:05:50.820> bit<00:05:50.970> better<00:05:51.180> and<00:05:51.510> then<00:05:51.990> I'll<00:05:52.080> make

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
tracks a bit better and then I'll make

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.529 
tracks a bit better and then I'll make
my<00:05:52.440> way<00:05:52.470> down<00:05:52.830> here<00:05:53.190> and<00:05:53.340> in<00:05:53.940> this<00:05:54.030> case<00:05:54.300> I'm

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 
my way down here and in this case I'm

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:56.659 
my way down here and in this case I'm
using<00:05:54.570> a<00:05:55.080> Wacom<00:05:55.470> stylus<00:05:56.070> tablet<00:05:56.430> but<00:05:56.520> if<00:05:56.639> you

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669 
using a Wacom stylus tablet but if you

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:58.219 
using a Wacom stylus tablet but if you
don't<00:05:57.000> have<00:05:57.210> one<00:05:57.360> of<00:05:57.389> those<00:05:57.600> you<00:05:57.810> could<00:05:57.960> still

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 
don't have one of those you could still

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:00.560 
don't have one of those you could still
do<00:05:58.440> this<00:05:58.650> yet<00:05:59.310> at<00:05:59.430> this<00:05:59.580> point<00:05:59.700> you'd<00:06:00.270> want<00:06:00.539> to

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
do this yet at this point you'd want to

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.659 
do this yet at this point you'd want to
perhaps<00:06:00.780> lower<00:06:01.289> your<00:06:01.590> opacity<00:06:01.919> a<00:06:02.280> little<00:06:02.340> bit

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 
perhaps lower your opacity a little bit

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:04.730 
perhaps lower your opacity a little bit
just<00:06:03.210> to<00:06:03.300> kind<00:06:03.360> of<00:06:03.600> blend<00:06:03.930> in<00:06:04.229> some<00:06:04.470> of<00:06:04.620> these

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
just to kind of blend in some of these

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.040 
just to kind of blend in some of these
details<00:06:05.310> on<00:06:05.669> the<00:06:05.850> tracks<00:06:06.150> so<00:06:06.479> that<00:06:06.510> the<00:06:06.840> wood

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
details on the tracks so that the wood

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.469 
details on the tracks so that the wood
of<00:06:07.260> the<00:06:07.380> train<00:06:07.650> tracks<00:06:07.950> here<00:06:08.250> line<00:06:09.000> up<00:06:09.030> pretty

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 
of the train tracks here line up pretty

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:11.540 
of the train tracks here line up pretty
well<00:06:09.600> you<00:06:10.350> also<00:06:10.530> want<00:06:10.800> to<00:06:10.830> be<00:06:10.950> careful<00:06:11.220> not<00:06:11.490> to

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
well you also want to be careful not to

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.090 
well you also want to be careful not to
create<00:06:12.000> any<00:06:12.180> repeating<00:06:12.960> patterns<00:06:13.440> if<00:06:13.680> you

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 
create any repeating patterns if you

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.040 
create any repeating patterns if you
look<00:06:14.280> at<00:06:14.430> my<00:06:14.669> image<00:06:15.000> you<00:06:15.330> notice<00:06:15.630> that<00:06:15.750> there's

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
look at my image you notice that there's

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.570 
look at my image you notice that there's
this<00:06:16.260> dark<00:06:16.620> rock<00:06:16.919> right<00:06:17.190> here

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
this dark rock right here

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.390 
this dark rock right here
well<00:06:18.210> it's<00:06:18.360> repeated<00:06:18.990> over<00:06:19.110> here<00:06:19.560> as<00:06:19.740> is<00:06:20.100> this

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
well it's repeated over here as is this

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.060 
well it's repeated over here as is this
rock<00:06:20.669> over<00:06:21.180> here<00:06:21.260> so<00:06:22.260> what<00:06:22.440> you<00:06:22.560> might<00:06:22.770> want<00:06:22.979> to

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 
rock over here so what you might want to

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.520 
rock over here so what you might want to
do<00:06:23.220> is<00:06:23.400> grab<00:06:23.580> your<00:06:23.910> brush<00:06:24.210> and<00:06:24.570> then<00:06:25.289> go<00:06:25.320> ahead

and paint with black or white as needed
and<00:06:27.600> just<00:06:27.660> kind<00:06:27.990> of<00:06:28.020> change<00:06:28.350> it<00:06:28.500> up<00:06:28.590> a<00:06:28.770> little

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
and just kind of change it up a little

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.890 
and just kind of change it up a little
bit<00:06:29.130> so<00:06:29.310> here<00:06:29.520> we<00:06:29.639> can<00:06:29.820> try<00:06:30.450> to<00:06:30.510> paint<00:06:30.780> with

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
bit so here we can try to paint with

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.900 
bit so here we can try to paint with
white<00:06:30.960> or<00:06:31.289> black<00:06:31.500> to<00:06:31.770> change<00:06:32.070> that<00:06:32.310> shape<00:06:32.610> of

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:32.910 
white or black to change that shape of

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.940 
white or black to change that shape of
that<00:06:33.030> rock<00:06:33.300> there<00:06:33.570> just<00:06:33.840> a<00:06:33.960> touch<00:06:34.139> and<00:06:34.620> again

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:34.950 
that rock there just a touch and again

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.230 
that rock there just a touch and again
we<00:06:35.099> can<00:06:35.280> do<00:06:35.430> that<00:06:35.610> in<00:06:35.700> a<00:06:35.760> couple<00:06:35.940> of<00:06:36.090> different

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
we can do that in a couple of different

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.480 
we can do that in a couple of different
places<00:06:36.630> just<00:06:37.320> to<00:06:37.440> kind<00:06:37.680> of<00:06:37.770> add<00:06:37.979> a<00:06:38.039> little<00:06:38.370> bit

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
places just to kind of add a little bit

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.460 
places just to kind of add a little bit
of<00:06:38.580> variety<00:06:38.700> to<00:06:39.030> the<00:06:39.240> way<00:06:39.360> that<00:06:39.570> that<00:06:39.690> looks

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:40.470 
of variety to the way that that looks

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.710 
of variety to the way that that looks
alright<00:06:41.040> well<00:06:41.250> next<00:06:41.400> what<00:06:41.700> we'll<00:06:41.850> do<00:06:42.030> is<00:06:42.420> zoom

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 
alright well next what we'll do is zoom

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.330 
alright well next what we'll do is zoom
out<00:06:42.840> and<00:06:43.140> take<00:06:43.470> a<00:06:43.500> look<00:06:43.590> at<00:06:43.860> how<00:06:44.010> we're<00:06:44.190> doing

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 
out and take a look at how we're doing

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.540 
out and take a look at how we're doing
so<00:06:44.700> far<00:06:45.000> this<00:06:45.840> is<00:06:45.900> really<00:06:46.440> stage<00:06:46.740> one<00:06:47.070> here<00:06:47.460> it

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:47.550 
so far this is really stage one here it

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.660 
so far this is really stage one here it
is<00:06:47.640> before<00:06:48.090> and<00:06:48.450> then<00:06:48.870> now<00:06:49.170> after<00:06:49.640> well<00:06:50.640> I

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:50.670 
is before and then now after well I

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.910 
is before and then now after well I
think<00:06:50.790> this<00:06:51.150> stage<00:06:51.510> one<00:06:51.900> looks<00:06:52.290> pretty<00:06:52.620> good

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:52.920 
think this stage one looks pretty good

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.180 
think this stage one looks pretty good
we<00:06:53.220> now<00:06:53.430> have<00:06:53.700> a<00:06:53.970> much<00:06:54.510> more<00:06:54.840> simple<00:06:55.470> in<00:06:55.620> strong

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:56.190 
we now have a much more simple in strong

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.910 
we now have a much more simple in strong
portrait<00:06:56.820> yet<00:06:57.570> obviously<00:06:58.050> there's<00:06:58.380> more<00:06:58.680> work

00:06:58.910 --> 00:06:58.920 
portrait yet obviously there's more work

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.370 
portrait yet obviously there's more work
that<00:06:59.130> we<00:06:59.190> need<00:06:59.490> to<00:06:59.640> do<00:06:59.850> we<00:07:00.480> need<00:07:00.630> to<00:07:00.660> disguise

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380 
that we need to do we need to disguise

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.560 
that we need to do we need to disguise
how<00:07:01.830> we've<00:07:02.040> done<00:07:02.310> this<00:07:02.520> a<00:07:02.580> bit<00:07:02.850> more<00:07:03.060> because

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:03.570 
how we've done this a bit more because

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.960 
how we've done this a bit more because
it<00:07:04.230> looks<00:07:04.440> a<00:07:04.530> little<00:07:04.650> bit<00:07:04.890> too<00:07:04.920> unnatural<00:07:05.400> to

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:05.970 
it looks a little bit too unnatural to

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:09.140 
it looks a little bit too unnatural to
have<00:07:06.300> the<00:07:06.570> same<00:07:06.930> kind<00:07:07.680> of<00:07:07.800> shadow<00:07:08.130> line<00:07:08.790> here

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:09.150 
have the same kind of shadow line here

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.420 
have the same kind of shadow line here
or<00:07:09.270> highlight<00:07:09.750> line<00:07:10.050> here<00:07:10.380> so<00:07:11.010> we<00:07:11.160> need<00:07:11.250> to

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:11.430 
or highlight line here so we need to

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.310 
or highlight line here so we need to
disguise<00:07:11.850> that<00:07:12.150> a<00:07:12.180> bit<00:07:12.480> we<00:07:12.660> also<00:07:12.870> need<00:07:13.200> to

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:13.320 
disguise that a bit we also need to

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.830 
disguise that a bit we also need to
finish<00:07:13.680> off<00:07:13.920> the<00:07:14.130> overall<00:07:14.550> project<00:07:14.880> you<00:07:15.720> know

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.580 
compositing is about more than simply

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.820
