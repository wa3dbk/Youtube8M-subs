 Now, when you control your phone 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:26.240
 No word to anyone I want to call the desired person first 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.859
 When you click on this , you will have a video call. 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.890
 I have a call 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:36.710
 If you press the video call, you can call the image. 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:42.860
 Pressing the phone calls the way

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.120
 You can see the other party's screen 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:59.340
 so 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:01.079
 If your computer fails or teaches you something and you use this share , 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:07.619
 I wish 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:09.150
 Now, at this time, I made a test call today on Group 2 calls 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.970
 There is a group. 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.780
 So in this subscription currency 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:19.350
 There is half a man 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:24.930
 I can call the group . 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:29.220
 I'll call the people. 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:32.820
 This makes the phone has two full-screen invariably sour 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:38.990

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:41.940
 Here's the call type or this is the microphone mute. 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:46.350
 I'll adjust and add people. 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:51.840
 I'm participating in my video, and then this is a speech bubble. 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:55.619
 So when you press this speech bubble, the screen goes up. 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:02:02.009
 So if you use this speech bubble well, 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:05.920
 The screen goes up and this selects the microphone, selects the camera 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:10.149
 It is adjustable 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:14.430

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:20.870
 Pressing this will end the call. 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.870
