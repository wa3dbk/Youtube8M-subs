00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
neither will you when your skill level

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.350 
neither will you when your skill level
improves<00:03:38.350> you'll<00:03:39.010> attempt<00:03:39.459> higher<00:03:39.730> quality

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
improves you'll attempt higher quality

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.110 
improves you'll attempt higher quality
balls<00:03:40.600> you'll<00:03:41.410> play<00:03:41.709> with<00:03:41.890> more<00:03:42.100> speed<00:03:42.489> spin

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
balls you'll play with more speed spin

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.199 
balls you'll play with more speed spin
and<00:03:43.390> you<00:03:43.690> lane<00:03:43.900> closer<00:03:44.260> to<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:44.709> lines

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
and you lane closer to the lines

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.729 
and you lane closer to the lines
therefore<00:03:46.209> you'll<00:03:46.959> still<00:03:47.260> play<00:03:47.470> with<00:03:47.650> an

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
therefore you'll still play with an

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.400 
therefore you'll still play with an
element<00:03:48.130> of<00:03:48.250> risk<00:03:48.510> even<00:03:49.510> what<00:03:49.810> you<00:03:49.989> think<00:03:50.260> is<00:03:50.380> a

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
element of risk even what you think is a

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.069 
element of risk even what you think is a
normal<00:03:50.890> rally<00:03:51.130> ball<00:03:51.459> is<00:03:51.910> actually<00:03:52.450> a<00:03:52.480> ball<00:03:52.750> hit

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
normal rally ball is actually a ball hit

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.530 
normal rally ball is actually a ball hit
with<00:03:53.380> an<00:03:53.530> element<00:03:53.920> of<00:03:54.070> risk<00:03:54.280> and<00:03:54.670> it's<00:03:55.209> simply

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
with an element of risk and it's simply

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.319 
with an element of risk and it's simply
a<00:03:55.630> matter<00:03:55.810> of<00:03:55.930> time<00:03:56.260> before<00:03:56.290> you<00:03:56.769> miss<00:03:56.980> so<00:03:57.970> stop
