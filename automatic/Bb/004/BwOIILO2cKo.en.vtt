00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
other game so yeah now code they make

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.240

pac-man<00:02:53.080> in<00:02:53.260> a<00:02:53.320> ghostly<00:02:53.560> adventure<00:02:54.010> so<00:02:54.130> I'm

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
pac-man in a ghostly adventure so I'm

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.070 
pac-man in a ghostly adventure so I'm

assuming they didn't really I'm assuming

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.480 
assuming they didn't really I'm assuming
that<00:02:56.200> they<00:02:56.320> weren't<00:02:56.560> really<00:02:56.890> fans<00:02:57.130> of<00:02:57.340> that

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
that they weren't really fans of that

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.220 
that they weren't really fans of that
design<00:02:57.880> do<00:02:58.120> you<00:02:58.180> know<00:02:58.270> that<00:02:58.450> modern<00:02:58.630> pac-man

design do you know that modern pac-man

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.780 
design do you know that modern pac-man
so<00:02:59.350> they<00:02:59.440> went<00:02:59.620> with<00:02:59.650> a<00:02:59.740> retro<00:03:00.070> style<00:03:00.130> pac-man

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790
