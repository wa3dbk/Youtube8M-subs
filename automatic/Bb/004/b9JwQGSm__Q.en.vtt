00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 in this video we will learn to 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.870
 break down the numbers into factors 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.610
 cousins the first thing we have to know 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.650
 is that a number is a prime number 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.559
 cousin is the one who can only be 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.960
 divided by itself or by the unit is 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.030
 tell 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.360
 2 is prime number with this you can 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.590
 divide between 2 and between 14 is not a 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.950
 prime number since it can be 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:28.189
 divided by 4 between 1 and between 2 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.140
 also then the numbers that meet 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.930
 that can only be divided among themselves 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:38.560
 themselves and the unit only with the cousin and 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.560
 are the following are 1 and 2 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:45.600
 the 5 on the 7 the 11 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.079
 the 13th and so on to infinity there 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.860
 infinite prime numbers but for 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:56.960
 decompose factors normally with 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.960
 those numbers is enough 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.510
 I already said that there is a property of 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.490
 numbers that is that all then 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.810
 decomposed as a formed product 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.760
 only by prime numbers vouchers 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.270
 let's see how that is done we go with 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:20.100
 one simple for example first 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:23.180
 let's break down the number 20 by 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.850
 to decompose the number 20 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.370
 we just started trying to see 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.990
 among whom number cousins â€‹â€‹can be 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.160
 divided we started with 2 on 1 no 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.800
 because all the numbers to be 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.930
 divided by 10 accounts let's start 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.410
 for the next prime number plus 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.840
 small that would be the 2 20 can be 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:51.670
 divided by 2 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.439
 20 in comes out to 10 and it gets what 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.710
 we put here the result of the division 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:59.979
 20 between two results 10 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:03.729
 whenever we can we try to go back to 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:06.190
 repeat with the same prime number in 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.429
 this case we can try with those 10 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:12.450
 can be divided by 2, yes, 10 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.580
 between 2 goes out to 5 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.610
 we put it there now we always have to 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.550
 retry dividing by the number 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.140
 cousin that we have in this case the 251 is 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.650
 can divide between 2 so then 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:30.010
 we go to the next prime number that is 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.080
 the 35 can be divided by 3 not 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.660
 so we went to the next prime number 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.770
 what is 5 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.240
 then if 5 can be divided by 5 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.700
 and it goes to 1 at the moment that here 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.400
 we have 1 we have already finished 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:49.060
 break down into prime factors and already 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:53.260
 we have that 20 can be written as 2 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:56.670
 by 2 by 5 that is 2 squared 2 by 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.670
 2 x 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:04.170
 so 20 is the same as 2 to 425 say it 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.870
 we have written as a formed product 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.060
 only by prime numbers raised to 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.260
 a power that yes but only for 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.690
 very important numbers to always start 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.420
 by the smallest prime number and so go 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.340
 going up without saying for example 20 it 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.519
 can divide between 5 and what appears here 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.989
 the 5 directly will go well if 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.180
 we do not follow the order correctly 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:31.560
 see if I say 20 can be divided 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:34.379
 between 525 I get to 4 and 4 can you 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.900
 divide by 2 as you start doing 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:38.200
 so sometimes it comes out to me but 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.140
 other times 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.390
 They annoy you and it will not go out forever 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.860
 you have to follow the order always start 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.440
 with both if you can not bring it 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:51.160
 can five and so up from 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.300
 agreement let's try it with one a 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.140
 bit harder 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.330
 let's try for example the 108 near 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.750
 or even a larger number is 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:07.269
 it does exactly the same 108 we try 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:09.250
 write between 2 leaves 54 54 Libyans what 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:12.400
 we try to live again between 2 as 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:17.690
 it ends in a number to it is worth it is 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:26.000
 divisible by 254 between 2 leaves 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:30.100
 25 50 27 goes from 54 between 2 is 27 and 27 already 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:35.120
 you can not divide between 227 us 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:40.250
 we went to the next number would be the 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:44.470
 3 and 27 yes that can be divided between 39 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:48.350
 by 317 next 7 between 3 goes out to 9 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.730
 how can we repeat the 3 we repeat it 9 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.820
 between 3 to 3 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:55.910
 how can we repeat the 3 we repeat it 3 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:59.360
 between 3 to 1 and we have already finished 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:04.439
 agreement so 108 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:07.810
 it can be described as 1 2 2 

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:13.450
 123 x 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:16.240
 squared by 3 to the cube is 108 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:21.270
 more let's try 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.270
 another number 1024 for example 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.150
 and 24 the same divide even if you can 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.460
 divide for a bigger monkey always 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.210
 we divide by the smallest number that 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.190
 it can 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:38.180
 in this case the 2 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:41.860
 half of my 24 is 512 half and 512 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:44.300
 156 half of 128 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.650
 the sale of 64 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.980
 32 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:54.970
 16 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:57.590
 8 between 2 to 4 4 2 to 2 and 2 between 2 to 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.840
 pass this and that is that a number is 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.360
 decomposes completely using a 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.180
 only prime factor that is 1024 is a 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.330
 exact power of 2 so we can 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:14.680
 say 1000 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:18.120
 24 equals 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 is 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.120
 same as 2 high 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:24.870
 I remember that easy, that's how 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:27.530
 factor numbers are decomposed 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.530
 cousins
