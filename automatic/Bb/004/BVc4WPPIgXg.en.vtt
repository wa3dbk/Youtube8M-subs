00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.570
 hello to all the guys from agents and for 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.039
 mine are jtf merging today I'm here 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.109
 for the first time on this channel 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.850
 some of you had already recognized me 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.859
 so I'll already know who I am anyway 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.170
 I'll talk better about myself later 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.400
 after describing the gameplay from 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.260
 then then the gameplay that you 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.940
 we carry today is a nuclear double 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.070
 performed in only on that much a 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.719
 teams in this case did from 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.760
 our Spanish section I recommend 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.540
 past you find us there in description 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.460
 as always 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.780
 then I told you I want to spend a 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.670
 just a few words on the gameplay 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.500
 why many of you can say eh 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.170
 ok, a double announcement to those who do 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.399
 give too easy no guys if not 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.170
 this is the first mistake here 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.309
 double core performed on the track 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.379
 teams in the world 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.239
 so it's not a very simple gameplay 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.500
 because you have to think of it this way 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.809
 then how do you all know about 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.180
 team deathmatch there are 75 keeps us 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.519
 at our disposal therefore do a 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.770
 double nuclear which includes at least 60 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.810
 killings but it's very easy because yes 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.310
 leave the allies in this case on 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.030
 multiplayer team has been 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.670
 facilitated however they leave 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.860
 only 15 kills available to the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.869
 so our allies are not gameplay 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.450
 very easy in this case the player 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.380
 managed to make 66 decisions a death 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.119
 therefore he left the allies only 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.680
 9 killings at least the allies are 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.960
 only managed to kill 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.700
 and he accomplished this 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.680
 gameplay then the map as you already have 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.720
 since the carrier was genuinely class 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.490
 the usual n 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.799
 with loader given adjustable faces 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.299
 from what I saw c4 as lethal 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.610
 of the series of points you see 18 a 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.229
 right which were web of sat and mp systems 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.579
 then as regards the why not them 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.030
 I also say because they are always the same 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.280
 good anti-splinter then from relatives 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.860
 described the gameplay began to speak 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.820
 of me then as you have already understood 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.040
 open excuse me already understood I am that is 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.380
 some of you will already have understood that I 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.890
 I'm the fusion 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.930
 ex sly leader then li sly chi 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.959
 were was another paxton bing clan 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.380
 it melted about two weeks ago more 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:21.470
 or less as you all know at least how 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.959
 has already said recent in the gdf video 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.489
 fab of the introduction the dg df pub many sly 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.760
 they came in here it's me included 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.440
 that I will comment on the videos so I won't be 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.230
 a gameplay provider at least if you 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.390
 something comes out but we will bring it to you for 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.250
 now I will try to help the canal 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.769
 management then listen for it 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.480
 more commented on my part 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.340
 talking about real life then like me 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.910
 I call my name is Sandro in the world 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:50.000
 videoludico fusion or 17 years old I come from 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.010
 Puglia I don't say the city for xxd reasons 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.230
 it is not true I do not say the city because I am 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.140
 ankle 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.060
 I attend a fourth scientific high school mi 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.049
 I recommend writing in the comments as of 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.510
 is going to school because 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.760
 lately we are in May we all have 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.769
 verification tasks queries 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.870
 deliver the work done 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.340
 previously etc. 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.010
 for example taking into consideration 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.480
 today is May 6th, not 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.340
 I know when this video comes out I am 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.410
 back home with three class assignments 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.690
 fixed and two deliveries to be made in 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.100
 next days so we should give 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.200
 an eye on old jobs or make them 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.389
 from scratch but in my case it means doing them 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.900
 from scratch it is clear I am not at risk of 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:32.030
 rejected all these things here though 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.630
 when you can avoid doing something myself 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.299
 I avoid 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.220
 but when it comes to serious study 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:40.549
 I put my small page there 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.859
 loretta and talking about sports 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:45.010
 then in this period I'm not 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:48.079
 by doing I am not practicing sport 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.700
 however when I was small that is about 34 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.109
 years ago I practiced sports then 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.780
 let's start from when I was little when 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:56.450
 I was really tiny little baby I have 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.549
 kicked for about five or six years 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.829
 to be years remember when I have 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.520
 carried out also a year of swimming e 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:05.020
 I also played soccer at the same time 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.610
 I don't remember when he pointed out 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.890
 shield for this however I don't think that 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.000
 is of interest to you 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.560
 that is, I don't think it's very important 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.300
 in conclusion 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.270
 so after leaving the soccer of the 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:19.180
 problems with the company I gave myself to 

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:22.750
 basketball basket played for about 34 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.720
 years I stopped in the first high because 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.610
 really took so much time away to 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.170
 because of workouts that were out 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.240
 from my city as in the city 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.580
 there was the team sucked I didn't 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.330
 I wanted to go so it was really a lot 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.070
 difficult to manage times and cocks studio 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.770
 decks so I decided to give up too 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.230
 let's talk basketball and mascia 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.750
 of hobbies then co as all 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.750
 guys the hobbies are almost always the 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:53.500
 same then I like to go out with 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:57.220
 friends in their spare time fooling around 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.930
 any way smoking is not true to play 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.100
 play the xbox even guys though 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.140
 lately I'm not playing 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.120
 very much because he never has time all 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.340
 these things in fact not all xbox 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.230
 live from a month or so more or less 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.110
 play played once every two months 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.790
 I play a game and turn it off 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.980
 lately i think all body 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.470
 they got bored like black ops 2 while 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.410
 there was less to see them can be different 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.490
 however play them lately enough 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.860
 fruit because they have also become 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.570
 playable notaries also remained a 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.220
 Minute to comment speaks a 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.810
 moment of my story on call of duty 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.140
 then ions you are playing call of duty 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:34.240
 cmv three was really very poor 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:37.360
 I think everyone who speaks for the 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.060
 first time slowly I improved 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.560
 I started doing the first ones but when it is 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.750
 come out black ops ideas you think me 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.760
 I bought it in Q3 when it was June 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.550
 of his vintage so I played it 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:51.040
 so much after improving 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:54.010
 quite a few black ops came out two had them 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.740
 a rate of 170 ii is logical copy less 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.720
 50 a 70 then I made a new start and 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.480
 all this stuff here anyway not 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.340
 matter is I can safely say that 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.350
 it was also my favorite black ops 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.540
 two was quite nice and talking 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.630
 of ghost and av 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.340
 I prefer to avoid because in fact I don't 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.670
 I liked it at all August. I played it 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.900
 the first 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.080
 as if I've played the first 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.340
 week and that thrown in short 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.380
 so guys hope this video will 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.760
 both liked it if you leave so many 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.470
 I like to see you reach the 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.480
 five hundred I recommend you pass also 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:43.080
 from the channel of the Spanish section we there 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:46.080
 see you next time the jtf 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.080
 killed
