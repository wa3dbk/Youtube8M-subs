00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
going to teach you guys how to calculate

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.179 
going to teach you guys how to calculate
offset<00:00:04.440> what<00:00:05.279> you<00:00:05.400> need<00:00:05.700> is<00:00:05.970> a<00:00:06.359> straight<00:00:06.660> edge

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:07.189 
offset what you need is a straight edge

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:12.140 
offset what you need is a straight edge
you'll<00:00:08.189> need<00:00:08.540> tape<00:00:09.540> measure<00:00:10.880> you'll<00:00:11.880> need

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
you'll need tape measure you'll need

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.890 
you'll need tape measure you'll need
some<00:00:12.990> paper<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.849> pen<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:17.660> something<00:00:18.660> to

some paper a pen and something to

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.370 
some paper a pen and something to
convert<00:00:19.430> your<00:00:21.529> inches<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.740> millimeters<00:00:24.380> so

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
convert your inches to millimeters so

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.650 
convert your inches to millimeters so
we'll<00:00:25.590> start<00:00:25.890> with<00:00:26.189> laying<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.359> straight

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
we'll start with laying the straight

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.700 
we'll start with laying the straight
edge<00:00:27.810> across<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:29.369> wheel<00:00:29.550> like<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:30.710> take

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
edge across the wheel like this take

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.090 
edge across the wheel like this take
your<00:00:31.890> tape<00:00:32.130> measure<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.700> measure<00:00:34.010> from<00:00:35.010> the

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
take this number one thirty-nine point

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:18.649 
take this number one thirty-nine point
seven<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:08.039> -<00:02:09.039> from<00:02:09.819> this<00:02:10.090> number<00:02:11.880> with<00:02:12.880> eight

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:25.039 

39.7<00:02:19.659> minus<00:02:20.310> one<00:02:21.310> seventy<00:02:22.090> seven<00:02:22.709> point<00:02:23.709> eight

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
39.7 minus one seventy seven point eight

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:33.899 
39.7 minus one seventy seven point eight
thirty<00:02:26.049> eight<00:02:26.819> point<00:02:27.819> one<00:02:30.209> and<00:02:32.280> here<00:02:33.280> is<00:02:33.549> your

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
thirty eight point one and here is your

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:38.910 
thirty eight point one and here is your
offset<00:02:35.549> thirty<00:02:36.549> eight<00:02:36.730> point<00:02:37.000> one<00:02:37.920> to

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
offset thirty eight point one to

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.800 
offset thirty eight point one to
determine<00:02:39.069> if<00:02:39.549> this<00:02:39.700> is<00:02:39.760> positive<00:02:40.299> or

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
determine if this is positive or

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.949 
determine if this is positive or
negative<00:02:41.319> if<00:02:42.629> this<00:02:43.629> number<00:02:43.959> is<00:02:45.689> larger<00:02:46.689> than

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
negative if this number is larger than

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.259 
negative if this number is larger than
this<00:02:47.260> number<00:02:47.670> it's<00:02:48.670> positive<00:02:49.889> if<00:02:51.030> this<00:02:52.030> number

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
this number it's positive if this number

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.490 
this number it's positive if this number
is<00:02:52.859> less<00:02:53.859> than<00:02:54.129> this<00:02:54.909> number<00:02:55.319> then<00:02:56.319> it's

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
is less than this number then it's

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.710 
is less than this number then it's
negative<00:02:56.709> so<00:02:57.519> obviously<00:02:57.940> this<00:02:58.150> is<00:02:58.329> larger

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
negative so obviously this is larger

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.860 
negative so obviously this is larger
than<00:02:58.900> this<00:02:59.079> it's<00:02:59.950> a<00:03:00.010> positive<00:03:00.190> offset<00:03:00.870> so

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
than this it's a positive offset so

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.759 
than this it's a positive offset so
hopefully<00:03:02.769> I<00:03:03.750> helped<00:03:04.750> you<00:03:04.840> guys<00:03:04.959> out<00:03:05.200> and
