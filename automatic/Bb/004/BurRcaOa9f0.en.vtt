and<00:00:19.730> at<00:00:20.730> that<00:00:21.090> they<00:00:21.240> weren't<00:00:21.539> even<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:21.779> good

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
and at that they weren't even that good

and at that they weren't even that good
in<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.140> first<00:00:22.410> place<00:00:22.699> so<00:00:23.699> I'm<00:00:24.300> just<00:00:24.510> gonna

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
because I've seen a lot of tutorials on

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.229 
because I've seen a lot of tutorials on
YouTube<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.130> always<00:00:32.309> pisses<00:00:32.820> me<00:00:32.969> off<00:00:33.000> when

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
YouTube and it always pisses me off when

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.240 
YouTube and it always pisses me off when
they<00:00:33.360> start<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.870> play<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.469> then<00:00:34.980> they<00:00:35.070> forget

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
they start to play and then they forget

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.709 
they start to play and then they forget
to<00:00:35.700> start<00:00:35.880> seeing<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.270> notes<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.660> don't

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
to start seeing the notes and I don't

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.450 
to start seeing the notes and I don't
want<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.230> happen<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.590> me<00:00:37.739> because<00:00:38.160> then

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
want that to happen to me because then

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.680 
want that to happen to me because then
you<00:00:38.520> have<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.790> kind<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:39.000> sit<00:00:39.210> there<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.570> kind

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
you have to kind of sit there and kind

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.760 
you have to kind of sit there and kind
of<00:00:39.840> guess<00:00:40.020> that's<00:00:40.200> what<00:00:40.379> they're<00:00:40.559> pressing

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
of guess that's what they're pressing

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.830 
of guess that's what they're pressing
and<00:00:41.219> it's<00:00:41.460> not<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.850> difficult<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.360> assume

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
and it's not that difficult to assume

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.650 
and it's not that difficult to assume
when<00:00:43.140> you're<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.320> good<00:00:43.530> piano<00:00:43.890> player<00:00:44.040> because

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
when you're a good piano player because

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.240 
when you're a good piano player because
it's<00:00:45.660> not<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.960> noticeable<00:00:46.170> when<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.710> key<00:00:47.010> like

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
it's not that noticeable when I key like

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.630 
it's not that noticeable when I key like
like<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.789> goes<00:00:48.000> down<00:00:48.270> like<00:00:48.539> if<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.750> do<00:00:48.870> this

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
like this goes down like if you do this

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.020 
like this goes down like if you do this
it's<00:00:50.640> not<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:50.940> easy<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.270> notice<00:00:52.250> so<00:00:53.250> in<00:00:53.820> case

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
it's not that easy to notice so in case

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.889 
it's not that easy to notice so in case
I<00:00:54.180> forget<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.629> stop<00:00:54.840> naming<00:00:55.469> out<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.829> keys

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
I forget to stop naming out the keys

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.049 
I forget to stop naming out the keys
