00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.690 
might be uh it might be a hardware issue
which<00:01:40.360> I<00:01:40.510> from<00:01:41.409> what<00:01:41.560> it<00:01:41.950> might<00:01:42.190> be<00:01:42.280> a<00:01:42.310> hardware

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
which I from what it might be a hardware

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.539 
which I from what it might be a hardware
hardware<00:01:43.540> issue<00:01:43.750> and<00:01:44.280> what<00:01:45.280> I<00:01:45.310> was<00:01:45.520> really

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
hardware issue and what I was really

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.219 
hardware issue and what I was really
thinking<00:01:45.820> in<00:01:46.360> the<00:01:46.450> very<00:01:46.630> beginning<00:01:46.780> was<00:01:47.110> it

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
thinking in the very beginning was it

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:48.780 
thinking in the very beginning was it
was<00:01:47.320> probably<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:47.619> power<00:01:47.920> supply<00:01:48.340> unit<00:01:48.700> which

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
was probably the power supply unit which

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.300 
was probably the power supply unit which
I've<00:01:48.940> read<00:01:49.119> online<00:01:49.360> that<00:01:50.110> they<00:01:50.619> go<00:01:50.770> bad<00:01:51.010> after

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
I've read online that they go bad after

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.640 
I've read online that they go bad after
a<00:01:51.340> while<00:01:51.610> but<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:52.510> other<00:01:52.930> thing<00:01:53.110> he<00:01:53.229> mentioned

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
a while but the other thing he mentioned

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.620 
a while but the other thing he mentioned
was<00:01:53.770> and<00:01:54.010> the<00:01:54.580> other<00:01:54.700> thing<00:01:54.850> he<00:01:54.940> mentioned<00:01:55.150> was

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
was and the other thing he mentioned was

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.440 
was and the other thing he mentioned was
that<00:01:55.960> it<00:01:56.170> might<00:01:56.530> be<00:01:56.740> it<00:01:56.950> might<00:01:57.010> even<00:01:57.610> be<00:01:57.850> a<00:01:57.880> it

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
that it might be it might even be a it

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.789 
that it might be it might even be a it
might<00:01:58.570> be<00:01:58.689> even<00:01:58.900> the<00:01:59.020> hard<00:01:59.320> drive<00:01:59.530> that<00:01:59.650> went

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
might be even the hard drive that went

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.300 
might be even the hard drive that went
bad<00:01:59.979> so<00:02:00.340> I<00:02:00.369> figure<00:02:00.790> okay<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:02.619> when<00:02:02.830> he<00:02:02.920> told<00:02:03.159> me

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
bad so I figure okay so when he told me

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.560 
bad so I figure okay so when he told me
that<00:02:03.400> told<00:02:03.760> him<00:02:03.850> well<00:02:04.030> I<00:02:04.060> don't<00:02:04.299> have<00:02:04.390> much

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
that told him well I don't have much

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.760 
that told him well I don't have much
money<00:02:04.720> just<00:02:04.869> give<00:02:05.080> me<00:02:05.200> till<00:02:05.320> the<00:02:05.409> first<00:02:05.619> of<00:02:05.710> the

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
money just give me till the first of the

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.620 
money just give me till the first of the
month<00:02:05.950> to<00:02:06.130> come<00:02:06.430> up<00:02:06.520> with<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.729> money<00:02:06.820> so<00:02:07.479> what

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630

I did was I went ahead I went ahead
and<00:02:13.440> took<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.540> hard<00:02:15.540> drive<00:02:15.750> out<00:02:15.780> of<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.020> PSP

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
and took the hard drive out of the PSP

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.590 
and took the hard drive out of the PSP
now<00:02:16.500> this<00:02:16.650> is<00:02:16.800> this<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.400> actually<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.360> have

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
now this is this is actually the I have

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.570 
now this is this is actually the I have
a<00:02:18.630> 500<00:02:19.260> gigabyte<00:02:19.560> hard<00:02:19.590> drive<00:02:19.800> so<00:02:20.340> what<00:02:20.460> I<00:02:20.490> did

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
a 500 gigabyte hard drive so what I did

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.670 
a 500 gigabyte hard drive so what I did
was<00:02:20.790> I<00:02:20.820> took<00:02:20.940> it<00:02:21.120> out<00:02:21.240> I<00:02:21.300> took<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.660> out<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:21.990> I

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
was I took it out I took it out and I

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.770 
was I took it out I took it out and I
installed<00:02:23.550> I<00:02:23.850> managed<00:02:24.270> to<00:02:24.390> find<00:02:24.570> the<00:02:24.660> original

installed I managed to find the original

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.990 
installed I managed to find the original
120<00:02:25.650> gigabyte<00:02:25.980> hard<00:02:26.130> drive<00:02:26.250> so<00:02:26.580> I<00:02:26.610> managed

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
120 gigabyte hard drive so I managed

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.140 
120 gigabyte hard drive so I managed
installed<00:02:27.900> it<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.770> my<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.520> my<00:02:29.670> amazement

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
installed it and to my to my amazement

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.100 
installed it and to my to my amazement
the<00:02:30.600> system<00:02:31.050> start<00:02:31.290> working<00:02:31.860> like<00:02:32.870> it<00:02:33.870> was<00:02:33.960> day

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
the system start working like it was day

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.890 
the system start working like it was day
one<00:02:34.380> basically<00:02:34.710> I<00:02:34.830> mean<00:02:35.210> like<00:02:36.210> there<00:02:36.420> was<00:02:36.540> no

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
one basically I mean like there was no

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.280 
one basically I mean like there was no
issues<00:02:37.470> whatsoever<00:02:37.710> and<00:02:38.430> like<00:02:38.580> oh<00:02:38.670> wow<00:02:39.270> I<00:02:39.750> I

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
issues whatsoever and like oh wow I I

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.690 
issues whatsoever and like oh wow I I
mean<00:02:40.800> like<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:41.010> mentioned<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:41.370> was<00:02:41.490> kind<00:02:41.670> of

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
amazed at all I had to do was basically

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.100 
amazed at all I had to do was basically
just<00:02:45.030> swap<00:02:45.180> out<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.360> hard<00:02:45.540> drive<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:45.840> it

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
just swap out the hard drive and it

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.020 
just swap out the hard drive and it
seemed<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.440> fix<00:02:46.740> the<00:02:46.860> problem<00:02:47.280> I've<00:02:47.430> been<00:02:47.460> I've

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.450 
seemed to fix the problem I've been I've
been<00:02:48.090> running<00:02:48.570> this<00:02:48.690> thing<00:02:48.930> on<00:02:49.380> for<00:02:50.010> 48<00:02:50.430> hours

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
been running this thing on for 48 hours

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.300 
been running this thing on for 48 hours
and<00:02:50.910> I<00:02:51.150> actually<00:02:51.420> when<00:02:52.080> I<00:02:52.380> actually<00:02:53.100> went

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
and I actually when I actually went

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.740 
and I actually when I actually went
ahead<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.820> bought<00:02:54.150> one<00:02:54.330> of<00:02:54.360> these<00:02:54.480> inner

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
ahead and bought one of these inner

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.330 
ahead and bought one of these inner
what's<00:02:55.320> it<00:02:55.380> called<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.620> nichael<00:02:56.130> inner

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
what's it called the nichael inner

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.390 
what's it called the nichael inner
cooler<00:02:56.760> things<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.210> so<00:02:58.200> far<00:02:58.440> it<00:02:58.710> seems<00:02:59.100> to<00:02:59.310> be

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
cooler things and so far it seems to be

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.690 
cooler things and so far it seems to be
doing<00:02:59.640> its<00:02:59.760> job<00:02:59.970> so<00:03:00.960> anyways<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:02.160> real<00:03:02.310> reason
