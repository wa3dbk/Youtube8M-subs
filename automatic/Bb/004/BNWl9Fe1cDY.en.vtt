00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.600
 Pegasus, still you? 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.350
 I have already told you... 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.850
 Until deprived of my 5 senses ... 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.150
 As long as the flame of my Cosmos burns, I will fight! 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.520
 Seiya! 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.800
 Unfortunately for you, you have no strength to face me. 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.700
 Look, if you can not even get up! 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.000
 Seiya! 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.000
 Wait! 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.950
 Seiya is not the one who abandons, you should know better than anyone. 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.370
 I trust him ... Seiya will get it! 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.150
 Seiya ... You're not alone. 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.200
 You can count on my help, as well as that of your friends. 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.150
 Come on, find the strength to get up, Seiya! 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.700
 Seiya! 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.300
 Where do you ... find the strength to get up? 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.600
 S ... Seiya ... I ... 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.070
 I'm going too, Seiya ... 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.170
 Me too, Seiya ... 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.870
 Seiya ... 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Their voices... 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.150
 I can feel your Cosmos around me! 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.500
 Let us unite our joys and our sorrows ... 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.850
 We fight together for the same ideal! 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.520
 My irreplaceable friends ... 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.200
 Your Cosmos ... Even if they deprive me of my senses, I can feel them! 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.400
 I must reach the last Cosmos, the Seventh Sense! 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.100
 Come on Athena, make me see my enemy for the last time! 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.350
 Athena! 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.770
 What ... What ?! 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.650
 What is this amazing Cosmos? 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.220
 The Cosmos of Seiya has merged with that of Shiryu and the others! 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.350
 PEGASUS METEOROS! 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.870
 The "Meteors" of Seiya have become a beam of light! 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.870
 Impossible! It is like...!
