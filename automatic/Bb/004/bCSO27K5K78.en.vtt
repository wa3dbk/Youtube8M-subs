00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Hello people, welcome to the 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.390
 channel sources and today our subject 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.309
 It's going to be like making a stop for you. 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.230
 already has a certain proficiency in your 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.690
 violin level has more time to 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.020
 know a little more of something 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.300
 the first important factor is people 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.000
 she understand that scale did not think the 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.800
 objective of improving clear tuning 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.930
 which is one of the main reasons 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.490
 but it can be used and should be used 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.080
 to work many other things 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:35.160
 so general tips I have for you 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.440
 It's if you do not know how to use pedals. 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.600
 trance of scale 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:45.680
 if I were of that greater question it is 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.680
 make the sun rise with the sun pedal 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:59.910
 something very interesting too 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:03.090
 Do you wear any clothes? 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:09.200
 I bring for beginners you use the 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.200
 more advanced methods we used as 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:15.900
 septic any with what already requires a 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:22.729
 technical level but there are 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.729
 methods of a very good thing 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:28.979
 there are several types of scale 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:32.970
 I think for those who are already on the level 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.460
 a fixed position scale 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:40.350
 are obligatory we will put pressure 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.450
 higher in the first labmon position if up 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.850
 the first in the first position when 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.140
 Are you going to move to the second? 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.340
 the larger scale 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.610
 octaves back then it's going to be serious 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.560
 best will make a climb on 2 8th round then 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.560
 would be like honey's scale is 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
 is 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.320
 is 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:26.540
 with the pedal sweating in case and do this 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.460
 even until the sun is here the eighth position 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.340
 Another thing that is also said to be 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.080
 varies a lot to the bow does not study scale 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.690
 always the same way we were is 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.390
 an accustomed study on a scale where two 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.680
 two brigades of 44 in the studio alone 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.090
 I watch you from there , then you study. 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.310
 1616 increasing speed reduced 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:51.200
 speed and explain everything in staccato 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.870
 rate in different ways 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.760
 wearing a bow coat rather than 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.480
 start without a plate below this mark 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.830
 top 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.530
 important is to vary because the 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.460
 learning is even precisely 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.950
 in that 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.750
 so the more you vary you 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.460
 how much more do you think to make a 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.080
 thing but you're learning because 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.480
 you always do the same as not 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.750
 was nothing is not repeating is 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.630
 making each became automatic more 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:22.040
 learn if you do not stop learning 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.930
 After you're very repeat 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.489
 a long time ago you do not even think to do 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.800
 that 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.720
 something else also very important 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.900
 you pay attention to the change of 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:37.550
 position does not always correct note 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:43.510
 drag on finger always take off of it places 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:43.510
 again then it only hurts here 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:50.670
 this is not if you take it off and put it on 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:53.730
 new finger to the scales they should be 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.480
 studied is preferably whenever 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.850
 I'm going to play the violin, you give some. 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.070
 past in scale is part of the 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.550
 our technical study that our study 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.720
 it is divided into technical study and 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.850
 repertoire 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.250
 so in the technical part we do 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.260
 climbed articulation exercise and decide 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.940
 anything of the sort and the scales 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.770
 are always restrained leaving so it is very 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.760
 important it is part of our routine 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:21.390
 daily 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.820
 other than the scales in position 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.740
 you can do scales in three 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.610
 steps that we also have with all 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:32.220
 In this method, what are you going to do? 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.210
 cause an escalation that only increases in 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.210
 three steps 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.060
 is 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.500
 the scale poets to present attached 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.690
 out of 88 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.419
 You can do it there, too. 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.949
 on top of both sun to sun makes scale 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:03.150
 between the eighth and I can leave 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:05.919
 down a link of some method that has 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.530
 this kind of scale and nonstop also 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:12.240
 a rope you make two positions in 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.240
 a rope the audience 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.910
 Let's suppose that the Rio Grande 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.660
 a rope and then you do it in others 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.100
 schools 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.250
 there are several ways of studying and 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.380
 always try to do different is better 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.510
 the staff think these tips that have 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.480
 to you today about ana any scale 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.500
 doubt suggestion requests just let us 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.870
