00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
writing of this series goes now if I'm

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.560 
writing of this series goes now if I'm
correct<00:03:02.530> this<00:03:03.220> is<00:03:03.400> an<00:03:03.520> anime<00:03:03.910> original<00:03:04.450> I<00:03:04.510> know

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
correct this is an anime original I know

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.420 
correct this is an anime original I know
it's<00:03:04.780> based<00:03:05.020> off<00:03:05.260> of<00:03:05.320> a<00:03:05.590> game<00:03:05.740> a<00:03:05.800> card<00:03:06.160> game<00:03:06.400> or

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
it's based off of a game a card game or

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.100 
it's based off of a game a card game or
a<00:03:06.580> game<00:03:06.760> or<00:03:06.970> something<00:03:07.270> but<00:03:07.540> I<00:03:07.570> think<00:03:07.660> this<00:03:07.930> is

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
a game or something but I think this is

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.290 
a game or something but I think this is
actually<00:03:08.620> an<00:03:08.860> anime<00:03:09.280> original<00:03:09.670> series<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:10.150> if

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
actually an anime original series and if

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.180 
actually an anime original series and if
it<00:03:10.450> is<00:03:10.660> once<00:03:10.990> again<00:03:11.110> I<00:03:11.230> give<00:03:11.350> a<00:03:11.410> platform<00:03:11.710> map

it is once again I give a platform map

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.400 
it is once again I give a platform map
