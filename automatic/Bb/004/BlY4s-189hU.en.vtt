we're<00:05:08.580> going<00:05:08.670> to<00:05:08.760> get<00:05:08.880> any<00:05:09.000> more<00:05:09.090> promos<00:05:09.570> I

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
we're going to get any more promos I

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.870 
we're going to get any more promos I
think<00:05:10.410> the<00:05:10.500> Easter<00:05:10.770> promo<00:05:11.160> was<00:05:11.340> probably<00:05:11.670> the

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
think the Easter promo was probably the

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.850 
think the Easter promo was probably the
last<00:05:12.120> big<00:05:12.480> one<00:05:12.660> that<00:05:12.810> we're<00:05:12.990> going<00:05:13.020> to<00:05:13.200> get<00:05:13.380> and

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
last big one that we're going to get and

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.760 
last big one that we're going to get and
I<00:05:14.580> think<00:05:14.870> ultimate<00:05:15.870> team<00:05:16.050> is<00:05:16.200> just<00:05:16.380> on<00:05:16.500> cruise

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
I think ultimate team is just on cruise

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.640 
I think ultimate team is just on cruise
control<00:05:16.860> from<00:05:17.550> now<00:05:17.700> until<00:05:17.730> man<00:05:18.210> 15<00:05:18.630> I<00:05:18.840> think

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
control from now until man 15 I think

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.170 
control from now until man 15 I think
you're<00:05:19.770> just<00:05:19.890> trying<00:05:20.130> to<00:05:20.190> update<00:05:20.340> things<00:05:20.820> as

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
you're just trying to update things as

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.840 
you're just trying to update things as
little<00:05:21.900> as<00:05:22.020> i<00:05:22.170> can<00:05:22.440> but<00:05:22.770> have<00:05:23.100> it<00:05:23.130> be<00:05:23.250> somewhat

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
little as i can but have it be somewhat

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.520 
little as i can but have it be somewhat
big<00:05:24.090> so<00:05:24.870> cuz<00:05:25.050> they're<00:05:25.170> going<00:05:25.290> to<00:05:25.350> do<00:05:25.440> the

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
big so cuz they're going to do the

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.810 
big so cuz they're going to do the
ultimate<00:05:25.770> legends<00:05:26.220> and<00:05:26.370> they're<00:05:26.460> going<00:05:26.580> to<00:05:26.640> do

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
ultimate legends and they're going to do

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.790 
ultimate legends and they're going to do
the<00:05:27.060> golden<00:05:27.510> tickets<00:05:27.870> but<00:05:28.080> once<00:05:28.320> that<00:05:28.500> runs

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
the golden tickets but once that runs

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.250 
the golden tickets but once that runs
out<00:05:28.980> which<00:05:29.760> i<00:05:29.910> think<00:05:29.970> ultimately<00:05:30.540> jeans<00:05:31.169> are

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
out which i think ultimately jeans are

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.090 
out which i think ultimately jeans are
actually<00:05:31.710> done<00:05:32.040> i'm<00:05:32.300> pretty<00:05:33.300> sure<00:05:33.919> the<00:05:34.919> night

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
actually done i'm pretty sure the night

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.770 
actually done i'm pretty sure the night
train<00:05:35.310> lane<00:05:35.370> was<00:05:35.880> the<00:05:36.030> last<00:05:36.270> one<00:05:36.630> they're

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
train lane was the last one they're

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.590 
train lane was the last one they're
going<00:05:36.960> to<00:05:37.020> do<00:05:37.140> last<00:05:37.380> big<00:05:37.620> one<00:05:37.800> i<00:05:38.419> could<00:05:39.419> be

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
going to do last big one i could be

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.480 
going to do last big one i could be
wrong<00:05:39.630> i<00:05:40.110> think<00:05:40.500> there<00:05:40.710> may<00:05:40.800> be<00:05:40.830> one<00:05:41.100> more<00:05:41.310> week

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
wrong i think there may be one more week

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.560 
wrong i think there may be one more week
of<00:05:41.610> it<00:05:41.760> but<00:05:41.970> as<00:05:42.200> of<00:05:43.200> that<00:05:43.530> I<00:05:43.560> think<00:05:44.540> that'll<00:05:45.540> be

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
of it but as of that I think that'll be

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.659 
of it but as of that I think that'll be
the<00:05:45.780> last<00:05:45.810> set<00:05:46.440> that<00:05:46.590> they<00:05:46.710> do<00:05:46.770> I<00:05:47.190> think<00:05:47.610> it

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:47.669 
the last set that they do I think it

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:50.480 
the last set that they do I think it
didn't<00:05:47.850> be<00:05:47.910> like<00:05:48.060> Sean<00:05:48.630> Taylor<00:05:48.930> and<00:05:49.410> a<00:05:50.280> couple

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
didn't be like Sean Taylor and a couple

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.760 
didn't be like Sean Taylor and a couple
of<00:05:50.640> other<00:05:50.790> guys<00:05:50.880> and<00:05:51.390> then<00:05:52.230> of<00:05:52.350> course<00:05:52.380> like<00:05:52.710> i

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
of other guys and then of course like i

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.320 
of other guys and then of course like i
