00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
 A) Yes 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.500
 good morning my name is Jorge Lopez and 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.780
 I am currently a sporting technician 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.420
 botanist on this occasion let's talk 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.010
 a little about the bulks 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.400
 well, bromeliads are epiphytic plants 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:24.760
 it means that they grow on trees and 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.260
 about and also lito fitas grow on 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.740
 rocks 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.740
 I 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:35.190
 in that sense its roots are 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:38.879
 exposed to continuous air currents 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.590
 there's not much water around them the 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.309
 way they have to hydrate and 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:48.269
 feeding is through the water that 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.039
 is here among the leaves here are some 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:52.399
 spaces that are between the pods of 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.399
 leaves 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:00.090
 when it rains it accumulates or here then 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.640
 in the nature fall dead moscas falls 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.190
 in pieces of leaves and all that is 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.200
 decomposes is mineralized and a 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.909
 nutrient solution that is absorbed by 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.920
 the base of by a few pores that 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.940
 found at the base of the leaves in that 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.560
 sense in the absorption of water by the 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:22.090
 root is not 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:24.820
 It is not large but not overwhelmingly 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.520
 rather hydration occurs and the 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.759
 nutrition is given by the base of the leaves 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.140
 they are plants that need to live in 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.570
 quite humid environments 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.440
 the temperature range needed 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.870
 it is from 14 to 28 degrees 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.410
 for most varieties and 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.410
 species 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.329
 are shade plants are not always 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.899
 protected by the treetops in 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.649
 the forest and they do not need them light 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.049
 direct 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.060
 lucy but not direct finds the 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.789
 reproduction what kind of substrate and 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.710
 will know that process the reproduction the 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.929
 we can do two ways the one is 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.410
 the asexual or vegetative reproduction that 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.870
 consists of dividing the plant 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.820
 in this case we can see that this is a 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:15.100
 adult plant and it's coming out here 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.550
 an outbreak when this outbreak is 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:21.040
 developed and is able to feed 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.890
 by itself this occurs when the angle 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.880
 of its leaves is similar to the angle of the 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.920
 of these leaves then with that angle 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.610
 can capture enough of 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.920
 light and the self-sufficient self is 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.260
 say produce your own food when 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.870
 the outbreak is big we can already 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.830
 divide with one with a detailed part 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:47.680
 as we did good it is divided with the 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.680
 small piece of damage that is growing 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.200
 here 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.959
 next to the mother plant and I 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.989
 proceeds to plant in another more eternal the 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.760
 substrate that we can use has to 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.250
 be a decomposing substrate 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.260
 slowly and a substrate that keeps 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.569
 quite a direction not exactly that 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.989
 keep them having nutrients because 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:12.870
 the absorption of water and nutrients by 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.280
 the bromeliads is not by the roots but 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.980
 as I mentioned by the base of the leaves 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.439
 in this sense no of the substrate does not have 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.900
 that does not necessarily have to have 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:23.340
 a good amount of nutrients which is 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.500
 the one that we are using in this in 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.319
 this case is this plant we just 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.370
 plant on a bark-based substrate 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.919
 Pine 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.360
 previously washed and good previously 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:38.980
 crushed and washed pine bark 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:42.890
 from 5 to 8 millimeters here we can see it 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:46.690
 only the part of the plant that is 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.360
 with roots the active within the substrate 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.090
 and we have outbreaks we have the outbreaks 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.510
 leave them on the surface of the 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.510
 substratum
