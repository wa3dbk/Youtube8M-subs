don't set the hook hard if you don't set
it<00:01:34.180> properly<00:01:34.350> they<00:01:35.350> spit<00:01:35.680> it<00:01:35.799> out<00:01:37.350> there<00:01:38.350> was

it properly they spit it out there was

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.349 
it properly they spit it out there was
something<00:01:38.770> there<00:01:38.890> that<00:01:38.950> was<00:01:39.189> easy<00:01:39.219> to<00:01:39.549> miss<00:01:39.820> if

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:40.359 
something there that was easy to miss if

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:41.700 
something there that was easy to miss if
you<00:01:40.420> look<00:01:40.570> to<00:01:40.659> the<00:01:40.750> right<00:01:40.930> hand<00:01:41.259> side<00:01:41.500> of<00:01:41.649> the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
you look to the right hand side of the

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.190 
you look to the right hand side of the
frame<00:01:41.950> there<00:01:42.549> goes<00:01:42.759> a<00:01:42.789> striper

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.899 

I<00:01:47.320> think<00:01:47.920> this<00:01:48.039> Kelly<00:01:48.250> got<00:01:48.430> hit<00:01:48.579> on<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:48.700> way

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
I think this Kelly got hit on the way

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.840 
I think this Kelly got hit on the way
down<00:01:49.180> and<00:01:49.420> it's<00:01:49.570> a<00:01:49.630> little<00:01:49.899> bit<00:01:50.020> foul<00:01:50.259> and<00:01:50.850> it's

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
down and it's a little bit foul and it's

00:01:51.850 --> 00:02:14.580 
down and it's a little bit foul and it's
not<00:01:52.000> going<00:01:52.149> to<00:01:52.210> make<00:01:52.299> too<00:01:52.450> much<00:01:52.570> difference

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.430 

now<00:02:15.580> despite<00:02:15.970> how<00:02:16.390> they<00:02:16.569> strike<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.080> killing

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
now despite how they strike the killing

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.640

see<00:02:26.170> just<00:02:27.160> briefly<00:02:27.520> the<00:02:27.700> bucktail<00:02:28.090> in<00:02:28.420> the

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
see just briefly the bucktail in the

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.510 
see just briefly the bucktail in the
frame<00:02:28.810> is<00:02:28.989> actually<00:02:29.140> up<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.709> right<00:02:29.920> it's

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
frame is actually up to the right it's

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.259

out<00:02:30.670> of<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.910> frame<00:02:31.360> of<00:02:31.390> view<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:33.700> was<00:02:33.849> actually

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
out of the frame of view it was actually

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.229 
out of the frame of view it was actually
hard<00:02:34.540> to<00:02:34.660> get<00:02:35.019> hits<00:02:35.290> on<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.590> kill<00:02:35.800> II<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.910> the

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
hard to get hits on the kill II the the

hard to get hits on the kill II the the
kill<00:02:37.450> II<00:02:37.590> didn't<00:02:38.590> attract<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.550> hits

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
kill II didn't attract the hits

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.870 
kill II didn't attract the hits
anywheres<00:02:40.480> near<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.950> way<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.190> bucktail<00:02:42.519> did

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
anywheres near the way the bucktail did

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.240 
anywheres near the way the bucktail did
I<00:02:43.300> was<00:02:43.510> like<00:02:44.110> catching<00:02:44.650> fish<00:02:44.860> nearly

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
I was like catching fish nearly

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.850 
I was like catching fish nearly
constantly<00:02:45.849> on<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.060> bucktail<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:46.780> I<00:02:47.560> felt

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
constantly on the bucktail and I felt

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.530 
constantly on the bucktail and I felt
like<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.640> rod<00:02:48.850> that<00:02:49.030> was<00:02:49.120> sitting<00:02:49.330> in<00:02:49.480> the

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
like the the rod that was sitting in the

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.870 
like the the rod that was sitting in the

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
rather took a while to get hit sometimes

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.410 
rather took a while to get hit sometimes
and<00:02:55.630> also<00:02:56.350> it<00:02:56.860> was<00:02:57.069> on<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.340> same<00:02:57.580> trip<00:02:57.880> that<00:02:58.209> I

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
and also it was on the same trip that I

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.420 
and also it was on the same trip that I
took<00:02:58.569> video<00:02:59.170> of<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.890> killing<00:03:00.099> on<00:03:00.310> the

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
floating jig head and I had a lot more

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.820 
floating jig head and I had a lot more
action<00:03:03.099> on<00:03:03.569> the<00:03:04.569> floating<00:03:04.870> jig<00:03:05.230> head<00:03:05.440> kilee

action on the floating jig head kilee

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.490 
action on the floating jig head kilee
combination<00:03:06.549> that<00:03:06.640> was<00:03:06.790> a<00:03:06.849> fluke<00:03:07.840> Andy<00:03:08.260> teaser

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
combination that was a fluke Andy teaser

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.509 
combination that was a fluke Andy teaser
from<00:03:08.709> jigging<00:03:09.130> world<00:03:09.370> and<00:03:10.170> yes<00:03:11.170> I<00:03:11.560> realized<00:03:12.340> I

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
from jigging world and yes I realized I

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.490 
from jigging world and yes I realized I
had<00:03:12.640> had<00:03:12.849> you<00:03:13.480> know<00:03:13.569> probably<00:03:13.840> plenty<00:03:14.410> of

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
had had you know probably plenty of

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.500 
had had you know probably plenty of
video<00:03:14.769> with<00:03:15.549> the<00:03:15.670> floating<00:03:15.910> jig<00:03:16.150> head<00:03:16.330> so<00:03:16.420> I

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
video with the floating jig head so I

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.770 
video with the floating jig head so I
decided<00:03:16.900> to<00:03:17.049> switch<00:03:17.230> over<00:03:17.830> and<00:03:18.329> try<00:03:19.329> just<00:03:19.600> the

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
decided to switch over and try just the

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.380 
decided to switch over and try just the
the<00:03:19.989> plane<00:03:20.260> killing<00:03:20.470> on<00:03:20.739> a<00:03:20.769> hook<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.390> while

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
the plane killing on a hook and while

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.210 
the plane killing on a hook and while
action<00:03:22.870> just<00:03:23.079> really<00:03:23.380> dropped<00:03:23.650> off<00:03:23.890> from<00:03:24.070> me<00:03:24.190> I

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
action just really dropped off from me I

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.009 
action just really dropped off from me I
didn't<00:03:24.549> get<00:03:24.670> as<00:03:24.760> many<00:03:24.970> hits<00:03:25.209> so<00:03:25.750> it<00:03:25.900> was

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
didn't get as many hits so it was

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.550 
didn't get as many hits so it was
interesting<00:03:26.350> to<00:03:26.590> see<00:03:26.739> underwater<00:03:27.130> that<00:03:28.560> even

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
interesting to see underwater that even

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.880 
interesting to see underwater that even
though<00:03:29.709> they<00:03:29.920> follow<00:03:31.079> other<00:03:32.079> baits<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:32.560> strip

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
though they follow other baits the strip

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.289 
though they follow other baits the strip
dates<00:03:33.100> the<00:03:33.250> floating<00:03:33.579> dick<00:03:33.760> heads<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.120> buck

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
attracted to those things and the kill

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.370 
attracted to those things and the kill
II<00:03:39.000> just<00:03:40.000> didn't<00:03:40.269> attract<00:03:40.600> them<00:03:40.780> but<00:03:40.959> boy<00:03:41.140> when

about<00:04:46.450> coming<00:04:46.960> off<00:04:47.080> the<00:04:47.260> hook<00:04:47.440> so<00:04:47.890> now<00:04:48.040> I've

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
about coming off the hook so now I've

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.820 
about coming off the hook so now I've
got<00:04:48.460> what<00:04:48.670> we<00:04:48.820> spook<00:04:49.120> around<00:04:49.480> and<00:04:49.830> I'm

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
got what we spook around and I'm

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.500 
got what we spook around and I'm
dragging<00:04:51.130> an<00:04:51.550> empty<00:04:51.820> hook<00:04:52.000> through<00:04:52.180> the<00:04:52.300> water

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
dragging an empty hook through the water

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.360 
dragging an empty hook through the water
and<00:04:52.720> that's<00:04:52.870> definitely<00:04:53.770> not<00:04:53.890> going<00:04:54.040> to<00:04:54.100> do<00:04:54.250> me

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
and that's definitely not going to do me

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.870 
and that's definitely not going to do me
any<00:04:54.400> good<00:04:56.730> and<00:04:57.960> you've<00:04:58.960> seen<00:04:59.200> a<00:04:59.230> few<00:04:59.880> fish

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
any good and you've seen a few fish

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.150 
any good and you've seen a few fish
shake<00:05:01.360> off<00:05:01.600> this<00:05:01.780> hook<00:05:01.990> this<00:05:02.440> is<00:05:02.680> a<00:05:02.710> Gamakatsu

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
shake off this hook this is a Gamakatsu

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.570 
shake off this hook this is a Gamakatsu
octopus<00:05:04.090> hook<00:05:04.330> I<00:05:05.160> don't<00:05:06.160> know<00:05:06.250> that<00:05:06.370> you<00:05:06.460> can

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
octopus hook I don't know that you can

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.570 
octopus hook I don't know that you can
buy<00:05:06.880> a<00:05:06.910> hook<00:05:07.210> that's<00:05:07.240> sharper<00:05:07.840> than<00:05:07.960> that<00:05:08.020> but

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
buy a hook that's sharper than that but

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.090 
buy a hook that's sharper than that but
again<00:05:09.580> you<00:05:10.180> need<00:05:10.300> a<00:05:10.360> firm<00:05:10.630> hook<00:05:10.840> set<00:05:11.080> and<00:05:11.290> the

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
again you need a firm hook set and the

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.040 
again you need a firm hook set and the
way<00:05:12.220> the<00:05:12.370> camera<00:05:12.730> is<00:05:12.790> rigged<00:05:13.060> up<00:05:13.270> I'm

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
way the camera is rigged up I'm

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.260 
way the camera is rigged up I'm
definitely<00:05:14.530> not<00:05:14.650> in<00:05:14.800> a<00:05:14.830> position<00:05:15.040> to<00:05:15.340> set<00:05:16.120> the

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
definitely not in a position to set the

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.650 
definitely not in a position to set the
hook<00:05:16.390> hard<00:05:18.000> so<00:05:19.000> if<00:05:19.060> you've<00:05:19.210> watched<00:05:19.420> closely

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
hook hard so if you've watched closely

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.020 
hook hard so if you've watched closely
you've<00:05:20.050> noticed<00:05:20.410> some<00:05:20.640> variation<00:05:21.640> in<00:05:21.670> bottom

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
you've noticed some variation in bottom

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.960 
you've noticed some variation in bottom
structure<00:05:22.710> where<00:05:23.710> were<00:05:23.890> clean<00:05:24.190> sand<00:05:24.580> bottom

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
structure where were clean sand bottom

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.940 
structure where were clean sand bottom
here<00:05:25.240> we<00:05:25.390> were<00:05:25.540> over<00:05:25.900> mussels<00:05:26.380> and<00:05:26.650> shells

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
here we were over mussels and shells

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.100 
here we were over mussels and shells
before<00:05:27.460> is<00:05:27.850> actually<00:05:28.360> about<00:05:28.750> eight<00:05:28.930> or<00:05:29.080> nine

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
before is actually about eight or nine

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.960 
before is actually about eight or nine
foot<00:05:29.470> difference<00:05:29.800> in<00:05:30.190> depth<00:05:30.430> in<00:05:30.610> those<00:05:30.760> two

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
foot difference in depth in those two

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.360 
foot difference in depth in those two
spots<00:05:31.240> as<00:05:31.540> well<00:05:31.690> and<00:05:32.560> yet<00:05:32.680> this<00:05:32.860> is<00:05:32.980> a<00:05:33.010> small

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
spots as well and yet this is a small

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.610 
spots as well and yet this is a small
area<00:05:33.400> I<00:05:33.790> could<00:05:33.910> cast<00:05:34.270> from<00:05:34.630> one<00:05:35.050> spot<00:05:35.350> to<00:05:35.410> the

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
area I could cast from one spot to the

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.700 
area I could cast from one spot to the
other<00:05:35.920> and<00:05:36.220> notice<00:05:37.180> how<00:05:37.330> close<00:05:37.570> it<00:05:37.810> is<00:05:37.900> and<00:05:38.110> for

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
other and notice how close it is and for

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.200 
other and notice how close it is and for
this<00:05:38.770> kind<00:05:38.980> of<00:05:39.100> fishing<00:05:39.310> it<00:05:39.580> really<00:05:39.910> pays<00:05:40.180> to

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
this kind of fishing it really pays to

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.940 
this kind of fishing it really pays to
move<00:05:40.540> around<00:05:40.690> a<00:05:40.930> lot<00:05:40.960> on<00:05:41.320> this<00:05:41.620> particular

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
move around a lot on this particular

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.740 
move around a lot on this particular
trip<00:05:42.430> the<00:05:42.580> fishing<00:05:42.970> was<00:05:43.120> better<00:05:43.390> the<00:05:43.570> fish

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
trip the fishing was better the fish

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.750 
trip the fishing was better the fish
were<00:05:43.900> a<00:05:43.930> little<00:05:44.140> larger<00:05:44.590> over<00:05:45.190> those<00:05:45.340> mussel

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
were a little larger over those mussel

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.280 
were a little larger over those mussel
beds<00:05:45.940> in<00:05:46.060> the<00:05:46.150> deeper<00:05:46.480> water<00:05:46.720> and<00:05:46.900> then<00:05:47.230> a

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.290 
beds in the deeper water and then a

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.780 
beds in the deeper water and then a
couple<00:05:47.500> days<00:05:47.650> later<00:05:47.800> was<00:05:48.190> completely<00:05:48.670> the

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790 
couple days later was completely the

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.790 
couple days later was completely the
opposite<00:05:49.270> but<00:05:49.420> it<00:05:49.810> typically<00:05:50.230> pays<00:05:50.440> to<00:05:50.620> move

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
opposite but it typically pays to move

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.690 
opposite but it typically pays to move
around<00:05:50.920> try<00:05:51.370> different<00:05:51.730> spots<00:05:53.460> okay<00:05:54.460> I<00:05:54.490> hope

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 
around try different spots okay I hope

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.510 
around try different spots okay I hope
