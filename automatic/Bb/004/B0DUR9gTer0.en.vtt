Pieces or Reese's Peanut Butter Cup by
cereal<00:01:14.189> but<00:01:14.729> tastes<00:01:14.970> little<00:01:15.119> bit<00:01:15.210> different

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
cereal but tastes little bit different

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.840 
cereal but tastes little bit different
it's<00:01:15.720> actually<00:01:15.960> very<00:01:16.110> very<00:01:16.259> good<00:01:16.729> not<00:01:17.729> that

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
it's actually very very good not that

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.580 
it's actually very very good not that
that<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.360> Reese's<00:01:18.689> isn't<00:01:19.020> good<00:01:19.229> but<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.530> is

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
that the Reese's isn't good but this is

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.560 
that the Reese's isn't good but this is
just<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.920> different<00:01:20.009> tasting<00:01:20.460> cereal<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:20.970> think

the<00:01:21.630> reason<00:01:21.840> they<00:01:21.930> did<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.080> was<00:01:22.259> because<00:01:22.439> the

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
the reason they did this was because the

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.499 
the reason they did this was because the

of<00:04:35.340> them<00:04:35.400> there's<00:04:35.550> orange<00:04:35.910> and<00:04:36.030> cherry

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
of them there's orange and cherry

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.990 
of them there's orange and cherry
strawberry<00:04:36.990> and<00:04:37.320> grape<00:04:37.350> so<00:04:38.310> basically<00:04:38.850> they

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
strawberry and grape so basically they

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.940 
strawberry and grape so basically they
