path<00:02:19.180> up<00:02:20.180> over<00:02:20.480> there

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
path up over there

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.490

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
think you can see it kind of overgrown

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.339 
think you can see it kind of overgrown
and<00:02:27.980> this<00:02:28.910> is<00:02:29.090> really<00:02:29.420> a<00:02:29.450> soft<00:02:29.780> in<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:29.989> back

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
and this is really a soft in the back

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.280 
and this is really a soft in the back
this<00:02:31.860> is<00:02:31.950> far<00:02:32.189> from<00:02:32.219> the<00:02:32.459> signals<00:02:32.909> I<00:02:33.290> wanted

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
this is far from the signals I wanted

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.509 
this is far from the signals I wanted
son<00:02:34.530> when<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:35.010> hurt<00:02:35.189> hits<00:02:35.599> hits<00:02:36.599> hard<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:38.280> I

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
son when it hurt hits hits hard and I

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.890 
son when it hurt hits hits hard and I
got<00:02:39.140> won't<00:02:40.140> chroma<00:02:40.469> clap<00:02:40.859> from<00:02:41.390> 1979<00:02:42.390> and

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
got won't chroma clap from 1979 and

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.780 
got won't chroma clap from 1979 and
there's<00:02:43.349> still<00:02:43.620> a<00:02:43.650> signal<00:02:44.099> in<00:02:44.219> there<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:44.549> he

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
there's still a signal in there so he

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.619 
there's still a signal in there so he
might<00:02:45.090> have<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.390> sister<00:02:46.159> to<00:02:47.159> find<00:02:47.189> out<00:02:47.519> it's<00:02:48.510> not

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
might have a sister to find out it's not

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.890 
might have a sister to find out it's not
very<00:02:49.079> interesting<00:02:49.379> at<00:02:49.799> all<00:02:49.980> but<00:02:50.280> it's<00:02:50.689> it's<00:02:51.689> a

very interesting at all but it's it's a

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.580 
very interesting at all but it's it's a
