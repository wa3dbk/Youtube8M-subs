00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:07.139 

so<00:00:04.779> first<00:00:05.080> take<00:00:05.230> both<00:00:05.649> pineapples<00:00:06.550> and<00:00:06.790> wash

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:07.149 
so first take both pineapples and wash

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:08.879 
so first take both pineapples and wash
them<00:00:07.450> and<00:00:07.630> then<00:00:07.689> what<00:00:08.109> you're<00:00:08.230> going<00:00:08.380> to<00:00:08.410> do<00:00:08.650> is

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:08.889 
them and then what you're going to do is

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:11.760 
them and then what you're going to do is
basically<00:00:09.370> just<00:00:09.490> take<00:00:09.910> the<00:00:10.660> head<00:00:10.900> of<00:00:11.140> one<00:00:11.500> out

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:11.770 
basically just take the head of one out

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.580 
basically just take the head of one out
be<00:00:12.700> very<00:00:13.000> careful<00:00:13.510> because<00:00:13.780> you<00:00:14.170> can<00:00:14.350> actually

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:14.590 
be very careful because you can actually

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.470 
be very careful because you can actually
hurt<00:00:15.040> yourself<00:00:15.519> with<00:00:15.820> these<00:00:16.090> because<00:00:16.269> they're

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 
hurt yourself with these because they're

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.260 
hurt yourself with these because they're
very<00:00:16.660> pointy<00:00:17.430> then<00:00:18.430> you're<00:00:18.880> going<00:00:18.970> to<00:00:19.060> have

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
very pointy then you're going to have

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.660 
very pointy then you're going to have
something<00:00:19.539> looking<00:00:19.960> like<00:00:20.020> this<00:00:20.380> from<00:00:21.310> there

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.670 
something looking like this from there

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.970 
something looking like this from there
you're<00:00:22.180> going<00:00:22.210> to<00:00:22.480> take<00:00:22.750> a<00:00:22.960> knife<00:00:23.199> and<00:00:23.470> very

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
you're going to take a knife and very

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:31.740 
you're going to take a knife and very
gently<00:00:24.630> cut<00:00:25.630> the<00:00:26.289> bottom<00:00:26.710> into<00:00:27.190> a<00:00:29.070> circle<00:00:30.750> so

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
gently cut the bottom into a circle so

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.349 
gently cut the bottom into a circle so
basically<00:00:32.230> you're<00:00:32.890> going<00:00:33.129> to<00:00:33.219> take<00:00:33.370> this<00:00:34.090> out

00:00:34.349 --> 00:00:34.359 
basically you're going to take this out

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:37.169 
basically you're going to take this out
so<00:00:34.780> it<00:00:35.260> creates<00:00:35.649> a<00:00:35.859> crease<00:00:36.190> like<00:00:36.429> this<00:00:36.460> and<00:00:36.969> you

00:00:37.169 --> 00:00:37.179 
so it creates a crease like this and you

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:40.410 
so it creates a crease like this and you
do<00:00:37.329> the<00:00:37.449> same<00:00:37.659> thing<00:00:38.339> for<00:00:39.339> the<00:00:39.460> top<00:00:39.670> once

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
do the same thing for the top once

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.209 
do the same thing for the top once
you've<00:00:40.629> done<00:00:40.870> that<00:00:40.929> take<00:00:41.379> your<00:00:41.679> paper<00:00:41.889> towel

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:42.219 
you've done that take your paper towel

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.439 
you've done that take your paper towel
holder<00:00:42.789> and<00:00:43.769> gently<00:00:44.769> slide<00:00:45.429> the<00:00:45.850> first

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
holder and gently slide the first

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.689 
holder and gently slide the first
pineapple<00:00:47.289> that<00:00:47.469> you<00:00:47.620> cut<00:00:47.920> into<00:00:48.609> it<00:00:49.239> it<00:00:50.699> might

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
pineapple that you cut into it it might

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:59.420 
pineapple that you cut into it it might
be<00:00:51.850> a<00:00:51.879> little<00:00:52.120> bit<00:00:52.329> hard<00:00:52.690> but<00:00:53.469> it's<00:00:53.769> okay

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.340 

and<00:01:00.430> then<00:01:01.060> do<00:01:01.240> the<00:01:01.360> same<00:01:01.600> thing<00:01:04.170> cut<00:01:05.170> the

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
and then do the same thing cut the

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.930 
and then do the same thing cut the
bottom<00:01:05.710> of<00:01:05.830> the<00:01:05.980> second<00:01:06.400> one<00:01:08.880> creating<00:01:09.880> a

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
bottom of the second one creating a

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
bottom of the second one creating a
crease<00:01:12.870> once<00:01:13.870> you<00:01:14.050> get<00:01:14.260> that<00:01:14.590> one<00:01:15.040> out<00:01:18.960> slide

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
crease once you get that one out slide

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.430 
crease once you get that one out slide
it<00:01:19.990> in<00:01:20.380> so<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:25.000> is<00:01:25.300> your<00:01:25.570> pick<00:01:25.840> to<00:01:25.869> do<00:01:26.110> the<00:01:26.229> top

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
it in so this is your pick to do the top

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.770 
it in so this is your pick to do the top
part<00:01:26.470> what<00:01:26.979> you<00:01:27.130> need<00:01:27.369> is<00:01:27.640> basically<00:01:28.630> just

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
part what you need is basically just

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.830 
part what you need is basically just
leaves<00:01:29.560> that<00:01:29.830> look<00:01:29.890> like<00:01:30.850> palm<00:01:31.210> tree<00:01:31.509> leaves

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
leaves that look like palm tree leaves

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.020 
leaves that look like palm tree leaves
so<00:01:32.229> I<00:01:32.530> just<00:01:32.770> literally<00:01:33.280> went<00:01:33.610> to<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:33.790> dollar

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
so I just literally went to the dollar

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.540 
so I just literally went to the dollar
store<00:01:34.210> bought<00:01:34.630> two<00:01:34.960> of<00:01:34.990> them<00:01:35.350> and<00:01:35.590> it<00:01:36.070> cost<00:01:36.340> me

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
store bought two of them and it cost me

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.620 
store bought two of them and it cost me
a<00:01:36.910> dollar<00:01:37.869> each<00:01:38.259> so<00:01:39.040> I<00:01:39.460> just<00:01:39.940> put<00:01:40.180> them<00:01:40.330> inside

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
a dollar each so I just put them inside

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.170 
a dollar each so I just put them inside
in<00:01:41.110> the<00:01:41.200> middle<00:01:41.530> of<00:01:41.710> these<00:01:42.070> leaves<00:01:42.430> you<00:01:43.000> can

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
in the middle of these leaves you can

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.090 
in the middle of these leaves you can
take<00:01:43.360> them<00:01:43.539> out<00:01:43.750> but<00:01:44.080> it<00:01:44.170> just<00:01:44.200> gives<00:01:44.530> a<00:01:44.649> nicer

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
take them out but it just gives a nicer

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.359 
take them out but it just gives a nicer
effect<00:01:45.670> and<00:01:46.479> texture<00:01:47.050> and<00:01:47.229> then<00:01:47.830> what<00:01:48.250> I<00:01:48.280> like

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
effect and texture and then what I like

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.700 
effect and texture and then what I like
about<00:01:48.759> the<00:01:49.149> fact<00:01:49.420> that<00:01:49.509> they're<00:01:49.840> synthetic<00:01:50.200> is

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
about the fact that they're synthetic is

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.100 
about the fact that they're synthetic is
that<00:01:50.890> you<00:01:51.100> can<00:01:51.280> move<00:01:51.520> them<00:01:51.700> around<00:01:51.940> and<00:01:52.390> shape

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
that you can move them around and shape

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.160 
that you can move them around and shape
your<00:01:54.039> tree<00:01:54.369> to<00:01:54.789> however<00:01:55.119> you<00:01:55.360> want<00:01:55.509> it<00:01:55.840> to<00:01:56.020> be

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
your tree to however you want it to be

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.490 
your tree to however you want it to be
shaped<00:01:56.560> so<00:01:57.399> I<00:01:57.640> really<00:01:58.090> hope<00:01:58.270> you<00:01:58.539> enjoyed<00:01:58.570> my
