00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.210
HI!

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:02.210
It’s Steve from PartSelect.

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.549
Today, we are going to show you how to change
a drain pump on your washer and it’s a really

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:06.800
easy job.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.019
All we are going to need is a quarter inch
nut driver, a 5/16ths nut driver, a flat blade

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:13.190
screwdriver and a pair of pliers.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:14.620
Let me show you how we do it.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.230
Now, the first thing we will to do before
we begin this repair is to disconnect the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.460
power to the washer.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.579
So simply pull the plug, and then we are going
to pull the washer away from the wall enough

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:25.099
that we can actually tilt it back.

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.579
It is easier to remove the bottom access panel
if you can elevate the front of the washer

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:31.579
sump.

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.809
So pull it forward and then just take a couple
of 2/4 blocks and set them in underneath where

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.050
the front legs would rest on them.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:46.379
And that will give us access to the three
quarter inch Hex Head screws that secure that

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.079
bottom access panel in place.

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:57.579
And 
once we have removed those screws you can

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.510
tilt it out on the bottom, and then let it
drop down away from the main front panel.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.390
There are a couple of locator pins there that
will fit into a receptacle on the bottom of

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.350
the front panel.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.000
Now we can set that aside.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.950
Now with the access panel removed, we now
have access to the pump.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.640
But before we take it over, we want to drain
whatever water maybe left in the bottom of

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.840
the tub or in the hoses.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.940
So with the container placed under the button
trap, we will turn that counter-clock wise,

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.369
and you may need to put an adjustable wrench
on that to get it started, so that it will

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:39.840
be fairly tight, and just loosen it enough,
let any water drain out till you fill your

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:47.170
container, tighten it back up until you have
it completely drained.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:02:04.149
Then you can replace it and now we will remove
the clamps that secure the inlet hose to the

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.090
pump and the drain hose outlet.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.470
So with a pair of pliers, we will simply reach
in and squeeze those clamps together and then

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.330
just slide the clamp further up the hose.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:37.270
Once you have the clamps pushed back far enough
you can actually remove the hoses.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.220
And again there maybe a little bit of water
remaining in those hoses, so keep an old towel

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.840
handy there that we can sop that up with.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:56.170
And once both hoses are removed, we will take
a flat blade screwdriver.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.010
And as the pump sits in the rear, there is
a little retaining flap on the right hand

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.010
side of it.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.450
We are just going to lift up on that flap
with a screwdriver and pull the pump a little

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:20.980
bit to the right.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:28.470
Once we have released the tab, we can pull
that pump away from the base and we can take

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.000
it out far enough that we can disconnect the
wire harness on the end.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:44.950
Simply depress the locking tab, release the
wires from the clamp on the side of it and

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.880
then remove the harness and discard the old
pump.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:54.040
Now the new pump comes with a new clamp for
the inlet hose to the back of the button trap.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.870
So we will take the whole squeeze clamp or
spring-type clamp off of the hose first and

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.590
may need to use the pliers to press that enough
to slide it off.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:11.590
We can discard that spring clamp and then
we will slide the new clamp on, keeping in

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.840
mind that we want to be able to access the
end of it with a nut driver.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.320
Just slide that over the hose.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:30.419
We will push it on that far enough that we
will be able to stretch the hose over the

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.009
inlet to the pump.

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.300
Next we will reconnect the wire harness.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.169
Make sure it locks in place.

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:48.650
We can pull that shield down over the harness
and route the wires around the little clip

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:56.110
on the side and then we can position the pump
into the base, and we will lift up on that

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.830
little rubber flap long enough that we can
set it down in position and then push it to

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:10.249
the left it, works all the way over and then
we will force that rubber flap to lock it

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:11.620
in place.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:22.900
Next, we will reposition the inlet and outlet
hoses.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:45.499
Make sure they are fully seated on the pump,
before we tighten the clamps.

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:50.139
Now the new clamp requires a 5/16ths nut driver
to tighten it.

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:53.409
So make sure that we got that hose pulled
fully on there and the clamp in the proper

00:05:53.409 --> 00:06:08.830
position.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:22.060
Now we are ready to reinstall the front panel.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:31.360
So line up the locating pins and tilt it into
position.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:43.259
Now while holding that in position, we will
put the center screw in first, and keep an

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:49.970
upward pressure on that front panel and that
will make it easier to put the two outside

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.219
screws in place.

00:06:51.219 --> 00:07:03.020
Now we are ready to tilt the washer back and
remove the two temporary blocks.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.800
We can now reconnect the power and our repair
is complete.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.720
I told you it was an easy job.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.059
Thanks for watching and good luck with your
repair.
