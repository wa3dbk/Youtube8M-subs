00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.760 

this<00:01:26.780> one<00:01:27.080> is<00:01:27.290> a<00:01:27.470> little<00:01:27.500> bit<00:01:27.940> shimmery<00:01:28.940> or

and let me squash that for you this one

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:57.820 
and let me squash that for you this one
is<00:01:41.799> the<00:01:42.070> ga<00:01:42.310> and<00:01:42.759> this<00:01:43.479> one<00:01:43.780> is<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.380> laurea

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:06.780

notice how they also bring that smoky
effects<00:02:10.300> both<00:02:10.660> of<00:02:10.899> them<00:02:11.080> it's<00:02:11.830> very<00:02:12.220> easy<00:02:12.490> to

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
effects both of them it's very easy to

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.900 
effects both of them it's very easy to
have<00:02:13.510> a<00:02:13.540> smoky<00:02:14.350> effect<00:02:14.470> using<00:02:15.340> these<00:02:15.670> two

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
have a smoky effect using these two

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.700

eyeshadows<00:02:16.060> um<00:02:17.070> I<00:02:18.070> have<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.790> say<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:20.140> texture

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
eyeshadows um I have to say the texture

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.550 
eyeshadows um I have to say the texture
is<00:02:20.920> very<00:02:21.270> similar<00:02:22.270> is<00:02:23.280> basically<00:02:24.280> I<00:02:25.560> don't

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
is very similar is basically I don't

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.310 
is very similar is basically I don't
notice<00:02:26.860> any<00:02:27.220> difference<00:02:27.670> I<00:02:27.970> could<00:02:28.900> say<00:02:29.110> it's

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
notice any difference I could say it's

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.480 
notice any difference I could say it's
almost<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.860> same<00:02:30.070> um<00:02:31.500> ta<00:02:32.500> one<00:02:32.920> is<00:02:33.220> probably

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
almost the same um ta one is probably

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.210 
almost the same um ta one is probably
fused<00:02:34.090> a<00:02:34.210> little<00:02:34.570> bit<00:02:34.720> smoother<00:02:35.110> because<00:02:35.530> the

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
fused a little bit smoother because the

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.370 
fused a little bit smoother because the
shimmering<00:02:36.850> particles<00:02:37.240> is<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:37.900> little<00:02:38.290> bit

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
shimmering particles is a little bit

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.280 
shimmering particles is a little bit
smaller<00:02:38.650> but<00:02:39.550> for<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.120> lawyer<00:02:40.360> one<00:02:40.720> because

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
smaller but for the lawyer one because

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.090 
smaller but for the lawyer one because
it's<00:02:41.530> Austria<00:02:41.950> Marie<00:02:42.130> right<00:02:42.459> so<00:02:43.440> it<00:02:44.440> feels<00:02:44.860> a

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
it's Austria Marie right so it feels a

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.740 
it's Austria Marie right so it feels a
little<00:02:45.310> bit<00:02:45.750> not<00:02:46.750> as<00:02:47.020> smooth<00:02:47.380> I<00:02:47.620> would<00:02:47.950> say<00:02:48.750> but

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
little bit not as smooth I would say but

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.880 
little bit not as smooth I would say but
the<00:02:49.810> texture<00:02:52.440> doesn't<00:02:53.440> feel<00:02:53.620> any<00:02:53.800> different

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
the texture doesn't feel any different

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.210 
the texture doesn't feel any different
when<00:02:54.580> it's<00:02:54.760> on<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.090> eyes<00:02:55.470> they<00:02:56.470> all<00:02:56.740> end<00:02:57.040> up

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
when it's on the eyes they all end up

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.780 
when it's on the eyes they all end up
with<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.270> powdery<00:02:58.720> texture<00:02:59.610> even<00:03:00.610> though

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
with the powdery texture even though

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.690 
with the powdery texture even though
they're<00:03:01.090> a<00:03:01.120> more<00:03:01.660> of<00:03:01.840> a<00:03:01.930> gel<00:03:02.170> form<00:03:02.440> here<00:03:02.709> but

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
they're a more of a gel form here but

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.960 
they're a more of a gel form here but
when<00:03:04.000> they<00:03:04.150> touch<00:03:04.420> this<00:03:04.720> again<00:03:05.760> they<00:03:06.760> actually

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
when they touch this again they actually

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.380 
when they touch this again they actually
turn<00:03:07.480> into<00:03:07.510> a<00:03:07.840> powder<00:03:08.050> phone

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
turn into a powder phone

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.020 

they<00:03:10.990> are<00:03:11.170> both<00:03:11.350> very<00:03:11.680> easy<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.310> use<00:03:12.550> and<00:03:12.790> feel

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
they are both very easy to use and feel

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.140 
they are both very easy to use and feel
very<00:03:13.390> easy<00:03:13.720> to<00:03:13.870> handle<00:03:14.319> and<00:03:14.640> they<00:03:15.640> are<00:03:15.880> both

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
very easy to handle and they are both

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.660 
very easy to handle and they are both
very<00:03:16.569> very<00:03:17.080> long<00:03:17.350> as<00:03:17.530> pain<00:03:17.830> I<00:03:18.100> have<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.490> say

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
look very good and here's one is

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.190 
look very good and here's one is
slightly<00:03:38.890> of<00:03:39.340> a<00:03:39.489> larger<00:03:39.880> size<00:03:40.120> is<00:03:40.450> full<00:03:40.870> gram

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
slightly of a larger size is full gram

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.320 
slightly of a larger size is full gram
but<00:03:42.100> for<00:03:42.489> l'oreal<00:03:42.940> one<00:03:43.180> is<00:03:43.450> only<00:03:43.900> 3.5<00:03:44.910> so<00:03:45.910> not

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
but for l'oreal one is only 3.5 so not

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.170 
but for l'oreal one is only 3.5 so not
that<00:03:46.600> big<00:03:47.230> of<00:03:47.350> a<00:03:47.500> difference<00:03:47.650> but<00:03:48.580> for<00:03:49.060> the

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
that big of a difference but for the

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.960 
that big of a difference but for the
price<00:03:49.420> voice<00:03:49.830> she<00:03:50.830> can't<00:03:51.100> want<00:03:51.430> it's<00:03:51.670> way<00:03:51.940> more

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
price voice she can't want it's way more

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.229 
price voice she can't want it's way more
expensive<00:03:52.630> as<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.890> lawyer<00:03:54.370> was<00:03:54.640> as<00:03:54.910> you<00:03:55.030> can

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
expensive as the lawyer was as you can

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.060 
expensive as the lawyer was as you can
see<00:03:55.690> you<00:03:55.900> know<00:03:56.050> as<00:03:56.260> you<00:03:56.410> can<00:03:56.560> guess<00:03:56.620> is

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
see you know as you can guess is

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.160 
see you know as you can guess is
probably<00:03:57.250> more<00:03:58.080> price<00:03:59.080> pet<00:03:59.320> friendly<00:03:59.709> um<00:04:00.190> i

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
probably more price pet friendly um i

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.729 
probably more price pet friendly um i
would<00:04:02.170> say<00:04:02.670> texture<00:04:03.670> very<00:04:04.300> similar<00:04:04.810> effects

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
would say texture very similar effects

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.729 
would say texture very similar effects
very<00:04:06.280> similar<00:04:06.730> and<00:04:07.000> the<00:04:07.870> only<00:04:08.170> difference<00:04:08.530> i

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
very similar and the only difference i

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.800 
very similar and the only difference i
would<00:04:08.890> probably<00:04:09.280> say<00:04:09.489> it<00:04:09.700> is<00:04:09.940> the<00:04:10.150> price<00:04:10.420> and

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
would probably say it is the price and

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.030 
would probably say it is the price and
also<00:04:11.019> as<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:11.650> color<00:04:12.070> and<00:04:12.480> GA<00:04:13.480> one<00:04:14.110> i<00:04:14.500> say<00:04:14.829> that

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
also as the color and GA one i say that

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.000 
also as the color and GA one i say that
you<00:04:15.130> got<00:04:15.340> like<00:04:15.700> 10<00:04:16.479> 15<00:04:16.810> color<00:04:17.320> to<00:04:17.620> choose<00:04:17.650> from

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
you got like 10 15 color to choose from

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.400 
you got like 10 15 color to choose from
but<00:04:18.729> for<00:04:19.680> Laurie<00:04:20.680> 01<00:04:21.130> I<00:04:21.400> say<00:04:21.940> they<00:04:22.120> have<00:04:22.419> eight

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
but for Laurie 01 I say they have eight

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.909 
but for Laurie 01 I say they have eight
to<00:04:23.740> 10<00:04:23.979> and<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:25.180> color<00:04:25.450> selection<00:04:26.169> wise<00:04:26.350> GA

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
to 10 and the color selection wise GA

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.060 
to 10 and the color selection wise GA
one<00:04:27.370> probably<00:04:27.790> wins<00:04:28.180> and<00:04:28.960> they<00:04:29.320> got<00:04:29.350> all<00:04:29.830> these

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
one probably wins and they got all these

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.490 
one probably wins and they got all these
sophisticated<00:04:30.550> colors<00:04:31.450> like<00:04:31.810> you<00:04:32.350> know

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
but for the lawyer one they tend to go

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.159 
but for the lawyer one they tend to go
for<00:04:38.590> more<00:04:41.340> normal<00:04:42.340> kind<00:04:43.060> of<00:04:43.180> colors<00:04:43.570> like<00:04:43.870> you

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
for more normal kind of colors like you

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.030 
for more normal kind of colors like you

they don't seem to have a lot of shade

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.690 
they don't seem to have a lot of shade
within<00:04:51.040> one<00:04:51.340> color<00:04:51.610> like<00:04:53.130> if<00:04:54.130> you<00:04:54.280> want<00:04:54.490> black

brown but they don't have

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.810 
brown but they don't have
have<00:05:02.580> that<00:05:02.880> sophisticated<00:05:04.040> shimmer<00:05:05.040> to<00:05:05.790> it

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
have that sophisticated shimmer to it

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.070 
have that sophisticated shimmer to it
let<00:05:06.810> this<00:05:06.990> one<00:05:07.259> this<00:05:07.740> one<00:05:07.979> is<00:05:08.009> the<00:05:08.250> ga<00:05:08.490> one<00:05:09.080> when

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
let this one this one is the ga one when

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.529 
let this one this one is the ga one when
a<00:05:10.110> light<00:05:10.410> shine<00:05:10.710> on<00:05:10.740> it<00:05:11.009> the<00:05:11.910> color<00:05:12.210> actually

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
a light shine on it the color actually

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:16.790 
a light shine on it the color actually
changes<00:05:13.259> but<00:05:14.039> for<00:05:14.550> the<00:05:15.110> larger<00:05:16.110> one<00:05:16.350> is<00:05:16.560> more

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
changes but for the larger one is more

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
changes but for the larger one is more
like<00:05:17.070> a<00:05:17.400> very<00:05:18.320> party<00:05:19.320> shimmery<00:05:19.979> kind<00:05:20.669> of

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
like a very party shimmery kind of

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:28.670 
like a very party shimmery kind of
effect<00:05:21.449> um<00:05:22.110> i<00:05:24.620> would<00:05:25.620> say<00:05:25.830> um<00:05:26.990> the<00:05:27.990> color<00:05:28.320> wise

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
effect um i would say um the color wise

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.230 
effect um i would say um the color wise
I<00:05:28.710> don't<00:05:29.340> see<00:05:29.639> it's<00:05:31.280> very<00:05:32.280> similar<00:05:32.699> to<00:05:32.940> each

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
I don't see it's very similar to each

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.110 
I don't see it's very similar to each
other<00:05:33.419> because<00:05:33.780> they<00:05:34.500> probably<00:05:34.919> go<00:05:35.729> off<00:05:35.910> in

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
other because they probably go off in

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.510 
other because they probably go off in
different<00:05:36.150> ways<00:05:36.630> this<00:05:36.960> is<00:05:37.139> more<00:05:37.380> like

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
different ways this is more like

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.100 
different ways this is more like
everyday<00:05:38.520> I'll<00:05:38.850> be<00:05:38.970> used<00:05:39.270> but<00:05:39.539> this<00:05:39.720> is<00:05:39.900> more

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
everyday I'll be used but this is more

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.040 
everyday I'll be used but this is more
like<00:05:40.169> ocean<00:05:41.070> Murray<00:05:41.250> party<00:05:42.000> stuff<00:05:42.360> you<00:05:42.930> know

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
like ocean Murray party stuff you know

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.480

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
if you like a lot of shimmer you

dupe<00:06:18.750> for<00:06:19.310> GA<00:06:20.310> one<00:06:20.669> and<00:06:20.909> a<00:06:21.810> part<00:06:22.139> that<00:06:22.320> i<00:06:22.380> cannot

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
dupe for GA one and a part that i cannot

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.879 
dupe for GA one and a part that i cannot
really<00:06:22.979> find<00:06:23.220> a<00:06:23.370> color<00:06:23.550> that<00:06:23.789> much<00:06:24.830> you<00:06:25.830> know

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:25.889 
really find a color that much you know

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:28.879 
really find a color that much you know
in<00:06:26.220> both<00:06:26.610> of<00:06:26.760> the<00:06:26.909> Rangers<00:06:27.300> but<00:06:27.659> they're<00:06:28.620> very

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:28.889 
in both of the Rangers but they're very

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:31.670 
in both of the Rangers but they're very
similar<00:06:29.070> texture<00:06:29.820> everything<00:06:30.690> apart<00:06:31.470> from

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 
similar texture everything apart from

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.159 
similar texture everything apart from
the<00:06:31.800> colors<00:06:32.099> so<00:06:32.490> depends<00:06:32.970> on<00:06:33.180> what<00:06:33.479> kind<00:06:33.510> of

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:34.169 
the colors so depends on what kind of

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:37.760 
the colors so depends on what kind of
color<00:06:34.620> that<00:06:34.740> you<00:06:34.919> like<00:06:35.039> right<00:06:35.460> um<00:06:36.560> you<00:06:37.560> can
