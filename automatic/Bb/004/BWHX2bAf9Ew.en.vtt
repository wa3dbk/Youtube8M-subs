Tests, brewing tea

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.990
Hello! Today I'd like to tell you how tea originated in China and Japan.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
There are separate stories about it. Discovering tea in China is connected to a half-mythical 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.990
and legendary first Chinese emperor called Shenong.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Since he had divine powers, he decided to discover the effects of all herbs that he had close at hand for people in China.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.990
He wanted to do it to say which ones were healing, which poisonous,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.990
what effect they had and he started to test them. It turned out he came across a harmful plant

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that poisoned him and he decided to take a rest, drink some water and fight the toxins inside him,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
so he chose a big tree, put some fire and kettle under it to heat water because he drank cooked water for health.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.990
He decided to rest there. While waiting for water to boil, he fell asleep

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.990
and it turned out in the meantime a leaf fell from the tree and got into the kettle.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
It steeped and it was a tea leaf, indeed. When Shenong woke up he saw that the aromatic brew in his kettle looks and smells lovely.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.990
He drank it and it turned out his fatigue was gone. It also made him refreshed and energized

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.990
and all the symptoms connected with the poisoning by harmful plant disappeared.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.990
This was how Shenong discovered tea and its wonderful healing properties.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.990
He contributed to it healing properties that cured all the diseases and poisonings.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Later while testing other herbs, after tasting every single herb that he wasn't sure of,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Shenong drank the healing tea at any case and that's how tea was approved in China as a very healthy healing brew.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.990
Beginnings of tea in Japan are related to Bodhidharm, a Buddhist monk from India

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
got to Japan through China where he set up a Buddhist fraction called Zen and started to introduce Zen philosophy

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
which is tightly connected with tea. Where does it come from? Well, Bodhidharm, as a typical Buddhist monk, meditated a lot

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.990
and he often fell asleep during allnight meditations. He had a problem with it, fell asleep, 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.990
and one day he was so angry with his eyelids that they drop down during his meditation

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.990
that with a burst of frustration he decided to pull them away, 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.990
or cut them off as another version says. He threw them behind him.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.990
Thanks to that his eyes no longer closed and he could meditate all night long.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.990
In the morning it turned out that a bush grew out of his eyelids behind his back.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
It was the first tea bush in Japan. It soon turned out the brew from those leaves sweeps drowsiness away

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
refreshes the mind and helps meditating. Thanks to it the tea was especially popular by the Buddhist monks

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.990
who drank it commonly during meditation and served it to all of their guests.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
The tea also has an important role in the Zen philosophy where there's a whole way of tea

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000
which is based actually on the Zen philosophy.
