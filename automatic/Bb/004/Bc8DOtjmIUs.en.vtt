00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:26.769 

and<00:05:21.080> the<00:05:21.919> aircon<00:05:25.029> I'm<00:05:26.029> sure<00:05:26.330> you<00:05:26.509> can<00:05:26.629> hear

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:45.450 

so<00:05:42.210> very<00:05:42.479> compact<00:05:42.990> engine

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.969 

we<00:05:46.000> just<00:05:46.180> have<00:05:46.330> a<00:05:46.360> little<00:05:46.570> look<00:05:46.710> bit<00:05:47.710> hard<00:05:47.889> to

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979 
we just have a little look bit hard to

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:50.820 
we just have a little look bit hard to
see<00:05:48.310> but<00:05:48.790> it<00:05:49.060> is<00:05:49.120> clean<00:05:49.630> there's<00:05:50.199> no<00:05:50.380> oil<00:05:50.410> leaks

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
see but it is clean there's no oil leaks

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:57.050 
see but it is clean there's no oil leaks
on<00:05:51.100> the<00:05:51.190> car<00:05:51.430> it's<00:05:52.419> in<00:05:52.570> immaculate<00:05:52.780> condition

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.910 

and<00:05:57.540> you<00:05:57.630> can<00:05:57.780> probably<00:05:57.900> hear<00:05:58.170> that<00:05:58.560> it's<00:05:58.680> just

00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:58.920 
and you can probably hear that it's just

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.390 
and you can probably hear that it's just
tipping<00:05:59.220> away<00:05:59.430> nicely<00:05:59.990> so<00:06:00.990> this<00:06:01.140> is<00:06:01.290> a

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
tipping away nicely so this is a

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.540 
tipping away nicely so this is a
