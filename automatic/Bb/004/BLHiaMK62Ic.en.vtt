difference<00:00:31.360> between<00:00:31.450> art<00:00:31.720> and<00:00:31.869> craft<00:00:32.110> I<00:00:32.259> mean

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
difference between art and craft I mean

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.100 
difference between art and craft I mean
is<00:00:32.710> there<00:00:33.030> personally<00:00:34.030> I<00:00:34.300> don't<00:00:34.480> distinguish

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
is there personally I don't distinguish

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.750 
is there personally I don't distinguish
I<00:00:35.350> think<00:00:35.620> some<00:00:35.860> things<00:00:35.890> are<00:00:36.220> meant<00:00:36.340> to<00:00:36.490> delight

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
I think some things are meant to delight

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.729 
I think some things are meant to delight
and<00:00:37.090> others<00:00:37.420> are<00:00:37.450> meant<00:00:37.690> to<00:00:37.780> provoke<00:00:38.050> and<00:00:38.410> I

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
and others are meant to provoke and I

and others are meant to provoke and I
just<00:00:39.040> enjoy<00:00:39.400> the<00:00:39.579> end<00:00:39.700> product<00:00:39.910> alright<00:00:40.630> we

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
just enjoy the end product alright we

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.889 
just enjoy the end product alright we
move<00:00:40.930> on<00:00:41.110> to<00:00:41.350> something<00:00:41.560> that<00:00:41.710> looks<00:00:42.100> like<00:00:42.220> a

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
move on to something that looks like a

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.369 
move on to something that looks like a
ceramic<00:00:43.899> but<00:00:44.680> he's<00:00:44.800> not<00:00:44.980> know<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:46.690> actually<00:00:47.260> as

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
ceramic but he's not know it actually as

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.520 
ceramic but he's not know it actually as
glass<00:00:47.649> it's<00:00:48.039> by<00:00:48.190> carol<00:00:48.609> heron<00:00:49.000> and<00:00:49.379> carol<00:00:50.379> has

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
glass it's by carol heron and carol has

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.830 
glass it's by carol heron and carol has
a<00:00:50.559> very<00:00:50.800> specific<00:00:51.039> technique<00:00:51.640> he<00:00:51.789> uses<00:00:51.969> to

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
a very specific technique he uses to

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.860 
a very specific technique he uses to
create<00:00:53.079> this<00:00:53.440> very<00:00:54.340> opaque<00:00:54.870> translucent

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
create this very opaque translucent

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.580 
create this very opaque translucent
finish<00:00:56.500> now<00:00:56.980> this<00:00:57.100> is<00:00:57.160> quite<00:00:57.699> heavy<00:00:58.410> I'm<00:00:59.410> going

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
finish now this is quite heavy I'm going

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.130 
finish now this is quite heavy I'm going
to<00:00:59.710> tilt<00:00:59.949> it<00:01:00.100> forward<00:01:00.129> so<00:01:00.820> that<00:01:00.929> we<00:01:01.929> can

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
to tilt it forward so that we can

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.020 
to tilt it forward so that we can
actually<00:01:02.260> catch<00:01:02.649> a<00:01:02.769> glimpse<00:01:02.949> of<00:01:03.190> what's

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
actually catch a glimpse of what's

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.550 
actually catch a glimpse of what's
within<00:01:04.750> maybe<00:01:05.110> I'll<00:01:05.290> do<00:01:05.410> it<00:01:05.530> over<00:01:05.770> there<00:01:06.450> yeah

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
within maybe I'll do it over there yeah

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.070 
within maybe I'll do it over there yeah
now<00:01:08.560> you<00:01:08.620> can<00:01:08.950> see<00:01:09.100> inside<00:01:09.610> yes<00:01:10.510> due<00:01:10.810> to<00:01:10.930> how

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
now you can see inside yes due to how

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.410 
now you can see inside yes due to how
does<00:01:11.230> that<00:01:11.350> change<00:01:11.410> and<00:01:12.040> what<00:01:12.730> Carl<00:01:13.030> does<00:01:13.090> is

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
does that change and what Carl does is

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.810 
does that change and what Carl does is
he<00:01:13.630> layers<00:01:13.930> and<00:01:14.230> fuses<00:01:14.770> two<00:01:15.100> different<00:01:15.490> mixes

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
he layers and fuses two different mixes

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.100 
he layers and fuses two different mixes
of<00:01:15.970> glass<00:01:16.180> together<00:01:16.509> at<00:01:16.840> very<00:01:17.049> high

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
of glass together at very high

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.140 
of glass together at very high
temperatures<00:01:17.799> and<00:01:18.040> the<00:01:18.130> interplay<00:01:19.119> between

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
temperatures and the interplay between

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.719 
temperatures and the interplay between
those<00:01:19.930> two<00:01:20.200> different<00:01:20.530> mixes<00:01:20.920> creates<00:01:21.430> this

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
those two different mixes creates this

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.630 
those two different mixes creates this
third<00:01:22.060> element<00:01:22.329> this<00:01:23.159> dramatic<00:01:24.159> line<00:01:24.400> that

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
third element this dramatic line that

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.280 
third element this dramatic line that
you<00:01:24.729> can<00:01:24.880> see<00:01:25.090> so<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.509> decorating<00:01:26.020> comes

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
you can see so the decorating comes

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.260 
you can see so the decorating comes
really<00:01:27.159> as<00:01:27.369> a<00:01:27.399> result<00:01:27.850> of<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.090> natural

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
really as a result of the natural

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.109 
really as a result of the natural
process<00:01:28.689> of<00:01:29.079> the<00:01:29.229> the<00:01:29.560> glass<00:01:29.740> fusing<00:01:30.250> okay<00:01:30.909> and

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
process of the the glass fusing okay and

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.630 
process of the the glass fusing okay and
another<00:01:31.470> example<00:01:32.470> of<00:01:32.740> his<00:01:32.920> work<00:01:33.130> here<00:01:33.460> and

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
another example of his work here and

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.539 
another example of his work here and
again<00:01:33.939> add<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:35.680> detail<00:01:36.040> I<00:01:36.070> mean<00:01:36.280> this<00:01:36.369> is

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
again add the the detail I mean this is

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.359 
again add the the detail I mean this is
not<00:01:36.700> painted<00:01:37.270> on<00:01:37.420> this<00:01:37.780> is<00:01:37.960> used<00:01:38.740> in<00:01:39.130> to<00:01:39.250> the

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
not painted on this is used in to the

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.310 
not painted on this is used in to the
guests<00:01:39.610> it's<00:01:39.880> a<00:01:40.000> it's<00:01:40.299> the<00:01:40.450> process<00:01:40.840> of<00:01:40.930> making

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
guests it's a it's the process of making

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.350 
guests it's a it's the process of making
that<00:01:41.439> creates<00:01:41.799> the<00:01:41.890> decoration<00:01:42.490> and<00:01:42.670> he<00:01:43.240> also

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
that creates the decoration and he also

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.109 
that creates the decoration and he also
sands<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:44.110> pieces<00:01:44.500> for<00:01:45.460> much<00:01:45.610> longer<00:01:45.790> time

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
sands the pieces for much longer time

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.209 
sands the pieces for much longer time
than<00:01:46.180> one<00:01:46.540> would<00:01:46.719> normally<00:01:46.960> infuse<00:01:47.920> class

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219 
than one would normally infuse class

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:49.740 
than one would normally infuse class
which<00:01:48.850> is<00:01:48.969> what<00:01:49.149> gives<00:01:49.270> it<00:01:49.479> this<00:01:49.570> particular

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
which is what gives it this particular

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.069 
which is what gives it this particular
pig<00:01:50.290> is<00:01:50.439> not<00:01:50.680> a<00:01:51.250> matte<00:01:51.729> finish<00:01:51.759> it's<00:01:52.390> right<00:01:52.600> we

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
pig is not a matte finish it's right we

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.679 
pig is not a matte finish it's right we
actually<00:01:53.409> brought<00:01:53.979> cards<00:01:54.310> work<00:01:54.490> over<00:01:54.880> to<00:01:55.119> sofa

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
actually brought cards work over to sofa
