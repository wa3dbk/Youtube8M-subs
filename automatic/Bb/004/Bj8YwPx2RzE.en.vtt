00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.290
 let's compare the aquarium 4.5 and the 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.420
 motogp two feature terminals 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.550
 pretty similar and similar prices 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.140
 many experts would choose the 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.029
 Motorola smartphone with eyes 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.830
 closed but let's see if really 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.470
 is so superior to the Spanish brand 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.970
 At first glance you can see how 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.039
 both devices have some 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.599
 almost identical dimensions although the 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.879
 motogp presents one more aspect 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.610
 rounded possibly more pleasant to 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.739
 the view if we take both devices 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.970
 if we notice an important difference of 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.980
 weight 143 against 123 grams here wins 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.660
 clearly the betis although it is quite 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.820
 complicated to appreciate in the video 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.890
 we can say that the motorcycle screen 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.399
 gp is quite better than the aquarium 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.140
 4.5 has higher resolution and higher 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.690
 pixel density what it provides 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.190
 sharper images one of the big ones 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.230
 differences is in the buttons of 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.059
 navigation while in the model of 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.280
 bq are physical in the motorola 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.410
 appear on the screen that is better 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.479
 now who says that in case of failure of 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.890
 the physical buttons these could not be 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.049
 fix with an update of 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.130
 operating system while others the 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.200
 will descend 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.899
 by not occupying space on the screen here 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.270
 we do not get wet both phones have 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:24.920
 very similar batteries identical memory 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.720
 ram and the storage space by 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.970
 the effect of that same although in the case 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.590
 of the aquarium bq 4.5 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.229
 can be expanded by a card 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.659
 microsd in theory the camera of the aquarium 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.030
 is something better than the motorcycle g 8 are 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.710
 megapixels versus 5 although we've already 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.479
 seen its shortcomings at the time of 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.399
 take pictures in low light conditions 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.619
 which of the two has the best 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.210
 processor some will prefer the 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.099
 popularity of a chipset manufactured by 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.250
 qualcomm as the one that incorporates the motogp 

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:54.080
 in front of the mediatek processor of the bq a 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.659
 benchmark like that of avtur can us 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.890
 remove doubts at any time as 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.929
 you can see in your doubt the bq to 44.5 as 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.970
 the best of the two devices with one 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:10.220
 score of 18 thousand 635 against 18,337 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.590
 They are not bad for a phone 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.569
 designed in Spain and costing between 20 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.569
 and 30 euros cheaper than its competitor
