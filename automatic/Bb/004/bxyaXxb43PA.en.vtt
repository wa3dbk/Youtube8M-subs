 Hello all together, Buster's case is deep of 4 because the BSG «take today 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.719
 I like the ps3 version of Lego Indiana Jones 2's new adventures 

00:00:22.719 --> 00:00:23.239
 magnifying glass 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:25.089
 have fun watching 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.130
 For some years, this has been providing Lego blocks in the world of video games 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:34.570
 So now the successor to Lego Indiana Jones 2 0 2 points on 16 out of the 14 it 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.579
 There are a total of six sections that could have been around the crystal skulls 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:37.970
 rotates 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.840
 however, the district council of one of the other these are not 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.490
 identical to the one on the first game 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.300
 if we do not always do something different 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.570
 Basically it looks like that on a map the opposite the pelvis 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.510
 filled or houses of the world will seek the gate in front 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.840
 is on the way September is another important figures or 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.990
 Vehicles can buy 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.330
 you have to solve many puzzles Run a race Kempf and much more 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.880
 you get a lot to collect 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.140
 1 this game lives from Coop i got the game then i would not go 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.010
 as soon as the players are related to each other, I'm something 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.830
 were most flexible spree 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.090
 There are things 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.359
 Lastly, there is a level editor by surprise 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:17.870
 own levels choice 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.410
 Storr man runs without problems until you then get into a vehicle 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.300
 we are extremely getting used to driving he liked that is not good at 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.800
 the graphics are okay we are better rated as good 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.270
 The boss fights are very resourceful and for me always parts 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.870
 even the cutscenes are right actually celebrating the best match 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.750
 played not Christian to 50 meters wins 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.450
 However, if you run on the map in order to legally allow Nelles leads 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.170
 and all that then, too 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.170
 These are partly bark confusing and also later 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.340
 but if you need a certain figure to get ahead you know 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.810
 not where the dead man walks around 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.500
 It is glad that it goes along 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.810
 The display is also not as great as you might think, in part you can see 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.160
 not where you are what you do and in general I am the partial 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.250
 a headache 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.520
 Anton I have that nothing 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.539
 it should have reversed the tire defect 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.709
 he has from the asset class k -d one also likes to hear 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.819
 but hard to play a few hours later proved Kießling met 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.999
 Looking for the right heaviest 

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:18.999
 Playboy Mansion seems to be freeing it 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:26.149
 increase 

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:29.149
 Children receives 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.439
 so a great whole the games he value 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:36.229
 Values ​​are absolutely no fun 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:38.169
 Bartlett direct hit 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:41.949
 That said to Guttenberg there is very little variety and could immediately 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:45.479
 you would have to buy the same figures in the car again and again what in the section 

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:46.589
 once 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:48.879
 rather, there is no patience there 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.199
 but maybe I'm just moving on 

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:55.039
 and the latter liked it he planed there says it off 

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:56.079
 so decreases 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.930
 Nonetheless, this game is definitely something of the moments 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.709
 Crazies is due 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.989
 she is now ringing such games at short notice 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.269
 according to pay 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.659
 Romain Cool's k12 Tropez does not exist but that's different 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.189
 Veni Vidi did not give said virus 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:15.189
 the ETA was empty and it's early then let it be 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:18.769
 Although I am not worth a bed 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.669
 at least not voluntarily 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:22.609
 lower ducks 2 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:24.439
 four out of ten biggest 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:26.619
 I'm close to it 

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:29.619
 Mittelbach Provider 

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:46.369
 we have
