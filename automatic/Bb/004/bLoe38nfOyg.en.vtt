00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
well obviously you can adjust these

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.819 
well obviously you can adjust these
measurements<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:42.240> make<00:01:42.420> more<00:01:42.810> or<00:01:43.110> less<00:01:43.470> of

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
measurements to make more or less of
