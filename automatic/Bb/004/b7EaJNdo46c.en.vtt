right<00:01:59.340> now<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.969> we're<00:02:00.899> getting<00:02:00.990> about<00:02:01.229> a

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
right now and we're getting about a

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.669 
right now and we're getting about a
gallon<00:02:02.039> per<00:02:02.729> tree<00:02:03.030> when<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:03.869> say<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.500> it

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
gallon per tree when you say that is it

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:09.080 
gallon per tree when you say that is it
a<00:02:04.829> gallon<00:02:05.189> what's<00:02:05.340> up<00:02:06.739> okay<00:02:07.739> so<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.640> mean<00:02:08.789> really

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
a gallon what's up okay so I mean really

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.539 
a gallon what's up okay so I mean really
that<00:02:09.149> just<00:02:09.420> translates<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:10.019> I<00:02:10.319> think<00:02:10.679> we've

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:11.549 
that just translates to I think we've

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:14.539 
that just translates to I think we've
done<00:02:11.700> maybe<00:02:11.910> five<00:02:12.510> gallons<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.349> syrup<00:02:13.709> so<00:02:14.280> far

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
done maybe five gallons of syrup so far

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.410 
done maybe five gallons of syrup so far
this<00:02:14.910> season<00:02:15.120> okay<00:02:15.720> so<00:02:16.470> by<00:02:17.209> standards<00:02:18.209> back

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
this season okay so by standards back

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.650 
this season okay so by standards back
east<00:02:18.720> it's<00:02:18.959> pretty<00:02:19.829> modest<00:02:20.220> amount<00:02:20.519> but<00:02:21.510> for

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
east it's pretty modest amount but for

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.539 
east it's pretty modest amount but for
here<00:02:21.930> is<00:02:22.079> tremendous<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.739> potential<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.370> to

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
here is tremendous the potential is to

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.270 
here is tremendous the potential is to
produce<00:02:23.760> more<00:02:24.209> here<00:02:24.540> but<00:02:25.319> it's<00:02:25.470> over<00:02:25.739> a<00:02:25.920> longer

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
produce more here but it's over a longer

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.979 
produce more here but it's over a longer
period<00:02:26.610> of<00:02:26.790> time<00:02:26.849> with<00:02:27.239> five<00:02:27.450> months<00:02:27.810> we're

syrup is an excellent source of

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.039 
syrup is an excellent source of

the Sun can hit the SAP and thought you

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.729 
the Sun can hit the SAP and thought you

gonna get out of the tree here in the
day<00:03:15.150> I<00:03:15.389> guess<00:03:15.630> you<00:03:15.690> could<00:03:15.780> give<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:15.930> a<00:03:16.019> slight

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
Laurie there's your first tree out of

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.650 
Laurie there's your first tree out of
this<00:04:13.590> SAP<00:04:13.950> you're<00:04:14.670> gonna<00:04:14.760> boil<00:04:15.000> down<00:04:15.120> to<00:04:15.239> syrup

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
this SAP you're gonna boil down to syrup

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.000 
this SAP you're gonna boil down to syrup
and<00:04:15.780> how<00:04:15.870> many<00:04:15.989> products<00:04:16.470> do<00:04:16.560> you<00:04:16.620> make<00:04:16.799> from

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
and how many products do you make from

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.420 
and how many products do you make from
this<00:04:17.130> with<00:04:17.790> the<00:04:17.940> BC<00:04:18.479> syrup<00:04:19.200> right<00:04:19.470> now<00:04:19.709> we're

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
this with the BC syrup right now we're

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.750 
this with the BC syrup right now we're
making<00:04:20.459> strictly<00:04:21.530> maple<00:04:22.530> syrup<00:04:22.889> and<00:04:23.130> we're

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
making strictly maple syrup and we're

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.280 
making strictly maple syrup and we're
fooling<00:04:24.330> around<00:04:24.570> with<00:04:24.720> a<00:04:24.750> couple<00:04:24.960> other

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
fooling around with a couple other

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.100 
fooling around with a couple other
byproducts<00:04:26.040> and<00:04:26.280> I<00:04:26.340> make<00:04:26.490> maple<00:04:27.419> sugar<00:04:27.720> in<00:04:27.990> a

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
byproducts and I make maple sugar in a

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.200 
byproducts and I make maple sugar in a
traditional<00:04:28.650> block<00:04:28.919> form<00:04:29.280> before<00:04:29.729> maple

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
traditional block form before maple

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.020 
traditional block form before maple
syrup<00:04:30.800> the<00:04:31.800> First<00:04:32.010> Nations<00:04:32.310> made<00:04:32.430> maple<00:04:32.790> sugar

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
syrup the First Nations made maple sugar

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.940 
syrup the First Nations made maple sugar
and<00:04:33.390> it<00:04:33.690> would<00:04:33.780> be<00:04:33.900> like<00:04:34.020> in<00:04:34.169> a<00:04:34.260> cake<00:04:34.500> type<00:04:34.830> of

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
and it would be like in a cake type of

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.670 
and it would be like in a cake type of
format<00:04:35.310> so<00:04:35.789> with<00:04:36.030> the<00:04:36.419> microloan<00:04:37.229> I<00:04:37.350> was<00:04:37.500> able

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
format so with the microloan I was able

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.950 
format so with the microloan I was able
to<00:04:37.710> get<00:04:37.890> through<00:04:38.220> farm<00:04:38.760> folk<00:04:39.060> city<00:04:39.330> folk<00:04:39.600> for

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
to get through farm folk city folk for

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.890 
to get through farm folk city folk for
farmers<00:04:40.919> and<00:04:41.300> for<00:04:42.300> small-scale<00:04:42.510> food

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
farmers and for small-scale food

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.590 
farmers and for small-scale food
processors<00:04:43.500> they<00:04:43.919> were<00:04:43.979> able<00:04:44.310> to<00:04:44.490> allow<00:04:45.210> me<00:04:45.390> to

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
processors they were able to allow me to

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.750 
processors they were able to allow me to
purchase<00:04:45.810> some<00:04:46.229> equipment<00:04:46.289> for<00:04:47.070> granulating

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
purchase some equipment for granulating

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.760 
purchase some equipment for granulating
the<00:04:48.030> maple<00:04:48.300> sugar<00:04:48.510> so<00:04:48.840> from<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.200> block<00:04:49.500> form

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
the maple sugar so from the block form

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.770 
the maple sugar so from the block form
of<00:04:49.860> the<00:04:49.919> cake<00:04:50.100> form<00:04:50.400> I<00:04:50.610> could<00:04:50.820> make<00:04:50.970> it<00:04:51.120> more

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
of the cake form I could make it more

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.260 
of the cake form I could make it more
accessible<00:04:52.140> for<00:04:52.470> people<00:04:52.830> west<00:04:53.789> to<00:04:54.060> use

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
accessible for people west to use

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.880 
accessible for people west to use
basically<00:04:54.780> what<00:04:54.960> I<00:04:54.990> would<00:04:55.200> do<00:04:55.320> before<00:04:55.440> is<00:04:55.710> just

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
basically what I would do before is just

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.090 
basically what I would do before is just
stir<00:04:56.190> it<00:04:56.340> and<00:04:56.640> have<00:04:56.940> to<00:04:57.030> keep<00:04:57.210> stirring<00:04:57.660> it<00:04:58.100> to

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
stir it and have to keep stirring it to

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.800 
stir it and have to keep stirring it to
evaporate<00:04:59.400> all<00:04:59.729> the<00:04:59.940> the<00:05:00.270> liquid<00:05:00.570> out<00:05:00.690> of

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
evaporate all the the liquid out of

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.200 
evaporate all the the liquid out of
there<00:05:00.930> and<00:05:01.110> then<00:05:01.770> pour<00:05:01.979> through<00:05:02.280> screens<00:05:02.669> into

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
there and then pour through screens into

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.270 
there and then pour through screens into
granulator<00:05:03.840> but<00:05:04.110> with<00:05:04.350> the<00:05:04.710> equipment<00:05:04.979> I<00:05:05.160> was

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
granulator but with the equipment I was

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.029 
granulator but with the equipment I was
able<00:05:05.490> to<00:05:05.520> get<00:05:05.700> through<00:05:06.060> the<00:05:06.120> microloan<00:05:07.039> those

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
able to get through the microloan those

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:09.890 
able to get through the microloan those
steps<00:05:08.400> was<00:05:08.850> very<00:05:09.060> labor-intensive

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
steps was very labor-intensive

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.830 
steps was very labor-intensive
repetitive<00:05:10.590> motion<00:05:10.919> injury<00:05:11.250> steps<00:05:11.550> are

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
repetitive motion injury steps are

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.960 
repetitive motion injury steps are
removed<00:05:12.840> now<00:05:13.169> and<00:05:13.650> I<00:05:14.220> can<00:05:14.400> make<00:05:14.580> actually

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
removed now and I can make actually

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.850 
removed now and I can make actually
larger<00:05:15.270> quantity<00:05:15.810> in<00:05:16.229> the<00:05:16.440> same<00:05:16.650> amount<00:05:16.830> of

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
larger quantity in the same amount of

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.040 
larger quantity in the same amount of
time<00:05:17.039> it<00:05:17.190> would<00:05:17.280> take<00:05:17.490> me<00:05:17.640> on<00:05:18.210> my<00:05:18.390> own<00:05:18.539> stovetop

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
time it would take me on my own stovetop

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.960 
time it would take me on my own stovetop
as<00:05:19.289> I<00:05:19.410> was<00:05:19.530> doing<00:05:19.740> it<00:05:19.830> in<00:05:19.919> the<00:05:20.010> past<00:05:20.190> this<00:05:20.820> is
