on the custom night let's get into this
because<00:00:37.140> it's<00:00:37.320> going<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.530> be<00:00:37.620> really<00:00:37.860> long

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
the first part is probably going to be

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.630 
the first part is probably going to be
the<00:00:46.680> selection<00:00:48.320> first<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.530> start<00:00:49.829> off<00:00:50.039> with<00:00:50.460> in

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640

is clicked and let me see change AI x
minus<00:01:39.930> 1<00:01:40.380> oh<00:01:40.590> yeah<00:01:41.130> this<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.700> scripts

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
minus 1 oh yeah this is the scripts

minus 1 oh yeah this is the scripts
because<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.720> got<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.990> create<00:01:43.290> on<00:01:43.680> this<00:01:44.070> arrow

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
because you got to create on this arrow

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.910 
because you got to create on this arrow
looking<00:01:45.810> thing<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:48.079> this<00:01:49.079> arrow<00:01:49.380> means<00:01:49.740> it's

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
looking thing and this arrow means it's

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.240 
looking thing and this arrow means it's
going<00:01:50.040> down<00:01:50.280> this<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.700> mean<00:01:50.909> it's<00:01:51.060> going<00:01:51.299> up<00:01:52.250> and

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
going down this I mean it's going up and

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.100 
going down this I mean it's going up and
then<00:01:53.579> once<00:01:53.759> you've<00:01:53.939> done<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.840> need<00:01:54.990> to

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
then once you've done that you need to

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:05.410 
then once you've done that you need to
do<00:01:55.259> if<00:01:58.219> so<00:01:59.219> if<00:02:01.040> um<00:02:02.990> pascual<00:02:03.990> i<00:02:04.020> get<00:02:04.380> slower<00:02:04.860> than

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
do if so if um pascual i get slower than

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.749 
do if so if um pascual i get slower than
0<00:02:07.009> you're<00:02:08.009> just<00:02:08.160> going<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.489> set<00:02:08.940> it

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
0 you're just going to set it

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.640 
0 you're just going to set it
20<00:02:11.640> yeah<00:02:12.640> I've<00:02:13.000> already<00:02:13.599> done<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.019> one<00:02:14.230> for

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
20 yeah I've already done the one for

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.250 
20 yeah I've already done the one for
chuck<00:02:14.950> e<00:02:15.099> cheese<00:02:15.430> so<00:02:16.180> I<00:02:16.209> made<00:02:16.599> sure<00:02:16.629> that<00:02:16.959> it

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
chuck e cheese so I made sure that it

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.860 
chuck e cheese so I made sure that it
worked<00:02:19.200> so<00:02:20.200> that's<00:02:20.349> getting<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.950> sun<00:02:21.840> sea<00:02:22.840> and

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
worked so that's getting the sun sea and

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.869 
worked so that's getting the sun sea and
then<00:02:23.409> you're<00:02:23.560> going<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.709> basically<00:02:24.099> duplicate

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
then you're going to basically duplicate

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:30.600 
then you're going to basically duplicate
the<00:02:25.030> whole<00:02:25.209> thing<00:02:25.599> on<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:26.049> the<00:02:26.700> second<00:02:27.700> one<00:02:29.610> but

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
the whole thing on to the second one but

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.210 
the whole thing on to the second one but
it's<00:02:30.940> going<00:02:31.239> to<00:02:31.299> be<00:02:31.480> plus<00:02:31.840> one<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.560> if<00:02:32.950> it<00:02:33.099> gets

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
it's going to be plus one and if it gets

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.789 
it's going to be plus one and if it gets
over<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.970> number<00:02:34.420> you<00:02:34.840> want<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.170> highest<00:02:35.560> to

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
over the number you want the highest to

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.369 
over the number you want the highest to
be<00:02:36.010> i<00:02:36.280> doing<00:02:37.000> five<00:02:37.329> because<00:02:37.629> it's<00:02:37.810> lower<00:02:38.049> and

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
be i doing five because it's lower and

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.619 
be i doing five because it's lower and
it<00:02:38.440> takes<00:02:38.680> less<00:02:38.920> time<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.310> do<00:02:39.750> set<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:41.079> five<00:02:41.319> and

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
it takes less time to do set to five and

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.170 
it takes less time to do set to five and
now<00:02:43.629> the<00:02:44.319> heart<00:02:44.590> of<00:02:45.159> one<00:02:45.459> of<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:45.760> hardest

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
now the heart of one of the hardest

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.360 
now the heart of one of the hardest
parts<00:02:46.599> well<00:02:47.079> it's<00:02:47.319> guess<00:02:47.680> it's<00:02:47.859> kind<00:02:48.040> of<00:02:48.069> easy

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
parts well it's guess it's kind of easy

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.270 
parts well it's guess it's kind of easy

so<00:04:13.390> like<00:04:13.540> that<00:04:13.780> and<00:04:14.140> then<00:04:14.379> do<00:04:15.600> 0<00:04:16.949> and<00:04:17.949> then<00:04:18.190> just

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
so like that and then do 0 and then just

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.550 
so like that and then do 0 and then just
do<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:18.609> numbers<00:04:19.090> you<00:04:19.389> want<00:04:19.509> your<00:04:19.690> AI<00:04:19.959> thing<00:04:20.410> to

do the numbers you want your AI thing to
go<00:04:20.680> to<00:04:21.840> maximum<00:04:24.660> 45<00:04:27.630> and<00:04:28.630> then<00:04:28.660> you're<00:04:28.840> just

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
go to maximum 45 and then you're just

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.439 
go to maximum 45 and then you're just
going<00:04:29.110> to<00:04:29.199> do<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:29.560> costumes<00:04:29.800> that<00:04:30.520> go<00:04:30.880> up<00:04:31.120> to
