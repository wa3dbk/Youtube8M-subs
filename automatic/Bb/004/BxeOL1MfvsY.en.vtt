00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
sweet development board here so this is

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.719 
sweet development board here so this is
running<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.760> TI<00:01:12.299> omap<00:01:13.049> processor<00:01:13.729> so

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
running on the TI omap processor so

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.090

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
and a dev kit for TI OMAP would be like

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.600

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
so you can see let's just do a little

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.550 
so you can see let's just do a little
little<00:02:21.420> swapping<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:22.140> you<00:02:22.200> see<00:02:22.380> this<00:02:22.500> is

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560
