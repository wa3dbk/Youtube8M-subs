one thing I didn't mention in the just
one<00:02:35.900> cool<00:02:36.080> thing<00:02:36.290> about<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.560> binding<00:02:37.010> is<00:02:37.069> real

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
one cool thing about the binding is real

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.670 
one cool thing about the binding is real
quick<00:02:37.310> I<00:02:37.459> didn't<00:02:37.670> do<00:02:37.730> in<00:02:37.849> the<00:02:37.940> review<00:02:38.209> video<00:02:38.680> is

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
quick I didn't do in the review video is

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.600 
quick I didn't do in the review video is
uh<00:02:41.290> okay<00:02:42.290> like<00:02:42.500> when<00:02:42.950> it<00:02:43.040> comes<00:02:43.280> these

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
uh okay like when it comes these

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.460 
uh okay like when it comes these
bindings<00:02:44.000> are<00:02:44.090> mediums<00:02:44.480> for<00:02:44.840> this<00:02:44.959> board<00:02:45.230> so

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
bindings are mediums for this board so

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.800 
bindings are mediums for this board so
so<00:02:46.280> um<00:02:46.489> I<00:02:46.870> think<00:02:47.870> it<00:02:48.080> fits<00:02:48.260> up<00:02:48.410> to<00:02:48.440> size<00:02:48.800> 11<00:02:49.810> or

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
so um I think it fits up to size 11 or

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.290 
so um I think it fits up to size 11 or
10<00:02:51.050> shoe<00:02:51.709> on<00:02:51.920> a<00:02:51.950> mat<00:02:52.220> or<00:02:52.519> boot<00:02:52.730> or<00:02:52.849> whatever<00:02:53.060> so

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
10 shoe on a mat or boot or whatever so

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.009 
10 shoe on a mat or boot or whatever so
but<00:02:53.959> um<00:02:54.140> they<00:02:54.290> come<00:02:55.450> they<00:02:56.450> come<00:02:56.600> in<00:02:56.750> like<00:02:56.870> the

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
but um they come they come in like the

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.000 
but um they come they come in like the
smallest<00:02:58.269> like<00:02:59.269> the<00:02:59.420> small<00:02:59.690> setting<00:03:00.140> cool

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
smallest like the small setting cool

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.340 
smallest like the small setting cool
thing<00:03:01.220> is<00:03:01.340> there's<00:03:01.489> this<00:03:01.730> tab<00:03:02.000> here<00:03:02.299> and<00:03:03.260> it

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
thing is there's this tab here and it

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.820 
thing is there's this tab here and it
flips<00:03:03.680> up<00:03:03.920> that's<00:03:04.790> a<00:03:04.970> screw<00:03:05.390> and<00:03:05.720> like<00:03:06.500> you<00:03:06.680> can

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
flips up that's a screw and like you can

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.830 
flips up that's a screw and like you can
make<00:03:06.950> it<00:03:07.069> bigger<00:03:07.280> smaller<00:03:07.549> or<00:03:07.880> whatever<00:03:08.120> same

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
make it bigger smaller or whatever same
