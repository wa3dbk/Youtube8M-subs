pretty<00:00:13.920> scary<00:00:14.250> no<00:00:14.519> just<00:00:14.790> take<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:14.940> deep<00:00:15.089> breath

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
pretty scary no just take a deep breath

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.029 
pretty scary no just take a deep breath
relax<00:00:15.660> let's<00:00:16.289> start<00:00:16.500> with<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.680> first<00:00:16.890> one

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
relax let's start with the first one

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.279 
relax let's start with the first one
heterozygous<00:00:17.670> for<00:00:18.300> both<00:00:18.330> trait<00:00:18.840> that<00:00:19.109> should

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
heterozygous for both trait that should

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.950 
heterozygous for both trait that should
be<00:00:19.410> easy<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:20.070> just<00:00:20.670> take<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.240> bigger<00:00:21.630> small

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
be easy you just take the bigger small

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.259 
be easy you just take the bigger small
our<00:00:22.230> depth<00:00:22.710> arrows<00:00:23.070> ideas<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.609> then<00:00:23.850> be<00:00:24.060> wise

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
our depth arrows ideas and then be wise

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.839 
our depth arrows ideas and then be wise
well<00:00:24.539> why<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:25.380> heterozygous<00:00:26.039> for<00:00:26.340> both<00:00:26.369> tree

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
well why so heterozygous for both tree

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.240 
well why so heterozygous for both tree
the<00:00:27.480> other<00:00:27.599> one<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.109> hormones<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:29.070> guess

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
the other one is a hormones I guess

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.479 
the other one is a hormones I guess
round<00:00:29.929> hormones<00:00:30.929> I<00:00:31.050> guess<00:00:31.230> round<00:00:31.439> well<00:00:31.830> we

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
round hormones I guess round well we

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.790 
round hormones I guess round well we
know<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.239> has<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.630> be<00:00:33.780> round<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.710> has

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
know that it has to be round so it has

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.889 
know that it has to be round so it has
to<00:00:34.920> be<00:00:35.040> big<00:00:35.309> R<00:00:35.550> but<00:00:36.270> then<00:00:36.390> because<00:00:36.690> it's

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
to be big R but then because it's

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.260 
to be big R but then because it's
homozygous<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.860> has<00:00:38.070> P<00:00:38.250> big<00:00:38.460> R<00:00:38.610> big<00:00:38.640> R<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.149> not

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
homozygous it has P big R big R and not

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.049 
homozygous it has P big R big R and not
big<00:00:39.450> R<00:00:39.600> small<00:00:39.719> R<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.190> a<00:00:41.190> heterozygous<00:00:41.730> yellow

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
big R small R and a heterozygous yellow

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.729 
big R small R and a heterozygous yellow
because<00:00:42.360> their<00:00:42.600> hair<00:00:42.750> looks<00:00:42.930> like<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.230> the

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
because their hair looks like is the

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.380 
because their hair looks like is the
opposite<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:44.550> Hera<00:00:44.730> was<00:00:44.879> like<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:45.210> is

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
opposite so Hera was like this is

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.000 
opposite so Hera was like this is
technically<00:00:45.809> usually<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.410> easiest<00:00:46.770> one<00:00:46.980> to

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
technically usually the easiest one to

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.790 
technically usually the easiest one to
go<00:00:47.190> around<00:00:47.989> okay<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.050> we're<00:00:49.289> asked<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.500> cross

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
go around okay so we're asked to cross

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.740 
go around okay so we're asked to cross
them<00:00:50.010> together<00:00:50.129> now<00:00:50.879> it's<00:00:51.090> not<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.270> hard<00:00:51.539> to

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
them together now it's not that hard to

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.610 
them together now it's not that hard to
take<00:00:51.899> them<00:00:52.050> one<00:00:52.170> at<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.320> time

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
take them one at a time

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.580 
take them one at a time
remember<00:00:53.460> for<00:00:54.120> everyone<00:00:54.570> are<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:55.260> start<00:00:55.500> with

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
remember for everyone are you start with

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.290 
remember for everyone are you start with
one<00:00:55.770> why<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.309> that's<00:00:56.730> when<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:56.940> get<00:00:57.090> for<00:00:57.239> the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
one why and that's when you get for the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.209 
one why and that's when you get for the
first<00:00:57.510> one<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.989> then<00:00:58.530> for<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.859> second<00:00:59.190> one

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
first one and then for the second one

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.990 
first one and then for the second one
it's<00:00:59.670> the<00:01:00.570> same<00:01:00.840> are<00:01:01.160> with<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.550> other<00:01:02.579> why

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
it's the same are with the other why

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.609 
it's the same are with the other why
that's<00:01:03.690> when<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:03.899> get<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.199> second<00:01:04.470> one

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
that's when you get to the second one

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.830 
that's when you get to the second one
and<00:01:04.860> then<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.369> do<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.670> other<00:01:05.700> one<00:01:06.000> for<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.540> R

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
and then you do the other one for this R

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.870 
and then you do the other one for this R
and<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.290> Y<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.920> then<00:01:08.010> for<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:08.280> R<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
and this Y and then for this R and the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.820 
and this Y and then for this R and the
last<00:01:09.090> Y<00:01:09.470> okay<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:11.010> between<00:01:11.549> doing<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.830> parents

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
last Y okay so between doing the parents

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:14.960 
last Y okay so between doing the parents
on<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.979> left<00:01:14.189> side<00:01:14.369> or<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.580> parents<00:01:14.850> on<00:01:14.909> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
on the left side or the parents on the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.160 
on the left side or the parents on the
right<00:01:15.119> side<00:01:15.330> doesn't<00:01:15.570> really<00:01:15.810> matter<00:01:16.020> which

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
right side doesn't really matter which

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.450 
right side doesn't really matter which
parent<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.590> do<00:01:16.710> as<00:01:16.950> long<00:01:17.220> as<00:01:17.280> you're

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
parent you do as long as you're

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.080 
parent you do as long as you're
consistent

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
consistent

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.460 
consistent
that's<00:01:18.210> all<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.390> matter<00:01:18.600> all<00:01:19.080> right<00:01:19.110> let's<00:01:19.350> move

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
that's all I matter all right let's move

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.230 
that's all I matter all right let's move
on<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.830> second<00:01:20.100> parent<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.880> second

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
on to the second parent the second

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.480 
on to the second parent the second
parent<00:01:21.600> we<00:01:21.720> start<00:01:21.900> where<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.110> R<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:23.250> Y

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
parent we start where this R and this Y

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.640 
parent we start where this R and this Y
here's<00:01:24.030> our<00:01:24.180> first<00:01:24.330> one<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:25.290> would<00:01:25.439> do<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
here's our first one and it would do the

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.740 
here's our first one and it would do the
same<00:01:25.799> thing<00:01:25.860> with<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.220> R<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.180> last<00:01:27.390> why

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
same thing with this R and the last why

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.960 
same thing with this R and the last why
there's<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.380> second<00:01:28.680> one<00:01:28.740> then<00:01:29.430> we'll<00:01:29.579> do<00:01:29.759> the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
there's a second one then we'll do the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.090 
there's a second one then we'll do the
third<00:01:30.150> one<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.750> aren't<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.259> y<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:31.950> this

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
third one this aren't is y and in this

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.980 
third one this aren't is y and in this
are<00:01:32.280> with<00:01:32.549> this<00:01:32.759> Y<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.270> there<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.810> have<00:01:33.840> it

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
are with this Y and there you have it

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.359 
are with this Y and there you have it
now<00:01:34.549> you<00:01:35.549> notice<00:01:35.970> on<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.570> right<00:01:36.750> hand<00:01:36.780> side

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
now you notice on the right hand side

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.920 
now you notice on the right hand side
the<00:01:38.369> trait<00:01:38.640> for<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:38.939> parents<00:01:39.299> right<00:01:39.420> here<00:01:39.780> is

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
the trait for this parents right here is

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.840 
the trait for this parents right here is
exactly<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.560> same<00:01:40.650> thing<00:01:41.009> as<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.340> first<00:01:41.579> two

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
exactly the same thing as the first two

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.569 
exactly the same thing as the first two
so<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.930> can<00:01:43.229> do<00:01:43.409> sixteen<00:01:43.860> box<00:01:44.100> if<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.369> want

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
so you can do sixteen box if you want

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.830 
so you can do sixteen box if you want
but<00:01:44.820> because<00:01:45.090> they're<00:01:45.240> both<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.630> same<00:01:45.659> thing

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
but because they're both the same thing

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.350 
but because they're both the same thing
you<00:01:46.530> can<00:01:46.710> remove<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.280> two<00:01:47.430> column<00:01:47.909> work<00:01:48.149> on

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
you can remove the two column work on

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.649 
you can remove the two column work on
only<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.689> first<00:01:48.930> two<00:01:49.140> column<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:50.270> then<00:01:51.270> you

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
only the first two column and then you

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.090 
only the first two column and then you
can<00:01:51.810> just<00:01:52.020> double<00:01:52.350> your<00:01:52.470> number<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.829> makes

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
can just double your number that makes

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.450 
can just double your number that makes
it<00:01:53.250> easier<00:01:53.460> it's<00:01:53.610> up<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.939> really

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
it easier it's up to you really

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.340 
it easier it's up to you really
okay<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:56.520> we<00:01:56.759> move<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.000> two<00:01:57.689> column<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.200> then

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
okay so we move the two column and then

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.450 
okay so we move the two column and then
we're<00:01:58.500> going<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.740> work<00:01:58.829> with<00:01:58.860> two<00:01:59.100> column<00:01:59.369> we

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
we're going to work with two column we

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.999 
we're going to work with two column we
will<00:01:59.579> double<00:01:59.820> our<00:01:59.880> number<00:02:00.149> at<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.360> end<00:02:01.009> so

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
will double our number at the end so

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.620 
will double our number at the end so
we're<00:02:02.130> going<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.340> fill<00:02:02.490> them<00:02:02.579> in<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:03.390> we<00:02:03.450> want

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
we're going to fill them in so we want

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.990 
we're going to fill them in so we want
to<00:02:03.719> fill<00:02:03.869> them<00:02:03.960> in<00:02:04.110> take<00:02:04.619> for<00:02:05.130> this<00:02:05.280> box<00:02:05.520> you

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
to fill them in take for this box you

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.639 
to fill them in take for this box you
notice<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.540> have<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.750> follow<00:02:06.930> with<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:07.380> one

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
notice you have to follow with this one

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.669 
notice you have to follow with this one
and<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:08.399> one<00:02:08.459> here<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.479> have<00:02:09.780> big<00:02:10.440> R<00:02:10.649> big

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
and this one here so you have big R big

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.199 
and this one here so you have big R big
R<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.280> big<00:02:11.670> y<00:02:11.879> big<00:02:12.120> why

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
R and big y big why

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:14.759 
R and big y big why
you<00:02:13.359> should<00:02:13.569> ruler<00:02:13.900> if<00:02:14.019> it<00:02:14.109> helps<00:02:14.319> you<00:02:14.469> if<00:02:14.739> you

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
you should ruler if it helps you if you

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.949 
you should ruler if it helps you if you
can't<00:02:15.129> correlate<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.909> points<00:02:16.810> in<00:02:16.870> the

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
can't correlate the points in the

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.569 
can't correlate the points in the
squared<00:02:17.230> stuff<00:02:17.500> like<00:02:17.590> that<00:02:17.739> for<00:02:18.129> example<00:02:18.370> this

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:18.579 
squared stuff like that for example this

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:20.099 
squared stuff like that for example this
one<00:02:18.790> here<00:02:19.060> it's<00:02:19.269> going<00:02:19.420> to<00:02:19.480> go<00:02:19.569> in<00:02:19.689> this<00:02:19.810> box

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:20.109 
one here it's going to go in this box

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:22.199 
one here it's going to go in this box
and<00:02:20.439> this<00:02:21.099> one<00:02:21.280> is<00:02:21.370> going<00:02:21.489> to<00:02:21.549> be<00:02:21.640> this<00:02:21.969> one

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
and this one is going to be this one

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.750 
and this one is going to be this one
okay<00:02:22.780> so<00:02:22.810> fill<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.409> in<00:02:23.500> for<00:02:23.739> you<00:02:23.950> there<00:02:24.459> you<00:02:24.609> go

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
okay so fill it in for you there you go

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.580 
okay so fill it in for you there you go
remember<00:02:25.209> just<00:02:25.540> take<00:02:25.659> your<00:02:25.780> time<00:02:26.019> making<00:02:26.469> sure

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
remember just take your time making sure

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.399 
remember just take your time making sure
you<00:02:26.769> double-check<00:02:27.069> your<00:02:27.280> answer<00:02:28.140> all<00:02:29.140> right

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:29.409 
you double-check your answer all right

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:31.110 
you double-check your answer all right
next<00:02:29.739> up<00:02:29.950> I'm<00:02:30.189> just<00:02:30.250> going<00:02:30.549> to<00:02:30.639> do<00:02:30.760> this<00:02:30.909> for

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
next up I'm just going to do this for

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.729 
next up I'm just going to do this for
you<00:02:31.239> just<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.569> make<00:02:31.599> it<00:02:31.719> easier<00:02:32.200> for<00:02:32.260> your<00:02:32.530> eyes

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
you just to make it easier for your eyes

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.640 
you just to make it easier for your eyes
now<00:02:33.639> notice<00:02:33.969> we<00:02:34.150> have<00:02:34.389> all<00:02:34.659> around

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
now notice we have all around

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.530 
now notice we have all around
there's<00:02:36.129> no<00:02:36.280> wrinkle<00:02:36.700> because<00:02:36.969> there<00:02:37.239> is<00:02:37.359> no

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
there's no wrinkle because there is no

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.709 
there's no wrinkle because there is no
recessive<00:02:38.260> from<00:02:39.219> this<00:02:39.549> parent<00:02:39.969> so<00:02:40.269> therefore

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:40.719 
recessive from this parent so therefore

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:43.020 
recessive from this parent so therefore
all<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.620> parents<00:02:42.010> is<00:02:42.159> going<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.489> be<00:02:42.609> having<00:02:42.849> at

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
all the parents is going to be having at

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.520 
all the parents is going to be having at
least<00:02:43.090> one<00:02:43.329> dominant<00:02:43.900> round<00:02:44.109> so<00:02:44.290> they're<00:02:44.409> all

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
least one dominant round so they're all

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.440 
least one dominant round so they're all
round<00:02:44.769> there's<00:02:45.579> six<00:02:45.909> of<00:02:46.030> them<00:02:46.090> that<00:02:46.209> are

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
round there's six of them that are

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.089 
round there's six of them that are
yellow<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:46.870> there's<00:02:47.230> only<00:02:47.349> two<00:02:47.590> of<00:02:47.739> them<00:02:47.889> that

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
yellow and there's only two of them that

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:49.589 
yellow and there's only two of them that
are<00:02:48.220> green<00:02:48.519> so<00:02:49.060> we're<00:02:49.180> going<00:02:49.269> to<00:02:49.329> start<00:02:49.480> with

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
are green so we're going to start with

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.089 
are green so we're going to start with
the<00:02:49.689> phenotype<00:02:49.930> which<00:02:50.379> is<00:02:50.439> the<00:02:50.560> easiest<00:02:50.859> one

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
the phenotype which is the easiest one

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.699 
the phenotype which is the easiest one
all<00:02:51.849> right<00:02:51.939> so<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.239> phenotype<00:02:52.480> we<00:02:53.349> notice

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
all right so the phenotype we notice

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.099 
all right so the phenotype we notice
there<00:02:53.919> it's<00:02:54.310> round<00:02:54.639> yellow<00:02:54.970> and<00:02:55.419> two<00:02:55.780> round

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
there it's round yellow and two round

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.949 
there it's round yellow and two round
green<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.919> ratio<00:02:57.310> is<00:02:57.549> six<00:02:57.819> to<00:02:58.000> two<00:02:58.209> well

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
green the ratio is six to two well

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.059 
green the ratio is six to two well
remember<00:02:59.290> we<00:02:59.349> have<00:02:59.469> to<00:02:59.530> double<00:02:59.799> up<00:02:59.859> our

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
remember we have to double up our

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.129 
remember we have to double up our
numbers<00:03:00.400> so<00:03:00.430> we<00:03:00.760> have<00:03:00.909> 12<00:03:01.269> round<00:03:01.540> yellow<00:03:01.900> and

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:02.139 
numbers so we have 12 round yellow and

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:04.349 
numbers so we have 12 round yellow and
four<00:03:02.650> round<00:03:02.919> green<00:03:03.189> and<00:03:03.400> that's<00:03:03.969> its<00:03:04.180> whole

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
four round green and that's its whole

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:09.619 
four round green and that's its whole
equivalent<00:03:04.989> to<00:03:05.169> 16<00:03:05.769> the<00:03:06.129> ratio<00:03:06.489> is<00:03:06.730> 12<00:03:07.389> to<00:03:07.510> 4

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
equivalent to 16 the ratio is 12 to 4

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.399 
equivalent to 16 the ratio is 12 to 4
all<00:03:10.629> right<00:03:10.719> now<00:03:10.840> we're<00:03:10.959> going<00:03:11.049> to<00:03:11.139> move<00:03:11.290> into

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409 
all right now we're going to move into

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:15.539 
all right now we're going to move into
genotype<00:03:12.219> so<00:03:12.659> for<00:03:13.659> the<00:03:13.719> genotype<00:03:14.280> simply<00:03:15.280> you

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
genotype so for the genotype simply you

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.369 
genotype so for the genotype simply you
take<00:03:15.609> each<00:03:16.000> one<00:03:16.239> and<00:03:16.480> you<00:03:16.659> do<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:16.930> math<00:03:16.959> see

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
take each one and you do the math see

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:19.080 
take each one and you do the math see
how<00:03:17.470> many<00:03:17.650> there<00:03:17.799> are<00:03:17.919> so<00:03:18.489> for<00:03:18.639> the<00:03:18.699> first<00:03:18.819> one

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
how many there are so for the first one

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.000 
how many there are so for the first one
big<00:03:19.329> or<00:03:19.479> bigger<00:03:19.690> or<00:03:19.900> big<00:03:20.109> one<00:03:20.290> big<00:03:20.470> why<00:03:20.709> there's

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
big or bigger or big one big why there's

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.890 
big or bigger or big one big why there's
only<00:03:21.159> one<00:03:21.430> of<00:03:21.549> it<00:03:21.639> and<00:03:21.849> then<00:03:22.299> you<00:03:22.389> move<00:03:22.599> on<00:03:22.750> to

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
only one of it and then you move on to

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.539 
only one of it and then you move on to
another<00:03:23.079> one<00:03:23.199> now<00:03:23.769> an<00:03:23.889> easier<00:03:24.220> way<00:03:24.370> of<00:03:24.400> doing

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
another one now an easier way of doing

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.789 
another one now an easier way of doing
this<00:03:24.940> is<00:03:25.239> okay<00:03:25.840> once<00:03:26.049> you<00:03:26.169> look<00:03:26.319> at<00:03:26.409> it<00:03:26.590> just

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
this is okay once you look at it just

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.259 
this is okay once you look at it just
make<00:03:26.949> an<00:03:27.069> X<00:03:27.340> or<00:03:27.549> something<00:03:27.819> and<00:03:27.940> that's<00:03:28.000> just

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
make an X or something and that's just

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:29.670 
make an X or something and that's just
to<00:03:28.359> notify<00:03:28.629> you<00:03:28.810> okay<00:03:29.169> I'm<00:03:29.290> done<00:03:29.409> with<00:03:29.560> that

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
to notify you okay I'm done with that

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.020 
to notify you okay I'm done with that
one<00:03:29.859> and<00:03:30.040> then<00:03:30.489> I'm<00:03:30.639> not<00:03:30.729> going<00:03:30.849> to<00:03:30.909> use<00:03:31.000> that

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
one and then I'm not going to use that

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.849 
one and then I'm not going to use that
one<00:03:31.269> anymore<00:03:31.299> and<00:03:31.840> then<00:03:32.290> you<00:03:32.319> move<00:03:32.560> on<00:03:32.680> to<00:03:32.799> the

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859 
one anymore and then you move on to the

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.589 
one anymore and then you move on to the
next<00:03:32.919> one<00:03:33.099> okay<00:03:33.220> so<00:03:33.370> there's<00:03:33.729> big<00:03:33.939> our<00:03:34.180> big<00:03:34.449> or

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
next one okay so there's big our big or

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.000 
next one okay so there's big our big or
a<00:03:34.689> big<00:03:34.870> white<00:03:35.049> small<00:03:35.319> white<00:03:35.500> that's<00:03:35.709> one<00:03:35.859> right

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
a big white small white that's one right

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.860 
a big white small white that's one right
here<00:03:36.430> and<00:03:36.609> then<00:03:37.209> there's<00:03:37.359> one<00:03:37.479> right<00:03:37.569> here

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
here and then there's one right here

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.240 
here and then there's one right here
just<00:03:38.319> make<00:03:38.470> sure<00:03:38.560> you<00:03:38.680> take<00:03:38.799> the<00:03:38.889> time<00:03:39.099> and

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
just make sure you take the time and

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.649 
just make sure you take the time and
look<00:03:39.340> carefully<00:03:39.579> for<00:03:40.090> all<00:03:40.150> of<00:03:40.209> it<00:03:40.299> okay<00:03:40.359> so<00:03:40.569> I

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:40.659 
look carefully for all of it okay so I

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:42.539 
look carefully for all of it okay so I
use<00:03:40.930> these<00:03:41.109> three<00:03:41.319> already<00:03:41.560> and<00:03:42.129> I<00:03:42.159> only<00:03:42.340> have

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
use these three already and I only have

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.309 
use these three already and I only have
the<00:03:42.699> other<00:03:42.849> remaining<00:03:43.180> and<00:03:43.449> you<00:03:43.780> go<00:03:43.989> and<00:03:44.169> you

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
the other remaining and you go and you

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:45.899 
the other remaining and you go and you
fill<00:03:44.530> down<00:03:44.650> all<00:03:44.919> the<00:03:45.009> way<00:03:45.129> down<00:03:45.489> to<00:03:45.669> the<00:03:45.759> rest

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:45.909 
fill down all the way down to the rest

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.390 
fill down all the way down to the rest
of<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.120> list<00:03:46.299> and<00:03:46.919> that's<00:03:47.919> pretty<00:03:48.189> much<00:03:48.310> it

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
of the list and that's pretty much it

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.189 
of the list and that's pretty much it
for<00:03:48.699> the<00:03:48.849> genotype<00:03:49.269> remember<00:03:49.750> you<00:03:49.870> also<00:03:50.019> have

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:50.199 
for the genotype remember you also have

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:52.729 
for the genotype remember you also have
to<00:03:50.319> double<00:03:50.650> them<00:03:50.799> up<00:03:50.919> it's<00:03:51.159> out<00:03:51.400> of<00:03:51.430> 16<00:03:51.939> total

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
to double them up it's out of 16 total

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.499 
to double them up it's out of 16 total
okay<00:03:53.739> so<00:03:54.189> for<00:03:54.400> the<00:03:54.459> first<00:03:54.669> one<00:03:54.970> because<00:03:55.329> this

00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:55.509 
okay so for the first one because this

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:57.800 
okay so for the first one because this
one<00:03:55.810> you<00:03:56.139> double<00:03:56.500> is<00:03:56.650> to<00:03:56.889> two<00:03:57.280> out<00:03:57.430> of<00:03:57.459> 16

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
one you double is to two out of 16

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.360 
one you double is to two out of 16
neither<00:03:58.810> one<00:03:59.049> is<00:03:59.079> to<00:03:59.470> two<00:03:59.739> double<00:03:59.949> is<00:04:00.099> four

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
neither one is to two double is four

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.999 
neither one is to two double is four
four<00:04:00.729> to<00:04:00.819> sixteen<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:01.750> then<00:04:02.229> so<00:04:02.530> on<00:04:02.680> and<00:04:02.709> so

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:03.009 
four to sixteen and then so on and so

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:04.589 
four to sixteen and then so on and so
forth<00:04:03.280> and<00:04:03.430> you<00:04:03.519> should<00:04:03.699> have<00:04:03.790> a<00:04:03.819> total<00:04:04.060> of<00:04:04.239> 16

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
forth and you should have a total of 16

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:06.929 
forth and you should have a total of 16
at<00:04:04.959> a<00:04:04.989> total<00:04:05.379> and<00:04:05.530> that's<00:04:06.370> pretty<00:04:06.519> much<00:04:06.639> it

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:06.939 
at a total and that's pretty much it

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:08.969 
at a total and that's pretty much it
you<00:04:07.090> have<00:04:07.239> your<00:04:07.449> phenotype<00:04:07.780> you<00:04:08.470> have<00:04:08.650> your

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:08.979 
you have your phenotype you have your

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:10.920 
you have your phenotype you have your
genotype<00:04:09.400> and<00:04:09.790> that's<00:04:10.419> pretty<00:04:10.569> much<00:04:10.689> what

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
genotype and that's pretty much what

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.899 
genotype and that's pretty much what
your<00:04:11.079> teacher<00:04:11.259> will<00:04:11.470> mostly<00:04:11.680> ask<00:04:11.889> you<00:04:12.069> oh<00:04:12.280> and

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:12.909 
your teacher will mostly ask you oh and

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:16.259 
your teacher will mostly ask you oh and
then<00:04:13.000> one<00:04:13.180> more<00:04:13.329> question<00:04:14.459> usually<00:04:15.459> you

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
then one more question usually you

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.729 
then one more question usually you
always<00:04:16.299> get<00:04:16.659> a<00:04:16.690> question<00:04:17.079> that<00:04:17.259> as<00:04:17.380> like<00:04:17.560> this

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
always get a question that as like this

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.949 
always get a question that as like this
what<00:04:18.250> is<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:18.489> chance<00:04:18.729> of<00:04:18.880> getting<00:04:19.239> a<00:04:19.389> blonde

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
what is the chance of getting a blonde

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.209 
what is the chance of getting a blonde
blonde<00:04:20.229> in<00:04:20.380> this<00:04:20.500> case<00:04:20.709> you're<00:04:20.889> asking<00:04:21.130> you

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:21.219 
blonde in this case you're asking you

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:22.620 
blonde in this case you're asking you
for<00:04:21.400> what<00:04:21.579> is<00:04:21.609> the<00:04:21.760> chance<00:04:22.000> of<00:04:22.150> when<00:04:22.330> you<00:04:22.419> cross

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
for what is the chance of when you cross

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.659 
for what is the chance of when you cross
those<00:04:22.930> two<00:04:23.139> together<00:04:23.349> what<00:04:24.099> is<00:04:24.219> the<00:04:24.310> chance<00:04:24.520> of

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
those two together what is the chance of

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.850 
those two together what is the chance of
getting<00:04:24.969> a<00:04:25.110> heterozygous<00:04:26.110> for<00:04:26.380> both

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
getting a heterozygous for both

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.459 
getting a heterozygous for both
so<00:04:27.699> what<00:04:27.939> do<00:04:28.000> you<00:04:28.060> do<00:04:28.180> first<00:04:28.509> step<00:04:28.840> is<00:04:29.110> you

00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:29.469 
so what do you do first step is you

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:31.439 
so what do you do first step is you
figure<00:04:30.219> out<00:04:30.340> the<00:04:30.490> parents<00:04:30.879> after<00:04:31.120> you<00:04:31.330> put

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 
figure out the parents after you put

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:34.230 
figure out the parents after you put
your<00:04:31.569> other<00:04:31.659> parents<00:04:32.669> separate<00:04:33.669> the<00:04:33.789> alleles

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
your other parents separate the alleles

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.270 
your other parents separate the alleles
and<00:04:34.539> then<00:04:34.750> do<00:04:35.050> your<00:04:35.199> cross<00:04:35.500> once<00:04:35.919> you<00:04:36.039> finish

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
and then do your cross once you finish

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.600 
and then do your cross once you finish
with<00:04:36.400> your<00:04:36.490> cross<00:04:36.759> you<00:04:37.090> have<00:04:37.180> to<00:04:37.270> genotype

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
with your cross you have to genotype

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.040 
with your cross you have to genotype
like<00:04:39.610> this<00:04:39.849> once<00:04:40.240> you<00:04:40.330> get<00:04:40.449> all<00:04:40.569> your<00:04:40.599> genotype

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
like this once you get all your genotype

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.779 
like this once you get all your genotype
like<00:04:41.319> this<00:04:41.500> then<00:04:42.129> all<00:04:42.280> you<00:04:42.370> have<00:04:42.490> to<00:04:42.580> do<00:04:42.639> is

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
like this then all you have to do is

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:44.129 
like this then all you have to do is
read<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.060> question<00:04:43.449> okay<00:04:43.750> they<00:04:43.870> asking<00:04:44.110> you

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
read the question okay they asking you

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.320 
read the question okay they asking you
for<00:04:44.349> this<00:04:44.530> one<00:04:44.740> heterozygous<00:04:45.280> and<00:04:45.580> you<00:04:46.030> find

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
for this one heterozygous and you find

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.969 
for this one heterozygous and you find
it<00:04:46.449> for<00:04:46.629> heterozygous<00:04:47.080> for<00:04:47.289> both<00:04:47.319> tree<00:04:47.710> and

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
it for heterozygous for both tree and

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.129 
it for heterozygous for both tree and
then<00:04:48.460> we<00:04:48.580> look<00:04:48.729> for<00:04:49.000> it<00:04:49.090> is<00:04:49.180> right<00:04:49.449> here

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
then we look for it is right here

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:51.540 
then we look for it is right here
heterozygous<00:04:50.710> for<00:04:50.889> both<00:04:50.919> tree<00:04:51.340> and<00:04:51.490> the

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
heterozygous for both tree and the

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.139 
heterozygous for both tree and the
chance<00:04:51.789> of<00:04:51.879> getting<00:04:52.150> its<00:04:52.300> 4<00:04:52.569> out<00:04:52.629> of<00:04:52.719> 16
