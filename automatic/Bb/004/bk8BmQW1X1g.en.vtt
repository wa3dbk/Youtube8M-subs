parts timid okay we can all agree on
that<00:00:11.280> right<00:00:11.460> yes<00:00:12.360> I<00:00:13.250> was<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.309> first<00:00:14.490> thing<00:00:14.639> I

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
that right yes I was the first thing I

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.130 
that right yes I was the first thing I
asked<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.210> they<00:00:15.269> said<00:00:15.299> no<00:00:17.570> it's<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.690> it's<00:00:18.930> weird

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
asked and they said no it's a it's weird

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.880 
asked and they said no it's a it's weird
because<00:00:20.270> the<00:00:21.270> climax<00:00:21.930> happens<00:00:22.350> kind<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.830> in

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
because the climax happens kind of in

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.070 
because the climax happens kind of in
the<00:00:22.949> middle<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.460> guess<00:00:24.390> more<00:00:24.539> towards<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.960> end

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
the middle I guess more towards the end

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.410 
the middle I guess more towards the end
of<00:00:25.170> Act<00:00:25.289> two<00:00:25.380> an<00:00:26.310> act<00:00:26.519> three<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:27.000> this<00:00:27.210> weird

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
of Act two an act three is this weird

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.330 
of Act two an act three is this weird
celebration<00:00:30.920> it<00:00:31.920> doesn't<00:00:32.189> make<00:00:32.309> sense

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
celebration it doesn't make sense

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.080 
celebration it doesn't make sense
structurally<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.960> episode<00:00:34.260> really<00:00:34.739> at<00:00:34.860> all

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
structurally the episode really at all

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.290 
structurally the episode really at all
but<00:00:36.090> it's<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.270> musical<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.559> can<00:00:37.800> kind<00:00:38.040> of

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
but it's a musical so you can kind of

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.260 
but it's a musical so you can kind of
get<00:00:39.300> away<00:00:39.450> with<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:40.670> also<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.879> guys<00:00:42.000> saw

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
get away with that also you guys saw

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.049 
get away with that also you guys saw
isn't<00:00:42.690> what<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:42.989> wrote<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.559> it's<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:44.059> little

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
tricky to talk about that when I was

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.520 
tricky to talk about that when I was
writing<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.899> script<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.230> was<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.379> end<00:00:49.500> of

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
writing that script it was the end of

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.069 
writing that script it was the end of
the<00:00:49.620> show<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:50.160> was<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.399> final<00:00:51.120> episode<00:00:51.390> and

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
premiere which was a really good idea

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.000 
premiere which was a really good idea
but<00:03:41.810> they<00:03:41.900> had<00:03:42.020> to<00:03:42.080> figure<00:03:42.200> out<00:03:42.290> how<00:03:42.470> to<00:03:42.590> extend

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
but they had to figure out how to extend

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.300 
but they had to figure out how to extend
it<00:03:43.190> now<00:03:43.310> it's<00:03:43.550> a<00:03:43.700> new<00:03:44.000> seasons<00:03:44.870> so<00:03:45.470> that's<00:03:46.070> why

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
it now it's a new seasons so that's why

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.470

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
really understand why they had to make

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.400
