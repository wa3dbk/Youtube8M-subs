00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:12.620
 I will teach you how to make this soft image 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:25.430
 Today I want to introduce you how the processing of my flow of image 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.630
 First of all, the image app I used was originally a line camera 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.640
 It has become 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.640
 It seems that it has been newly changed here 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:39.210
 The first one to do is to call the album 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.210
 And you will be received or statement you want to own processing 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.130
 After choosing, I am sure to stamp it 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:55.290
 I am not familiar with the original stamp and it will take some other time 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:01:00.480
 I am making a stamp that I can make my own 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:02.970
 And I will use this and how to make the staff of this image will be introduced later 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.630
 think 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.320
 This photo stamp is all made by myself 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.510
 Tap 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.780
 Masu image does not originally made by yourself because they are found by searching 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.560
 I am making my own stamp but it is a little complicated 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.220
 Please wait, as I will explain later 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:28.520
 Well I'm making it transparent 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:29.990
 I wanted to make it look like I wanted to make it a little cute 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.530
 doing 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.190
 Chapter 10 when I put various things the same 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.220
 And the para-bar 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:44.320
 I will keep it and save it. 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:50.170
 I think that I would like to use a different application next time. This is the next application to use. 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:51.870
 I would like to go using the real letter application and the camera button below 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:57.790

00:01:51.870 --> 00:02:03.460
 Then select an album and persuade the image you made earlier 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:04.990

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.399
