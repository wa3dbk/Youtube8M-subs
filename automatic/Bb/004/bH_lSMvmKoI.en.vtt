00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
it went into a direction that I didn't

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.400 
it went into a direction that I didn't
see<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.789> really<00:00:45.090> going<00:00:45.420> when<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.110> saw<00:00:46.350> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
see it really going when I saw the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.410 
see it really going when I saw the
screenshots<00:00:47.100> which<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.640> was<00:00:47.940> trying<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.329> avoid

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
screenshots which I was trying to avoid

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.750 
screenshots which I was trying to avoid
but<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.960> saw<00:00:49.260> them<00:00:49.469> anyways<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.219> saw<00:00:50.700> the

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
but I saw them anyways I saw the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.160 
but I saw them anyways I saw the
screenshot<00:00:51.300> with<00:00:51.390> Nightmare<00:00:51.750> Moon<00:00:51.930> and

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
screenshot with Nightmare Moon and

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.060 
screenshot with Nightmare Moon and
discord<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.809> vine<00:00:54.809> things<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.530> thought

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
discord and the vine things I thought

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.860 
discord and the vine things I thought
the<00:00:56.219> vine<00:00:56.430> things<00:00:56.760> were<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.300> chrysalis

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
the vine things were of chrysalis

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.479 
the vine things were of chrysalis
because<00:00:58.170> they<00:00:58.260> looked<00:00:58.500> like<00:00:58.680> similar<00:00:59.010> the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
because they looked like similar the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.580 
because they looked like similar the
scheme<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.570> whole<00:01:00.750> like<00:01:01.020> holes<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
scheme of it the whole like holes in the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.799 
scheme of it the whole like holes in the
leaves<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.010> everything<00:01:02.399> like<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.000> would

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
leaves and everything like that would

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:04.820 
leaves and everything like that would
have<00:01:03.899> been<00:01:03.960> chrysalis<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.470> thought<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.739> would

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
have been chrysalis I thought it would

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.460 
have been chrysalis I thought it would
be<00:01:04.979> obvious<00:01:05.369> but<00:01:05.820> apparently<00:01:06.659> like<00:01:07.260> they

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
be obvious but apparently like they

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.590 
be obvious but apparently like they
threw<00:01:08.220> us<00:01:08.340> for<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.490> loop<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.880> I'm<00:01:09.210> kind<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.479> glad

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
threw us for a loop and I'm kind of glad

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.719 
threw us for a loop and I'm kind of glad
that<00:01:09.900> they<00:01:09.990> did<00:01:10.200> do<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.409> because<00:01:10.830> kind<00:01:11.670> of

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
that they did do that because kind of

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.359 
that they did do that because kind of
having<00:01:11.970> like<00:01:12.150> no<00:01:12.420> real<00:01:12.900> enemy<00:01:13.470> but<00:01:14.010> like

a lot of depth to her character which is

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.580 
a lot of depth to her character which is
something<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.750> think<00:01:24.960> people<00:01:25.229> were<00:01:25.350> really

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
something I think people were really

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.980 
something I think people were really
expecting<00:01:26.189> from<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.460> season<00:01:26.729> 3<00:01:26.909> finale<00:01:26.990> which

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
expecting from the season 3 finale which

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.600 
expecting from the season 3 finale which
um<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.650> know<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> lot<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.040> people<00:01:29.130> didn't

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
um you know a lot of people didn't

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.730 
um you know a lot of people didn't
really<00:01:29.909> care<00:01:30.060> for<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.540> mean<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.900> still<00:01:31.350> liked<00:01:31.590> it

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
really care for I mean I still liked it

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.830 
really care for I mean I still liked it
for<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.950> music<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.369> stuff<00:01:32.549> but<00:01:32.820> as<00:01:33.600> far<00:01:33.780> as

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
for the music and stuff but as far as

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.060 
for the music and stuff but as far as
like<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.140> storytelling<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.770> could<00:01:34.890> have<00:01:34.979> been

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
like the storytelling it could have been

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.859 
like the storytelling it could have been
done<00:01:35.280> better<00:01:35.340> but<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:35.880> think<00:01:36.240> season<00:01:36.630> 4

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
done better but I think season 4

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.130 
done better but I think season 4
definitely<00:01:37.619> kinda<00:01:38.280> almost<00:01:38.909> made<00:01:39.600> up<00:01:39.630> for<00:01:39.780> it

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
definitely kinda almost made up for it

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.429 
definitely kinda almost made up for it
for<00:01:40.500> some<00:01:40.680> people<00:01:40.829> i<00:01:41.070> mean<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.490> made<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.820> up<00:01:41.939> for

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
for some people i mean it made it up for

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.170 
for some people i mean it made it up for
like<00:01:43.439> majority<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.009> my<00:01:44.130> friend<00:01:44.460> i<00:01:44.670> think<00:01:44.909> i

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
like majority of my friend i think i

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.969 
like majority of my friend i think i
also<00:01:45.600> wanted<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.079> say<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.530> pacing<00:01:46.890> of

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
also wanted to say that the pacing of

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.740 
also wanted to say that the pacing of
the<00:01:47.040> premier<00:01:47.430> actually<00:01:47.880> felt<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.329> lot<00:01:48.540> better

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
the premier actually felt a lot better

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.300 
the premier actually felt a lot better
than<00:01:49.049> like<00:01:49.259> any<00:01:49.439> other<00:01:49.680> premier<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.220> I've

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
than like any other premier that I've

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.609 
than like any other premier that I've
seen<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:51.240> may<00:01:51.479> just<00:01:51.509> be<00:01:51.840> because<00:01:52.079> i<00:01:52.259> was

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
seen that may just be because i was

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.069 
seen that may just be because i was
actually<00:01:52.799> seeing<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.549> like<00:01:53.850> live<00:01:54.149> on<00:01:54.390> TV<00:01:54.600> with

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
actually seeing it like live on TV with

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.410 
actually seeing it like live on TV with
hero<00:01:55.320> Sashi<00:01:55.530> but<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.340> also<00:01:56.460> saw<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.030> crystal

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
hero Sashi but I also saw the crystal

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.630 
hero Sashi but I also saw the crystal
Empire<00:01:57.750> live<00:01:58.110> on<00:01:58.320> TV<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.649> feel<00:01:59.040> like<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.460> that

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
Empire live on TV I feel like that that

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.459 
Empire live on TV I feel like that that
didn't<00:02:00.000> have<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.360> right<00:02:00.540> pacing<00:02:00.990> but<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.229> feel

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
didn't have the right pacing but I feel

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.170 
didn't have the right pacing but I feel
like<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.829> season<00:02:02.100> 4<00:02:02.310> premiere<00:02:02.340> did<00:02:02.880> maybe

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
like the season 4 premiere did maybe

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.690 
like the season 4 premiere did maybe
because<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:04.469> just<00:02:04.560> had<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.860> right<00:02:05.070> set<00:02:05.430> pieces

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
because it just had the right set pieces

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.869 
because it just had the right set pieces
for<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.420> happen<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:07.079> have<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.829> feel<00:02:08.190> like

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
for that to happen to have it feel like

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.330 
for that to happen to have it feel like
you<00:02:09.270> know<00:02:09.390> okay<00:02:09.959> this<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.349> like<00:02:10.860> where<00:02:11.190> it

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
you know okay this is like where it

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.850 
you know okay this is like where it
starts<00:02:11.730> where<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.030> ends

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
starts where it ends

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:13.720 
starts where it ends
you<00:02:12.950> know<00:02:13.040> here's<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.370> middle<00:02:13.610> and

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
you know here's the middle and

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.340 
you know here's the middle and
everything<00:02:14.030> like<00:02:14.540> everything<00:02:14.690> felt<00:02:15.170> like<00:02:15.260> it

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
everything like everything felt like it

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.660 
everything like everything felt like it
was<00:02:15.440> leading<00:02:15.710> up<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:15.920> something<00:02:16.100> with<00:02:16.430> enough

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
was leading up to something with enough

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.260 
was leading up to something with enough

mean it bothered me when I first started

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.360 
mean it bothered me when I first started
watching<00:03:05.989> the<00:03:06.020> show<00:03:06.110> like<00:03:06.920> when<00:03:07.070> I<00:03:07.100> first

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
watching the show like when I first

thought<00:03:12.260> like<00:03:12.620> this<00:03:13.040> isn't<00:03:13.489> fitting<00:03:13.730> but<00:03:14.090> as<00:03:14.690> I

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
thought like this isn't fitting but as I

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.009 
thought like this isn't fitting but as I
started<00:03:15.200> watching<00:03:15.850> again<00:03:16.850> and<00:03:17.209> again<00:03:17.420> like

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.840 
started watching again and again like
each<00:03:18.200> episode<00:03:18.650> it<00:03:18.830> actually<00:03:19.190> made<00:03:19.370> a<00:03:19.610> lot<00:03:19.820> of

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
each episode it actually made a lot of

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.020 
each episode it actually made a lot of
sense<00:03:19.989> so<00:03:21.100> I'm<00:03:22.100> not<00:03:22.220> sure<00:03:22.340> why<00:03:22.670> people<00:03:22.700> would

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
sense so I'm not sure why people would

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.570 
sense so I'm not sure why people would
complain<00:03:23.180> about<00:03:23.330> that<00:03:23.590> but<00:03:24.590> as<00:03:25.040> far<00:03:25.280> as<00:03:25.340> like

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
complain about that but as far as like

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.430 
complain about that but as far as like
the<00:03:25.760> whole<00:03:25.910> episode<00:03:26.390> it<00:03:26.570> was<00:03:26.600> kind<00:03:26.840> of<00:03:26.870> kind<00:03:27.290> of

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
the whole episode it was kind of kind of

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.729 
the whole episode it was kind of kind of
lackluster<00:03:28.299> like<00:03:29.299> right<00:03:29.930> after<00:03:30.080> season<00:03:30.530> four

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
lackluster like right after season four

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.850 
lackluster like right after season four
we<00:03:31.130> found<00:03:31.340> that<00:03:31.790> boxing<00:03:32.420> and<00:03:32.660> we<00:03:33.590> don't<00:03:33.739> really

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
we found that boxing and we don't really

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.580 
we found that boxing and we don't really
find<00:03:34.220> that<00:03:34.340> that<00:03:34.760> much<00:03:35.000> out<00:03:35.150> about<00:03:35.390> it<00:03:35.600> so<00:03:36.320> I

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
find that that much out about it so I

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.190

don't<00:03:37.549> know<00:03:37.700> maybe<00:03:37.940> later<00:03:38.239> in<00:03:38.390> the<00:03:38.510> season<00:03:38.690> so
