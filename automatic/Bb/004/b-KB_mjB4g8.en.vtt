the Mambo do you remember we're gonna

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.240 
the Mambo do you remember we're gonna
remember<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.680> that's<00:00:49.800> not<00:00:49.950> gonna<00:00:50.100> be<00:00:50.219> a

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
remember it that's not gonna be a

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.060 
remember it that's not gonna be a
problem<00:00:50.989> one<00:00:51.989> two<00:00:52.350> three

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
problem one two three

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.400

Mambo<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.180> great<00:00:54.449> desk<00:00:54.719> for<00:00:54.989> us<00:00:55.079> but<00:00:55.320> it

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
Mambo is a great desk for us but it

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.529 
Mambo is a great desk for us but it
wasn't<00:00:55.710> perfect<00:00:55.860> score<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.760> think<00:00:56.969> we<00:00:57.329> can

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
wasn't perfect score so I think we can

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.930 
wasn't perfect score so I think we can
give<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.289> little<00:00:58.829> oomph<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.340> show<00:00:59.699> the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
give that little oomph and show the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.330 
give that little oomph and show the
judges<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.780> big<00:01:01.079> difference<00:01:01.620> if<00:01:01.770> Laila<00:01:02.010> went
