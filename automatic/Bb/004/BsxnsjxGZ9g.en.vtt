00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.429 

what's<00:00:00.390> going<00:00:00.599> on<00:00:00.659> everybody<00:00:00.900> my<00:00:01.199> name<00:00:01.350> is

00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:01.439 
what's going on everybody my name is

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:02.840 
what's going on everybody my name is
Kremlin<00:00:01.770> I<00:00:01.860> have<00:00:01.979> finally<00:00:02.370> come<00:00:02.490> up<00:00:02.550> with<00:00:02.760> the

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
Kremlin I have finally come up with the

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.880 
Kremlin I have finally come up with the
design<00:00:02.970> to<00:00:03.330> rule<00:00:03.540> them<00:00:03.689> all<00:00:03.870> I<00:00:04.170> have<00:00:04.589> been

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
design to rule them all I have been

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.230 
design to rule them all I have been
trying<00:00:05.130> to<00:00:05.220> figure<00:00:05.460> out<00:00:05.640> how<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:05.910> get<00:00:06.089> down

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
trying to figure out how to get down

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.880 
trying to figure out how to get down
this<00:00:06.450> damn<00:00:06.750> runway<00:00:07.170> as<00:00:07.290> fast<00:00:07.589> as<00:00:07.770> I<00:00:07.859> possibly

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
this damn runway as fast as I possibly

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.910 
this damn runway as fast as I possibly
can<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:08.730> i'm<00:00:09.090> gonna<00:00:09.179> show<00:00:09.540> you<00:00:09.710> exactly<00:00:10.710> how

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
can and i'm gonna show you exactly how

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.890 
can and i'm gonna show you exactly how
quickly<00:00:11.580> i<00:00:11.759> can<00:00:11.849> get<00:00:12.120> this<00:00:12.240> thing<00:00:12.480> down<00:00:12.630> there

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
quickly i can get this thing down there

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.980 
quickly i can get this thing down there
so<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.620> speed<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:14.070> beat<00:00:14.250> was<00:00:14.509> 244<00:00:15.509> meters<00:00:15.870> a

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
so the speed to beat was 244 meters a

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.750 
so the speed to beat was 244 meters a
second<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.440> we<00:00:16.529> are<00:00:16.619> now<00:00:16.770> well<00:00:17.130> beyond<00:00:17.490> that

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
second and we are now well beyond that

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.189 
second and we are now well beyond that
we<00:00:18.180> hit<00:00:18.590> 260<00:00:19.609> 260<00:00:20.609> won<00:00:20.789> roughly<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.480> this

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
we hit 260 260 won roughly and this

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.679 
we hit 260 260 won roughly and this
plane<00:00:22.470> has<00:00:22.500> basically<00:00:23.490> just<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.910> massive<00:00:24.359> fuel

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
plane has basically just a massive fuel

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.509 
plane has basically just a massive fuel
tank<00:00:24.930> with<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.109> massive<00:00:25.439> engine<00:00:25.890> strapped<00:00:26.340> to

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
tank with a massive engine strapped to

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.830 
tank with a massive engine strapped to
it<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.119> can<00:00:27.330> pretty<00:00:27.510> much<00:00:27.570> do<00:00:27.810> nothing

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
it so you can pretty much do nothing

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.810 
it so you can pretty much do nothing
except<00:00:28.560> get<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.710> speed<00:00:29.039> run<00:00:29.189> down<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.550> runway

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
except get a speed run down the runway

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.740 
except get a speed run down the runway
so<00:00:29.910> i'm<00:00:30.000> going<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.179> try<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.300> make<00:00:30.449> some<00:00:30.630> more

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
so i'm going to try and make some more

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.209 
so i'm going to try and make some more
modifications<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.890> see<00:00:31.980> what<00:00:32.009> i<00:00:32.099> can

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
modifications to this and see what i can

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.920 
modifications to this and see what i can
come<00:00:32.309> up<00:00:32.430> with<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:35.390> may<00:00:36.390> have<00:00:36.480> lost<00:00:36.780> some

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
come up with I may have lost some

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.720 
come up with I may have lost some
aerodynamic<00:00:37.320> capabilities<00:00:37.890> with<00:00:38.489> all<00:00:38.610> these

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
aerodynamic capabilities with all these

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.190 
aerodynamic capabilities with all these
strut<00:00:39.120> connections<00:00:39.540> but<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.750> sure<00:00:39.870> does<00:00:40.020> seem

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
strut connections but it sure does seem

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.840 
strut connections but it sure does seem
like<00:00:40.410> we're<00:00:40.559> going<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.800> head<00:00:41.040> out<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.579> lot

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
like we're going to head out a lot

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.729 
like we're going to head out a lot
faster<00:00:42.350> we<00:00:43.350> had<00:00:43.800> 260<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.789> beat<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.440> we<00:00:46.440> just

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
faster we had 260 to beat and we just

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.369 
faster we had 260 to beat and we just
matched<00:00:47.550> our<00:00:47.760> time<00:00:48.000> interesting<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.930> guess

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
matched our time interesting I guess

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.250 
matched our time interesting I guess
these<00:00:49.559> engines<00:00:50.010> waste<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:50.520> much<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.510> fuel

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
these engines waste so much and the fuel

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.410 
these engines waste so much and the fuel
tanks<00:00:52.590> are<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:53.309> heavy<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:54.090> doesn't

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
tanks are so heavy that it doesn't

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.900 
tanks are so heavy that it doesn't
really<00:00:54.539> make<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.079> difference<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.530> add<00:00:55.739> more<00:00:56.160> so

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
really make a difference to add more so

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.180 
really make a difference to add more so
i<00:00:56.940> don't<00:00:57.120> know<00:00:57.210> maybe<00:00:57.510> maybe<00:00:57.930> 260<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.920> going<00:00:59.129> to

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
i don't know maybe maybe 260 is going to

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.340 
i don't know maybe maybe 260 is going to
be<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.370> extent<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.850> which<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.449> can<00:01:00.629> go<00:01:01.140> on

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
be the extent of which you can go on

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.660 
be the extent of which you can go on
that<00:01:01.500> runway<00:01:01.680> that's<00:01:02.039> pretty<00:01:02.370> kind<00:01:02.550> of

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
that runway that's pretty kind of

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.170 
that runway that's pretty kind of
interesting

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.590 

you<00:01:07.690> can<00:01:07.810> always<00:01:07.930> use<00:01:08.230> more<00:01:08.440> power<00:01:08.500> I<00:01:09.600> think

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
you can always use more power I think

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.870 
you can always use more power I think
you<00:01:10.720> just<00:01:10.900> need<00:01:11.050> more<00:01:11.320> and<00:01:11.470> more<00:01:11.620> and<00:01:11.740> more

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
you just need more and more and more

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.740 
you just need more and more and more
although<00:01:12.880> the<00:01:12.970> weight<00:01:13.150> is<00:01:13.270> higher<00:01:13.480> your

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
although the weight is higher your

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.950 
although the weight is higher your
engine<00:01:14.110> output<00:01:14.500> is<00:01:14.620> higher<00:01:14.830> and<00:01:15.130> we<00:01:15.400> are<00:01:15.550> not

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
engine output is higher and we are not

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.500 
engine output is higher and we are not
yeah<00:01:17.350> we<00:01:18.190> keep<00:01:18.370> just<00:01:18.610> matching<00:01:19.030> it<00:01:19.119> despite

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
yeah we keep just matching it despite

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.649 
yeah we keep just matching it despite
whatever<00:01:19.840> I<00:01:20.380> add<00:01:20.680> that<00:01:21.460> is<00:01:21.760> funny<00:01:22.060> and<00:01:22.270> you<00:01:22.390> run

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
whatever I add that is funny and you run

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.260 
whatever I add that is funny and you run
out<00:01:22.780> of<00:01:22.810> fuel<00:01:23.080> so<00:01:23.170> damn<00:01:23.619> quickly<00:01:23.920> as<00:01:24.130> well<00:01:24.369> you

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
out of fuel so damn quickly as well you

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.760 
out of fuel so damn quickly as well you
can<00:01:25.420> kind<00:01:25.600> of<00:01:25.659> turn<00:01:25.840> around<00:01:26.170> but<00:01:26.320> there's<00:01:26.500> so

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
can kind of turn around but there's so

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.440 
can kind of turn around but there's so
much<00:01:27.040> weight<00:01:27.310> on<00:01:27.490> board<00:01:27.790> is<00:01:28.030> in<00:01:28.060> just<00:01:28.360> a

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
much weight on board is in just a

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.450 
much weight on board is in just a
massive<00:01:28.810> maybe<00:01:29.229> I<00:01:29.290> need<00:01:29.350> smaller<00:01:29.770> fuel<00:01:30.009> tanks

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
massive maybe I need smaller fuel tanks

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.749 
massive maybe I need smaller fuel tanks
or<00:01:31.000> perhaps<00:01:31.210> one<00:01:31.630> massive<00:01:32.280> now<00:01:33.280> this<00:01:33.520> it's

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
or perhaps one massive now this it's

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:46.440 
or perhaps one massive now this it's
hard

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.100 

how<00:01:46.840> is<00:01:47.020> this<00:01:47.170> thing<00:01:47.380> rolling<00:01:48.930> now<00:01:49.930> I<00:01:49.960> know

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
how is this thing rolling now I know

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.630 
how is this thing rolling now I know
what<00:01:50.200> you're<00:01:50.350> thinking<00:01:50.649> this<00:01:51.159> is<00:01:51.310> never<00:01:51.520> gonna

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
what you're thinking this is never gonna

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.539 
what you're thinking this is never gonna
work<00:01:51.990> right<00:01:52.990> probably<00:01:53.590> will<00:01:53.770> but<00:01:54.280> this<00:01:54.430> is

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
work right probably will but this is

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.870 
work right probably will but this is
just<00:01:54.579> an<00:01:54.820> act<00:01:55.000> of<00:01:55.179> desperation<00:01:55.240> I<00:01:56.700> can't<00:01:57.700> come

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
just an act of desperation I can't come

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.069 
just an act of desperation I can't come
