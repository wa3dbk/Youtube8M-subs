00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:08.519
 Now art stores are very 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.200
 large variety of material for 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.530
 creativity and for painting in particular 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.390
 it is very good then there is a choice there is 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.930
 there is plenty to choose from 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.900
 but on the other hand beginner 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.240
 the artist is where to dissolve that is 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:29.380
 when he comes the material store 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.720
 so much so much that if not 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.350
 know exactly what you need 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:39.760
 and if you still meet a consultant 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:42.370
 who doesn't understand painting then 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.570
 You can buy a lot of things too much and 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.460
 because without even realizing because of what and because 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.910
 materials a greater degree just 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.670
 receive errors and as a result you can 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.250
 Generally give up on painting 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.030
 I am often asked about 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.030
 how to choose brushes 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:07.100
 brushes choose difficult because the choice 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.770
 big and really quality 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:16.009
 little brushes and 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:18.950
 as a rule no longer differences between the well 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.740
 I often eat it between China and China 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.190
 Italy and France Europe and so on 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.170
 There is very high-quality Chinese 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.770
 brushes and absolutely not quality 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.360
 European for example and vice versa 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.409
 so you need to look and feel 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:39.830
 directly in the store and ask 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.690
 I recommend expert opinion 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:46.640
 the brushes that we use are very 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:49.250
 long time ago it is synthetic to Chechnya it is very 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:54.259
 dear and she often does not justify 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.149
 expectations since the average price 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.340
 segment 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.890
 bristles and these are substandard brushes 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.470
 very expensive and meet quality 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.640
 seldom 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.060
 well and novice 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.209
 who writes in the techniques that we 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:15.230
 we teach which techniques alla prima is 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:17.959
 impressionism my other tassels should 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.879
 be enough with so resist 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.360
 himself i mean they should she not be 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:25.370
 soft because if lay out 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.620
 masks in this style of impressionism then 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.040
 there must resist it should not 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.290
 be soft 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.810
 which is good for what 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:39.180
 then the portrait statement is also a problem she 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:43.140
 probably number one is that pile 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.299
 falls out that is you paint a picture with you 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.400
 half brush left in the picture but 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.799
 one account sorry for a brush for what it is 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.250
 in the picture dries up or it is necessary 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:56.040
 choose from the picture is this complexity in 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.340
 I'll show you my brushes now 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.459
 Now this is not a new show how they are and here in 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.620
 the result of the work already feels 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.239
 part of those brushes that we use 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.840
 at master classes 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:12.299
 they went well, a lot of workshops 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.359
 probably more than a year maybe even 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:18.230
 some of them are two years old so you 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:20.790
 at home but they are more likely to you 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.769
 rather, you will want to buy a new one 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.069
 than they reach you to such a state 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.810
 although look they 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:32.909
 if you wash them if you follow them 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:36.090
 then they absolutely say the same 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:39.150
 filled and shaggy like new then 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:42.510
 there is no nap they fall out absolutely 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:47.250
 good condition the only thing with 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:50.269
 through them time happens well as in 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:54.510
 any ladies tassels we often use 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:57.419
 lying in the background 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:02.220
 tassels because of this summer that we don't 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:05.310
 Sorry that is, we like a brush goes to 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.810
 damage to his painting that has a picture 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.840
 first brush it 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.129
 support material here that is it 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.799
 we're starting a little bit here 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:15.490
 wear off but this brush can be 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.510
 it worked there for two years 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.860
 a large number of workshops 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.170
 which problem 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.290
 and not a problem to solve it absolutely 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:30.250
 that they have weak 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:33.520
 these are these 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:36.250
 weak and a brush can not everything happens 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.700
 sometimes that she is like this with her 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:43.420
 what 's happening is what happened to 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:45.310
 brush union boiling water wash repeatedly 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.320
 if heel cartoons are like this 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.640
 Well, I don't know which one 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.630
 there must be a brush which is 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:56.260
 this problem will endure falling out 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.570
 and forget, and here you need either glue 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.190
 put well wiped before that 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.370
 there is from oil paint that is not 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.980
 there must be paints 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:10.120
 press pliers and you can still on top 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:12.250
 insulating tape and absolutely ok here 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:16.360
 in this way brush yourself 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:21.520
 feels that is a long nap synthetic 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:25.870
 and it is desirable that you have a home 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:28.270
 well let's say the whole set is from 1 to 12 because 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.530
 that the brushes need different you need and 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:35.950
 unit which with long such here 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:39.100
 little spout and even you need not 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:42.220
 only oval but flat 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:44.920
 such here that hemp and tassels that 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:48.670
 number one after a while it becomes 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:51.840
 so perfect let's say with a pencil and if 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:55.780
 summarize then the brush should be 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:58.210
 synthetic long nap enough 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:02.700
 dense that is not uncommon 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:05.950
 Not a rare pile but a lot of pile 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:09.220
 You can also shop a little bit for now. 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:12.640
 no one sees try as far as 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:15.720
 this pile falls or not even in the new 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:19.530
 tassels if tassel 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:22.650
 will in future lost their fur 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:25.460
 nap then it will be even in new tassels 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.460
 already seen
