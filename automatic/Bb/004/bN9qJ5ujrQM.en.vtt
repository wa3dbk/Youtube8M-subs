Hello! Today I will show you how to make an ethnic nail art design.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.640
It's a cashmere design I recreated.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.050
So let’s have a look at the video. I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.160
To start off, I apply a beige base coat.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.260
Then I use a soft sponge and an orange and a pearly peach nail polish.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.690
I dip the sponge in the two colors and I make the shade off at the corner of my nail,

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.690
starting from the bottom to the top.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.590
When it is dry, I make the detailed pattern.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.290
I use a very fine brush and black acrylic paint

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.260
Then I start to draw. I won’t explain how I make the design

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
Instead, I let you see how to make it, it should be easier.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.140
Then I make a leaf design.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.970
To do so, I press on my brush when I reach the center of the line.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.270
First I don’t press on the brush

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.880
Then I press on the brush and release it.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.450
To obtain a fine stroke, then a thick stroke and a fine stroke again.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.490
Then I add some color to enhance the design

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.640
To do so, I use a golden nail polish

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.500
Then with a dotting tool rather than a brush, because it is more practical.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.560
I add some golden color between each drop.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.180
Then I add some little orange dots around the big drop.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.710
And finally I add a golden rhinestone.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.510
Do not forget to apply the final top coat.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.840
I hope that you enjoyed this tutorial.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.820
