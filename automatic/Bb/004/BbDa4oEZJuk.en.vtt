00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.420
 hey love a fan some processes 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.830
 done iphone so inconspicuously in 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.960
 background that you completely of it 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.340
 on the one hand, that is comfortable 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.349
 deadline on the other hand, too 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.670
 accordingly, a lot of power in case of problems 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.230
 with the battery life it is recommended 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.330
 these do not sing necessary 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.140
 automatisms at least temporarily 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.310
 off 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.960
 so you can do it again 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.119
 easier with the battery to the end 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.710
 the first day the active as the first 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.140
 background update of the under the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:33.480
 attitude then go under general 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.190
 and under background updating 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.090
 below 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.320
 Now we can do the background 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.010
 update generally above 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.960
 turn off 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.190
 that means no apps anymore 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.170
 content fully automatically in the background 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.510
 load even if they are not open at all 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.890
 But that would be the club still 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.140
 you can just do that 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.789
 disable unwanted 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.039
 he think both re-activated app 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.289
 more power is needed next 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.149
 they activate the data synchronization because 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.370
 understanding apps work together and 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.210
 access to the same data to thus 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.160
 communicate with each other 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.730
 in between the whole time what also 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.379
 electricity eats 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.299
 to end this just go back in 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.000
 the settings and for example 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.650
 just then under mail contacts and 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.330
 calendar use these apps eg 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.670
 Data reconciliation now clicks on 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.930
 data reconciliation and if none 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.130
 data synchronization should take place more 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.960
 click her up the push 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.460
 notifications are gone 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.080
 disabled is no longer consistent 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.180
 controlled and updated 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.860
 but you can adjust that all for example 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.780
 15 minutes every 30 minutes or 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.360
 should be updated every hour 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.619
 You will only see manually 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.460
 If you update the apps too 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.460
 really fulfilled 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.350
 deactivate as the last power-saving trick 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.270
 we automatic downloads from 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.390
 itunes and the app store go for it 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.880
 back to the settings and 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.799
 now under itunes app store 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.229
 Here you can now set which 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.570
 automatic download 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.049
 Disables all power to most 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.240
 save up 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.380
 we hope it could help more power 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.579
 to save on the iphone 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.649
 Of course, keep in mind that the 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.630
 comfort you suffer from 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.189
 enough electricity is available or comes 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.659
 quickly return to a power source worthwhile 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.159
 it turns on this automatic too 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.479
 leave or reactivate 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.979
