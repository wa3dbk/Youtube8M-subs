feedback especially collaborating with

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.049 
feedback especially collaborating with
students<00:00:07.590> is<00:00:07.680> being<00:00:07.979> able<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.280> sit<00:00:08.490> down<00:00:08.700> and

draw over their drawing to point out
everything<00:00:13.679> that<00:00:13.860> say<00:00:14.249> every<00:00:14.910> mistake

would<00:00:17.130> do<00:00:17.280> but<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.940> really<00:00:18.090> work<00:00:18.360> through<00:00:18.390> the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
would do but to really work through the

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.170 
would do but to really work through the
design<00:00:18.990> process<00:00:19.290> find<00:00:19.890> out<00:00:20.040> what<00:00:20.790> their<00:00:20.940> goals

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
design process find out what their goals

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.360 
design process find out what their goals
were<00:00:21.390> with<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.690> design<00:00:22.020> things<00:00:22.530> that<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:22.920> feel

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:23.370 
were with the design things that I feel

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.040 
were with the design things that I feel
could<00:00:23.670> help<00:00:23.910> push<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.330> design<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.750> be<00:00:24.780> better

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
could help push the design to be better

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.110 
could help push the design to be better
but<00:00:25.680> also<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.980> point<00:00:26.250> out<00:00:26.340> things<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.970> I

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:27.120 
but also to point out things that I

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.880 
but also to point out things that I
really<00:00:27.450> like<00:00:27.690> about<00:00:27.870> the<00:00:28.140> design<00:00:28.440> or<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.710> think

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
really like about the design or I think

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.790 
really like about the design or I think
is<00:00:29.220> working<00:00:29.840> you<00:00:30.840> know<00:00:30.960> functionally<00:00:31.620> in

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
is working you know functionally in

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.010 
is working you know functionally in
their<00:00:32.129> in<00:00:32.340> their<00:00:32.550> work<00:00:32.790> so<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.629> know<00:00:33.719> for<00:00:33.960> me

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.470 
their in their work so you know for me
the<00:00:34.379> the<00:00:34.890> whenever<00:00:35.609> I<00:00:35.670> think<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.030> feedback<00:00:36.359> I

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
the the whenever I think of feedback I

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.119 
the the whenever I think of feedback I
just<00:00:36.690> think<00:00:36.839> of<00:00:36.929> collaboration<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.890> really

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
bit about how this body shape sits on

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.630 
bit about how this body shape sits on
this<00:01:42.479> type<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.840> bench<00:01:43.289> you've<00:01:43.920> got<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.160> bench

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
this type of bench you've got a bench

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.570 
this type of bench you've got a bench
that<00:01:44.759> has<00:01:45.630> sort<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.050> a<00:01:46.170> great<00:01:47.039> sense<00:01:47.399> of

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
that has sort of a great sense of

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.960 
that has sort of a great sense of
dimension<00:01:47.940> and<00:01:48.420> she's<00:01:49.080> sort<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.970> flatly

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
dimension and she's sort of flatly

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.279 
dimension and she's sort of flatly
sitting<00:01:51.330> on<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.599> so<00:01:51.750> what<00:01:51.959> I<00:01:51.990> would<00:01:52.080> almost

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
sitting on it so what I would almost

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.949 
sitting on it so what I would almost
suggest<00:01:52.560> with<00:01:53.009> her<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:54.330> type<00:01:54.569> of<00:01:54.599> thing

00:01:54.949 --> 00:01:54.959

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
butt is sitting so to speak and then if

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.510 
butt is sitting so to speak and then if
you<00:02:03.840> want<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.080> have<00:02:04.229> her<00:02:04.349> legs<00:02:04.649> crossed<00:02:04.950> just

have one cross like this you can still
have<00:02:11.280> those<00:02:11.520> sort<00:02:11.760> of<00:02:11.819> dainty<00:02:17.060> dainty<00:02:18.060> feet

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:33.290 

and<00:02:23.599> by<00:02:24.599> doing<00:02:24.810> this<00:02:29.630> got<00:02:30.630> this<00:02:30.810> leg<00:02:32.090> this<00:02:33.090> is

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
and by doing this got this leg this is

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.400 
and by doing this got this leg this is
spotted<00:02:33.930> over<00:02:34.530> here<00:02:35.300> this<00:02:36.300> now<00:02:36.630> becomes<00:02:37.170> the

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
spotted over here this now becomes the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.790 
spotted over here this now becomes the
bench

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
bench

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.370 
bench
this<00:02:38.220> becomes<00:02:38.610> underneath<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.330> bench<00:02:39.540> and

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
this becomes underneath the bench and

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.160 
this becomes underneath the bench and
now<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.650> me<00:02:40.980> she<00:02:41.280> actually<00:02:41.430> feels<00:02:42.030> like<00:02:42.480> she's

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
now to me she actually feels like she's

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.900 
now to me she actually feels like she's
sitting<00:02:43.379> on<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.739> bench<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.250> I<00:02:44.640> might<00:02:44.879> even

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
sitting on the bench and I might even

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.650 
sitting on the bench and I might even
thicken<00:02:45.629> up<00:02:45.720> her<00:02:46.020> little<00:02:46.230> purse<00:02:46.560> strap<00:02:47.660> and

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
thicken up her little purse strap and

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.800 
thicken up her little purse strap and
put<00:02:49.349> it<00:02:49.440> like<00:02:49.590> this<00:02:49.800> so<00:02:49.860> that<00:02:50.069> you<00:02:50.310> can<00:02:50.459> tell

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
put it like this so that you can tell

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.059 
put it like this so that you can tell
what<00:02:51.810> she's<00:02:52.020> holding<00:02:52.230> at<00:02:52.500> first<00:02:52.709> I<00:02:52.860> thought<00:02:53.010> it

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
what she's holding at first I thought it

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.220 
what she's holding at first I thought it
was<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.250> little<00:02:53.400> see-through<00:02:53.910> into<00:02:54.750> her<00:02:54.870> dress

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
was a little see-through into her dress

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.110 
was a little see-through into her dress
but<00:02:56.010> then<00:02:56.160> I<00:02:56.220> could<00:02:56.400> realize<00:02:56.700> it<00:02:56.850> was<00:02:56.970> the

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
but then I could realize it was the

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.540 
but then I could realize it was the
purse<00:02:57.360> so<00:02:58.200> I<00:02:58.230> would<00:02:58.410> make<00:02:58.590> this<00:02:58.800> adjustment

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
purse so I would make this adjustment

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.860 
purse so I would make this adjustment
this<00:02:59.730> now<00:02:59.910> makes<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.300> feel<00:03:00.510> like<00:03:00.660> she's

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
this now makes it feel like she's

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.770 
this now makes it feel like she's
actually<00:03:01.080> sitting<00:03:01.590> on<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:01.860> bench<00:03:02.570> the<00:03:03.570> other

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
actually sitting on the bench the other

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.780 
actually sitting on the bench the other
thing<00:03:04.110> is<00:03:04.290> readability<00:03:04.830> on<00:03:05.160> this<00:03:05.340> character

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
thing is readability on this character

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.420 
thing is readability on this character
space<00:03:06.060> it's<00:03:06.270> really<00:03:06.840> hard<00:03:07.110> to<00:03:07.290> tell<00:03:07.530> what's

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
space it's really hard to tell what's

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.000 
space it's really hard to tell what's
going<00:03:08.670> on<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:09.270> what<00:03:09.450> he's<00:03:09.690> doing<00:03:10.110> so<00:03:10.680> I<00:03:10.950> would

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
going on and what he's doing so I would

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.310 
going on and what he's doing so I would
almost<00:03:12.320> start<00:03:13.320> over<00:03:13.710> a<00:03:13.740> little<00:03:14.010> bit<00:03:15.320> that's

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
almost start over a little bit that's

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:23.270 
almost start over a little bit that's
kind<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:16.620> what<00:03:16.800> you're<00:03:16.920> doing<00:03:21.770> I'm<00:03:22.770> just<00:03:22.920> going

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
kind of what you're doing I'm just going

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.280 
kind of what you're doing I'm just going
to<00:03:23.340> sort<00:03:23.490> of<00:03:23.550> make<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:24.000> generic<00:03:24.290> suggestion

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
to sort of make a generic suggestion

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.340 
to sort of make a generic suggestion
that<00:03:25.470> would<00:03:25.710> would<00:03:26.190> definitely<00:03:26.820> work<00:03:27.350> for

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
that would would definitely work for

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:41.560 
that would would definitely work for
clarity<00:03:28.830> if<00:03:29.040> we<00:03:29.610> have<00:03:33.350> mouth<00:03:34.350> here<00:03:37.850> nose<00:03:38.850> here

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
clarity if we have mouth here nose here

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.550 
clarity if we have mouth here nose here
we<00:03:42.570> have<00:03:42.690> enough<00:03:43.020> space<00:03:43.350> up<00:03:43.680> here<00:03:45.290> so<00:03:46.290> that<00:03:46.470> you

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
we have enough space up here so that you

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.540 
we have enough space up here so that you
can<00:03:46.740> get<00:03:46.890> those<00:03:47.100> eyebrows<00:03:47.790> like<00:03:48.210> this<00:03:49.550> because

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
can get those eyebrows like this because

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.430 
can get those eyebrows like this because
I<00:03:50.640> know<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:51.030> character<00:03:51.420> sort<00:03:51.600> of<00:03:51.720> had<00:03:51.870> it<00:03:52.110> was

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
I know the character sort of had it was

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.520 
I know the character sort of had it was
like<00:03:52.590> he<00:03:52.740> was<00:03:52.890> crooning<00:03:53.460> or<00:03:53.670> singing<00:03:54.530> but

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
like he was crooning or singing but

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.750 
like he was crooning or singing but
let's<00:03:55.740> just<00:03:55.950> say<00:03:56.130> for<00:03:56.190> example<00:03:57.710> whatever

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
let's just say for example whatever

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.880 
let's just say for example whatever
expression<00:03:59.760> you<00:03:59.910> use<00:04:00.110> you<00:04:01.110> think<00:04:01.410> about<00:04:01.620> his

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
expression you use you think about his

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:11.080 
expression you use you think about his
face<00:04:02.280> a<00:04:07.040> bit<00:04:08.040> more<00:04:08.220> clearly<00:04:08.820> like<00:04:09.209> this<00:04:09.620> and

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
face a bit more clearly like this and

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.220 
face a bit more clearly like this and
you<00:04:12.090> can<00:04:12.239> have<00:04:12.360> some<00:04:12.660> you<00:04:12.840> know<00:04:12.870> sort<00:04:13.170> of

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
you can have some you know sort of

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.780 
you can have some you know sort of
spilled<00:04:13.470> liquid<00:04:13.950> you<00:04:14.340> could<00:04:14.459> have<00:04:14.580> one<00:04:14.760> of

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
spilled liquid you could have one of

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.340 
spilled liquid you could have one of
these<00:04:15.000> is<00:04:15.410> like<00:04:16.410> a<00:04:16.470> bottle<00:04:16.950> that<00:04:16.980> was<00:04:17.310> broken

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
these is like a bottle that was broken

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.440 
these is like a bottle that was broken
whatever<00:04:19.350> is<00:04:19.620> you<00:04:19.919> could<00:04:20.130> you<00:04:20.580> know<00:04:20.669> it<00:04:20.970> kind

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
whatever is you could you know it kind

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:22.700 
whatever is you could you know it kind
of<00:04:21.540> doesn't<00:04:21.690> matter<00:04:21.840> I<00:04:22.049> like<00:04:22.290> the<00:04:22.410> fact<00:04:22.620> that

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
of doesn't matter I like the fact that

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.300 
of doesn't matter I like the fact that
you've<00:04:22.860> got<00:04:22.890> his<00:04:23.130> legs<00:04:23.400> going<00:04:23.700> over<00:04:25.100> the<00:04:26.100> bench

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
you've got his legs going over the bench

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.690 
you've got his legs going over the bench
I<00:04:26.490> think<00:04:26.730> that's<00:04:26.880> a<00:04:27.000> nice<00:04:27.180> touch<00:04:28.520> love<00:04:29.520> the

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
I think that's a nice touch love the

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.900 
I think that's a nice touch love the
readability<00:04:30.090> on<00:04:30.480> the<00:04:30.690> heart<00:04:31.230> in<00:04:32.220> his<00:04:32.430> hands

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
readability on the heart in his hands

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.790 
readability on the heart in his hands
that's<00:04:33.180> all<00:04:33.419> very<00:04:33.450> clear<00:04:33.990> but<00:04:34.200> just<00:04:34.470> making

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
that's all very clear but just making

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.730 
that's all very clear but just making
his<00:04:34.919> face<00:04:35.280> feel<00:04:35.700> this<00:04:36.000> much<00:04:36.210> clearer<00:04:36.780> whether

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
his face feel this much clearer whether

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.260 
his face feel this much clearer whether
it's<00:04:37.919> this<00:04:38.100> expression<00:04:38.669> or<00:04:38.820> not<00:04:38.970> but

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
it's this expression or not but

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.680
