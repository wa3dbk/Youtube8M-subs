00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.480
 and canada have all today I'm going to 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:28.220
 teach this application that is 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.410
 free in the app store and it's also very 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.630
 Good know what it does not serve 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.000
 to clean our device is very 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.950
 similar if it has jailbreak to what 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.489
 would be the clean air pro there we have it 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:43.200
 it's ok that's called che let's see 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:45.360
 so you can see how it works 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.460
 it opens 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.530
 to finish the notifications I 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.720
 You looked right now with what I have 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.740
 used in that they are 498 megabytes 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:59.420
 this is ram memory pairs test at 1% 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:02.510
 of memory and 8 free 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.990
 Well, if we give 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.030
 clean the memory I'm going to what I would think 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:11.390
 is clearing the memory is about the 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:15.380
 speed does not go up considerably 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:19.450
 64 to 64 by the way ok then we have 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:24.100
 here another option that puts the 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:26.619
 we clean the garbage that already have 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.250
 used 10 gigs and free I have 2 gigs 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.110
 only vouchers 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.540
 let's give it to you so you can see what 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.220
 this part would last a little longer 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.260
 because we clean up the entire goal of 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.180
 missions let's see me 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.710
 look what to clean there could be the 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.840
 almost full disk message 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.410
 this is normal from the process of 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.210
 cleaning please selections 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.610
 finished when you see it and it contains a 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.000
 9 waiting for the process to end 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.220
 big cleaning 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.480
 now he is insisting 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:03.620
 and there we have it it will take us two minutes 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:07.370
 So let's leave it two minutes and there's 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.800
 successful cleaning the data cache the 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:13.700
 iphone has been cleaned and is located 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.610
 now in a good state enjoy of 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.250
 your fast iphone with more good space 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.800
 Well, this is what I wanted to teach today 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.880
 now let's see the name here yes you 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.820
 you give more austral in the applications 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:31.250
 they have what the developer is and 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:36.200
 there are many more examples but let's go 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:40.550
 where it goes much faster you see press 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.580
 286 and 317 memory louvre much more 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:47.300
 nothing 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:49.490
 we are going to go to what is app store and 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.480
 we are going to look for him we give him to search and 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.480
 It's free of charge 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.440
 I was going to say the check 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.360
 if it is there we are going to see 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:16.300
 but I'm betting 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:20.170
 this is worth the second 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:25.060
 now you can access it because what 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:28.400
 what would be the app store but memory alix 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.620
 if it's 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.930
 who has made this application is called 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.689
 parishes and here where I would say a little bit 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:40.340
 what would the description be but let's 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:43.280
 I can not in English but what I have 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.840
 explained that is what would be the 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.909
 developer we study language 2 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.909
 this is the category of utilities 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:59.120
 is version 1.2 weighs only 23 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:04:01.290
 megas between 3 hung with 1 requires and 27 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.569
 Back compatible with iphone ipod 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:09.120
 ipad 2 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.120
 and is also used to see 5 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:18.989
 download it because the ipod goes a lot 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.810

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:28.199
