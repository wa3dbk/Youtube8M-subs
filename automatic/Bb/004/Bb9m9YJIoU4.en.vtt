00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.520
 one that tares all let's stay here faith 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.770
 mind and as always I hope they are 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.440
 super mega turbo host welcome to 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.660
 channel before you start let me warn you 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.210
 that yesterday I took a six of pau 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.580
 pau with fruit yes and that hits but mega 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.770
 cannon so I was driving like 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.930
 can see in a state of drunkenness so 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.029
 although as I ran over a post 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.890
 etcetera do not worry I told you the 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.230
 motive as a mean let's start not 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.590
 but good the reason for this video is 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.960
 to talk a little about the haste or 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.660
 good I made like some summer or like 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.100
 want to tell you that it is not missions 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.200
 obviously but they require 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.590
 approximately five people require 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.410
 a conductor a goldman who is a man 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.440
 that knows how to use weapons not a killer 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:50.140
 could you say it requires a hacker or 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.600
 requires certain people to be made and 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.670
 these missions will be incorporated into 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.739
 online to multiplayer 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.500
 there are many information has come out 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.809
 this in the last patches as we have 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.939
 seen tricks or rather a click to 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.250
 make a hacker appear in your 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.229
 room in your house appear or two hackers 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.880
 one above the other appear in the 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.930
 computer is one more bug you could 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.659
 say one click 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.640
 there are some tricks that have come 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.710
 giving information about that you're 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.840
 missions that are because some people do not 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.110
 he knows and as I told you they are going to do 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.880
 missions I'm going to give you an example you're going to 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.460
 entering a people to rob a bank 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.659
 for example and you will be five people 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.470
 and if you manage to do it successfully and all 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.390
 Suppose you are going to be given three 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.240
 millions to each or three million to 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.890
 each one we put or 500 thousand or half 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.500
 million or so depending on the mission 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.240
 that it does not touch you, the truth is that 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.860
 that's about more than anything is a way 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.840
 to do a mission and earn a lot 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.929
 money that would be one of the points 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.840
 dgt to the truth is that when it's going to come out 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:57.140
 of this and so on I do not want to cheat you 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.810
 this is that is a patch that could not 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.340
 leaving maybe this month the safest thing is 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.579
 that would come in two 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.380
 months plus or minus four 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.149
 months etcetera 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.610
 normally there could come out that patch 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.349
 no no it's not something why why 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.560
 I'm saying that two three four months 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:17.629
 because the six is something that recreates a lot 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.450
 hype creates a lot of emotion in people who 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:23.090
 people be what not then I think 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.769
 that those of rockstar could take advantage 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.450
 to sell that patch because I'm 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.030
 sure if they take it out for sale that 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.010
 tlc because a lot of people would buy it already 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.470
 that would give more life to the game then 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.510
 I doubt that they take it out for free because 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.239
 they have given us 22 of them that is for 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.579
 example that of the valentine that was 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.130
 On the 14th they also gave you the gift of 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:46.040
 the business that was in March in this 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.709
 same month a few days ago sincerely no 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.810
 I think they give away all the content is 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.090
 obviously I do not think they're going to give everything away 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.040
 the content already made a lot of money 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.810
 that's right in that but 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.910
 remember that these companies never 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.579
 they will associate with those companies always 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.470
 they will want more because they have 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:05.600
 investors there are people who have 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.310
 invested in gt to people who put money 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.819
 then people want to earn money and 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.769
 obviously 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.870
 the pink companies because you have to 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.700
 pay everyone who invested their 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.680
 wool and give them to win a more amount 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.060
 then those companies are always going to 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.999
 want more now roster is taking it 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.040
 fine with taking twice now free 

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:24.799
 that speaks well of them 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.200
 then the next dlc the truth of 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.180
 the people of the missions sincerely 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.340
 I think a lot of things are missing before 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.989
 that could come out that because you pum 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.000
 you win a million no but you're going to 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.439
 spend on another car in clothes 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.980
 I sincerely believe that more is needed 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:41.719
 things to spend money like casinos 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.519
 banks etc where they can by themselves 

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:45.319
 banks steal money but they do 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.030
 missing more places where you can spend 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.219
 the money that you have stolen instead of 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.269
 be buying clothes and the truth is 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:51.680
 that I think everyone will need 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.060
 put it much earlier but good I hope 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.169
 that you liked the video do not forget 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.449
 I like to help him a lot 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:58.430
 subscribe every day there were videos of 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:04:02.319
 what tea they share with their friends 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.319
 and first we have another video chau
