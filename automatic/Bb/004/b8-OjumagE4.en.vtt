extra<00:03:20.590> health<00:03:21.210> and<00:03:22.210> without<00:03:22.660> having<00:03:22.840> that

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
extra health and without having that

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.920 
extra health and without having that
you're<00:03:23.320> gonna<00:03:23.440> die<00:03:23.770> it's<00:03:24.280> -<00:03:24.760> he<00:03:25.360> gets<00:03:25.540> shot<00:03:25.600> at

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
you're gonna die it's - he gets shot at

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.720 
you're gonna die it's - he gets shot at
like<00:03:26.110> with<00:03:26.260> one<00:03:26.500> bullet<00:03:26.740> sometimes<00:03:27.340> and<00:03:27.640> it

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
like with one bullet sometimes and it

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.100 
like with one bullet sometimes and it
you<00:03:27.850> can<00:03:27.970> see<00:03:28.120> a<00:03:28.150> little<00:03:28.300> red<00:03:28.570> you<00:03:28.930> know<00:03:29.020> the

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
you can see a little red you know the

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.020 
you can see a little red you know the
little<00:03:29.260> red<00:03:29.500> arrow<00:03:30.130> thing<00:03:30.520> that<00:03:30.640> it<00:03:30.730> shows<00:03:30.910> at

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
little red arrow thing that it shows at

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.090 
little red arrow thing that it shows at
the<00:03:31.090> bottom<00:03:31.300> when<00:03:31.420> he<00:03:31.480> does<00:03:31.630> get<00:03:31.750> shot<00:03:31.990> at<00:03:32.140> and

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
the bottom when he does get shot at and

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.020 
the bottom when he does get shot at and
that<00:03:33.220> probably<00:03:33.459> would<00:03:33.550> have<00:03:33.670> killed<00:03:33.850> him<00:03:34.000> that

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
that probably would have killed him that

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.880 
that probably would have killed him that
literally<00:03:34.540> would<00:03:34.840> have<00:03:34.870> killed<00:03:35.410> him<00:03:35.620> if<00:03:35.770> he

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
literally would have killed him if he

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.140 
literally would have killed him if he
didn't<00:03:36.220> have<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.459> ballistic<00:03:36.820> vest<00:03:37.000> because

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
didn't have the ballistic vest because

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.949 
didn't have the ballistic vest because
you<00:03:37.720> die<00:03:37.900> incredibly<00:03:38.560> fast<00:03:38.770> in<00:03:38.950> hardcore<00:03:39.959> but
