fingers<00:02:08.360> relate<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:08.959> it<00:02:09.530> won't<00:02:09.800> become<00:02:10.069> an

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
fingers relate and it won't become an

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.040 
fingers relate and it won't become an
exercise<00:02:10.550> it<00:02:10.819> will<00:02:10.849> become<00:02:11.209> part<00:02:11.480> of<00:02:11.599> your

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
exercise it will become part of your

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.370 
exercise it will become part of your
musical<00:02:12.560> vocabulary<00:02:13.430> so<00:02:14.239> let's<00:02:14.930> take<00:02:15.110> a<00:02:15.140> look

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
musical vocabulary so let's take a look

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.830 
musical vocabulary so let's take a look
at<00:02:15.470> where<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.800> modes<00:02:15.980> come<00:02:16.310> from<00:02:16.660> okay<00:02:17.660> let's

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
at where the modes come from okay let's

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.750 
at where the modes come from okay let's
talk<00:02:18.050> about<00:02:18.110> our<00:02:18.440> modes<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:18.980> it's<00:02:19.370> really<00:02:19.550> see

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
talk about our modes and it's really see

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.479 
talk about our modes and it's really see
where<00:02:19.910> they<00:02:20.000> come<00:02:20.180> from<00:02:20.680> molds<00:02:21.680> are<00:02:21.890> basically

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
where they come from molds are basically

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.020 
where they come from molds are basically
scales<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:24.129> where<00:02:25.129> they<00:02:25.340> come<00:02:25.550> from<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:25.970> the

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
scales and where they come from and the

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.910 
scales and where they come from and the
names<00:02:26.239> are<00:02:26.540> well<00:02:27.140> let's<00:02:27.349> start<00:02:27.590> in<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.739> key<00:02:27.890> of

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
names are well let's start in the key of

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.479 
names are well let's start in the key of
G<00:02:28.250> shall<00:02:28.520> we<00:02:28.700> with<00:02:29.330> a<00:02:29.660> G<00:02:30.050> major<00:02:30.290> scale<00:02:30.739> for<00:02:30.980> real

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
G shall we with a G major scale for real

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:40.720 
G shall we with a G major scale for real
now

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.059 

so<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.849> key<00:02:42.030> of<00:02:42.180> G<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.750> tonic<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.800> first

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
so the key of G the tonic the first

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.850 
so the key of G the tonic the first
scale<00:02:44.250> is<00:02:44.459> called<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.790> Ionian<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.690> its<00:02:46.500> scale

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
scale is called the Ionian and its scale

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.260 
scale is called the Ionian and its scale
is<00:02:47.130> made<00:02:47.370> up<00:02:47.520> of<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:48.060> root<00:02:48.590> major<00:02:49.590> second

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
is made up of the root major second

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.130 
is made up of the root major second
major<00:02:51.270> third<00:02:51.630> fourth<00:02:52.350> fifth<00:02:53.480> sixth<00:02:54.480> major

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
major third fourth fifth sixth major

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.390 
major third fourth fifth sixth major
seventh<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:55.850> the<00:02:56.850> octave<00:02:58.160> there<00:02:59.160> you<00:02:59.280> have

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
seventh and the octave there you have

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.210 
seventh and the octave there you have
your<00:02:59.430> Ionian<00:03:00.090> or<00:03:00.269> the<00:03:00.540> tonic<00:03:00.989> in<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.590> key<00:03:01.769> of<00:03:01.800> G

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
your Ionian or the tonic in the key of G

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.240 
your Ionian or the tonic in the key of G
now<00:03:03.180> what<00:03:03.330> happens<00:03:03.720> if<00:03:04.140> we<00:03:04.470> take<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:04.950> same

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
now what happens if we take the same

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.400 
now what happens if we take the same
notes<00:03:05.550> of<00:03:05.700> that<00:03:05.819> scale<00:03:06.209> but<00:03:07.019> instead<00:03:07.290> of

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
notes of that scale but instead of

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.990 
notes of that scale but instead of
starting<00:03:07.650> on<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.860> tonic<00:03:08.220> starting<00:03:08.670> on<00:03:08.850> the

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
starting on the tonic starting on the

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.770 
starting on the tonic starting on the
two<00:03:09.239> which<00:03:10.170> would<00:03:10.350> be<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.600> so<00:03:12.600> we're<00:03:12.690> going

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
two which would be the a so we're going

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.300 
two which would be the a so we're going
to<00:03:12.840> have<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.049> same<00:03:13.290> notes<00:03:13.620> that<00:03:13.769> we're<00:03:14.010> in<00:03:14.069> a<00:03:14.130> G

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
to have the same notes that we're in a G

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.140 
to have the same notes that we're in a G
major<00:03:14.519> scale<00:03:14.910> but<00:03:15.150> starting<00:03:15.450> in<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.489> so

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
major scale but starting in the a so

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:25.910 
major scale but starting in the a so
we've<00:03:18.330> got<00:03:22.640> there<00:03:23.640> is<00:03:23.910> a<00:03:23.970> mode<00:03:24.330> that<00:03:24.630> is<00:03:25.590> called

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
we've got there is a mode that is called

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.050 
we've got there is a mode that is called
the<00:03:26.040> Dorian<00:03:26.549> mode<00:03:26.900> okay<00:03:27.980> now<00:03:28.980> well<00:03:29.700> if<00:03:29.819> we<00:03:29.910> take

we're going to do two octave scales and
I<00:04:41.750> want<00:04:41.930> to<00:04:41.990> talk<00:04:42.170> just<00:04:42.200> a<00:04:42.500> minute<00:04:42.620> about<00:04:42.860> a

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
I want to talk just a minute about a

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.550 
I want to talk just a minute about a
concept<00:04:44.120> of<00:04:44.360> moving<00:04:44.780> up<00:04:44.900> and<00:04:45.020> down<00:04:45.200> the<00:04:45.350> neck

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
concept of moving up and down the neck

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.590 
concept of moving up and down the neck
right<00:04:46.460> when<00:04:46.670> we're<00:04:46.790> doing<00:04:46.910> scales<00:04:47.390> and

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
right when we're doing scales and

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.200 
right when we're doing scales and
arpeggios<00:04:48.040> which<00:04:49.040> is<00:04:49.310> we're<00:04:49.790> really<00:04:49.970> trying

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
arpeggios which is we're really trying

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.810 
arpeggios which is we're really trying
to<00:04:50.330> teach<00:04:50.540> a<00:04:50.720> technique<00:04:51.170> of<00:04:51.680> moving<00:04:52.190> in<00:04:52.730> a

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
to teach a technique of moving in a

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.900 
to teach a technique of moving in a
smooth<00:04:53.240> manner<00:04:53.510> up<00:04:53.900> and<00:04:54.050> down<00:04:54.200> the<00:04:54.350> neck<00:04:54.910> for

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
smooth manner up and down the neck for

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.070 
smooth manner up and down the neck for
instance<00:04:56.180> if<00:04:56.270> you<00:04:56.360> wanted<00:04:56.570> to<00:04:56.660> play<00:04:56.810> a<00:04:56.840> two

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
instance if you wanted to play a two

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:03.190 
instance if you wanted to play a two
octave<00:04:57.410> scale<00:05:01.780> well<00:05:02.780> that's<00:05:02.930> a<00:05:03.020> lot<00:05:03.170> of

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
octave scale well that's a lot of

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:09.610 
octave scale well that's a lot of
movement<00:05:03.620> of<00:05:03.680> your<00:05:03.830> hand<00:05:04.040> right<00:05:04.310> or<00:05:08.500> well<00:05:09.500> if

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
movement of your hand right or well if

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.140 
movement of your hand right or well if
you<00:05:09.740> know<00:05:09.950> the<00:05:10.100> right<00:05:10.280> places<00:05:10.580> to<00:05:10.790> move<00:05:10.970> your

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
you know the right places to move your

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.470 
you know the right places to move your
hand

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.730 

you're<00:05:17.480> going<00:05:17.630> to<00:05:17.690> find<00:05:17.900> a<00:05:17.990> lot<00:05:18.170> easier<00:05:18.590> ways

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
you're going to find a lot easier ways

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.320 
you're going to find a lot easier ways
to<00:05:18.800> get<00:05:19.160> up<00:05:19.280> and<00:05:19.430> down<00:05:19.550> the<00:05:19.670> neck<00:05:19.700> and<00:05:20.090> believe

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
to get up and down the neck and believe

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.510 
to get up and down the neck and believe
me<00:05:20.540> the<00:05:20.750> idea<00:05:21.170> is<00:05:21.680> to<00:05:21.830> make<00:05:21.950> things<00:05:22.100> as<00:05:22.280> easily

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
me the idea is to make things as easily

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.980 
me the idea is to make things as easily
as<00:05:22.790> possible<00:05:22.970> so<00:05:23.390> you<00:05:23.450> don't<00:05:23.630> have<00:05:23.690> to<00:05:23.840> worry

as possible so you don't have to worry

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.530 
as possible so you don't have to worry
about<00:05:24.080> scales<00:05:24.800> and<00:05:25.190> notes<00:05:25.370> and<00:05:25.580> chords<00:05:26.360> and

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
about scales and notes and chords and

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.600 
about scales and notes and chords and
stuff<00:05:26.720> like<00:05:26.900> that<00:05:27.140> so<00:05:27.350> there<00:05:28.160> are<00:05:28.250> your<00:05:28.370> moans
