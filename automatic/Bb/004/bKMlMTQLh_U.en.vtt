so it is the rubber grip ER here on the

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.359 
so it is the rubber grip ER here on the
heel<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.600> again<00:01:48.869> they're<00:01:49.320> on<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.979> forefoot

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369

heel and again they're on the forefoot
area<00:01:50.610> which<00:01:51.360> helps<00:01:51.720> give<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.049> nice<00:01:52.229> secure

are these ventilation holes here in the

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.229 
are these ventilation holes here in the
sole<00:02:29.380> along<00:02:30.380> the<00:02:30.590> side<00:02:30.830> of<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.580> upper<00:02:31.940> and

some people do this for speed others do
it<00:03:00.739> for<00:03:00.830> the<00:03:00.950> fact<00:03:01.250> that<00:03:01.400> when<00:03:01.819> you<00:03:01.910> try<00:03:02.120> to<00:03:02.150> get

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
it for the fact that when you try to get

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.570 
it for the fact that when you try to get
socks<00:03:02.690> onto<00:03:03.049> a<00:03:03.080> wet<00:03:03.380> foot<00:03:03.739> after<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.280> swim

socks onto a wet foot after the swim

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.640 
socks onto a wet foot after the swim
it's<00:03:05.180> actually<00:03:05.510> really<00:03:05.690> difficult<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:06.500> when

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
it's actually really difficult and when

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:07.690 
it's actually really difficult and when
you've<00:03:06.769> already<00:03:06.830> got<00:03:07.040> enough<00:03:07.370> to<00:03:07.489> deal<00:03:07.670> with

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
you've already got enough to deal with

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.309 
you've already got enough to deal with
in<00:03:07.940> a<00:03:08.030> race<00:03:08.209> you<00:03:08.480> don't<00:03:08.630> need<00:03:08.870> that<00:03:08.989> kind<00:03:09.200> of

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
in a race you don't need that kind of

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.440 
in a race you don't need that kind of
stress<00:03:09.620> so<00:03:10.610> what<00:03:10.760> you've<00:03:10.940> got<00:03:10.970> here<00:03:11.150> is<00:03:11.360> a

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
stress so what you've got here is a

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.229 
stress so what you've got here is a
neoprene<00:03:11.930> one-piece<00:03:12.560> inside<00:03:13.160> on<00:03:13.430> that<00:03:13.459> so

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
neoprene one-piece inside on that so

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.509 
neoprene one-piece inside on that so
that<00:03:14.420> you<00:03:14.750> can<00:03:15.049> comfortably<00:03:15.739> cycling<00:03:16.310> these

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
that you can comfortably cycling these

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.789 
that you can comfortably cycling these
with<00:03:17.030> no<00:03:17.269> socks<00:03:17.600> on<00:03:17.840> without<00:03:18.260> getting<00:03:18.380> any

friction or any rubbing or hot spots

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.210 
friction or any rubbing or hot spots
that<00:03:20.810> can<00:03:20.959> cause<00:03:21.110> blisters<00:03:21.620> later<00:03:21.799> on<00:03:22.070> into

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
that can cause blisters later on into

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.259 
that can cause blisters later on into
the<00:03:22.430> race<00:03:23.980> what<00:03:24.980> you<00:03:25.100> also<00:03:25.280> get<00:03:25.670> from<00:03:25.880> the<00:03:26.000> trip

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
the race what you also get from the trip

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.170 
the race what you also get from the trip
it<00:03:26.510> is<00:03:26.750> really<00:03:27.560> really<00:03:27.739> good<00:03:28.130> power<00:03:28.430> transfer

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
it is really really good power transfer

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.390 
it is really really good power transfer
now<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:29.930> composite<00:03:30.560> sole<00:03:30.829> on<00:03:31.010> this<00:03:31.160> is

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
now the composite sole on this is

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.430 
now the composite sole on this is
actually<00:03:31.790> quite<00:03:32.060> hard<00:03:32.299> it's<00:03:32.660> very<00:03:32.720> difficult

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
actually quite hard it's very difficult
