00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.529

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.579
 easter eggs and everything possible beauty then 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.630

 Good guys, in this video, here I go. 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.200
 comment on the plot in this episode 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.910
 pilot is and along with the 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.649
 talk we are already talking about the 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.480
 damage and the things that will appear 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.489
 Beauty, come on then 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.190
 as revealed in the trailer is extended 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.890
 At 26 minutes, she leaves clinton 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.600
 same time as carrel with its mission 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.820
 to protect his cousin who still 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.129
 At that time an affected baby is 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.050
 directly linked to the couple and 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.690
 coordinates to go to earth 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.089
 however as crypton slot the ship of 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.470
 sent to the phantom zone and 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.020
 dance to understand that she was a good 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.720
 time there until she gets out and 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.030
 go to land here she wakes up on earth and 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.590
 she does not know how she got there her 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.409
 cous is that it is never referred to as 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.600
 superman in this episode is what he finds 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.060
 she takes her to the duties that are her 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.250
 adoptive parents on earth and two things 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.110
 very cool here is that we may have already 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.600
 a notion that the superman already acts 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.060
 how hero is a good time on earth then 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.850
 He's already there, it turned out to be super 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.770
 hero and the other thing comes from the time is 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.350
 for those who do not know khar's parents in 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.500
 new series profile is steel lost from 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.030
 1984 film and the superman of the lois series 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.909
 and clark the new adventures of superman 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.649
 b old series also I think a lot out 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.170
 when they do these tributes already 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.240
 we had this too from the flesh a guy 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.969
 she works for qat grande na national 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.219
 where is khat wilson's assistant 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:59.740
 scott and games 11 they are introduced 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:02.859
 it is also noted that kaka still refers 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.899
 to the twins as dimmy or ciné that in 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:06.430
 time series seems to be very different from 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.830
 version of the comics that we 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.770
 apparently the character will be a 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.900
 partner is the most 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.940
 clark kent and it seems that he left 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.060
 daily planet and now he works on 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.770
 national cib as art director and a 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.930
 thing that caught my attention is that 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.610
 scott Islam is the friend that carli 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.500
 seems to have a crush on her 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.390
 his name is the alter ego of the man of the 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.370
 toys a villain who in the comics 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.440
 He uses toys as weapons. 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.110
 would be that in the future he would be the villain 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.170
 in the series I do not know how to keep it in the 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.959
 head thinking pretty good is to continue 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.360
 here Alex gamers who is sister on earth not 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.940
 It's from here she's out of geneva when 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.860
 your plane is attacked when 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.470
 The guy reveals his powers for the first time. 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.970
 time running down the alley when 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.790
 turns into super dog 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.830
 this scene is a reference to superman 2 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.230
 the scene in question reminds her very much 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.290
 used in the trilogy of man before an arm 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.110
 face a classic scene already in the middle and 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.180
 Dear sister , she was not very happy. 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.340
 because she used her powers 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.140
 He said not to do it again. 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.510
 before I forget the rescue scene 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.760
 of the plane that the superleague rescue its sister 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.769
 From her we see a bridge with the sayings 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.840
 vote bayern another neighborhood for those who do not 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.660
 You know the name of the character's creator. 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.090
 in the face very fucking comics if it 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.830
 also that he created brehme here he is there 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.840
 in the gallery of ben villains that you 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.519
 You can go there and check it out after the crankcase. 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.170
 talked to his sister, he says that he 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.070
 I really liked the idea of her revealing 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.290
 your powers 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.120
 she needs to tell someone and 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.450
 share these good feelings 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.549
 né and she decides to reveal to the i on the roof 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.070
 she goes up with him there on the terrace and 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.060
 talks about your abilities 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.010
 super powers and everything else 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.230
 good and with that your friend in makes a 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.090
 uniform where it begins to 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.610
 combat some of the crimes that are 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.530
 happening until the villain is going taxi is 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.590
 introduced it is responsible for 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.930
 sabotage the plane and tell another alien 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.780
 who is called the commander a girl 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.280
 stopped the blast orders then 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.620
 mentions that they have to stay 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.090
 hidden and that the arrival of the general is 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.280
 impending death 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.799
 his mission is to eliminate agents and 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.500
 humans and now meat that has been added 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.239
 to the list the vortex 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.760
 alien who want to take revenge on 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.220
 lost because the squid to his mother she went to 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.650
 Judge who sent them to the strong prison. 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.510
 ross and the ghost zone, right? 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.310
 and talking about it this frost prison 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.040
 Rossi was the one who left the ghost zone 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.650
 along with meat will apparently be the 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.810
 uncle to have several positive aliens here 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.790
 on earth and we also have in the series the he 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.280
 has shown he is the director of dell 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.730
 extra normal operations department 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.670
 huh 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.890
 your alex sister is a people and hodel it 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.600
 protects the earth from aliens and 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.970
 alien invasions 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.220
 one curiosity is that henrique rech 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.440
 comics he becomes a superman cyborg 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.840
 a villain who transfers his mind to 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.850
 a metal body after an accident 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.860
 which one does he always blame superman? 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.290
 out that this dell is an agency that 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.300
 monitors the super human activity to 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.490
 keep the world safe in the 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.650
 supergauss should work with an agent 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.710
 of the department serving more or less 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.050
 how do flash stars in the labs 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.060
 the flash series with the series she also 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.960
 talks about feminism , and commit a 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.180
 heroin 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.820
 this pilot episode I think reasonable 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.470
 nothing much was the references and tals 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.330
 and we'll certainly see a superman 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.310
 future in the series the effects 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.470
 Specials are cool and the actress I 'm 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.720
 enjoying a lot and for those who wanted a 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.400
 super summer dark series is even better 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.690
 take the horse out of the clear rain 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.580
 it will not happen 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.510
 well, that's it then, I'll wait 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.250
 that you have enjoyed 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.229
 remember to comment what you are 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.390
 finding the series and I'll try to do 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:48.419
 videos for each episode of the series 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.470
 I then accompany that's it worth and 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:51.830
 to the next 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.830
 went
