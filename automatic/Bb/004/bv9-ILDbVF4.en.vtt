00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.280
 hello everyone to raÃºl with a 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.110
 new white video - and I bring you a 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.960
 new trick in multiplayer mode and in 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.820
 this case I will show you a little trick 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.960
 so you can practice to play 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.000
 against bots guys and stay 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.399
 paralyzed so you can practice tricks 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.649
 8 whatever clicks what you give the 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:32.509
 wins and good for it you do not need 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:35.000
 download nothing the only thing that you have to 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.730
 do is put bots and be able to take the 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.739
 flag and edit rules so you have 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.530
 to put the same as me as you see rounds 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.000
 earned and limited and in adjustment to take 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.559
 the flag the most important thing will be that the 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.329
 return time that is not you 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.699
 paralyze the video and you put it such and 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.649
 as I have it and well the only thing that will do 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.360
 is that you can not return the 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:57.360
 flag then that vessel 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.640
 according to the bots and they stay around 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.470
 the flag and well I recommend that 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.930
 restrict all weapons except the one 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:07.530
 are you going to use for the trick shot in this 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.300
 case I'm going to use the remington and the dcr 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.460
 and of secondaries also the restrict 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.180
 all and good time I'm going to create the 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.180
 class because 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.229
 to do the tribute to see 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.850
 an excess of means so you can also 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.730
 see what class I'm going to use 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.530
 I to do 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:30.420
 metrix is â€‹â€‹already worth 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.420
 to see good I need monkeys angels 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.880
 and a shock load serves itself is 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.189
 Well , I think it's already 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.840
 and well we give initial departure and good what 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.009
 only you have to do 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.280
 so that the bots 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.770
 book on is going to catch your flag the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.969
 enemy flag and then you have to 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.700
 let die right where 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:58.740
 where you want them to stay blocked and 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.890
 in this case good as knock down it 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.990
 they go up the normal thing is to go up to the houses 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.510
 we will leave them judged below a 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.400
 home to be able to make a trick shot 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.869
 and well the only thing you have to do is 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.560
 that when it comes out what you want 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:17.070
 kiel leave camps because to finish 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.680
 the game and that's it and now we're going 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.329
 to get over the trick 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.790
 we kill them because if not then we 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.500
 annoy 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.400
 OK 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.400
 downcast enemy 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.189
 well here we are already in your flag the 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:35.069
 take more in this case as we want 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:37.500
 do the 37 in this site because we 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.150
 let die here we have to let 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.050
 kill us a mod 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.510
 and now no vote will kill us 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.280
 and now how do you see that it is set for 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.370
 that can not be 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:56.250
 put the flag back and we are already 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.250
 all the bots are there to see 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.180
 beyond potatoes because I forgot 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.540
 to put the clamor I wanted to put the 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.540
 weather 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.170
 with the bully bot we go well 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.170
 we are making progress 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.440
 dejected 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.940
 good 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.620
 I think I put the bots in 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.180
 professionals we put in 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.920
 recruits because if they are going to be 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.480
 annoying as I have done now and 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.690
 I have also removed the gusts worth 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.690
 why 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.550
 and now of course I will not get any 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.550
 it's going to be normal 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.200
 and I take the good flag it's really 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.390
 that what if we are going to do something 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.280
 and if you want it to be every click camps 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.960
 then you do the twitcam as 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.690
 now 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.550
 good and we finished the game and that's 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.990
 here change this is the trick more than a 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.520
 Trick is a tip because it's not a 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.990
 trick neither clips nor anything the only thing 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.430
 we do is so that the flag does not 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.550
 I can 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.140
 will put back 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.670
 and well I hope you liked this 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.500
 video to see if we get to have you with 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.180
 this trick to practice and I've 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.430
 Done enough tips to practice 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.810
 with the sniper and as I said 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.280
 I hope you enjoyed a single 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.600
 everyone and see you in the next video 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.600
