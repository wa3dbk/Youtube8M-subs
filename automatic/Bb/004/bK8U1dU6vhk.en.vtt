 a teaspoon of mashed peppers 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.390
 the golden agglo of rock is that one 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.400
 discover all the ingredients before 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.780
 start the recipe for the simple and 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.850
 very good reason that these are cooking 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.470
 very quickly and that we should not 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.689
 they are overcooked by the time 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.400
 we cut out the others so we can not 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.020
 all the ingredients and once that 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.820
 everything is ready we can start 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.020
 cooking all the ingredients are 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.700
 cut into pieces 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.930
 I only have one thing left to 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.000
 prepare that was not done yet 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.170
 this is the omelet so prepare a 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.340
 very thin omelette that I will not have 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.340
 only cut into thin slices 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.189
 we are looking to have a good omelette 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.479
 fine so be you cooked in a big 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.929
 stove is different from oneself in a 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.929
 small 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.200
 the let and thighs frozen folded in three on 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.770
 herself and I will now cut 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.770
 thin slices 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.000
 all you have to do is cook 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.970
 pasta so we take a large volume 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.260
 salted boiling water and after we follow 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.820
 the indications on the ferry and so me 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.950
 it's 5 to 7 minutes in boiling water 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.430
 and then I kidneys under the water 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.470
 cold 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.820
 and then I make them wait with the 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.600
 other ingredients before entering 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:17.270
 track of a look the noodles are ready 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.820
 and I 'm going to be the goat 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.130
 heated and I'm going to prepare the little 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.380
 sauce by mixing the chili paste 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.680
 the quickest like that with the 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.310
 oyster sauce and soy sauce like that 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.310
 there will be more than 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.290
 I heat the oil in the euro 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.540
 is then I'm going to add the 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.860
 lemongrass shallots and the 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.989
 ginger I come back for 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.940
 about 3 4 minutes to fire knew a game 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.120
 bright and then I add the rest of the 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.610
 vegetables except the scallion and I also put 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.799
 the tofu the principle is to add the 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.120
 vegetables as a sign of 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.379
 their cooking time so the vegetables 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.420
 which takes the longest time to cook 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.780
 first like the carrot or the 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.780
 peppers 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.070
 and those who take less time to 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.500
 cook like peas for example 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:20.820
 greedy or soy bean sprouts 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:22.410
 last as the vegetables are cut 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.690
 a little bit more is that they 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.400
 cook quickly once 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.340
 they are cooked but still slightly 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:34.050
 crunchy we'll be able to add the 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:36.180
 paws the sauce and warm up all 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.220
 that in the wok on high heat 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.870
 who says we skip fried noodles 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.950
 so to blow them up a good train 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.600
 we do a little like pancakes 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.560
 we blew up like that a movement 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.810
 wrist so it's not a 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.520
 year t te am worth but that ceiling 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.040
 the idea if to make them really hot 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.410
 we just have to add 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.209
 omelette and chives to 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.260
 warm up a few moments and it will be 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.260
 good for the service 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.400
 fried noodles with vegetables are 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.350
 ready for gold and that it jumps to the table and 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.430
 if you love Chinese hero get 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:20.720
 also advise the chicken bone version 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:22.190
 it's also very good I give you 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.720

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.730
 new recipe and if you do not want 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.419
 miss it is beaune you h and black and 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:33.919
 let's click on the magazine 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:37.060
 the adjuster writes it and charles charras 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.060
 do not count the one doing the dishes 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:52.090
 it's you it's not that they can street 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:53.370
 Salines impossible to play tennis 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.420
 and especially that it's way too much 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.270
 and make me jump it's a little 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.350
 endpoint move to the houlala I 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.330
