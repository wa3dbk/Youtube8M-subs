got<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.910> bag<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.360> tortilla<00:00:51.510> chips<00:00:51.840> with<00:00:52.260> me

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
got a bag of tortilla chips with me

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.139

would<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:52.980> be<00:00:53.100> able<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.460> analyze<00:00:53.879> them<00:00:54.120> and

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
would you be able to analyze them and

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.299 
would you be able to analyze them and
would<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.690> make<00:00:54.840> any<00:00:55.050> sense<00:00:55.190> we<00:00:56.190> can

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
would that make any sense we can

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.279 
would that make any sense we can
definitely<00:00:56.550> do<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.780> makes<00:00:57.989> total

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
definitely do that and it makes total

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.340 
definitely do that and it makes total
sense<00:00:58.500> in<00:00:59.190> genetically<00:00:59.910> modified<00:01:00.449> maize<00:01:00.719> is

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
sense in genetically modified maize is

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.020 
sense in genetically modified maize is

a<00:01:07.290> closer<00:01:07.619> look<00:01:07.890> at<00:01:08.040> last<00:01:08.220> crisps<00:01:08.729> why<00:01:09.090> do<00:01:09.150> you

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
a closer look at last crisps why do you

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.630 
a closer look at last crisps why do you
have<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.630> do<00:01:09.750> these<00:01:09.930> analyses<00:01:10.400> well<00:01:11.400> there<00:01:11.610> are

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
have to do these analyses well there are

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.580 
have to do these analyses well there are

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
now see it clearly our sample really

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:52.529 
now see it clearly our sample really
does<00:04:51.069> contain<00:04:51.400> genetically<00:04:51.849> modified<00:04:52.300> maize

does contain genetically modified maize

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:54.360 
does contain genetically modified maize
well<00:04:53.139> let's<00:04:53.289> say<00:04:53.410> we<00:04:53.530> can<00:04:53.710> suppose<00:04:54.039> that<00:04:54.280> it

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
well let's say we can suppose that it

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.700 
well let's say we can suppose that it
does<00:04:54.580> our<00:04:55.240> control<00:04:55.630> experiment<00:04:56.229> genetically

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
does our control experiment genetically

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.650 
does our control experiment genetically
modified<00:04:57.099> maize<00:04:57.310> is<00:04:57.550> positive<00:04:58.000> as<00:04:58.150> we<00:04:58.300> expect

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
modified maize is positive as we expect

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.900 
modified maize is positive as we expect
but<00:04:59.169> the<00:04:59.289> same<00:04:59.440> fragment<00:04:59.889> has<00:05:00.009> also<00:05:00.370> formed<00:05:00.759> in

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
but the same fragment has also formed in

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.430 
but the same fragment has also formed in
our<00:05:00.970> sample<00:05:01.240> and<00:05:01.720> now<00:05:01.960> the<00:05:02.020> question<00:05:02.289> remains

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
our sample and now the question remains

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.290 
our sample and now the question remains
as<00:05:02.889> to<00:05:02.949> what<00:05:03.190> may<00:05:03.370> is<00:05:03.490> variety<00:05:03.759> this<00:05:04.090> is

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
as to what may is variety this is

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.150 
as to what may is variety this is
whether<00:05:05.020> it's<00:05:05.199> the<00:05:05.349> genetically<00:05:05.770> modified

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
whether it's the genetically modified

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.420 
whether it's the genetically modified

maize variety mon810 and how much of it
is<00:05:09.490> press<00:05:09.759> you<00:05:10.000> in<00:05:10.270> order<00:05:10.569> find<00:05:10.780> that<00:05:10.960> out<00:05:11.110> we

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
is press you in order find that out we

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:26.760 
is press you in order find that out we
need<00:05:11.680> real-time<00:05:11.919> pcr<00:05:25.110> we've<00:05:26.110> analyzed<00:05:26.530> the

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
need real-time pcr we've analyzed the

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.830 
need real-time pcr we've analyzed the
DNA<00:05:26.919> again<00:05:27.490> very<00:05:27.849> specifically<00:05:28.479> using

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
DNA again very specifically using

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.499 
DNA again very specifically using
real-time<00:05:29.199> pcr<00:05:30.300> according<00:05:31.300> to<00:05:31.330> the

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:31.509 
real-time pcr according to the

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:33.360 
real-time pcr according to the
fluorescence<00:05:32.110> that's<00:05:32.409> produced<00:05:32.830> during<00:05:33.190> the

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
fluorescence that's produced during the

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.850 
fluorescence that's produced during the
PCR<00:05:33.880> reaction<00:05:34.360> we<00:05:34.870> can<00:05:35.020> see<00:05:35.259> how<00:05:35.380> much<00:05:35.590> the

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
PCR reaction we can see how much the

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.950 
PCR reaction we can see how much the
genetically<00:05:36.430> modified<00:05:36.849> fragment<00:05:37.389> is<00:05:37.509> present

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
genetically modified fragment is present

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.439 
genetically modified fragment is present
and<00:05:38.259> also<00:05:38.740> from<00:05:39.310> which<00:05:39.490> may<00:05:39.729> is<00:05:39.789> variety<00:05:40.150> it

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:40.449 
and also from which may is variety it

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:43.260 
and also from which may is variety it
stems<00:05:40.979> do<00:05:41.979> these<00:05:42.130> results<00:05:42.580> already<00:05:42.699> tell<00:05:43.120> you

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
stems do these results already tell you

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.680 
stems do these results already tell you
which<00:05:43.449> variety<00:05:44.110> it<00:05:44.169> is<00:05:44.789> yes<00:05:45.789> we<00:05:46.240> tested

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
which variety it is yes we tested

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.740 
which variety it is yes we tested
specifically<00:05:47.380> for<00:05:47.590> mon<00:05:47.800> 810<00:05:48.400> a<00:05:49.060> variety

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
specifically for mon 810 a variety

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.450 
specifically for mon 810 a variety
that's<00:05:49.930> very<00:05:50.229> often<00:05:50.560> contained<00:05:51.009> in<00:05:51.219> food

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
that's very often contained in food

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.640 
that's very often contained in food
products<00:05:51.880> and<00:05:52.509> we<00:05:52.599> did<00:05:52.750> actually<00:05:52.900> detect<00:05:53.469> it

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
products and we did actually detect it

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.800 
products and we did actually detect it
here<00:05:53.919> too<00:05:54.190> but<00:05:54.849> it<00:05:54.969> looks<00:05:55.120> like<00:05:55.210> it<00:05:55.509> was<00:05:55.599> only

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
here too but it looks like it was only

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.170 
here too but it looks like it was only
very<00:05:56.199> little<00:05:56.409> only<00:05:56.889> in<00:05:57.130> the<00:05:57.219> range<00:05:57.430> of<00:05:57.580> traces

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
very little only in the range of traces

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.379 
very little only in the range of traces
really<00:05:58.570> below<00:05:59.139> point<00:05:59.440> 1<00:05:59.650> percent<00:06:00.070> I<00:06:00.310> see<00:06:00.789> so

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:01.389 
really below point 1 percent I see so

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:03.060 
really below point 1 percent I see so
they<00:06:01.780> wouldn't<00:06:01.960> have<00:06:02.110> had<00:06:02.229> to<00:06:02.349> put<00:06:02.530> a<00:06:02.560> label<00:06:02.830> on

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
they wouldn't have had to put a label on

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.120 
they wouldn't have had to put a label on
my<00:06:03.219> bag<00:06:03.400> of<00:06:03.580> crisps<00:06:04.380> okay<00:06:05.380> thank<00:06:05.860> you<00:06:05.919> very

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
my bag of crisps okay thank you very

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.280 
my bag of crisps okay thank you very
much
