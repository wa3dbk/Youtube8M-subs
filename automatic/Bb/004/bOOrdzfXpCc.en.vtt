dynamic issues and all other ones you
might<00:03:29.030> expect<00:03:29.770> this<00:03:30.770> is<00:03:30.980> a<00:03:31.130> very<00:03:31.310> modern<00:03:31.880> car

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
might expect this is a very modern car

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.840 
might expect this is a very modern car
one<00:03:32.870> that<00:03:33.020> aluminium<00:03:33.280> derivative<00:03:34.280> are<00:03:34.460> very

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
one that aluminium derivative are very

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.240 
one that aluminium derivative are very
stiff<00:03:35.210> well<00:03:35.510> with<00:03:35.780> their<00:03:36.080> fragility<00:03:36.290> issues

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
stiff well with their fragility issues

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.820 
stiff well with their fragility issues
and<00:03:37.580> it<00:03:38.210> has<00:03:38.420> that<00:03:38.900> we're<00:03:39.110> going<00:03:39.320> to<00:03:39.410> the<00:03:39.560> front

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
and it has that we're going to the front

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.770 
and it has that we're going to the front
and<00:03:40.070> it<00:03:40.250> has<00:03:40.400> that<00:03:41.000> which<00:03:41.180> went<00:03:41.420> to<00:03:41.450> the<00:03:41.570> back

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
and it has that which went to the back

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.260 
and it has that which went to the back
so<00:03:41.990> it<00:03:42.080> has<00:03:42.260> the<00:03:42.590> Optimus<00:03:43.130> pension<00:03:43.760> for<00:03:44.060> a<00:03:44.090> race

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
so it has the Optimus pension for a race

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.800 
so it has the Optimus pension for a race

you<00:03:48.290> can<00:03:48.470> take<00:03:48.680> it<00:03:48.709> to<00:03:48.860> the<00:03:48.950> track<00:03:49.099> as<00:03:49.430> they're

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
you can take it to the track as they're

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.270 
you can take it to the track as they're
doing<00:03:49.849> gt3<00:03:50.330> and<00:03:50.420> do<00:03:50.540> very<00:03:50.750> well<00:03:50.810> in<00:03:51.080> it<00:03:51.200> but<00:03:52.160> it

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
doing gt3 and do very well in it but it

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.960 
doing gt3 and do very well in it but it
means<00:03:52.459> it's<00:03:52.610> a<00:03:52.670> bit<00:03:52.819> compromised<00:03:53.239> on<00:03:53.450> the

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
means it's a bit compromised on the

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.190 
means it's a bit compromised on the
haven't<00:03:54.240> got<00:03:54.360> much<00:03:54.510> special<00:03:54.990> travel

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
haven't got much special travel

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.050 
haven't got much special travel
therefore<00:03:55.770> I've<00:03:55.860> got<00:03:56.010> pointed<00:03:56.430> busy<00:03:56.820> ride

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
therefore I've got pointed busy ride

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.210 
therefore I've got pointed busy ride
although<00:03:57.600> it<00:03:57.720> does<00:03:57.870> smooth<00:03:58.170> at<00:03:58.380> that<00:03:58.650> speed<00:03:58.950> so

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
although it does smooth at that speed so

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.890 
although it does smooth at that speed so
better<00:03:59.640> going<00:03:59.880> faster<00:04:00.330> than<00:04:00.450> going<00:04:00.570> slow

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
better going faster than going slow

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.810 
better going faster than going slow
which<00:04:01.320> is<00:04:01.350> good<00:04:01.620> because<00:04:01.830> as<00:04:02.160> you<00:04:02.250> said<00:04:02.460> it

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
which is good because as you said it

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.130
