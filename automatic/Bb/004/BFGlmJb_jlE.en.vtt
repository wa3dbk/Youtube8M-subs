00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
prestige because I used it a lot but

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.359 
prestige because I used it a lot but

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
overall this gun is pretty good it's a

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.890 
overall this gun is pretty good it's a
lot<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.609> people's<00:00:20.910> favorite<00:00:21.330> i<00:00:21.420> remember<00:00:21.779> in

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
lot of people's favorite i remember in

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.359 
lot of people's favorite i remember in
call<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.109> duty<00:00:22.199> for<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.590> lot<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.740> people<00:00:22.859> used<00:00:23.220> it

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
call of duty for a lot of people used it

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.560 
call of duty for a lot of people used it
there<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:24.150> in<00:00:24.750> modern<00:00:25.109> warfare<00:00:25.140> 2<00:00:25.529> also<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.250> i

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
there is a in modern warfare 2 also so i

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.200 
there is a in modern warfare 2 also so i
think<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:28.109> mp5k<00:00:28.590> which<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.160> make<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.820> different

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
think the mp5k which is make a different

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.250 
think the mp5k which is make a different
version<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.689> or<00:00:30.810> something<00:00:31.109> like<00:00:31.199> that

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
version of it or something like that

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.709 
version of it or something like that
probably<00:00:31.650> not<00:00:32.460> quite<00:00:32.640> sure<00:00:32.759> was<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.270> black<00:00:33.480> ops

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
probably not quite sure was in black ops

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.680 
probably not quite sure was in black ops
as<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.020> guys<00:00:34.170> know<00:00:34.200> but<00:00:34.950> uh<00:00:34.980> it's<00:00:35.520> not<00:00:35.880> as<00:00:36.180> i

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
as you guys know but uh it's not as i

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.569 
as you guys know but uh it's not as i
find<00:00:37.140> in<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.410> game<00:00:37.559> it's<00:00:37.770> not<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.129> same<00:00:38.370> as

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
find in this game it's not the same as

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.760 
find in this game it's not the same as
like<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.879> call<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.090> duty<00:00:39.120> for<00:00:39.480> one<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> lot

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
like the call of duty for one that a lot

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.560 
like the call of duty for one that a lot
of<00:00:40.890> people<00:00:40.980> used<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.520> stuff<00:00:41.730> like<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:41.910> if

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
of people used and stuff like that if

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.270 
of people used and stuff like that if
they<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.530> know<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.649> lot<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:43.890> people<00:00:43.980> were

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
they you know a lot of people were

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.000 
they you know a lot of people were
excited<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:45.480> see<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.320> gun<00:00:46.530> coming<00:00:46.829> back

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
excited to see this gun coming back

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.470 
excited to see this gun coming back
because<00:00:47.190> they<00:00:47.670> thought<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.030> would<00:00:48.180> be<00:00:48.300> like

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
because they thought it would be like

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.299 
because they thought it would be like
the<00:00:48.780> call<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.260> duty<00:00:49.440> for<00:00:49.620> one<00:00:49.829> which<00:00:50.010> i<00:00:50.160> really

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
the call of duty for one which i really

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.150 
the call of duty for one which i really
like<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.789> but<00:00:51.719> overall<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.320> think<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.739> weapons

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
like to but overall I think this weapons

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.040 
like to but overall I think this weapons
pretty<00:00:53.370> good<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.760> only<00:00:54.090> downside<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.600> think

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
pretty good the only downside I think

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.840 
pretty good the only downside I think
there<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.920> amount<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.640> recoil

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
there is to it is the amount of recoil

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.720 
there is to it is the amount of recoil
it<00:00:57.210> has<00:00:57.329> sometimes<00:00:58.070> you<00:00:59.070> don't<00:00:59.160> really<00:00:59.340> see<00:00:59.609> it

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
it has sometimes you don't really see it

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.330 
it has sometimes you don't really see it
that<00:00:59.760> much<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.510> game<00:01:00.719> play<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.710> find<00:01:02.219> that

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
that much in this game play I find that

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.579 
that much in this game play I find that
with<00:01:02.699> my<00:01:02.850> wii<00:01:03.120> remote<00:01:03.420> settings<00:01:03.840> um<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.500> don't

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
with my wii remote settings um you don't

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.640 
with my wii remote settings um you don't
see<00:01:04.860> recoil<00:01:05.339> nearly<00:01:05.729> as<00:01:05.820> much<00:01:06.000> as<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.450> would

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
see recoil nearly as much as you would

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.140 
see recoil nearly as much as you would
say<00:01:07.650> if<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.860> were<00:01:07.890> using<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.369> classic<00:01:08.670> controller

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
say if I were using a classic controller

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.390 
say if I were using a classic controller
and<00:01:09.360> stuff<00:01:09.540> like<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.860> but<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.159> know<00:01:11.189> you

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
and stuff like that but you know you

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.350 
and stuff like that but you know you
still<00:01:11.700> see<00:01:11.880> some<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.510> know<00:01:12.540> like<00:01:14.150> spots<00:01:15.150> where

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
still see some you know like spots where

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.969 
still see some you know like spots where
I<00:01:15.390> where<00:01:15.930> I'm<00:01:16.020> shooting<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:16.710> there's<00:01:16.920> a

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
I where I'm shooting in it so there's a

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.770 
I where I'm shooting in it so there's a
lot<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.189> recoil<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.820> it's<00:01:18.330> hard<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.509> pick<00:01:18.659> off

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
lot of recoil and it's hard to pick off

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.420 
lot of recoil and it's hard to pick off
enemies<00:01:18.960> at<00:01:19.259> long<00:01:19.439> range<00:01:19.680> but<00:01:19.890> here<00:01:20.130> I'm<00:01:20.280> using

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
enemies at long range but here I'm using

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.539 
enemies at long range but here I'm using
the<00:01:21.020> attachments<00:01:22.020> proficiency<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.650> think<00:01:22.950> with

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
the attachments proficiency I think with

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.600 
the attachments proficiency I think with
rapid<00:01:23.970> fire<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.650> extended<00:01:25.650> mags<00:01:25.830> now<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.430> use

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
rapid fire and extended mags now I use

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.690 
rapid fire and extended mags now I use
rapid<00:01:27.000> fire<00:01:27.710> obviously<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:29.070> get<00:01:29.189> more<00:01:29.310> damage

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
rapid fire obviously to get more damage

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.310 
rapid fire obviously to get more damage
out<00:01:29.850> per<00:01:30.000> second<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.390> stuff<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.780> but<00:01:31.110> I

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
out per second and stuff like that but I

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.710 
out per second and stuff like that but I
also<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.310> put<00:01:32.490> on<00:01:32.579> an<00:01:32.700> extended<00:01:32.970> mags<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:33.540> it's

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
also you put on an extended mags so it's

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.090 
also you put on an extended mags so it's
a<00:01:33.780> pretty<00:01:33.900> good<00:01:34.110> combination<00:01:34.439> if<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.890> guys

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
a pretty good combination if you guys
