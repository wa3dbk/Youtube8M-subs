00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.279

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:19.979

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.160
 fantastic world and Japanese to help 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.000
 a bit of experience and direct and with 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:32.759
 people with sake yokohama know that 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.860
 yes I had a slight consider myself a 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.619
 moment how it went I call it really 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.780
 ten seconds that lets you eat a 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.970
 zero on the beach I asked for 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.060
 Japanese to make a force we see that 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.850
 when they drink a little they are more open than 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.009
 normal and they invited me and ii 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.450
 grill to make barbecue with them 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.789
 knows that the only extra but always the 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.470
 glass for the nice experience 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.850
 the fun experience not me 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.250
 I expected it because I usually am a lot 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:04.210
 so it's yes though when I drink I don't drop 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.720
 after drop go as how it is the 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.270
