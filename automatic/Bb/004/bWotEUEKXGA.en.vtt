and just for the heck of it I plugged my

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.870 
and just for the heck of it I plugged my
analog<00:04:21.470> synth<00:04:21.800> this<00:04:21.980> is<00:04:22.160> the<00:04:22.310> korg<00:04:22.550> mono/poly

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
analog synth this is the korg mono/poly

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.620 
analog synth this is the korg mono/poly
plugged<00:04:23.750> it<00:04:23.870> into<00:04:24.020> the<00:04:24.320> iRig<00:04:24.970> it's<00:04:25.970> not<00:04:26.240> quite

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
plugged it into the iRig it's not quite

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.390 
plugged it into the iRig it's not quite
the<00:04:26.780> right<00:04:26.960> impedance<00:04:27.560> it's<00:04:27.770> not<00:04:27.950> a<00:04:27.980> high<00:04:28.130> Z

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
the right impedance it's not a high Z

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.300 
the right impedance it's not a high Z
output<00:04:28.880> but<00:04:29.030> hey<00:04:29.350> I'm<00:04:30.350> gonna<00:04:30.470> go<00:04:30.650> for<00:04:30.860> it<00:04:30.950> let's

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
output but hey I'm gonna go for it let's

00:04:31.310 --> 00:05:01.770 
output but hey I'm gonna go for it let's
make<00:04:31.550> some<00:04:31.730> noise

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:27.200 

here's<00:05:02.780> the<00:05:03.020> wah-wah<00:05:03.620> pedal<00:05:04.130> on<00:05:04.340> analog<00:05:04.970> synth

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.690 

you<00:05:28.210> see<00:05:28.480> a<00:05:28.590> distortion<00:05:29.590> pedal<00:05:29.890> on<00:05:30.070> analog

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 
you see a distortion pedal on analog

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.060 
you see a distortion pedal on analog
