it let me show you in Photoshop I
highlight<00:01:59.270> at<00:01:59.420> the<00:01:59.509> area<00:01:59.899> with<00:02:00.619> the

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
highlight at the area with the

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.849 
highlight at the area with the
desaturation<00:02:01.729> tool<00:02:02.179> and<00:02:02.450> it's<00:02:02.990> amazing

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:03.859 
desaturation tool and it's amazing

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:05.499 
desaturation tool and it's amazing
because<00:02:04.130> when<00:02:04.549> they<00:02:04.640> make<00:02:04.819> everything<00:02:05.000> one

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
because when they make everything one

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.539 
because when they make everything one
color<00:02:06.610> it<00:02:08.080> just<00:02:09.080> makes<00:02:09.379> everything<00:02:09.560> full<00:02:10.160> flap

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:10.549

color it just makes everything full flap
there's<00:02:11.360> no<00:02:11.480> 3d<00:02:11.959> effect<00:02:12.470> so<00:02:13.400> let's<00:02:13.730> take<00:02:13.910> a

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
there's no 3d effect so let's take a

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.920 
there's no 3d effect so let's take a
look<00:02:14.269> in<00:02:14.510> Adobe<00:02:16.120> now<00:02:17.120> you<00:02:17.180> can<00:02:17.540> see<00:02:17.720> what<00:02:17.840> I'm

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
look in Adobe now you can see what I'm

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.280 
look in Adobe now you can see what I'm
talking<00:02:17.959> about<00:02:19.390> see<00:02:20.390> how<00:02:20.480> this<00:02:20.660> stuff<00:02:20.870> starts

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
talking about see how this stuff starts

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.910 
talking about see how this stuff starts
to<00:02:21.379> get<00:02:21.470> a<00:02:21.530> 3d<00:02:21.950> effect<00:02:22.810> just<00:02:23.810> would<00:02:24.049> like<00:02:24.410> basic

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
to get a 3d effect just would like basic

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.860 
to get a 3d effect just would like basic
gray<00:02:25.220> and<00:02:25.610> you<00:02:26.030> know<00:02:26.120> different<00:02:26.390> shades<00:02:26.750> of

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
gray and you know different shades of

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.650 
gray and you know different shades of
gray

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
gray

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:40.600

see<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.410> statute

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.400 

you<00:02:40.940> could<00:02:41.150> see<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.480> eye<00:02:41.740> pupil<00:02:44.020> you<00:02:45.020> see<00:02:45.230> them

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
you could see the eye pupil you see them

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.980 
you could see the eye pupil you see them
the<00:02:45.620> nose<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.190> contour<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.700> mouth<00:02:47.060> they<00:02:47.660> carve

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
the nose the contour to mouth they carve

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.110 
the nose the contour to mouth they carve
something<00:02:48.320> in<00:02:48.530> here<00:02:48.890> I<00:02:49.160> guess<00:02:49.460> to<00:02:49.610> represent

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
something in here I guess to represent

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.440 
something in here I guess to represent
cheeks<00:02:51.610> see<00:02:52.610> there's<00:02:52.790> something<00:02:53.240> back<00:02:53.420> here

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
cheeks see there's something back here
