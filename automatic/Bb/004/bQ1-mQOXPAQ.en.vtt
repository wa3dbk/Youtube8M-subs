what-have-you this particular boat has a
compass<00:00:33.100> recess<00:00:33.519> here<00:00:33.789> so<00:00:34.030> typically<00:00:34.780> we

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
compass recess here so typically we

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:37.139 
compass recess here so typically we
would<00:00:35.140> have<00:00:35.289> a<00:00:35.320> compass<00:00:35.739> here<00:00:36.070> to<00:00:36.699> help<00:00:36.879> guide

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
would have a compass here to help guide

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.189 
would have a compass here to help guide
us<00:00:37.649> we<00:00:38.649> have<00:00:38.859> deck<00:00:39.399> bungees<00:00:39.640> here<00:00:40.149> and<00:00:40.329> here

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
us we have deck bungees here and here

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.520 
us we have deck bungees here and here
and<00:00:41.350> these<00:00:42.309> deck<00:00:42.609> bungees<00:00:42.850> are<00:00:43.570> to<00:00:44.079> help<00:00:44.289> hold

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
and these deck bungees are to help hold

really<00:00:52.719> robust<00:00:53.229> hatch<00:00:53.589> covers<00:00:56.460> built<00:00:57.460> to<00:00:57.640> take

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 
really robust hatch covers built to take

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:00.180 
really robust hatch covers built to take
a<00:00:57.850> beating<00:00:57.940> built<00:00:58.569> to<00:00:58.690> be<00:00:58.809> immersed<00:00:59.260> a<00:00:59.409> lot<00:00:59.589> so

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
a beating built to be immersed a lot so

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.709 
a beating built to be immersed a lot so
if<00:01:00.249> he<00:01:00.370> wants<00:01:00.609> to<00:01:00.699> go<00:01:00.789> out<00:01:00.850> and<00:01:01.089> roll<00:01:01.269> his<00:01:01.510> boat

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
if he wants to go out and roll his boat

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.590 
if he wants to go out and roll his boat
all<00:01:01.929> afternoon<00:01:02.469> this<00:01:03.159> is<00:01:03.460> gonna<00:01:03.819> stay<00:01:04.089> dry<00:01:04.390> in

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
all afternoon this is gonna stay dry in

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.679 
all afternoon this is gonna stay dry in
here<00:01:05.340> again<00:01:06.340> we<00:01:06.490> have<00:01:06.520> deck<00:01:07.000> bungees<00:01:07.240> on<00:01:07.570> the

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:07.689 
here again we have deck bungees on the

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:10.080 
here again we have deck bungees on the
bow<00:01:07.899> so<00:01:08.530> you've<00:01:08.680> got<00:01:08.920> storage<00:01:09.670> under<00:01:10.060> here

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
bow so you've got storage under here

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.630 
bow so you've got storage under here
typically<00:01:10.780> would<00:01:10.899> be<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:11.290> chart<00:01:11.590> chart<00:01:12.430> room

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
typically would be the chart chart room

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.090 
typically would be the chart chart room
so<00:01:12.909> they'd<00:01:13.000> have<00:01:13.030> charts<00:01:13.450> here<00:01:14.100> smaller

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
so they'd have charts here smaller

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.480 
so they'd have charts here smaller
cockpit<00:01:15.729> very<00:01:16.030> form-fitting<00:01:17.219> easier<00:01:18.219> to<00:01:18.340> put

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
cockpit very form-fitting easier to put

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.510 
cockpit very form-fitting easier to put
a<00:01:18.520> skirt<00:01:18.880> on<00:01:19.060> quickly<00:01:19.539> and<00:01:20.140> then<00:01:20.799> on<00:01:21.039> the<00:01:21.250> side

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
a skirt on quickly and then on the side

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:28.440 
a skirt on quickly and then on the side
here<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:25.090> is<00:01:25.390> a<00:01:25.780> skeg<00:01:26.560> control<00:01:27.460> so<00:01:27.909> we'll<00:01:28.270> get

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
here this is a skeg control so we'll get

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.819 
here this is a skeg control so we'll get
to<00:01:28.570> the<00:01:28.659> sched<00:01:28.930> in<00:01:29.049> a<00:01:29.109> minute<00:01:29.350> it's<00:01:29.469> basically

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
to the sched in a minute it's basically

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.679 
to the sched in a minute it's basically
a<00:01:29.950> fin<00:01:30.250> that<00:01:30.460> drops<00:01:30.729> down<00:01:30.850> out<00:01:31.270> of<00:01:31.359> the<00:01:31.450> stern

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
a fin that drops down out of the stern

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:33.060 
a fin that drops down out of the stern
to<00:01:31.840> help<00:01:31.990> you<00:01:32.109> track<00:01:32.380> straight<00:01:32.680> in<00:01:32.799> the<00:01:32.890> wind

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
to help you track straight in the wind

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.980 
to help you track straight in the wind
and<00:01:33.280> if<00:01:33.789> he<00:01:33.880> wanted<00:01:34.149> to<00:01:34.240> engage<00:01:34.359> it<00:01:34.719> he<00:01:34.840> would

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
and if he wanted to engage it he would

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.310 
and if he wanted to engage it he would
slide<00:01:35.259> this<00:01:35.289> back<00:01:35.710> and<00:01:36.539> then<00:01:37.539> to<00:01:37.719> disengage<00:01:38.289> it

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
slide this back and then to disengage it

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.120 
slide this back and then to disengage it
slide<00:01:38.710> it<00:01:38.859> forward<00:01:39.039> okay<00:01:39.630> five<00:01:40.630> braces<00:01:41.170> and<00:01:41.380> on

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
slide it forward okay five braces and on

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.160 
slide it forward okay five braces and on
these<00:01:42.340> type<00:01:42.640> boats<00:01:42.939> you're<00:01:43.840> not<00:01:43.990> really

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
these type boats you're not really

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.450 
these type boats you're not really
sitting<00:01:44.619> in<00:01:44.740> them<00:01:44.890> so<00:01:45.070> much<00:01:45.250> like<00:01:45.429> a

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
sitting in them so much like a

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.580 
sitting in them so much like a
recreational<00:01:46.090> boat<00:01:46.149> their<00:01:46.899> little<00:01:47.109> snugger

recreational boat their little snugger

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.830 
recreational boat their little snugger
fit<00:01:47.619> so<00:01:48.490> when<00:01:48.700> he<00:01:48.820> lifts<00:01:49.119> his<00:01:49.270> leg<00:01:49.299> the<00:01:49.689> boat

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
fit so when he lifts his leg the boat

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.630 
fit so when he lifts his leg the boat
responds<00:01:50.350> these<00:01:50.710> boats<00:01:50.950> are<00:01:51.130> much<00:01:51.399> more

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
responds these boats are much more

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.130 
responds these boats are much more
responsive<00:01:52.270> than<00:01:52.299> anything<00:01:52.630> else<00:01:52.899> that<00:01:52.990> was

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
responsive than anything else that was

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.929 
responsive than anything else that was
looked<00:01:53.380> at<00:01:53.530> today<00:01:53.710> and<00:01:54.100> that's<00:01:54.520> what<00:01:54.670> you<00:01:54.789> want
