that<00:00:14.130> out<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.700> made<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.360> prediction<00:00:15.630> video<00:00:16.199> and

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
that out I made a prediction video and

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.609 
that out I made a prediction video and
every<00:00:17.490> single<00:00:17.880> one<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.270> my<00:00:18.420> predictions<00:00:19.199> came

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
every single one of my predictions came

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.890 
every single one of my predictions came
true<00:00:19.680> watch<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:20.760> eight-minute<00:00:21.240> video<00:00:21.420> and

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
true watch that eight-minute video and

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.769 
true watch that eight-minute video and
tell<00:00:22.470> me<00:00:22.710> where<00:00:22.949> in<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.160> hell<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.820> said

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
tell me where in the hell I said

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.050 
tell me where in the hell I said
anything<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:25.650> was<00:00:25.769> incorrect<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.580> still

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
anything that was incorrect I still

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.970 
anything that was incorrect I still
think<00:00:27.359> we<00:00:27.480> need<00:00:27.510> some<00:00:27.869> perimeter<00:00:28.380> shooting<00:00:28.710> I

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
think we need some perimeter shooting I

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.999 
think we need some perimeter shooting I
really<00:00:29.970> do<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.390> think<00:00:30.900> we<00:00:31.050> need<00:00:31.199> some<00:00:31.439> perimeter

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
really do I think we need some perimeter

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.709 
really do I think we need some perimeter
shooting<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.520> don't<00:00:33.000> think<00:00:33.180> this<00:00:33.300> team<00:00:33.510> has

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
shooting I don't think this team has

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.840 
shooting I don't think this team has
enough<00:00:33.930> perimeter<00:00:34.739> shooting<00:00:34.980> because<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.730> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
enough perimeter shooting because of the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.680 
enough perimeter shooting because of the
loss<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.440> Rashad<00:00:37.440> Lewis<00:00:37.520> Ray<00:00:38.520> Allen<00:00:39.000> James

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
loss of Rashad Lewis Ray Allen James

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.660 
loss of Rashad Lewis Ray Allen James
Jones<00:00:40.079> we<00:00:40.410> need<00:00:40.620> some<00:00:40.890> more<00:00:41.100> perimeter

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
Jones we need some more perimeter

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.130 
Jones we need some more perimeter
shooting<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.180> has<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.629> come<00:00:42.660> from<00:00:43.050> somewhere

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
shooting it has to come from somewhere

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.790 
shooting it has to come from somewhere

carry it so let's look at these numbers
real<00:01:00.120> quick<00:01:00.420> um<00:01:00.680> we've<00:01:01.680> got<00:01:01.859> 26<00:01:02.489> from<00:01:02.699> Bosh

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
real quick um we've got 26 from Bosh
