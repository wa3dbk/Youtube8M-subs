00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:13.259
 all for your johnny and today on my 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.120
 video you can review the composition yes 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.260
 just like that today i will review 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.279
 composition actually composition 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.080
 I will say enough for an amateur 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.840
 the composition consists purely of bronze 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.850
 players but these bronze players are just 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:36.690
 killers and let's take a look at it 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:40.410
 here it is these bronze killers and so on 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:46.020
 the gate is our canon jerek 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:50.280
 hook is very difficult the last name of this than he 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:54.120
 wears absolutely everything at outputs 11 he 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.890
 plays madly that is, he is about well, not 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.600
 misses about 90 percent of swords 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.120
 There are of course shoals like any 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.229
 goalkeeper but he sharpens most swords 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.619
 It is very cool 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:11.400
 Immediately I tell you the composition of the smile by the hand 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.979
 but he is not entirely cn logical of course but I 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.600
 earned money and actually finished 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:22.470
 so he became so in defense we stand 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.409
 also two italian Koreans and his partner 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.250
 team huang year eat 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:35.880
 these guys are just killers honest 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:39.689
 look 78 for pace 59 protection is not it 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.380
 and statistics statistics there are all 90 he 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:46.310
 not about his unreal body 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:51.450
 second 76 soon due to 59 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:55.920
 this brek they body repel 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.610
 catch up with anyone don't believe the statistics and 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:07.619
 the guys on the left flank we have two 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:08.450
 dude from mls man salt and both cop these 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.860
 the guys 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:16.940
 really tear the left curb mans he 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.000
 although essentially left back but he has 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:24.560
 tm83 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.019
 physics 64 introduction 61 he is gorgeous 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.360
 helps on the brow actually his 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:36.590
 partner and you're a cop from ages tm83 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:39.769
 introduction 67 it's just unrealistic they 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.830
 such transfers are done from the flank 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:45.380
 it's just not realistic and so moving on to 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.319
 right brow on the right brow here 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:52.959
 are logan and his teammate 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:58.730
 also manakana manat let's start with the Molokans and 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:03:02.180
 89 temp 65 introductions this is not real 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.849
 dude he just runs over the brow and 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:11.900
 affairs pushes away the case goes unreal 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:16.489
 transfer also logan 81 ps 65 vision 62 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.549
 protection 61 physics but also just statistics 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.109
 speaks for itself unreal drive 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:24.880
 so go to the central pause 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:27.769
 I have enough dates 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.700
 how do you say outside the box because 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.389
 here these dudes of constants central 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.030
 midfielder 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:38.450
 washing midfielder may pai 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.069
 they are both forward in essence but they are redistributed and 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:45.609
 I will say for good reason 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:49.630
 May share 85 pace introduction 7 st1 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:52.670
 also beats from afar chic 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.829
 the transmissions are perfect the truth is he more 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.880
 transfer to do on the box to him 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:04:01.250
 Well, I do not know very good transmission 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.690
 on short distance 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.880
 it is not very just the same constant 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.870
 perfect transmission 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:13.440
 distant ie from afar he can hang 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.799
 transfer to make a gorgeous 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.560
 79 pace all 9 blows all those visions 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:24.120
 hit him of course so-so statistics 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:27.030
 I think it will leave but here it is otherwise 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.980
 only with decreases his stats and so 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.960
 move to the next center 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:36.930
 midfielder this one is dream about 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:41.160
 god what they tell you 76 pace 68 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.000
 Introduction 7 old man physics 64 protection and groove 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.270
 and 63 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.630
 this dude is just a universal player 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.520
 he beats well and smart transfer 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:54.570
 chic pace so he also come back 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:57.720
 in defense against embarrassing he destroys so 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:01.700
 say top attack very chic 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:07.950
 the ground and on sharper we stand cheers 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:14.250
 carpet 90 tempo written strikes 61 lies 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:18.000
 lie full blows on 90 introduction under 90 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:20.540
 Well, really he has a minus is fizuhu 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.070
 weakly that is it can 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:26.550
 Well, actually here's such 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:29.910
 team we get to play matches i 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:32.280
 I probably won't have it because I have 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.140
 unfortunately important things now too i am not 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.480
 I have time to sit down 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.630
 write a video especially for you but 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:42.300
 so here is such a team 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:44.430
 really there is quite expensive 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:48.450
 players who for example should be 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:51.270
 and here instead of both koba stand partner 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.790
 the team here is a woman salt but he stands 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.040
 6000 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.569
 coins that I could not buy it but here 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.569
 this a backup he 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:02.069
 but the angle is not much better but 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:04.860
 at least he doesn't deliver 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:07.349
 so here is such a team to collect 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.990
 players play try leave 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:12.199
 comments with you was john not everyone yet 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.199
 until
