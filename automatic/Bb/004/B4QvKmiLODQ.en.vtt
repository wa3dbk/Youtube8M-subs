everything<00:02:10.989> that<00:02:11.019> but<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:11.799> kids<00:02:12.010> do<00:02:12.370> that<00:02:12.580> I

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
everything that but the kids do that I

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.900 
everything that but the kids do that I
can<00:02:12.879> do<00:02:13.030> so<00:02:13.840> would<00:02:14.260> make<00:02:14.470> accommodations

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
can do so would make accommodations

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.130 
can do so would make accommodations

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
every time they come to class I believe

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.960 
every time they come to class I believe
that<00:02:17.170> I<00:02:17.319> learned<00:02:17.620> something<00:02:17.890> new<00:02:18.069> by<00:02:18.670> teaching

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
nailed it he did really really well and

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.830 
nailed it he did really really well and
since<00:02:42.099> then<00:02:42.340> that's<00:02:42.519> carried<00:02:42.940> on<00:02:43.150> into<00:02:43.510> his

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
since then that's carried on into his

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.720

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
factors where he is now a little bit

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.069 
factors where he is now a little bit
more<00:02:48.430> courageous<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:49.150> trying<00:02:49.420> things<00:02:49.690> first

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
more courageous and trying things first

more courageous and trying things first
it<00:02:50.349> was<00:02:50.500> really<00:02:50.799> nice<00:02:50.920> that<00:02:50.980> you<00:02:51.280> could<00:02:51.549> try<00:02:51.970> it

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
it was really nice that you could try it

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.490 
it was really nice that you could try it
and<00:02:52.360> just<00:02:52.480> see<00:02:52.660> if<00:02:52.690> it<00:02:52.900> was<00:02:52.989> something<00:02:53.170> that<00:02:53.319> he

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
and just see if it was something that he

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.470 
and just see if it was something that he
was<00:02:53.650> going<00:02:53.739> to<00:02:53.799> be<00:02:53.920> interested<00:02:54.400> in<00:02:54.519> once<00:02:55.090> you

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
was going to be interested in once you

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.240 
was going to be interested in once you
know<00:02:55.600> he<00:02:55.780> tried<00:02:55.930> it<00:02:56.170> was<00:02:56.410> you<00:02:56.980> know<00:02:57.010> no

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
know he tried it was you know no

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.979 
know he tried it was you know no
question<00:02:57.670> that<00:02:57.700> it<00:02:58.150> was<00:02:58.299> where<00:02:58.569> we<00:02:58.660> wanted<00:02:58.930> to

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
question that it was where we wanted to

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:05.000 
question that it was where we wanted to
be

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.040
