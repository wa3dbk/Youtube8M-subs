00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 what are youtube wave are guys but that 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.140
 are very good, I bring you a way 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.510
 more for minecraft and 0.9 point 5 in ios 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.820
 and as you can see is the mold is minimal 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.420
 of bending over how good is not a way that 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.470
 well it's not so that it will be the best 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.640
 but good and every way that is 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.369
 calendar is the truth is that it is 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.890
 shocking because then it is difficult for 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.269
 there are motorcycles in majors and good because already 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.920
 is working on this as I told you already 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.109
 it is possible through creating much more in 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.750
 kraft and in majors and in fact they are 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.309
 working on your mind the guys that in 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.140
 When I leave, I will bring them the channel 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.460
 but now I found this mode is it 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.059
 or who's good if they do not know that this 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.730
 is a inkin is stooping and as I started or 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.250
 good as crouching is going to be shift 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.370
 this works perfectly like eating 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.399
 here I put on servers to 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.260
 the beautiful skies greetings to the droid that 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.300
 he says mentioning there and good as 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.280
 see here I am and here I have up to my 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.219
 left as you can see two buttons 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.040
 what is the sneak mode and what does it say and 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.290
 neck please, good if we press the 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.990
 of cinema as you can see I crouched 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.850
 He puts my little monkey like that and for this 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.540
 serves is exactly for this for what 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.310
 which serves the sneak mod so you do not get 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.280
 fall at the time of being like that 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.950
 let's say that for example at first 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.140
 person let's say it 's good to see 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.979
 that is mentioning everything to me so that 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.360
 have when you are building 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.789
 they did a lot for when we're 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.250
 building this on platforms above 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:32.130
 because if you eliminate them for this purpose 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.509
 exactly for this for good you know 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.729
 that minecraft and to build towards 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.259
 It's like this because good is something that 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.289
 add to a minecraft and because there's no 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.090
 snake that would hold like this 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.850
 dare to say building like this because I do not know 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.700
 can otherwise without motorcycles because it is 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.429
 impossible to put you here good is almost 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.860
 impossible to put on you like I did and 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:54.450
 get you to build because picas things 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.130
 so that's how you can see 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.230
 but it 's very difficult that's why I 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.750
 they added this feature to minecraft and that 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.000
 is to build well this is exclusive of 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.360
 minecraft and for that is the sneak mod 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.840
 as soon as I activate it 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.930
 there is already I can put on the banks and 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.680
 can you get me to do this and good 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.990
 obviously the good thing about this is that here 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.360
 is the other button to undo it 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.190
 it can be and you can undo it and then 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.840
 works perfectly guys does not have 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.110
 no single fault plus those that look 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.700
 come ugly there the buttons but hey 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.400
 I hope that later they fix it or good 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.900
 truth is that great work but I do not 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.250
 I obviously do not complain because the 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.200
 true that it is a job I think very 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.430
 difficult is this but I think that 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.780
 we could talk a little aesthetically 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.270
 not so good we'll see what happens 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.280
 guys and will update air goals video 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.080
 but for the moment if we leave it with the mod 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.270
 of snake I hope you liked it 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.700
 to install it simply add the 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.980
 network because it's here in the description and 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.660
 they add the well write the good because 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.790
 I took it like five times they get to 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.100
 not being that I put more I swear them according to 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.230
 I put it well but it did not hold me 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.790
 spare are written exactly like me 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.230
 be like a description and you do not owe them 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.349
 to give no error 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.830
 and install the good package will install 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:11.269
 repo and nothing else fix the repo and 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.430
 there is one called smoking mode 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.690
 nothing else they give him what they open they give him to install 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.340
 and now I need the number of 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.379
 tutorials this because good is like 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.030
 all packages decide like this will be of 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:23.000
 that way you open it you give install 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.010
 Restart your device with a break 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.060
 so that it works and then then guys 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.370

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.840
