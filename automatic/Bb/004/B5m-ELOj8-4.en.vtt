00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.250 

yeah<00:00:16.379> well<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:17.279> course<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.960> big<00:00:18.960> puzzle

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
yeah well it is of course a big puzzle

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.380 
yeah well it is of course a big puzzle
that<00:00:21.560> mathematics<00:00:22.560> turns<00:00:22.890> out<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.400> be<00:00:23.430> so

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
that mathematics turns out to be so

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.080 
that mathematics turns out to be so
extraordinarily<00:00:25.230> powerful<00:00:25.920> in<00:00:26.519> explaining

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
extraordinarily powerful in explaining

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.110 
extraordinarily powerful in explaining
physics<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:28.880> we<00:00:29.880> have<00:00:30.090> all<00:00:30.269> these<00:00:32.120> examples

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
physics that we have all these examples

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.110 
physics that we have all these examples
of<00:00:33.600> like<00:00:34.050> Einstein's<00:00:34.680> general<00:00:35.010> relativity<00:00:35.219> or

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
of like Einstein's general relativity or

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.510 
of like Einstein's general relativity or
Serena's<00:00:37.010> wave<00:00:38.010> equation<00:00:38.640> where<00:00:40.100> just<00:00:41.100> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
Serena's wave equation where just the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.690 
Serena's wave equation where just the
the<00:00:41.809> mathematical<00:00:42.809> beauty<00:00:43.530> seem<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.280> give<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
the mathematical beauty seem to give the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.500 
the mathematical beauty seem to give the
key<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.090> truth<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.980> that<00:00:47.510> mathematics

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
key to truth and that mathematics

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.720 
key to truth and that mathematics
actually<00:00:48.690> was<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.320> tool<00:00:49.620> as<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:50.129> mathematical

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
actually was the tool as of mathematical

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.479 
actually was the tool as of mathematical
beauty<00:00:51.050> was<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.230> tool<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.649> discovery<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.309> the

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
beauty was the tool of discovery of the

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.970 
beauty was the tool of discovery of the
laws<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.940> nature<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.710> somehow<00:00:55.710> worked

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
laws of nature that somehow worked

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.400 
laws of nature that somehow worked
beautifully<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:56.640> physics<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.510> didn't<00:00:57.870> doesn't

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
beautifully in physics it didn't doesn't

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.099 
beautifully in physics it didn't doesn't
seem<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.710> work<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:59.129> biology<00:00:59.340> so<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.930> the

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
seem to work in biology so that is the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.840 
seem to work in biology so that is the
question<00:01:01.500> why<00:01:01.649> doesn't<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.250> work<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.670> biology

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
question why doesn't it work in biology

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.050 
question why doesn't it work in biology
and<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:04.170> can't<00:01:04.439> answer<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:05.010> either<00:01:05.220> but<00:01:05.850> that

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
and I can't answer that either but that

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.170 
and I can't answer that either but that
that<00:01:06.240> was<00:01:06.420> what<00:01:06.600> it's<00:01:06.810> about<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:08.180> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
that was what it's about and and the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.450 
that was what it's about and and the
fact<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:11.000> mathematics<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:13.159> useful<00:01:14.159> for

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
fact is that mathematics is useful for

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.060 
fact is that mathematics is useful for
biology<00:01:15.180> only<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.810> very<00:01:15.990> humble<00:01:16.439> way<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.890> is

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
biology only in a very humble way it is

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.679 
biology only in a very humble way it is
just<00:01:18.200> essentially<00:01:19.200> computer<00:01:19.680> science

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
just essentially computer science

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:29.260 
just essentially computer science
organizing<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.840> databases<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:26.600> making

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
organizing of databases and and making

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.950 
organizing of databases and and making
simulations<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:31.070> complicated<00:01:32.070> systems

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
simulations of complicated systems

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.109 
simulations of complicated systems
mathematics<00:01:33.960> can<00:01:34.140> do<00:01:34.350> but<00:01:34.590> it's<00:01:34.740> used<00:01:35.670> as<00:01:35.970> if

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
mathematics can do but it's used as if

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.770 
mathematics can do but it's used as if
as<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.479> humble<00:01:36.930> tool<00:01:37.200> not<00:01:37.470> really<00:01:37.890> as<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.780> creator

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
as a humble tool not really as a creator

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.620 
as a humble tool not really as a creator
for<00:01:39.990> insight<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.909> so<00:01:41.909> there<00:01:42.119> seems<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.420> be<00:01:42.509> a

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
for insight and so there seems to be a

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.139 
for insight and so there seems to be a
some<00:01:43.140> kind<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.740> real<00:01:44.640> difference<00:01:45.060> between

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
some kind of a real difference between

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.830 
some kind of a real difference between
physics<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.020> biology<00:01:46.310> in<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.670> respect<00:01:48.180> but

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
physics and biology in that respect but

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.740 
physics and biology in that respect but
of<00:01:48.960> course<00:01:49.140> we<00:01:49.259> always<00:01:49.439> hope<00:01:49.740> that

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
of course we always hope that

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.569 
of course we always hope that
mathematics<00:01:51.750> will<00:01:51.960> in<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.560> end<00:01:52.710> turn<00:01:53.100> out<00:01:53.310> to

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
mathematics will in the end turn out to

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.749 
mathematics will in the end turn out to
give<00:01:54.329> some<00:01:54.600> deep<00:01:54.810> insights<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:56.250> particularly

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
give some deep insights and particularly

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:07.030 
give some deep insights and particularly
into<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.540> way<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.899> brain<00:01:58.110> works
