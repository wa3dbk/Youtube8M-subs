first<00:00:44.760> part<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.239> this<00:00:45.360> theory<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:45.930> we<00:00:46.530> had<00:00:46.739> four

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
first part of this theory is we had four

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.130 
first part of this theory is we had four

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
which take back to nineteen seventeen

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.569 
which take back to nineteen seventeen
keep<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.230> mind<00:00:52.260> these<00:00:52.710> letters<00:00:53.219> were<00:00:53.250> rope

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
keep in mind these letters were rope

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.940

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
before the zombie stories and even began

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.010 
before the zombie stories and even began
the<00:00:56.640> letters<00:00:56.940> were<00:00:57.149> written<00:00:57.300> by<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.690> four

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
look closely it says 935 which is

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.730

of space between pack a punch which

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.390 
of space between pack a punch which
means<00:02:14.230> there<00:02:14.620> was<00:02:14.739> something<00:02:15.190> previously

this theory the giant metal man will be

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.350 
this theory the giant metal man will be

nuketown zombies loading page you guys
will<00:02:32.830> see<00:02:32.980> a<00:02:33.160> machine<00:02:33.670> without<00:02:34.269> is<00:02:34.540> targeting

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
will see a machine without is targeting

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.110 
will see a machine without is targeting
the<00:02:35.140> ground<00:02:35.440> it<00:02:35.680> looks<00:02:36.160> like<00:02:36.310> it<00:02:36.489> is<00:02:36.549> pushing

the ground it looks like it is pushing
however<00:02:37.840> what<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.200> machine<00:02:38.590> is<00:02:38.709> actually

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
however what the machine is actually

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.970 
however what the machine is actually
doing<00:02:39.220> is<00:02:39.459> pulling<00:02:39.730> origin<00:02:40.660> energy<00:02:40.840> from<00:02:41.830> the

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
doing is pulling origin energy from the
