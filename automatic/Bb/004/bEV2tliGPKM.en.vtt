00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
just I love it it's actually fun to do

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.340 
just I love it it's actually fun to do
lunges<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.990> find<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.920> using<00:01:26.220> g<00:01:26.670> flex<00:01:27.140> makes<00:01:28.140> me

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
lunges I find that using g flex makes me

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.020 
lunges I find that using g flex makes me
use<00:01:28.500> my<00:01:28.740> core<00:01:29.040> muscles<00:01:29.520> which<00:01:29.700> are<00:01:29.850> so

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
use my core muscles which are so

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.850 
use my core muscles which are so
important<00:01:30.570> especially<00:01:30.689> after<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.350> had<00:01:31.590> three

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
important especially after you had three

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.039 
important especially after you had three
children<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:33.060> happens<00:01:33.600> now<00:01:33.810> along<00:01:34.020> with

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
children this happens now along with

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.649 
children this happens now along with
pregnancy<00:01:34.710> but<00:01:34.920> also<00:01:35.070> with<00:01:35.400> age<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.540> is

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
pregnancy but also with age so it is

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.660 
pregnancy but also with age so it is
important<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.229> keep<00:01:37.380> those<00:01:37.530> core<00:01:37.920> muscles<00:01:37.950> in

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
important to keep those core muscles in

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.870 
important to keep those core muscles in
line<00:01:38.909> g<00:01:39.509> flex<00:01:39.810> does<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.290> for<00:01:40.500> me<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:41.430> g<00:01:41.670> flex

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
line g flex does that for me the g flex

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.289 
line g flex does that for me the g flex
enables<00:01:42.720> me<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.020> actually<00:01:43.560> be<00:01:44.130> lifting<00:01:44.820> more

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
enables me to actually be lifting more

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.350 
enables me to actually be lifting more
weight<00:01:45.439> than<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.500> would<00:01:46.979> if<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.460> were<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:47.970> doing

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
weight than I would if I were just doing

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.170 
weight than I would if I were just doing
it<00:01:48.509> with<00:01:48.659> free<00:01:48.960> weights<00:01:49.170> why<00:01:49.920> because<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:51.030> are

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
it with free weights why because you are

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.690 
it with free weights why because you are
using<00:01:51.420> your<00:01:51.720> own<00:01:51.960> body<00:01:52.259> weight<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.490> as<00:01:53.579> I'm

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
using your own body weight so as I'm
