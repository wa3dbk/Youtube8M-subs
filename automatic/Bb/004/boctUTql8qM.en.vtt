and that is that there's a it's a

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.870 
and that is that there's a it's a

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
you can see if you look very closely in

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.100 
you can see if you look very closely in
there<00:02:11.070> the<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.940> romo<00:02:12.270> motor<00:02:12.480> is<00:02:12.690> at<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.959> back

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
there the the romo motor is at the back

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.780 
there the the romo motor is at the back
and<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.440> crystal<00:02:13.800> lights<00:02:13.980> up<00:02:14.190> with<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.489> saber

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
and the crystal lights up with the saber

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.640 
and the crystal lights up with the saber
so<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.910> saber<00:02:18.150> turns<00:02:18.390> on<00:02:18.600> crystal<00:02:19.320> lights<00:02:19.470> up

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
so the saber turns on crystal lights up

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.449 
so the saber turns on crystal lights up
blue<00:02:19.770> as<00:02:20.040> well

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.160 

the<00:02:26.459> Robo<00:02:26.760> motor<00:02:26.940> you<00:02:27.090> can<00:02:27.150> may<00:02:27.810> be<00:02:27.840> able<00:02:28.110> to

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
the Robo motor you can may be able to

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.540 
the Robo motor you can may be able to
see<00:02:28.319> it<00:02:28.410> just<00:02:28.440> kind<00:02:28.800> of<00:02:28.830> spinning<00:02:29.129> away<00:02:29.280> back

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
see it just kind of spinning away back

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.960 
see it just kind of spinning away back
there

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
there

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.780 
there
I<00:02:30.030> feel<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.870> vibrations<00:02:30.989> in<00:02:31.500> this<00:02:31.620> area<00:02:31.860> not

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
I feel the vibrations in this area not

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.790 
I feel the vibrations in this area not
enough<00:02:33.060> that<00:02:33.239> it<00:02:33.360> sets<00:02:33.569> off<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.930> swings<00:02:34.230> or

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
enough that it sets off the swings or

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.309 
enough that it sets off the swings or
the<00:02:34.890> sound<00:02:35.129> card<00:02:36.410> now<00:02:37.410> this<00:02:37.590> this<00:02:37.920> feature<00:02:38.220> it

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
the sound card now this this feature it

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.930 
the sound card now this this feature it
it<00:02:40.319> rotates<00:02:40.769> in<00:02:41.670> there<00:02:41.880> so<00:02:43.580> so<00:02:44.580> most<00:02:44.790> of<00:02:44.880> my

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
it rotates in there so so most of my

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.320 
it rotates in there so so most of my
sabers<00:02:45.480> are<00:02:45.660> really<00:02:46.470> solid<00:02:46.709> for<00:02:47.099> dueling<00:02:47.550> this

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
sabers are really solid for dueling this

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.479 
sabers are really solid for dueling this
is<00:02:48.599> an<00:02:48.750> exception<00:02:49.349> this<00:02:49.620> saber<00:02:49.920> is<00:02:50.099> more<00:02:50.340> of<00:02:50.430> a

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
is an exception this saber is more of a

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.390 
is an exception this saber is more of a
showpiece<00:02:51.410> because<00:02:52.410> it<00:02:52.560> slides<00:02:53.010> out<00:02:53.250> of<00:02:53.310> the

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
showpiece because it slides out of the

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.400 
showpiece because it slides out of the
way<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:53.549> exposes<00:02:54.090> that<00:02:54.780> crystal<00:02:55.140> this<00:02:55.260> is

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
way and exposes that crystal this is

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.740 
way and exposes that crystal this is
meant<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.860> kind<00:02:56.010> of<00:02:56.130> hang<00:02:56.310> on<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.549> belt<00:02:56.750> you

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
meant to kind of hang on the belt you

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.110 
meant to kind of hang on the belt you
can<00:02:57.959> do<00:02:58.110> some<00:02:58.319> light<00:02:58.920> dueling<00:02:59.700> with<00:02:59.849> it<00:03:00.000> which

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
can do some light dueling with it which

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.089 
can do some light dueling with it which
would<00:03:00.239> be<00:03:00.330> very<00:03:00.480> mild<00:03:00.840> just<00:03:01.709> kind<00:03:01.890> of<00:03:01.920> like

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
would be very mild just kind of like

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.250 
would be very mild just kind of like
some<00:03:02.280> choreograph<00:03:02.819> with<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.030> friend<00:03:03.390> because

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
some choreograph with a friend because

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.890 
some choreograph with a friend because
this<00:03:04.980> is<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.250> little<00:03:05.849> bit<00:03:05.940> more<00:03:06.090> fragile<00:03:06.360> this

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
this is a little bit more fragile this

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.380 
this is a little bit more fragile this
joint<00:03:07.260> here<00:03:07.500> then<00:03:08.160> then<00:03:08.610> traditionally<00:03:09.239> what

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
joint here then then traditionally what

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.490 
joint here then then traditionally what
I<00:03:09.420> would<00:03:09.599> build<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.019> first<00:03:10.200> savers

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
I would build it the first savers

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.430 
I would build it the first savers
however<00:03:10.769> you<00:03:10.950> are<00:03:11.069> gonna<00:03:11.220> do<00:03:11.880> with<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.440> what

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
however you are gonna do with it what

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.050 
however you are gonna do with it what
what<00:03:13.950> you<00:03:14.040> need<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.280> do<00:03:14.400> is<00:03:14.549> follow<00:03:14.760> a<00:03:14.880> couple

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
what you need to do is follow a couple

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.589 
what you need to do is follow a couple
of<00:03:15.239> steps

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
of steps

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.220 
of steps
there's<00:03:16.049> a<00:03:16.110> hidden<00:03:16.349> set<00:03:16.620> screw<00:03:17.930> that's<00:03:18.930> in

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
there's a hidden set screw that's in

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.110 
there's a hidden set screw that's in
this<00:03:19.410> tiny<00:03:19.590> little<00:03:19.709> hole<00:03:20.040> there<00:03:20.280> so<00:03:20.940> if<00:03:21.030> you

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
this tiny little hole there so if you

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.850 
this tiny little hole there so if you
pull<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.720> sleeve<00:03:21.959> back<00:03:21.989> as<00:03:22.410> far<00:03:22.590> as<00:03:22.709> it<00:03:22.799> will

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
pull the sleeve back as far as it will

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.059 
pull the sleeve back as far as it will
go<00:03:22.940> and<00:03:23.940> you<00:03:24.030> kind<00:03:24.269> of<00:03:24.329> line<00:03:24.510> up<00:03:24.799> the<00:03:25.799> hole<00:03:26.040> with

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
go and you kind of line up the hole with

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.640 
go and you kind of line up the hole with
the<00:03:26.340> set<00:03:26.519> screw<00:03:27.139> and<00:03:28.139> what<00:03:28.230> you<00:03:28.319> do<00:03:28.440> is<00:03:28.560> you

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
the set screw and what you do is you

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.410 
the set screw and what you do is you
turn<00:03:29.630> counterclockwise<00:03:31.609> which<00:03:32.609> is<00:03:32.760> strange

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
turn counterclockwise which is strange

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.690 
turn counterclockwise which is strange
but<00:03:33.630> what<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:33.989> does<00:03:34.109> is<00:03:34.260> actually<00:03:34.549> loosens<00:03:35.549> the

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
but what it does is actually loosens the

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.309 
but what it does is actually loosens the
screw<00:03:35.940> inside<00:03:36.090> it<00:03:36.389> begins<00:03:36.840> to<00:03:36.930> put<00:03:37.079> pressure

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
screw inside it begins to put pressure

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.129 
screw inside it begins to put pressure
on<00:03:37.859> the<00:03:38.280> sleeve<00:03:38.549> so<00:03:39.299> you<00:03:39.359> do<00:03:39.510> about<00:03:39.660> one<00:03:39.900> full

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
on the sleeve so you do about one full

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:41.720 
on the sleeve so you do about one full
turn<00:03:40.350> and<00:03:40.590> now<00:03:40.769> that<00:03:40.950> things<00:03:41.160> actually<00:03:41.370> locked

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
turn and now that things actually locked

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.940 
turn and now that things actually locked
pretty<00:03:41.940> solid<00:03:42.359> in<00:03:42.450> there<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:43.410> further<00:03:43.680> lock

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
pretty solid in there the further lock

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.650 
pretty solid in there the further lock
it<00:03:44.190> there's<00:03:44.430> another<00:03:44.670> hole<00:03:44.970> here<00:03:45.269> you<00:03:45.420> can<00:03:45.540> put

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
it there's another hole here you can put

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.830 
it there's another hole here you can put
any<00:03:45.780> kind<00:03:45.989> of<00:03:46.250> 832<00:03:47.250> thread<00:03:47.670> screw<00:03:48.569> in<00:03:48.690> there

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
any kind of 832 thread screw in there

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.289 
any kind of 832 thread screw in there
and<00:03:49.139> use<00:03:49.350> this<00:03:49.500> thumb<00:03:49.739> screw<00:03:49.769> which<00:03:50.310> will<00:03:51.120> come

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
and use this thumb screw which will come

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.289 
and use this thumb screw which will come
with<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.600> saber<00:03:52.430> you<00:03:53.430> can<00:03:53.519> tighten<00:03:53.819> that<00:03:53.880> in<00:03:54.090> I

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
with the saber you can tighten that in I

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.440 
with the saber you can tighten that in I
always<00:03:54.630> do<00:03:54.750> that<00:03:54.870> after<00:03:55.470> locking<00:03:56.250> this<00:03:56.670> if<00:03:57.359> you

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
always do that after locking this if you

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.240 
always do that after locking this if you
want<00:03:57.630> further<00:03:58.019> locking<00:03:58.829> you<00:03:59.010> actually

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
want further locking you actually

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.590 
want further locking you actually
probably<00:03:59.340> tighten<00:03:59.790> this<00:03:59.940> I<00:04:00.090> may<00:04:00.209> use<00:04:00.420> some

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
probably tighten this I may use some

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.900 
probably tighten this I may use some
some<00:04:01.560> Loctite<00:04:01.799> on<00:04:02.069> that<00:04:02.310> just<00:04:02.519> to<00:04:02.609> make<00:04:02.730> it

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
some Loctite on that just to make it

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.789 
some Loctite on that just to make it
solid<00:04:03.720> so<00:04:03.959> I<00:04:03.989> wouldn't<00:04:04.260> worry<00:04:04.440> about<00:04:04.500> playing

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
solid so I wouldn't worry about playing

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:05.809 
solid so I wouldn't worry about playing
with<00:04:04.980> that<00:04:05.069> one<00:04:05.220> but<00:04:05.340> that's<00:04:05.430> a<00:04:05.579> little<00:04:05.670> bit

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
with that one but that's a little bit

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.520 
with that one but that's a little bit
more<00:04:05.970> solid<00:04:06.209> now<00:04:06.450> you<00:04:06.870> can<00:04:06.989> put<00:04:07.139> a<00:04:07.170> blade<00:04:07.410> in

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
more solid now you can put a blade in

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.190 
more solid now you can put a blade in
that<00:04:07.680> and<00:04:07.799> you<00:04:07.859> can<00:04:08.040> you<00:04:08.549> can<00:04:08.579> lightly<00:04:09.000> do<00:04:09.410> that

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
that and you can you can lightly do that

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.129 
that and you can you can lightly do that
you<00:04:13.200> know<00:04:13.319> you<00:04:13.440> can<00:04:13.560> play<00:04:13.680> around<00:04:13.950> you<00:04:14.550> some

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:15.139 
you know you can play around you some

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.110 
you know you can play around you some
showing<00:04:16.139> off<00:04:16.290> at<00:04:16.500> a<00:04:16.530> at<00:04:17.280> a<00:04:17.340> con<00:04:17.639> or<00:04:17.820> something

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
showing off at a at a con or something

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.319 
showing off at a at a con or something
like<00:04:18.209> that<00:04:19.549> and<00:04:20.549> that's<00:04:20.790> how<00:04:20.880> that<00:04:20.970> saver

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
like that and that's how that saver

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.540 
like that and that's how that saver
works<00:04:21.600> then<00:04:22.260> if<00:04:22.440> you<00:04:22.530> want<00:04:22.710> to<00:04:22.860> expose<00:04:23.340> the

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
works then if you want to expose the

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.580 
works then if you want to expose the
crystal<00:04:23.880> you<00:04:23.970> just<00:04:24.180> take<00:04:24.330> a<00:04:24.660> few<00:04:25.290> seconds<00:04:25.740> to

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
crystal you just take a few seconds to

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.629 
crystal you just take a few seconds to
loosen<00:04:28.590> that<00:04:28.710> off<00:04:31.250> through<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:32.340> hole<00:04:32.490> on

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
loosen that off through the hole on

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.850 
loosen that off through the hole on
again<00:04:32.910> just<00:04:33.120> you<00:04:34.080> only<00:04:34.200> need<00:04:34.380> one<00:04:34.620> turn

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
again just you only need one turn

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.090 
again just you only need one turn
actually<00:04:35.220> this<00:04:35.340> way<00:04:35.490> you<00:04:35.639> would<00:04:35.760> tighten<00:04:36.030> it

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
actually this way you would tighten it

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.460 
actually this way you would tighten it
clockwise<00:04:38.100> one<00:04:38.520> turn<00:04:39.650> it<00:04:40.650> opens<00:04:41.010> up<00:04:41.130> again<00:04:42.470> so

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
clockwise one turn it opens up again so

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.240 
clockwise one turn it opens up again so
that's<00:04:43.560> the<00:04:43.740> new<00:04:43.830> saber

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
that's the new saber

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.590 
that's the new saber
it's<00:04:44.550> a<00:04:44.610> rumble<00:04:44.910> motor<00:04:45.090> I'm<00:04:45.300> going<00:04:45.419> to<00:04:45.479> put

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
it's a rumble motor I'm going to put

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.040 
it's a rumble motor I'm going to put
that<00:04:45.690> up<00:04:45.750> for<00:04:45.930> sale<00:04:46.940> if<00:04:47.940> someone<00:04:48.690> wants<00:04:48.840> to<00:04:48.900> buy
