00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello how about youtube people I'm Luis 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.680
 brawler and this time I bring you a 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.190
 small tutorial on how to solve the 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.309
 geometric error 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.230
 the error that it runs in a 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.950
 higher resolution than our 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.840
 monitor and the screen stays black 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.400
 but we heard the game but 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.230
 the screen stays black because 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.259
 the game runs in a resolution 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.380
 high to that of our monitor and as the 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.750
 monitor does not support it crashes is 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.250
 why the black screen remains and 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.440
 good to try the traditional methods 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.620
 how to run a game in mode 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.960
 window and then I could not the only way 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.350
 that I could do this is with a program 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.720
 what is called xw nd what I have 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.199
 understood is that that program executes 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:56.489
 forcefully a program is in mode 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:01:01.680
 window and then now the strange thing is 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.629
 that did not execute me geometries like mode 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.909
 window the executed on screen 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.880
 complete but with the resolution that 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.369
 has the monitor and effort that I could 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.110
 open and when I did not play it but if I did 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.720
 I opened and civic is the program worked 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.450
 the program only weighs two megabytes 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.340
 in the description of the video I'm going to 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.109
 leave 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.259
 you just have to download the lean in 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:28.140
 download and well as I said start 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.270
 I think 2 megabytes 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.050
 and then they extract it but preferably 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.240
 create a folder and it has made me erase 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.760
 in there and already after extracting here 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.430
 with a right click because it lets go 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.320
 several files release all these and 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.110
 so that the regulated centers and is 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.700
 that the desk frets why 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.520
 better than it was a folder and you put the 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.190
 good time file as we use this 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.729
 good program this program is here 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:59.460
 is of xwn of we execute the 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:03.270
 application with double click and then we 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.090
 will open this box ok we are going to do 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:10.289
 now well we give in edit what 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:13.470
 we leave atc is to add and in peace and in 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.600
 launch there are three dots at the end good 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.750
 then what we have to click the 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.420
 and we look for the route from where we have 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.480
 this our geometrical executable 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.790
 if you have it for steam this too 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.730
 it works I have it for steam and as 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.879
 you will see here is 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.640
 the route if you download it this pirate 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:37.140
 it only puts the executable of 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.630
 geometry I say no problem 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:44.190
 and we give it in the executable of 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:46.240
 geometric we are going to open and the same with 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.190
 launch 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.350
 same as opening 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.260
 and well now what are we going to do 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.210
 ok ok now we will appear with 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.780
 utility this 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:03.390
 with a green dot and here the following 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.170
 I will explain it with images because the 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.450
 program does not record me good there's only 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.690
 than double- click it and it will open 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.420
 game 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.220
 something like that 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.850
 it's already open but that's how the 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.350
 screen on it 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.620
 in the good video this 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:25.490
 Today is going to teach you good this already 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.250
 being in the part of committed 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:31.010
 on the menu I think that's the menu itself 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.750
 good to solve this error this one already 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.160
 it did not have to be the process we did 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:39.460
 previously we are going to give 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.040
 where is the gear below that is 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:46.630
 configurations will then appear 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:50.470
 a screen if it 's a screen we're going to 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:53.080
 give graphics that are graphics and this 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.170
 in the video options we are going to 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.960
 uncheck full screen or screen 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.970
 complete and move the resolution to how 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.580
 we want it to be preferred 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.320
 is smaller than the monitor 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.480
 obviously so that what happens 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.770
 blocks so I'm going to leave it in 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.770
 1280 x 720 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:18.280
 and I'm going to give him to apply if they give him 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.709
 appling and it's already applied and the game is 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.860
 run now 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:27.520
 window mode I do not know if this I recorded it in 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:32.729
 the program but it's already good I 'm going to 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.729
 make a little smaller 800 x 600 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.729
 it stayed that way was the big screen 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:43.539
 it stayed as thrown 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:47.589
 yes in the resolution that I had put 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:51.710
 first good this would be everything and the 

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:53.850
 bad is that apply 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.550
 says that I have not made any change 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.030
 fuck 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.630
 but now yes 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.340
 well I do not know what he said but well what 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:06.400
 they mark full screen that is screen 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.780
 complete and can a resolution and that 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.230
 it's all they have to do to see what 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.230
 try again 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:17.770
 says he has not made changes to 5,280 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.770
 so it runs 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.770
 but if I give 800 x 600 what 

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:28.039
 or if it is executed but done again 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:28.039
 fullscreen 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:37.139
 good this airbag and I think I'm going to 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.499
 have to restart this so that it 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:41.889
 execute is executed and the 

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:44.669
 changes 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.669
 Where are you 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:52.290
 well that would be all 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:54.419
 I said it the program works so much in 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:58.260
 the geometries that were bought by 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:06:01.169
 steam and those who were this 12 2 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:06.150
 pirates for that I have seen that closed 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:07.919
 the extract version of steam and then yes 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.520
 it does not work with the piratilla version 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:15.320
 that has got the steam version and 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.870
 this same one can get perotti 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.280
 and then they do this process even though 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.280
 I do not think there are many problems 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.860
 true because the program works well 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.590
 and well this is all I hope you have 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.900
 liked and served them more than anything 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:33.919
 I understand that we do not all have the same 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:35.570
 with the same computer or we do not have 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:37.669
 the same software and it's possible that 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.340
 many to many this does not work 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:42.280
 but 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.380
 I hope they work the truth back 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.360
 to say I hope you liked it 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:50.310
 subscribe give a like and comment that 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.310
 we see you in the next video
