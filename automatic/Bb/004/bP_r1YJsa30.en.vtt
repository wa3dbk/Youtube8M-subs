what's neat about this whole way this
this<00:01:29.369> product<00:01:29.909> works<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.420> two<00:01:30.930> things<00:01:31.200> those

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
this product works is two things those

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.990 
this product works is two things those
wire<00:01:32.659> inside<00:01:33.659> each<00:01:34.290> one<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.799> these<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.670> can

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
wire inside each one of these so you can

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.649 
wire inside each one of these so you can
actually<00:01:36.210> bend<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.220> make<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.250> look<00:01:38.659> really

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
actually bend it and make it look really

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.469 
actually bend it and make it look really
natural<00:01:40.490> you<00:01:41.490> know<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.729> can<00:01:42.000> just<00:01:42.180> play

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
natural you know you can just play

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.780 
natural you know you can just play
around<00:01:42.509> with<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.439> decide<00:01:44.159> exactly<00:01:44.369> how

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
around with it and decide exactly how

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.950 
around with it and decide exactly how
you<00:01:45.000> want<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.600> look<00:01:46.189> but<00:01:47.189> in<00:01:48.090> addition<00:01:48.360> to

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
you want it to look but in addition to

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.539 
you want it to look but in addition to
playing<00:01:49.560> around<00:01:49.710> with<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.979> leaves<00:01:50.220> and

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
playing around with the leaves and

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.639 
playing around with the leaves and
letting<00:01:51.210> them<00:01:51.360> overlap<00:01:51.960> with<00:01:52.259> each<00:01:52.409> other

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
letting them overlap with each other

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.980 
letting them overlap with each other
which<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:52.920> again<00:01:53.579> typical<00:01:54.420> how<00:01:54.600> they<00:01:54.780> might

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
which is again typical how they might

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.959 
which is again typical how they might
sit<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.350> between<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:56.100> overlapping<00:01:56.549> leaves

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
sit in between the overlapping leaves

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.690 
sit in between the overlapping leaves
and<00:01:57.210> feel<00:01:57.600> protected<00:01:58.290> there's<00:01:58.979> also<00:01:59.310> two<00:01:59.670> ways

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
and feel protected there's also two ways

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.450 
and feel protected there's also two ways
this<00:02:00.090> screws<00:02:00.450> in<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.380> can<00:02:01.680> actually<00:02:01.950> have

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
this screws in so you can actually have

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.179 
this screws in so you can actually have
this<00:02:02.670> at<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.180> 45<00:02:03.869> degree<00:02:04.079> angle<00:02:04.320> like<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.979> see

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
this at a 45 degree angle like you see

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.190 
this at a 45 degree angle like you see
here<00:02:05.520> or<00:02:06.829> we're<00:02:07.829> gonna<00:02:07.920> unscrew<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:09.200> you

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
here or we're gonna unscrew this and you

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.990 
here or we're gonna unscrew this and you
can<00:02:10.379> also<00:02:10.560> have<00:02:10.950> it

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
can also have it

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.410 
can also have it
a<00:02:12.410> perfectly<00:02:13.410> vertical<00:02:14.070> and<00:02:14.340> basically<00:02:15.210> it

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
a perfectly vertical and basically it

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.540 
a perfectly vertical and basically it
screws<00:02:15.720> into<00:02:15.870> this<00:02:16.050> rock<00:02:16.320> base<00:02:16.560> this<00:02:17.070> is<00:02:17.280> very

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
screws into this rock base this is very

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.590 
screws into this rock base this is very
stable<00:02:17.910> -<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:19.500> rock<00:02:19.950> is<00:02:20.160> fairly<00:02:20.460> heavy<00:02:20.820> so<00:02:21.450> it

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
stable - the rock is fairly heavy so it

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.720 
stable - the rock is fairly heavy so it
really<00:02:21.810> has<00:02:22.260> some<00:02:22.500> stability<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.220> this<00:02:23.340> but

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
really has some stability to this but

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.670 
really has some stability to this but
again<00:02:23.910> it's<00:02:24.090> really<00:02:24.450> cool<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.530> can

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
again it's really cool that you can

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.530 
again it's really cool that you can
decide<00:02:26.130> whether<00:02:26.460> you<00:02:26.550> want<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.850> 45<00:02:27.390> degree

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
decide whether you want a 45 degree

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.350 
decide whether you want a 45 degree
angle<00:02:27.750> or<00:02:28.370> whether<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:29.460> actually<00:02:29.700> want<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.240> to

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
angle or whether you actually want it to

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.330 
angle or whether you actually want it to
go<00:02:30.540> completely<00:02:31.020> vertical<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.920> other<00:02:32.070> thing

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
go completely vertical the other thing

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.610 
go completely vertical the other thing
that<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.550> like<00:02:32.700> about<00:02:32.910> this<00:02:33.210> is<00:02:33.450> you<00:02:33.630> can<00:02:34.290> you

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
that I like about this is you can you

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.850 
that I like about this is you can you
could<00:02:34.950> potentially<00:02:35.640> get<00:02:35.880> two<00:02:36.630> of<00:02:36.660> these<00:02:36.990> and

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
could potentially get two of these and

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.970 
could potentially get two of these and
so<00:02:38.220> you<00:02:38.280> have<00:02:38.610> one<00:02:38.640> vertical<00:02:39.450> and<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:40.320> can<00:02:40.890> do

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
so you have one vertical and you can do

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.949 
so you have one vertical and you can do
now<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.040> can<00:02:44.280> do<00:02:44.430> two<00:02:44.640> of<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.880> big<00:02:45.030> ones<00:02:45.060> and

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
now you can do two of the big ones and

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.260 
now you can do two of the big ones and
not<00:02:46.410> necessarily<00:02:46.980> use<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.280> rock<00:02:47.610> if<00:02:47.880> you<00:02:48.030> want

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
not necessarily use the rock if you want

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.060 
not necessarily use the rock if you want
to<00:02:48.570> have<00:02:49.640> some<00:02:50.640> room<00:02:50.940> saved<00:02:51.800> inside<00:02:52.800> your

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
to have some room saved inside your

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.060 
to have some room saved inside your
enclosure<00:02:53.459> but<00:02:54.150> you<00:02:54.360> can<00:02:54.630> do<00:02:54.959> -<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.739> can<00:02:55.890> do<00:02:56.040> a

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
enclosure but you can do - you can do a

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.170 
enclosure but you can do - you can do a
small<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.760> large

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
small and a large

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.479 
small and a large
or<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:58.080> can<00:02:58.320> do<00:02:58.560> two<00:03:00.080> large<00:03:01.080> ones<00:03:01.380> and<00:03:01.800> you<00:03:02.340> can

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
or you can do two large ones and you can

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:03.830 
or you can do two large ones and you can
blend<00:03:02.700> them<00:03:02.940> together<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.510> then<00:03:03.660> you<00:03:03.690> can

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
blend them together and then you can

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.280 
blend them together and then you can
again<00:03:04.440> play<00:03:05.160> with<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.520> leaves<00:03:06.020> get<00:03:07.020> it<00:03:07.170> to

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
again play with the leaves get it to

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.040 
again play with the leaves get it to
look<00:03:07.610> you<00:03:08.610> know<00:03:08.730> natural<00:03:09.510> like<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.840> leaves

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
look you know natural like the leaves

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.240 
look you know natural like the leaves
would<00:03:10.260> be<00:03:10.380> coming<00:03:10.739> out<00:03:12.770> like<00:03:13.770> it<00:03:13.950> would<00:03:14.130> in

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
would be coming out like it would in

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.370 
would be coming out like it would in
nature<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.880> so<00:03:14.910> you<00:03:15.239> can<00:03:15.600> again<00:03:15.959> you<00:03:16.200> can

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
nature and so you can again you can

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.560 
nature and so you can again you can
blend<00:03:16.590> this<00:03:16.830> or<00:03:17.250> you<00:03:17.400> like<00:03:17.790> is<00:03:17.910> that<00:03:18.060> use<00:03:18.330> two

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
blend this or you like is that use two

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.050 
blend this or you like is that use two
big<00:03:18.780> ones<00:03:18.930> use<00:03:19.500> two<00:03:19.769> small<00:03:20.130> ones<00:03:20.310> you<00:03:20.790> can<00:03:20.940> do

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
big ones use two small ones you can do

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.970 
big ones use two small ones you can do
all<00:03:21.299> kinds<00:03:21.330> of<00:03:21.690> things<00:03:21.900> but<00:03:22.049> again<00:03:22.170> what<00:03:22.950> I

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
all kinds of things but again what I

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.360 
all kinds of things but again what I
love<00:03:23.310> about<00:03:23.489> this<00:03:23.850> is<00:03:24.150> that<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:25.170> is<00:03:25.530> so<00:03:25.920> natural

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
love about this is that it is so natural

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.630 
love about this is that it is so natural
looking<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.299> it<00:03:27.720> really<00:03:28.200> caters<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.709> tree

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
looking and it really caters to tree

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.460 
looking and it really caters to tree
frogs<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:30.239> like<00:03:30.330> I<00:03:30.360> said<00:03:30.570> crested<00:03:31.080> geckos

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
frogs and like I said crested geckos

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.830 
frogs and like I said crested geckos
then<00:03:32.310> all<00:03:32.610> works<00:03:32.850> great<00:03:33.180> and<00:03:33.360> they<00:03:33.540> look<00:03:33.720> great

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
then all works great and they look great

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.370 
then all works great and they look great
in<00:03:34.080> your<00:03:34.140> cage<00:03:34.380> as<00:03:34.590> well<00:03:34.830> so<00:03:35.370> again<00:03:35.700> also<00:03:36.380> real

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
in your cage as well so again also real

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.910 
in your cage as well so again also real
quick<00:03:37.910> detachable<00:03:39.380> just<00:03:40.380> simply<00:03:40.769> by

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
quick detachable just simply by

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.949 
quick detachable just simply by
unscrewing<00:03:41.519> it<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:41.910> then<00:03:42.330> you<00:03:42.420> can<00:03:42.600> take<00:03:42.810> it

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
unscrewing it and then you can take it

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.960 
unscrewing it and then you can take it
over<00:03:43.080> to<00:03:43.350> your<00:03:43.440> sink<00:03:43.709> clean<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.519> whole<00:03:44.700> thing

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
over to your sink clean the whole thing

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.580 
over to your sink clean the whole thing
out<00:03:45.150> if<00:03:45.390> you<00:03:45.480> had<00:03:45.630> crested<00:03:46.080> gecko<00:03:46.260> food

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
out if you had crested gecko food

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.650 
out if you had crested gecko food
especially<00:03:47.250> but<00:03:47.700> even<00:03:47.970> changing<00:03:48.330> the<00:03:48.450> water

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
especially but even changing the water

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.870 
especially but even changing the water
around<00:03:48.810> easy<00:03:49.470> take<00:03:49.950> it<00:03:50.070> you<00:03:50.190> sink<00:03:50.459> fill<00:03:50.670> it<00:03:50.790> up

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
around easy take it you sink fill it up

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.259 
around easy take it you sink fill it up

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
remarkably easy to keep these and very

looking<00:04:00.180> it's<00:04:00.750> probably<00:04:01.200> one<00:04:01.440> of<00:04:01.470> my

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
looking it's probably one of my

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.720 
looking it's probably one of my
favorites<00:04:02.730> as<00:04:02.880> far<00:04:03.120> as<00:04:03.269> looking<00:04:03.660> good<00:04:03.930> in<00:04:04.200> a

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
favorites as far as looking good in a

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.100 
favorites as far as looking good in a
terrarium<00:04:05.810> without<00:04:06.810> being<00:04:07.110> a<00:04:07.200> real<00:04:07.380> plant<00:04:07.739> so

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
terrarium without being a real plant so

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.490 
terrarium without being a real plant so
those<00:04:10.110> are<00:04:10.500> basically<00:04:11.070> the<00:04:11.190> dark<00:04:11.640> Frog<00:04:11.970> ones

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
those are basically the dark Frog ones

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.870 
those are basically the dark Frog ones
although<00:04:13.500> you<00:04:13.799> know<00:04:14.100> they<00:04:14.220> say<00:04:14.400> dark<00:04:14.640> fog

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
although you know they say dark fog

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.550 
although you know they say dark fog
again<00:04:15.090> really<00:04:15.930> any<00:04:16.200> kind<00:04:16.680> of<00:04:16.859> tree<00:04:17.519> frog<00:04:17.790> or

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
again really any kind of tree frog or

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.560 
again really any kind of tree frog or
crested<00:04:19.560> gecko<00:04:19.890> works<00:04:20.220> great<00:04:20.580> and<00:04:20.789> these<00:04:21.419> are

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
crested gecko works great and these are

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.170 
crested gecko works great and these are
the<00:04:21.630> large<00:04:21.840> ones

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
the large ones

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.070 
the large ones
so<00:04:22.300> this<00:04:22.509> is<00:04:22.720> the<00:04:22.930> skin<00:04:23.800> abscess<00:04:24.310> and<00:04:25.080> again

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
so this is the skin abscess and again

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.370 
so this is the skin abscess and again
two<00:04:26.560> big<00:04:26.889> leaves<00:04:27.310> and<00:04:27.699> what<00:04:28.570> happens<00:04:29.199> is

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
two big leaves and what happens is

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.590 
two big leaves and what happens is
you've<00:04:29.800> got<00:04:30.039> this<00:04:30.250> wire<00:04:30.460> so<00:04:30.490> you<00:04:31.030> can<00:04:31.419> either

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
you've got this wire so you can either

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.870 
you've got this wire so you can either
go<00:04:31.840> like<00:04:32.080> a<00:04:32.289> straight<00:04:32.770> up<00:04:32.800> kind<00:04:33.250> of<00:04:33.310> thing<00:04:33.370> and

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
go like a straight up kind of thing and

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.189 
go like a straight up kind of thing and
your<00:04:34.330> enclosure<00:04:34.720> and<00:04:35.910> play<00:04:36.910> with<00:04:37.060> it<00:04:37.090> and<00:04:37.389> make

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
your enclosure and play with it and make

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:40.200 
your enclosure and play with it and make
it<00:04:38.229> all<00:04:38.500> kinds<00:04:38.919> of<00:04:39.009> different<00:04:39.699> ways<00:04:40.000> depending

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
it all kinds of different ways depending

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.730 
it all kinds of different ways depending
how<00:04:40.570> it<00:04:40.690> might<00:04:40.840> look<00:04:40.990> good<00:04:41.050> in<00:04:41.259> your<00:04:41.380> enclosure

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
how it might look good in your enclosure

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.100 
how it might look good in your enclosure
but<00:04:42.340> you<00:04:42.430> can<00:04:42.550> also<00:04:42.699> droop<00:04:43.120> these<00:04:43.360> and<00:04:43.630> you<00:04:43.960> can

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
but you can also droop these and you can

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.600 
but you can also droop these and you can
put<00:04:44.259> them<00:04:44.440> one<00:04:44.590> on<00:04:44.740> top<00:04:44.949> of<00:04:45.009> the<00:04:45.160> other<00:04:45.370> and

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
put them one on top of the other and

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.240 
put them one on top of the other and
what<00:04:46.180> happens<00:04:46.570> with<00:04:46.690> tree<00:04:46.900> frogs<00:04:47.199> is<00:04:47.380> typical

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
what happens with tree frogs is typical

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.100 
what happens with tree frogs is typical
of<00:04:48.310> tree<00:04:48.580> frogs<00:04:48.820> is<00:04:49.000> they'll<00:04:49.419> hang<00:04:49.720> out<00:04:49.900> in

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
of tree frogs is they'll hang out in

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.620 
of tree frogs is they'll hang out in
here<00:04:50.590> in<00:04:50.770> between<00:04:51.220> where<00:04:52.150> they<00:04:52.240> have<00:04:52.449> some

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
here in between where they have some

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.140 
here in between where they have some
shade<00:04:52.900> and<00:04:53.169> sort<00:04:53.710> of<00:04:53.770> feel<00:04:54.039> comfortable<00:04:54.669> but

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
shade and sort of feel comfortable but

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.060 
shade and sort of feel comfortable but
they<00:04:55.270> also<00:04:55.479> a<00:04:55.840> lot<00:04:56.139> of<00:04:56.259> tree<00:04:56.410> frogs<00:04:56.680> like<00:04:56.919> to

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
they also a lot of tree frogs like to

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.710 
they also a lot of tree frogs like to
hang<00:04:57.280> out<00:04:57.400> underneath<00:04:58.240> they<00:04:58.419> attach

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
hang out underneath they attach

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.900 
hang out underneath they attach
themselves<00:04:58.870> underneath<00:04:59.530> the<00:04:59.979> leaf<00:05:00.160> and<00:05:00.400> that

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
themselves underneath the leaf and that

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.520 
themselves underneath the leaf and that
helps<00:05:01.180> them<00:05:01.270> with<00:05:01.449> security<00:05:01.960> and<00:05:02.139> feeling

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
helps them with security and feeling

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.070 
helps them with security and feeling
right<00:05:02.740> you<00:05:02.979> can<00:05:03.400> also<00:05:03.669> put<00:05:04.180> this<00:05:04.300> over<00:05:04.570> water

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
right you can also put this over water

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.710 
right you can also put this over water
and<00:05:05.530> that's<00:05:06.479> nature

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
and that's nature

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.830 
and that's nature
frogs<00:05:08.229> reproduce<00:05:09.130> on<00:05:09.370> leaves<00:05:09.789> that<00:05:10.330> are<00:05:10.389> above

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
frogs reproduce on leaves that are above

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.140 
frogs reproduce on leaves that are above
water<00:05:11.199> so<00:05:11.530> you<00:05:11.800> can<00:05:12.009> reproduce<00:05:12.370> what<00:05:12.820> goes<00:05:13.000> on

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
water so you can reproduce what goes on

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.930 
water so you can reproduce what goes on
in<00:05:13.300> nature<00:05:13.660> to<00:05:14.080> help<00:05:14.410> your<00:05:14.800> frogs<00:05:15.190> actually

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
in nature to help your frogs actually

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.810 
in nature to help your frogs actually
produce<00:05:16.120> more<00:05:16.509> frogs<00:05:17.110> so<00:05:17.889> and<00:05:18.370> then<00:05:18.550> again

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
produce more frogs so and then again

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.029 
produce more frogs so and then again
this<00:05:19.000> is<00:05:19.060> the<00:05:19.300> filling<00:05:19.599> tantrum<00:05:20.169> and<00:05:20.440> this<00:05:20.889> is

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 
this is the filling tantrum and this is

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:23.400 
this is the filling tantrum and this is
just<00:05:21.310> it's<00:05:21.520> similar<00:05:21.789> to<00:05:22.090> this<00:05:22.240> but<00:05:22.840> obviously

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
just it's similar to this but obviously

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.080 
just it's similar to this but obviously
you<00:05:23.590> see<00:05:23.770> there's<00:05:23.979> a<00:05:24.039> different<00:05:24.340> design<00:05:24.639> they

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
you see there's a different design they

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.180 
you see there's a different design they
all<00:05:25.300> have<00:05:25.539> that<00:05:25.660> wire<00:05:25.900> background<00:05:26.590> so<00:05:26.979> you<00:05:27.070> can

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
all have that wire background so you can

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.040 
all have that wire background so you can
play<00:05:27.400> around<00:05:27.669> with<00:05:27.909> them<00:05:28.120> get<00:05:28.570> them<00:05:28.750> into<00:05:29.020> a

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
play around with them get them into a
