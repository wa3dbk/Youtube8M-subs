all the interiors like towers and

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.340 
all the interiors like towers and
whatnot<00:00:38.640> like<00:00:38.850> this<00:00:39.090> this<00:00:39.510> mini<00:00:39.780> area<00:00:40.110> I

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
whatnot like this this mini area I

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.619 
whatnot like this this mini area I
decided<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.129> do<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.879> think<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.300> looks<00:00:42.540> very

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
decided to do and I think it looks very

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.819 
decided to do and I think it looks very
nice<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.079> flows<00:00:43.530> well<00:00:43.860> with<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.129> style<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:45.829> we

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
nice and flows well with the style so we

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.520 
nice and flows well with the style so we
decided<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.550> it'd<00:00:48.390> be<00:00:48.570> nice<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:49.170> do<00:00:49.500> a

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
decided that it'd be nice to do a

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.799 
decided that it'd be nice to do a
rustic-style<00:00:50.100> pill<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:51.300> think<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.690> it

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
rustic-style pill and I think that it

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.900 
rustic-style pill and I think that it
turned<00:00:52.050> out<00:00:52.170> amazing<00:00:53.070> better<00:00:53.489> than<00:00:53.699> what<00:00:53.879> I

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
turned out amazing better than what I

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.619 
turned out amazing better than what I
would<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.570> what<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:54.989> felt<00:00:55.410> would<00:00:56.030> like<00:00:57.030> end<00:00:57.239> up

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
would I what I felt would like end up

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.099 
would I what I felt would like end up
