for<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.070> weapon<00:01:35.369> both<00:01:35.579> in<00:01:35.880> gameplay<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.659> even

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
for the weapon both in gameplay and even

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.380 
for the weapon both in gameplay and even

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
emotionally for the gameplay Bungie

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.630 
emotionally for the gameplay Bungie
wanted<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.810> experience<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.530> be<00:01:40.740> shoot<00:01:41.490> a

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
wanted that experience to be shoot a

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.280 
wanted that experience to be shoot a
laser<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.150> bounces<00:01:42.509> around<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.930> kills<00:01:43.170> a

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
laser that bounces around and kills a

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.410 
laser that bounces around and kills a
bunch<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.530> stuff<00:01:43.829> however<00:01:44.670> design<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.299> what

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
bunch of stuff however design and what

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.149 
bunch of stuff however design and what
is<00:01:45.509> actually<00:01:45.750> going<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.110> work<00:01:46.259> in<00:01:46.560> game<00:01:46.829> is

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
is actually going to work in game is

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.069 
is actually going to work in game is
vastly<00:01:47.579> different<00:01:47.700> at<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.630> end<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.930> day

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
vastly different at the end of the day

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.600 
vastly different at the end of the day
it<00:01:49.259> needs<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.680> look<00:01:49.860> good<00:01:50.189> from<00:01:50.460> a

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
it needs to look good from a

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.069 
it needs to look good from a
first-person<00:01:50.909> perspective<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.840> there's<00:01:52.020> a

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
first-person perspective so there's a

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.109 
first-person perspective so there's a
lot<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.350> visual<00:01:52.680> tuning<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.130> happens<00:01:53.520> then

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
lot of visual tuning that happens then

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.969 
lot of visual tuning that happens then
there's<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.540> gameplay<00:01:54.930> tuning<00:01:55.350> for<00:01:55.619> example

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
there's the gameplay tuning for example

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.819 
there's the gameplay tuning for example
Bungie<00:01:56.280> wanted<00:01:56.549> people<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.820> use<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.329> really

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
Bungie wanted people to use it really

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.289 
Bungie wanted people to use it really
utilizing<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.979> ricochet<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.790> rounds<00:02:00.149> but

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
utilizing the ricochet of the rounds but

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.910 
utilizing the ricochet of the rounds but
players<00:02:00.840> wanted<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.290> use<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.619> more<00:02:01.740> like<00:02:01.890> a

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
players wanted to use it more like a

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.370 
players wanted to use it more like a
precision<00:02:02.579> weapon<00:02:02.969> charge<00:02:03.659> time<00:02:03.899> was<00:02:04.079> another

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
precision weapon charge time was another

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.200 
precision weapon charge time was another
factor<00:02:04.680> they<00:02:05.070> wanted<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.490> be<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.670> real<00:02:05.939> heavy

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
factor they wanted it to be a real heavy

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.029 
factor they wanted it to be a real heavy
hitter<00:02:06.299> with<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.750> really<00:02:07.170> slow<00:02:07.409> charge<00:02:07.740> time

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
hitter with a really slow charge time

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.190 
hitter with a really slow charge time
but<00:02:08.250> players<00:02:08.729> did<00:02:08.970> not<00:02:09.000> like<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.780> very<00:02:09.959> slow

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
but players did not like the very slow

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.949 
but players did not like the very slow
charge<00:02:10.530> time<00:02:10.830> let's<00:02:11.610> look<00:02:11.700> at<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.180> clip<00:02:12.569> we

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
charge time let's look at the clip we

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.320 
charge time let's look at the clip we
can<00:02:12.989> see

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
can see

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.390 
can see
that<00:02:13.450> it<00:02:13.540> fires<00:02:13.720> one<00:02:14.170> big<00:02:14.530> laser<00:02:14.860> beam<00:02:15.160> which

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
that it fires one big laser beam which

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.000 
that it fires one big laser beam which
can<00:02:15.640> quickly<00:02:16.120> see<00:02:16.510> a<00:02:16.540> crit<00:02:16.930> here<00:02:17.260> for<00:02:17.470> sixteen

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
can quickly see a crit here for sixteen

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.970 
can quickly see a crit here for sixteen
thousand<00:02:19.000> damage<00:02:19.480> with<00:02:20.050> non<00:02:20.260> crits<00:02:20.620> doing

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
around eight to nine thousand it comes

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.960 
around eight to nine thousand it comes

you<00:02:27.550> would<00:02:27.640> apply<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.180> weapon<00:02:28.480> more<00:02:28.630> heavy

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
you would apply to the weapon more heavy

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.990 
you would apply to the weapon more heavy
ammo<00:02:29.320> or<00:02:29.470> more<00:02:29.650> fusion<00:02:29.920> rifle<00:02:30.280> ammo<00:02:30.520> or<00:02:30.670> maybe

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
be a viable option although I'd need to

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.080 
be a viable option although I'd need to

see the exact stat increases you get to

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.360 
see the exact stat increases you get to
come<00:02:55.360> to<00:02:55.510> an<00:02:55.600> actual<00:02:55.870> conclusion<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:57.130> first

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
come to an actual conclusion the first

come to an actual conclusion the first
bonus<00:02:57.640> is<00:02:57.910> called<00:02:58.150> just<00:02:58.630> a<00:02:58.780> scratch<00:02:59.260> where<00:02:59.740> the

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
bonus is called just a scratch where the

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.680 
bonus is called just a scratch where the
weapon<00:03:00.190> reduces<00:03:00.700> aim<00:03:00.940> deflection<00:03:01.540> on

weapon reduces aim deflection on
incoming<00:03:02.320> rounds<00:03:02.830> while<00:03:03.250> you're<00:03:03.520> aiming<00:03:03.910> the

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
incoming rounds while you're aiming the

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.760 
incoming rounds while you're aiming the
weapon<00:03:04.360> which<00:03:04.510> sounds<00:03:04.930> awfully<00:03:05.740> like

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
weapon which sounds awfully like

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.160 
weapon which sounds awfully like
unflinching<00:03:06.760> which<00:03:06.910> is<00:03:07.060> apparently<00:03:07.570> useless

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
unflinching which is apparently useless

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.900 
unflinching which is apparently useless
so<00:03:08.440> hopefully<00:03:09.160> this<00:03:09.310> will<00:03:09.430> be<00:03:09.580> a<00:03:09.610> little<00:03:09.730> bit

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
so hopefully this will be a little bit

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.940 
so hopefully this will be a little bit

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
maybe this weapon will be different

maybe this weapon will be different
somehow<00:04:10.299> maybe<00:04:10.660> it<00:04:10.780> has<00:04:10.930> some<00:04:11.140> slight<00:04:11.470> homing

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950

to each beam the weapon looks great and

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.530 
to each beam the weapon looks great and
sounds<00:04:14.560> great<00:04:15.040> and<00:04:15.430> I'm<00:04:15.549> sure<00:04:15.580> the<00:04:16.060> journey<00:04:16.330> to

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
sounds great and I'm sure the journey to

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
randomly getting it but at the moment I

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.830 
randomly getting it but at the moment I

entry level to the taken King do not
take<00:06:55.410> this<00:06:55.590> as<00:06:55.650> fate<00:06:56.070> bringer<00:06:56.370> being<00:06:56.610> around

take this as fate bringer being around
for<00:06:57.150> the<00:06:57.210> entirety<00:06:57.690> of<00:06:57.720> the<00:06:57.810> taken<00:06:58.169> King<00:06:58.410> this

for the entirety of the taken King this

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.580 
for the entirety of the taken King this
seems<00:06:59.130> a<00:06:59.340> very<00:06:59.370> much<00:06:59.970> like<00:07:00.389> the<00:07:00.600> first<00:07:00.840> mission
