so when I show you how to Center a large
chunk<00:00:07.450> of<00:00:07.630> clay<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:09.940> starting<00:00:10.360> with<00:00:10.450> 15

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:10.750

chunk of clay and starting with 15
pounds<00:00:11.050> of<00:00:11.080> clay<00:00:11.260> and<00:00:11.530> I<00:00:12.190> haven't<00:00:12.640> really

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:12.820 
pounds of clay and I haven't really

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.180 
pounds of clay and I haven't really
wedged<00:00:13.000> it<00:00:13.300> I've<00:00:13.450> cut<00:00:13.690> it<00:00:13.780> off<00:00:13.900> the<00:00:14.050> block<00:00:14.320> and

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190

wedged it I've cut it off the block and
I've<00:00:15.340> rolled<00:00:15.670> it<00:00:15.940> and<00:00:16.470> patted<00:00:17.470> it<00:00:17.590> so<00:00:17.769> that

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:17.949 
I've rolled it and patted it so that

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.640 
I've rolled it and patted it so that
it's<00:00:18.580> a<00:00:18.699> little<00:00:18.910> more<00:00:19.030> round<00:00:19.240> what<00:00:20.230> I<00:00:20.260> want<00:00:20.530> is

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
it's a little more round what I want is

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.130 
it's a little more round what I want is
to<00:00:20.860> make<00:00:21.160> sure<00:00:21.190> that<00:00:21.430> this<00:00:21.580> part<00:00:21.850> is<00:00:21.970> domed<00:00:22.300> if

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
to make sure that this part is domed if

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.930 
to make sure that this part is domed if
it's<00:00:23.440> flat<00:00:23.740> when<00:00:24.039> you<00:00:24.070> slam<00:00:24.400> it<00:00:24.430> down<00:00:24.580> it<00:00:24.850> can

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:24.940 
it's flat when you slam it down it can

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.010 
it's flat when you slam it down it can
catch<00:00:25.119> air<00:00:25.390> underneath

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.020 
catch air underneath

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.400 
catch air underneath
so<00:00:26.949> now<00:00:27.070> let's<00:00:27.220> don't<00:00:27.930> I'm<00:00:28.930> gonna<00:00:29.109> hit<00:00:29.230> it<00:00:29.350> in

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
so now let's don't I'm gonna hit it in

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:39.180 
so now let's don't I'm gonna hit it in

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
the middle more you pick clay with your

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.559 
the middle more you pick clay with your
hands<00:00:39.550> some<00:00:39.670> more<00:00:39.789> damage<00:00:39.940> you're<00:00:40.210> gonna<00:00:40.329> do

so I want to just get it in the middle

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:50.219 
so I want to just get it in the middle
get<00:00:44.289> it<00:00:45.569> and<00:00:46.569> get<00:00:46.690> it<00:00:46.809> wet<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:49.539> centering<00:00:50.109> this

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:50.229 
get it and get it wet so centering this

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:51.860 
get it and get it wet so centering this
much<00:00:50.409> clay<00:00:50.649> has<00:00:50.889> to<00:00:51.010> do<00:00:51.100> a<00:00:51.129> lot<00:00:51.309> with<00:00:51.339> leverage

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
much clay has to do a lot with leverage

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.360 
much clay has to do a lot with leverage
so<00:00:52.870> instead<00:00:53.139> of<00:00:53.199> having<00:00:53.319> my<00:00:53.589> elbow<00:00:53.889> on<00:00:53.979> my<00:00:54.010> leg

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
so instead of having my elbow on my leg

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.739 
so instead of having my elbow on my leg
like<00:00:54.579> I<00:00:54.670> normally<00:00:54.789> what<00:00:55.149> I'm<00:00:55.329> gonna<00:00:55.479> move<00:00:55.659> it

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:55.749 
like I normally what I'm gonna move it

00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:57.479 
like I normally what I'm gonna move it
more<00:00:55.929> towards<00:00:56.260> my<00:00:56.440> pick<00:00:56.649> so<00:00:56.920> that<00:00:57.069> when<00:00:57.219> I<00:00:57.249> lean

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
more towards my pick so that when I lean

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.270 
more towards my pick so that when I lean
forward<00:00:57.519> I'm<00:00:58.449> applying<00:00:58.719> pressure<00:00:59.010> so<00:01:00.010> I'm<00:01:00.159> not

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
forward I'm applying pressure so I'm not

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.039 
forward I'm applying pressure so I'm not
using<00:01:00.579> any<00:01:00.789> arm<00:01:01.030> muscle<00:01:01.359> right<00:01:01.449> now<00:01:01.600> just

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:02.049 
using any arm muscle right now just

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:04.730 
using any arm muscle right now just
leaning<00:01:02.289> forward<00:01:02.799> is<00:01:03.039> gonna<00:01:03.249> do<00:01:03.399> the<00:01:03.489> work

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:04.740 
leaning forward is gonna do the work

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.740 
leaning forward is gonna do the work
we're<00:01:05.740> gonna<00:01:05.830> get<00:01:05.979> it<00:01:06.100> wet<00:01:06.420> I'm<00:01:07.420> gonna<00:01:07.570> line<00:01:07.720> up

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
we're gonna get it wet I'm gonna line up

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.180 
we're gonna get it wet I'm gonna line up
the<00:01:07.870> center<00:01:08.110> the<00:01:08.260> clay<00:01:08.410> the<00:01:08.620> middle<00:01:08.830> my<00:01:08.950> wrist

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
the center the clay the middle my wrist

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
the center the clay the middle my wrist
on<00:01:09.370> my<00:01:09.460> elbow<00:01:09.810> I'm<00:01:10.810> gonna<00:01:11.020> lean<00:01:11.200> forward<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:13.060> I

on my elbow I'm gonna lean forward and I

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.850 
on my elbow I'm gonna lean forward and I
lean<00:01:13.360> forward<00:01:13.390> the<00:01:13.900> clay<00:01:14.020> has<00:01:14.200> no<00:01:14.350> place<00:01:14.530> to<00:01:14.560> go

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
lean forward the clay has no place to go

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.270 
lean forward the clay has no place to go
but<00:01:15.240> up

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
but up

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.650 
but up
keeping<00:01:18.280> my<00:01:18.340> hand<00:01:18.550> towards<00:01:18.760> the<00:01:19.030> bottom<00:01:19.180> still

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
keeping my hand towards the bottom still

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.719 
keeping my hand towards the bottom still
so<00:01:20.560> that<00:01:20.680> the<00:01:20.770> comb<00:01:20.950> goes<00:01:21.160> up

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
so that the comb goes up

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.100 
so that the comb goes up
because<00:01:22.939> the<00:01:23.060> cone<00:01:23.240> starts<00:01:23.539> to<00:01:23.659> move<00:01:23.719> up<00:01:23.840> I'm

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
because the cone starts to move up I'm

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.310 
because the cone starts to move up I'm
going<00:01:24.229> to<00:01:24.289> move<00:01:24.439> up<00:01:24.560> slowly<00:01:24.799> with<00:01:24.950> it<00:01:26.289> but<00:01:27.289> I

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
going to move up slowly with it but I

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.350 
going to move up slowly with it but I
don't<00:01:27.409> want<00:01:27.560> to<00:01:27.740> do<00:01:27.860> is<00:01:28.340> move<00:01:28.579> too<00:01:28.909> quickly<00:01:29.149> and

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
don't want to do is move too quickly and

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.459 
don't want to do is move too quickly and
cause<00:01:29.509> a<00:01:29.539> big<00:01:29.810> spiral<00:01:32.200> then<00:01:33.200> I'm<00:01:33.289> going<00:01:33.409> to

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 
cause a big spiral then I'm going to

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:35.460 
cause a big spiral then I'm going to
come<00:01:33.619> down

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
come down

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.980 
come down
again<00:01:36.130> having<00:01:36.730> the<00:01:36.910> elbow<00:01:37.270> close<00:01:37.330> to<00:01:37.540> my<00:01:37.780> hip

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
again having the elbow close to my hip

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.930 
again having the elbow close to my hip
those<00:01:38.800> we've<00:01:38.980> put<00:01:39.190> a<00:01:39.220> lot<00:01:39.340> of<00:01:39.460> pressure<00:01:39.610> on<00:01:39.850> it

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
those we've put a lot of pressure on it

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.630 
those we've put a lot of pressure on it
without<00:01:40.120> doing<00:01:40.360> a<00:01:40.420> lot<00:01:40.540> of<00:01:40.630> work<00:01:41.640> also

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
without doing a lot of work also

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.790 
without doing a lot of work also
breathing<00:01:43.180> is<00:01:43.300> important<00:01:43.840> a<00:01:44.080> lot<00:01:44.470> of<00:01:44.560> people

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
breathing is important a lot of people

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.440 
breathing is important a lot of people
with<00:01:44.890> a<00:01:44.950> larger<00:01:45.250> chunk<00:01:45.430> of<00:01:45.550> clay<00:01:45.640> have<00:01:46.330> a

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
with a larger chunk of clay have a

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.680 
with a larger chunk of clay have a
tendency<00:01:46.870> to<00:01:46.900> stop<00:01:47.230> breathing<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:49.540> you<00:01:49.600> can

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
tendency to stop breathing so you can

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:50.940 
tendency to stop breathing so you can
see<00:01:49.810> it's<00:01:49.930> pretty<00:01:50.080> much<00:01:50.200> in<00:01:50.470> the<00:01:50.590> middle<00:01:50.830> now

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
see it's pretty much in the middle now

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.740 
see it's pretty much in the middle now
after<00:01:51.550> one<00:01:51.700> cone<00:01:51.910> up<00:01:52.030> and<00:01:52.180> cone<00:01:52.330> down

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
after one cone up and cone down

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.660 
after one cone up and cone down
I'm<00:01:53.020> do<00:01:53.410> it<00:01:53.500> again<00:01:53.710> though<00:01:53.860> to<00:01:54.190> line<00:01:54.400> up<00:01:54.550> the

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
I'm do it again though to line up the

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.840 
I'm do it again though to line up the
clay<00:01:54.880> particles<00:01:55.420> so<00:01:55.690> that<00:01:56.160> rhythm<00:01:57.160> them<00:01:57.580> being

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
clay particles so that rhythm them being

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.640 
clay particles so that rhythm them being
all<00:01:58.090> different<00:01:58.960> directions

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
all different directions
