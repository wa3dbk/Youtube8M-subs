 just bought my two spoons 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.750
 in my mix here it would make 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:40.429
 lumps it would be super rude 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.830
 to taste makes it important to 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:45.170
 delegate in a liquid once it's 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.039
 exactly what the child of 8 years 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.500
 using spoons of cornstarch 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:53.300
 now I am good as must a 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.250
 once this delay is there we will buy 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.729
 our milk our vehicle to the rest of the 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.000
 mixed 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.399
 we are going to whip all that remains to them 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.629
 to do at this point is to fill in 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.629
 mold poggi co 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.840
 we whipped our mixture up 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.380
 time we are getting a beautiful 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.180
 homogeneous consistency to all that remains 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.910
 to do at this point is to fill 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.190
 our little fashion so gecko the same 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.280
 technique that I found to perfect 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.450
 the dga has transferred good appears here 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.819
 in a measuring cup simply 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.440
 because thinks a spout is going 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.120
 really help us to perfect the disgust 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.430
 we can not put it everywhere 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.819
 torrent otherwise it may be hard to 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.239
 unmold 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.940
 we will buy our little sticks and more 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.080
 this is the hardest goal of greece is 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.630
 that is, we will send to 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.280
 freezer we 'll have to wait six to 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.690
 eight o'clock so our local fans 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.690
 be well frozen 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.709
 this is the moment of truth of our 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:59.620
 try we will try to unmold nov to 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.930
 dzeko the I imagine on the demo of good 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.249
 quality its tate pub is super easy I 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.409
 you will admit that I bought my 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:07.150
 molds to dollarama so in europe the 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:09.639
 first time the results are going well 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.980
 easily demolishes take our 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:16.359
 stick here it'll just work on the 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.669
 twister and see who faces it 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.230
 not bad to cancun in coop in cut of l 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:21.549
 water it certainly remains home they 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.639
 do not know how scrapped one day 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.469
 especially in this dakar is the mother 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.090
 technique that I figured until date 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:29.980
 to unmould but jcall's fault is 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.040
 just to take a container so 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.620
 hot in which we will drop 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.239
 of offer jcall one to one inside that 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.159
 will just take control of our 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.620
 dzeko faith a little bit because will shoot the 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:44.079
 boat but we hope we will be threatened 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:49.239
 with a Croatian rifle ina our hands and 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:54.400
 not just the twist stick can be used for 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:04:01.000
 waters and that's a perfect frozen desserts 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:02.889
 for the summer season by far the 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.340
 better if n 'roll I never put 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:05.340
 in my mouth
