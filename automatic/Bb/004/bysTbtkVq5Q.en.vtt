00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.440
 was around when is the cactus after bigger 

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:11.780
 i will need a bigger pot 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.780
 but as there is agreement can help you 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.270
 Occasionally you should have a cactus 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.540
 also repot why should one 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.360
 repot the cactus because he despite the high 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.250
 mineral fraction weather around the 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.330
 to give the place and around the roots 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.970
 to control roots 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.730
 when is the best time for a cactus? 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.430
 and pot should be repotted with the 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.410
 pot too small so speak 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.180
 you can not pour them anymore because he is 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.880
 you should do that at the latest five years 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.770
 as a substrate in vallendar creates better 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.870
 is what I actually need one too 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.000
 Cactus repot a suitable place 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.309
 where you can the potatoes without 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.679
 problems can be displaced 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:01:00.530
 cactus for repotting suitable earth or 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:03.199
 a fitting french vase gravel as 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.089
 decorative top layer you need 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:11.440
 various auxiliary tools such as 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:16.630
 For example, a tweezers a barbecue tongs 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.630
 or the special gloves 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.869
 So first a cactus 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.450
 long out and see if the 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.490
 rooting sense if the diseases 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.369
 but have the really good looking 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.600
 were they that it was good that they were 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:43.409
 we usually had to know 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.270
 White finally is normal with those and 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.369
 Now let me have the cactus one 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.049
 For a long time both profit and profit 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.350
 and to unite emotions 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.350
 can 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.010
 especially a suitable new planter 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.270
 chosen the which is large enough that 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.340
 the plant definitely the next 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.770
 But two years can stay 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.830
 not too big that he does not stay forever 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.530
 what I can stay in it all 21 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.390
 we have about how strong that is 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.000
 For example, every woman becomes a cactus 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.350
 grabbed the plant so you can get away with it 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.700
 that he at least expects them 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.350
 two to three years on information 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.850
 you can stay and do the new job 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:27.060
 now a bit like the red ca 1 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:28.590
 to 2 cm round out just a small one 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.170
 Break through the long coconut fibers 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.200
 from the uniqa the standard superstar 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.800
 it still stays pretty good matches 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.980
 minimal risk 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.580
 it was thus currently only fixed you can 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.080
 that makes the roots so can sit down 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:49.230
 with the barbecue tongs to cancer back 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:54.920
 because we are so very good 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:03:02.400
 out and then carefully in the pages 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:04.350
 the fresh fruit a380 texts this is one 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.870
 thing there you can also in the truck 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.989
 Tuesday is normally sparkle again 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.890
 help well everywhere 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:18.390
 one fills approximately to 12 cm underland 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:25.200
 movie career to that there is also the 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:26.790
 train in the holes through which this is 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.330
 root bales yes a uniformly shaped 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.860
 give up on that cavities and that 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.700
 is, of course, bad advice at the moment 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.180
 franz vessel could be a small village 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.180
 supported 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:48.780
 if you have the complete squibb 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.780
 So from about 12 cm you here 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:57.190
 the joke with 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.140
 and that's that that 's all that is 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.870
 speculation like what the rootstock 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.760
 Hard dries and if for example 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.020
 weeds grow it looks easier 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:10.709
 these four later also last again 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.709
 from which he himself simply send 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.890
 the socialist instructor cactus 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:23.140
 crouching comes to that one too 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.520
 knows what the cinema leaves and now lets 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.120
 from the communes for another week 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.190
 leave 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.220
 completely dry it all 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.450
 then that is supposed to root 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:37.210
 You can regenerate from the injuries 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:38.590
 Well, what should I do with these aha like that 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.480
 easy is the cathin and open 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.770
 if I liked that for sure 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.630
 the green ladies 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.490
