it<00:01:14.939> down<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.150> bit<00:01:15.270> because<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:16.020> was<00:01:16.200> kind<00:01:16.409> of

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
it down a bit because it was kind of

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.429 
it down a bit because it was kind of
getting<00:01:16.680> overwhelming<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.659> so<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.960> still<00:01:19.380> have

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439
