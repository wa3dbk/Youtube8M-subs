00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:19.730
 hello friends here is chris and again 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.090
 Welcome to a new video of mine 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:26.160
 and what are we going to do today? 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.599
 the next hour we will be in the 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:35.670
 Jockey Dettori the Bavarians were visually 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:38.210
 Growing up nicely and I'll show you 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.210
 what I have done 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:50.370
 Here is, and I thought so 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.449
 the alu may possibly share one 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.609
 or two we can paint 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:59.940
 but was very important in this case 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:03.329
 Anodized that means you can not now 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.429
 just dub and for that I have 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.160
 of course a solution that I say 

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:11.729
 Show you for the first time what I am 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.560
 I already did that and I did 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:19.380
 here the things unscrewed four in front 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:23.099
 was there for the bracket where the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.170
 piston sits in it and that I mean 

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:28.649
 not these wishbones here in front 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:32.179
 I do not mean that, I mean 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:36.450
 The ones here are often hard plastic 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:37.789
 is very hard plastic and that 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.530
 to paint 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.069
 because I've been watching everywhere 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.679
 Internet 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:46.950
 You will not find these parts in the 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:50.239
 galvanize alu that of course a pity 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.239
 Of course, that's a pity 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.820
 so that comes across reasonably cool 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:02:00.729
 so that looks like something like here 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.250
 so in zinc blue when you do that 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.189
 Of course, I'll show you myself 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.220
 how it works 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:11.980
 So you need to follow in any case 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.030
 i was already shopping for it i show 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.030
 you something I bought 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:27.910
 that is the primer the bock beer that 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:30.970
 is often easy on it but the 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.540
 Prime that a primer yes 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.540
 how should I say 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:40.480
 that's really good and it holds too 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:46.840
 For smooth surfaces, fold properly 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:49.209
 surfaces holds you need then around 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.810
 again to get the effect that that 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:58.239
 somewhere so bright is here once chrome 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:01.480
 You need that too and then 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.850
 once the blue and that is not 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.530
 somehow in royal blue so completely 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:10.720
 supple no that's ice blue so 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.569
 For example, if you like me now 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.359
 say if you for example one 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:19.630
 plexiglass plate would have that with it 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:21.880
 Spray then at the end is so 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.010
 look like the plexiglas plate 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.220
 blue and you can still through 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.540
 look 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:34.919
 of course he gets the effect 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.919
 then wonderful way that it will run as 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.959
 So I would suggest 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.840
 I also screw the others 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.860
 things are not the wishbones that those 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:53.430
 these carriers 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:58.080
 and we'll be back soon 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:02.670
 until just friends like that again and again 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:06.750
 back and I'm blind here in the picture 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:15.510
 a like me with the first layer 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:20.340
 have started here and that there are 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:28.530
 now about yes about now 18 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:32.160
 hours passed and I will one time 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:34.710
 play video here for a short time how long 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.850
 Yesterday was still awake to the parts 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.330
 paint and then we'll see you soon 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:47.720
 again 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:52.070
 look at that for a minute and so people 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:58.919
 By now it is almost fast and 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:59.790
 it's about 11pm and me 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:04.260
 I have the last shift now 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:05.640
 applied by the chrome and yes me 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:12.300
 will sleep in any case now 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:16.830
 Let's go see that is pretty 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:21.479
 expensive but worth it 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:25.080
 definitely once again very clear that 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:27.419
 blue is now empty and I get time 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.810
 the parts of course all ready now 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:29.810
 mortal 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:46.890
 So here it is no longer better 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:55.410
 seen super beautiful dried out 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:06:03.840
 they are too and it will be the same 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:07.830
 of course, to the installation and if 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.930
 I'll have it all mounted then 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.420
 I show the car again we finished 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:17.480
 looks 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:17.480
 and yes I would say it soon 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:25.060
 so friends the summer back again so 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:30.669
 only now completely ruin that was 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:31.449
 yes there is definitely one can 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:33.190
 let see 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:37.419
 that's very clear that can be 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:40.990
 see the effect so the blue 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:45.600
 Galvanized looks really nice I have to 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.600
 to say honestly are really nice 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.720
 and of course you do that too in advance 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:55.330
 imitate 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:07:00.250
 then I'll help you then write 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:02.620
 in my opinion ask here in this regard 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.400
 with color and so how long have I been 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:07.620
 needed 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:10.360
 to dry and all in all 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:13.900
 I'm definitely ready to go there too 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.200
 help so i would say that was it for 

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.040

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:26.160
