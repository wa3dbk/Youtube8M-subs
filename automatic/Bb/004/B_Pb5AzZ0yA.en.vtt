00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:06.460
 you know it's a solar rash a 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.980
 Solar eruption is a violent explosion 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.929
 in the photosphere of the sun with an energy 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.570
 equivalent to tens of millions of 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:15.880
 Hydrogen pumps up to 6 by 10 a 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.730
 the 25 joules 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.460
 the sun unleashed its first super flare 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.130
 powerful of the year this Wednesday, the 11th 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.279
 March and the intense irruption is directed 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.220
 directly to the earth the monstrous 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.739
 flare solar class x the category more 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.079
 strong sun storms reached 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.260
 its maximum point at 12 22 local time 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.970
 today Thursday, March 12 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.120
 coming from a known sunspot 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:46.640
 as active region 12,297 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.320
 the phenomenon has triggered a series of 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.660
 flares of medium strength in the 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.960
 last days the Wednesday event 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.550
 took things to a higher level 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.290
 causing a one- hour blackout in the 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.170
 radio communications high 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.970
 frequency in wide areas the flare 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.360
 registered this Wednesday was 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.940
 considered class x 2.2 on the scale of 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.369
 solar storms used to measure 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.530
 solar storms which 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:16.009
 means that this type of rashes 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.440
 the emanated are twice as powerful 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.570
 solar systems are often accompanied by 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.520
 coronal mass injections that are 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.380
 huge clouds of super hot plasma 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.600
 who travels through space to 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.909
 millions of kilometers per hour while 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.920
 that the radiation of an outbreak reaches the 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.080
 land in a matter of minutes the 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.970
 coronal mass ejections so 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.880
 General takes several days to arrive 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.850
 but powerful and actions in the direction of 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.500
 the earth can wreak havoc 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.659
 causing geomagnetic storms that 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.970
 they can interrupt electrical networks 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.520
 and satellite navigation 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.040
 as a result of three and actions that 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.650
 untied the sun last Monday, March 9 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.960
 another storm has already been announced 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.570
 Geomagnetic although with less warning 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.880
 for Friday, March 13 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.770
 so you know if tomorrow 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.770
 you have problems with your networks 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.270
 electrical and satellite navigation 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.600
 everything can be the cause of the storm 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.610
 geomagnetic looming do not forget 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.060
 share the information and leave your 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.890
 comments in the description shares 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.170
 the link where you will find images and the 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.910
 video captured by NASA just 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.910
 at the time when the eruption occurred
