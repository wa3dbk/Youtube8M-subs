so the facts what I did is because I

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.279 
so the facts what I did is because I
downloaded<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.329> as<00:00:48.450> well<00:00:48.660> just<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.899> try<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.170> out

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
downloaded it as well just to try it out

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.319 
downloaded it as well just to try it out
because<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.680> actually<00:00:50.129> quite<00:00:50.550> fancied<00:00:51.120> doing

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
because I actually quite fancied doing

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.290 
because I actually quite fancied doing
that<00:00:51.809> at<00:00:52.289> first<00:00:52.559> but<00:00:52.739> now<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.370> want<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.059> stick

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
that at first but now I want to stick

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.590 
that at first but now I want to stick
with<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:55.140> windows<00:00:55.440> 7<00:00:55.649> thing<00:00:56.120> so<00:00:57.120> what<00:00:57.390> you'd

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
with the windows 7 thing so what you'd

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.450 
with the windows 7 thing so what you'd
actually<00:00:57.840> have<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.199> do<00:00:58.440> first<00:00:58.829> because<00:00:59.309> this

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
actually have to do first because this

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.450 
actually have to do first because this
only<00:00:59.730> works<00:01:00.300> when<00:01:00.690> they<00:01:00.840> 7th<00:01:01.230> not<00:01:01.859> for<00:01:02.039> XP

the slush then scan now
and<00:02:09.770> you<00:02:10.770> actually<00:02:10.860> lumber<00:02:11.750> that<00:02:12.830> both<00:02:13.830> the

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
ends are put together right so we'll

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.250 
ends are put together right so we'll
just<00:02:18.959> say<00:02:19.110> scan<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:19.739> add<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.250> two<00:02:20.459> pens<00:02:20.730> and

that you have to make sure there's a
space<00:02:23.459> between<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:24.000> left<00:02:24.239> arrow<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:25.130> us<00:02:27.440> so

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
space between the left arrow and us so

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.130 
space between the left arrow and us so
once<00:02:29.430> he<00:02:29.550> did<00:02:29.700> that<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:30.330> have<00:02:30.600> to<00:02:30.780> press<00:02:30.989> the

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
Enter key and then it'll do a full

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.940

around<00:03:14.280> 30<00:03:14.730> minutes<00:03:15.090> just<00:03:15.359> to<00:03:15.450> do<00:03:15.600> a<00:03:15.630> full<00:03:15.870> scan

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
around 30 minutes just to do a full scan

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.310 
around 30 minutes just to do a full scan
on<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:16.980> whole<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.609> your<00:03:17.760> false<00:03:18.200> everything<00:03:19.200> no

quick<00:03:19.590> scan<00:03:19.829> a<00:03:20.040> full<00:03:20.400> scan<00:03:20.730> so<00:03:21.420> but<00:03:22.320> since<00:03:22.530> my

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
quick scan a full scan so but since my

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.349 
quick scan a full scan so but since my
PC<00:03:23.970> is<00:03:24.120> very<00:03:24.540> very<00:03:24.810> fast<00:03:25.160> you'll<00:03:26.160> it<00:03:26.519> took<00:03:26.850> less

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
PC is very very fast you'll it took less

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.270 
PC is very very fast you'll it took less
than<00:03:27.630> 30<00:03:28.260> minutes<00:03:28.530> in<00:03:28.769> the<00:03:28.859> second<00:03:29.130> actually

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
than 30 minutes in the second actually

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.440 
than 30 minutes in the second actually
around<00:03:29.609> like<00:03:29.870> 10<00:03:30.870> to<00:03:31.049> 15<00:03:31.470> minutes<00:03:32.180> so<00:03:33.180> it

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
around like 10 to 15 minutes so it

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.270 
around like 10 to 15 minutes so it
depends<00:03:33.959> how<00:03:34.320> fast<00:03:34.739> your<00:03:35.070> processor<00:03:35.489> is<00:03:36.079> so<00:03:37.280> it

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
depends how fast your processor is so it

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.069 
depends how fast your processor is so it
it's<00:03:38.820> actually<00:03:38.970> quite<00:03:39.390> fast<00:03:39.750> on<00:03:39.959> new

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
it's actually quite fast on new

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.160 
it's actually quite fast on new
computers<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:40.799> be<00:03:40.890> honest<00:03:41.220> so<00:03:41.720> it<00:03:42.720> might<00:03:42.900> take

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
computers to be honest so it might take

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
computers to be honest so it might take
some<00:03:43.260> time<00:03:43.560> if<00:03:43.799> you<00:03:43.859> have<00:03:43.980> a<00:03:44.010> t-bolt<00:03:44.810> Vista<00:03:46.190> so

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
some time if you have a t-bolt Vista so

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.199 
some time if you have a t-bolt Vista so
just<00:03:47.790> remember<00:03:48.060> that<00:03:48.269> just<00:03:48.570> in<00:03:48.720> case<00:03:49.970> so<00:03:50.970> once

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
just remember that just in case so once

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.259 
just remember that just in case so once
it's<00:03:51.450> done<00:03:51.540> it<00:03:52.049> will<00:03:52.260> say<00:03:52.500> that<00:03:52.769> it<00:03:53.040> is<00:03:53.269> 100%

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
it's done it will say that it is 100%

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.460 
it's done it will say that it is 100%
and<00:03:54.959> it<00:03:55.799> says<00:03:56.040> in<00:03:56.280> order<00:03:57.000> to<00:03:57.299> do<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:58.140> effect

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
and it says in order to do the effect

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.789 
and it says in order to do the effect
you<00:03:58.709> have<00:03:58.739> to<00:03:58.920> restart<00:03:59.489> your<00:04:00.000> computer<00:04:00.769> so<00:04:01.769> you

you have to restart your computer so you

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.819 
you have to restart your computer so you

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
windows back to normal with your normal

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.200 
windows back to normal with your normal
thing<00:04:53.190> and<00:04:54.950> it<00:04:55.950> will<00:04:56.070> still<00:04:56.340> show<00:04:56.370> quite<00:04:57.060> the

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
thing and it will still show quite the

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.930 
thing and it will still show quite the
square<00:04:57.450> here<00:04:58.010> like<00:04:59.010> what<00:04:59.220> I<00:04:59.250> have<00:04:59.610> but

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
square here like what I have but

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.120 
square here like what I have but
actually<00:05:00.570> still<00:05:00.870> back<00:05:01.110> to<00:05:01.260> windows<00:05:01.620> and<00:05:01.830> still
