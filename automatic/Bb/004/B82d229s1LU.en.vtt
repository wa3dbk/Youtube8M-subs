00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Oh 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.540
 hello everyone and welcome to the channel 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.910
 hbo said to m cpj and today I am 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.289
 with the ending I find it why 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.279
 not what I'm going to propose a 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.660
 special training 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.480
 adriana lima if you have not museum 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.800
 just click here and at the end of the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.180
 life of olmes a little roomed sk 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.650
 find I'm not very drunk halal 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.000
 get a little bit of it she told me 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.010
 yeah you're not under for a left 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.330
 I'm going to show you a routine so 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.100
 today is what we propose to you 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.839
 his routine of stretches suddenly 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.940
 now for exercise and minutes 33 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:46.950
 so an excess by exercise she 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.940
 stretches at least once a week and 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.010
 that's how you 've gained in 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.379
 flexibility but an hour here I have 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.300
 still motivation and hope 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.739
 so you show that and then I'm going 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.420
 explain you the different forms 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.430
 stretching is to warm up for 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.050
 prepare an effort to pay for 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.410
 recover or to gain in level the 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.010
 flexibility 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.010
 will you go 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:45.140
 o o 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.020
 and so that's for the routine of 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.920
 launches the bank bundle of handsets to 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.270
 thousand times a week 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.650
 of course advise you to make two to 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.780
 four times this really wanted to win in 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.030
 flexibility and to go gradually 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.740
 So now aboard the bus 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.360
 part how to stretch well how 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.310
 gain flexibility or the inverted 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.960
 how are you preparing an effort there for 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.660
 you start do you do 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.400
 after being warmed up that it's learning the 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.140
 premium is warmed up okay so 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.190
 balloon can advise you to do that 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.480
 after a little warm up cardio 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.860
 vascular are white is that the 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.380
 muscle is hot it's easier to 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.120
 stretch now we advise 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.740
 also to frouard we were afraid that it 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.130
 cause injury bray do it you have 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.810
 cold 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.490
 apparently the flexibility you're going 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.110
 acquire it will be more sustainable 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.459
 on the other hand for sure you are much more 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.020
 gently and that the stretch come out 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.670
 longer was gradually going into 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.590
 the effort is good it's true that we do not 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.730
 wants to risk getting hurt 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.959
 then there are different forms 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.030
 stretching function of the lens 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.010
 that it was proposed that the threat is 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.120
 so gaining flexibility so as she 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.190
 you said it can do that after a 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.930
 cardiovascular or afro warm-up 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.310
 not going gradually thereafter if they 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.780
 really wanted you ready to 1 is 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.760
 strong on for example for a sport 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.620
 collective and race that especially 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.910
 what to do with long passive stretching 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.959
 like that because they were going to sleep 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.480
 the muscle is therefore breastfeeding 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.890
 responsive - times you're going to have to do 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.660
 Third - party type bank 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.489
 and for that you have for example the 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.380
 ballistic type stretching 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.360
 the chord that I throw the leg before 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.400
 back I have a moment where my thigh 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.200
 and shoot and there to contract them I stretch 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.880
 I contract a movement of type not 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.950
 the targets of this style simply 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.630
 also you have dynamic stretching 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.860
 when you are down you will shoot 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.510
 the charming thigh 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.850
 and the reverse ischios advice the young 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.620
 man or stretching that we will call 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.990
 to thibaut dynamic to say he has 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.220
 hit for example your foot is 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.620
 slightly stretching at the level of the 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.090
 thighs therefore missed the thigh for 5 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.710
 at 6 seconds and will be able to let go of a 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.080
 shot while contracting the leg 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.150
 why they decide to lengthen the must 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.370
 is to still keep the vivacity 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.380
 to stay dynamic to be able to be 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.120
 powerful and so that's it these are the 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.650
 three types of stretching for 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.590
 prepare so they can serve for 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.630
 a warm up ok quarantine is 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.010
 perfect here after you have an effort 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.209
 long enough that they need you 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.830
 stretch to recover a little bit 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.450
 give two lengths to the muscles 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.070
 during an effort there you will do 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.260
 rather the team in the passive ie 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.519
 that you are going to catch the right leg 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.320
 contracted for five six seconds 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.030
 you recover a little satisfying and 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.590
 you start as this is not what 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.510
 move to release you contract the 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.650
 leg and finally of course you have the 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.680
 stretching at the end of a workout 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.940
 to give length to the museum if 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.950
 you have not seen I already proposed a 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.660
 stretching routine that appears here 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.250
 exactly where we have just an hour 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.900
 thirty seconds a position it's just 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.970
 to recover the initial length 12 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.979
 so that's passive stretching 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.900
 like the routine also 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:48.850
 but by cons it is the most 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.020
 just after a cardio warm-up for 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.180
 really gain flexibility 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.040
 what you can do also after 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.260
 a training that will be contracted 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.940
 released ie if you 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.680
 always catch the example with the 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.780
 thigh and catch your foot i'm going 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.460
 contracted at most the thigh and when 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.840
 I relax to accentuate the stretching I 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.200
 sought to gain even a little bit in 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.540
 flexibility 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.250
 it could do it after in the cube 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.990
 your workout to also win 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.760
 flexibly on the same routine as she 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.920
 proposed 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.720
 and then you also contracted 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.640
 relaxed mental where does that mean that there 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.140
 I rather sought to contract less 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.420
 hamstrings why because if I 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.100
 account tradition the body unconsciously 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.510
 it will inevitably release the crisis the 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.550
 pisco contract seeking to bring back 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.080
 talent buttocks it loosens my thigh and 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.610
 I can emphasize for the pulls the 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.600
 growing little tips for 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.370
 even win a little more 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.800
 flexibility and like that you will see 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:42.600
 that within three to four hours shock is 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:44.070
 haunted carreton and wall in any case 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.260
 I hope the video has you more it's 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.670
 good for that m a little I like of course 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.080
 think to join us on all 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.490

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.140
 google instagram + 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.400
 we will tell you very quickly and especially that 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.400
 if he has to look at fishing
