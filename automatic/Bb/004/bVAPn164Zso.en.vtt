catastrophic wildfires that we have been
experiencing<00:02:06.829> here<00:02:07.100> in<00:02:07.219> Arizona<00:02:07.700> instead<00:02:08.509> of

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
experiencing here in Arizona instead of

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.389 
experiencing here in Arizona instead of
spending<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.170> millions<00:02:09.649> of<00:02:09.769> dollars<00:02:09.830> that<00:02:10.310> we

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
spending the millions of dollars that we

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.520 
spending the millions of dollars that we
spent<00:02:10.759> on<00:02:11.030> suppressing<00:02:11.510> fires<00:02:11.989> like<00:02:12.290> these

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
spent on suppressing fires like these

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.500 
spent on suppressing fires like these
what<00:02:12.920> we<00:02:13.069> would<00:02:13.220> like<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.459> do<00:02:13.730> is<00:02:13.970> use<00:02:14.239> those

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
what we would like to do is use those

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.620 
what we would like to do is use those
resources<00:02:14.829> proactively<00:02:15.829> to<00:02:16.370> thin<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:17.120> forest

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
resources proactively to thin the forest

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.440 
resources proactively to thin the forest
and<00:02:17.840> then<00:02:18.260> have<00:02:18.799> controlled<00:02:19.489> burns<00:02:19.849> to

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
and then have controlled burns to

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.360 
and then have controlled burns to
continue<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.079> management<00:02:21.560> of<00:02:21.620> our<00:02:21.769> force<00:02:22.099> so

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
continue the management of our force so

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.550 
continue the management of our force so
they<00:02:22.489> can<00:02:22.640> handle<00:02:22.910> natural<00:02:23.480> fire<00:02:23.750> so<00:02:24.290> we<00:02:24.410> can

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
they can handle natural fire so we can

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.620 
they can handle natural fire so we can
allow<00:02:24.860> lightning<00:02:25.459> strikes<00:02:25.849> and<00:02:26.150> other

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
allow lightning strikes and other

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.319 
allow lightning strikes and other
natural<00:02:26.989> fires<00:02:27.500> to<00:02:27.829> occur<00:02:28.250> across<00:02:29.000> the

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
natural fires to occur across the

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.960 
natural fires to occur across the
landscape<00:02:29.860> had<00:02:30.860> they<00:02:31.250> been<00:02:31.280> able<00:02:31.640> to

landscape had they been able to

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.750 
landscape had they been able to
successfully<00:02:32.450> do<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.890> thinning<00:02:34.370> around

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760
