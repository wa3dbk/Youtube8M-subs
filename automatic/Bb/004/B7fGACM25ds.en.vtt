my current card but when I started
recording<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.390> became<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.840> real<00:00:49.289> chore

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
recording it became a real chore

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.799 
recording it became a real chore
especially<00:00:50.340> with<00:00:50.879> Metro<00:00:51.180> lastly<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.570> had<00:00:51.719> to

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
especially with Metro lastly I had to

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.150 
especially with Metro lastly I had to
drop<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.199> game<00:00:52.320> down<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.559> medium<00:00:52.949> if<00:00:53.070> I

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
drop that game down to medium if I

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.160 
drop that game down to medium if I
wanted<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.489> record<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.969> at<00:00:54.300> any<00:00:54.660> decent

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
wanted to record it at any decent

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.900 
wanted to record it at any decent
framerate<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.280> thought<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.520> know<00:00:56.610> what

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
framerate and so I thought you know what

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.180 
framerate and so I thought you know what
even<00:00:57.210> though<00:00:57.270> this<00:00:57.360> guy<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.600> kind<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.899> pricey

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
even though this guy is kind of pricey

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.799 
even though this guy is kind of pricey
pretty<00:00:59.190> darn<00:00:59.370> pricing<00:00:59.820> in<00:00:59.879> fact<00:01:00.000> 650<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.660> what

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
pretty darn pricing in fact 650 is what

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.020 
pretty darn pricing in fact 650 is what
I<00:01:00.870> paid<00:01:01.109> on<00:01:01.230> Amazon<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:02.370> would<00:01:02.489> be<00:01:02.699> it's

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
I paid on Amazon it would be it's

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.299 
I paid on Amazon it would be it's
cheaper<00:01:03.390> than<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.570> Titan<00:01:03.989> which<00:01:04.680> are<00:01:04.979> our

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
cheaper than a Titan which are our

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.520 
cheaper than a Titan which are our
around<00:01:05.820> closer<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.630> thousand<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.290> it

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
around closer to a thousand and it

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.250 
around closer to a thousand and it

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
youtube channel it will help with the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.969 
youtube channel it will help with the
rendering<00:01:39.090> speed<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:40.110> up<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.380> little<00:01:40.530> bit<00:01:40.680> as

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
rendering speed that up a little bit as

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.120 
rendering speed that up a little bit as
well<00:01:41.310> BAM<00:01:41.930> it's<00:01:42.930> pretty<00:01:43.229> awesome<00:01:43.409> looking<00:01:43.829> and

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
well BAM it's pretty awesome looking and

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.740 
well BAM it's pretty awesome looking and
I'm<00:01:44.280> ready<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.640> pump<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.390> see<00:01:45.600> how

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
I'm ready to pump it in and see how

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.069 
I'm ready to pump it in and see how
pretty<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.170> makes<00:01:46.439> my<00:01:46.590> PC<00:01:47.130> let's<00:01:47.820> go<00:01:48.079> already

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
pretty it makes my PC let's go already

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.350 
pretty it makes my PC let's go already
so<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.680> Metro<00:01:50.040> last<00:01:50.310> light<00:01:50.549> on<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.000> GTX

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
so this is Metro last light on the GTX

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.260 
so this is Metro last light on the GTX
780<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.920> am<00:01:53.280> recording<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.000> takes<00:01:54.149> a

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
780 and I am recording it so it takes a

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.999 
780 and I am recording it so it takes a
little<00:01:54.600> bit<00:01:54.810> of<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.140> hit<00:01:55.380> but<00:01:55.530> let<00:01:55.619> me<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:55.740> say

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
little bit of a hit but let me just say

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.620 
little bit of a hit but let me just say
that<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.219> looks<00:01:56.399> downright<00:01:56.700> amazing<00:01:57.149> when<00:01:57.509> I'm

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
that it looks downright amazing when I'm

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.410 
that it looks downright amazing when I'm
not<00:01:57.780> recording<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.439> when<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.369> am<00:01:59.759> recording<00:02:00.060> I

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
not recording and when I am recording I

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.870 
not recording and when I am recording I
basically<00:02:00.719> everything<00:02:01.079> maxed<00:02:01.290> out<00:02:01.590> as<00:02:02.250> high

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
basically everything maxed out as high

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.639 
basically everything maxed out as high
is<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.270> pretty<00:02:03.570> much<00:02:03.780> can<00:02:03.990> be<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.290> looks<00:02:04.469> so

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
is it pretty much can be it looks so

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.319 
is it pretty much can be it looks so
good<00:02:04.860> I've<00:02:04.950> got<00:02:04.979> advanced<00:02:05.340> physics<00:02:05.759> on<00:02:05.880> let<00:02:06.299> me

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
good I've got advanced physics on let me

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.520 
good I've got advanced physics on let me
just<00:02:06.509> bring<00:02:06.659> up<00:02:06.810> here<00:02:06.990> I'll<00:02:07.110> bring<00:02:07.320> up<00:02:07.439> the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
I say a on two times 1920 by 1080 blah

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.280 
I say a on two times 1920 by 1080 blah
blah<00:02:12.270> blah<00:02:12.420> everything<00:02:12.750> is<00:02:12.840> on<00:02:12.900> very

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
blah blah everything is on very

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.160 
blah blah everything is on very
as<00:02:13.500> it<00:02:13.650> can<00:02:13.860> be<00:02:14.159> and<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:14.939> runs<00:02:15.150> really<00:02:15.569> well<00:02:15.750> now

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
as it can be and it runs really well now

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.709 
as it can be and it runs really well now
if<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.409> turn<00:02:16.500> off<00:02:16.680> recording<00:02:17.459> I<00:02:18.120> can<00:02:18.510> get

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:18.719 
if I turn off recording I can get

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:21.020 
if I turn off recording I can get
usually<00:02:19.379> get<00:02:19.620> about<00:02:19.920> 50<00:02:20.459> 60<00:02:20.579> frames<00:02:20.909> per

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
second and graphically it looks just

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.690 
second and graphically it looks just
about<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.939> same<00:02:27.209> as<00:02:27.959> you<00:02:28.170> can<00:02:28.200> see<00:02:28.500> it's<00:02:28.739> it's

bang at you ma'am let's watch this

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.929 
bang at you ma'am let's watch this
explosion<00:02:39.209> and<00:02:39.480> beautiful<00:02:40.489> perfect<00:02:41.489> visuals

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
explosion and beautiful perfect visuals

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:43.580 
explosion and beautiful perfect visuals
all<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.389> explosions<00:02:42.989> going<00:02:43.139> I<00:02:43.260> mean<00:02:43.379> this

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
all the explosions going I mean this

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.140 
all the explosions going I mean this
basically<00:02:44.010> looks<00:02:44.129> like<00:02:44.370> next-gen<00:02:44.879> which<00:02:45.030> is

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
basically looks like next-gen which is

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.179 
basically looks like next-gen which is
pretty<00:02:45.359> darn<00:02:45.629> awesome<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:46.680> hope<00:02:46.709> that<00:02:47.159> I

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:47.189 
pretty darn awesome and I hope that I

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:48.589 
pretty darn awesome and I hope that I
can<00:02:47.489> get<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.730> good<00:02:47.879> sense<00:02:48.150> of<00:02:48.239> it<00:02:48.359> even<00:02:48.480> though

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
can get a good sense of it even though

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.119 
can get a good sense of it even though
I'm<00:02:48.689> recording<00:02:48.989> like<00:02:49.109> I<00:02:49.170> said<00:02:49.349> it<00:02:49.980> looks

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
I'm recording like I said it looks

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.740 
I'm recording like I said it looks
better<00:02:50.340> than<00:02:50.489> my<00:02:50.639> screen<00:02:51.000> than<00:02:51.480> it<00:02:51.599> does<00:02:51.720> on

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
better than my screen than it does on

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.690 
better than my screen than it does on
yours<00:02:52.049> sadly<00:02:52.500> but<00:02:53.069> when<00:02:53.220> you<00:02:53.370> when<00:02:53.579> you

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
yours sadly but when you when you

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.580 
yours sadly but when you when you
activate<00:02:54.239> any<00:02:54.419> sort<00:02:54.599> of<00:02:54.659> recording<00:02:55.079> app<00:02:55.230> and

activate any sort of recording app and

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:14.509 
activate any sort of recording app and
it<00:02:55.950> takes<00:02:56.159> a<00:02:56.310> little<00:02:56.579> bit<00:02:56.819> of<00:02:56.879> a<00:02:57.000> hit<00:03:11.659> I<00:03:13.519> heard

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
it takes a little bit of a hit I heard

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:51.170 
it takes a little bit of a hit I heard
about<00:03:14.790> this<00:03:15.169> plane<00:03:16.169> was<00:03:49.909> really<00:03:50.909> impressive

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
about this plane was really impressive

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.640 
about this plane was really impressive
