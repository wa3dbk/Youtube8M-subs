a<00:01:40.770> few<00:01:40.920> nature's<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.400> guess<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:42.079> whilst<00:01:43.079> we<00:01:43.229> run

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
a few nature's I guess so whilst we run

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.499 
a few nature's I guess so whilst we run
around<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.979> think<00:01:44.399> we<00:01:44.520> need<00:01:44.670> some<00:01:44.850> monies<00:01:45.240> too

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
around I think we need some monies too

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.020 
around I think we need some monies too
so<00:01:45.750> I'm<00:01:45.840> gonna<00:01:45.930> make<00:01:46.049> 200k<00:01:46.710> with<00:01:46.860> me<00:01:47.040> because

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
so I'm gonna make 200k with me because

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.139 
so I'm gonna make 200k with me because
that<00:01:48.060> seems<00:01:48.450> like<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.810> good<00:01:49.020> amount<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.439> take<00:01:50.149> so

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
that seems like a good amount to take so

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.969 
that seems like a good amount to take so
what<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.299> might<00:01:51.450> do<00:01:51.689> is<00:01:51.899> just<00:01:51.930> hide<00:01:52.409> my<00:01:52.680> clenched

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
what I might do is just hide my clenched

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.090 
what I might do is just hide my clenched
up<00:01:53.159> because<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.990> saw<00:01:54.990> something<00:01:55.290> racist<00:01:55.530> before

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
up because I saw something racist before

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.429 
up because I saw something racist before
so<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.850> don't<00:01:57.030> just<00:01:57.119> have<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.659> like<00:01:58.259> off

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
so I don't just have that like off

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.160 
so I don't just have that like off
handily<00:01:58.890> in<00:01:58.920> videos<00:01:59.399> so<00:01:59.850> I'm<00:02:00.600> gonna<00:02:00.780> get<00:02:01.049> rid

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
handily in videos so I'm gonna get rid

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.990 
handily in videos so I'm gonna get rid
of<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.799> didn't<00:02:02.070> take<00:02:02.280> any<00:02:02.430> nature<00:02:02.700> in

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
of that and I didn't take any nature in

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.660 
of that and I didn't take any nature in
so<00:02:03.180> that's<00:02:03.360> fantastic<00:02:04.250> but<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.280> think<00:02:05.520> there's

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
so that's fantastic but I think there's

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.330 
so that's fantastic but I think there's
a<00:02:05.759> bank<00:02:05.969> there<00:02:06.210> anyway<00:02:06.540> so<00:02:06.829> the<00:02:07.829> fishing<00:02:08.160> gold

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
a bank there anyway so the fishing gold

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.130 
a bank there anyway so the fishing gold
I<00:02:08.520> don't<00:02:08.670> think<00:02:08.910> I've<00:02:09.000> actually<00:02:09.090> been<00:02:09.450> in<00:02:09.509> to

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
I don't think I've actually been in to

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.640 
I don't think I've actually been in to
fish<00:02:10.349> ever

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
I think I went there once maybe twice to

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.520 
I think I went there once maybe twice to
get<00:02:14.349> a<00:02:14.590> yo-yo<00:02:15.459> I<00:02:15.879> think<00:02:16.120> it<00:02:16.239> was<00:02:16.420> I<00:02:16.689> was<00:02:17.230> like<00:02:17.319> hi

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.129 
into it so I don't have a harpoon and
I'm<00:03:09.790> pretty<00:03:10.030> sure<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.299> guy<00:03:10.389> sells<00:03:10.720> one<00:03:10.900> so<00:03:11.109> I

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
set

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.330 
set
aah<00:04:25.030> at<00:04:25.420> the<00:04:25.600> moment<00:04:25.960> so<00:04:26.200> I<00:04:26.470> want<00:04:27.190> to<00:04:27.250> actually

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
aah at the moment so I want to actually

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.100 
aah at the moment so I want to actually
see<00:04:27.610> if<00:04:27.700> they're<00:04:27.880> viable<00:04:28.090> you<00:04:28.720> know<00:04:28.870> for

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.510 
see if they're viable you know for
money-making<00:04:29.710> so<00:04:30.100> I<00:04:30.130> think<00:04:30.250> that'll<00:04:30.490> be

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
money-making so I think that'll be

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.730 
money-making so I think that'll be
interesting<00:04:31.060> but<00:04:31.630> in<00:04:31.810> the<00:04:31.900> meantime<00:04:32.140> actually

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
interesting but in the meantime actually

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.890 
interesting but in the meantime actually
after<00:04:32.980> fish<00:04:33.160> these<00:04:33.400> and<00:04:33.730> it's<00:04:34.630> kind<00:04:34.840> of

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
after fish these and it's kind of

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.600 
after fish these and it's kind of
strange<00:04:35.140> having<00:04:35.410> ninety-eight<00:04:35.920> fishing<00:04:36.370> and

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
strange having ninety-eight fishing and

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.000 
strange having ninety-eight fishing and
feel<00:04:37.420> like<00:04:37.780> still<00:04:38.110> feeling<00:04:38.530> like<00:04:38.650> a<00:04:38.680> slave

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
feel like still feeling like a slave

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.560 
feel like still feeling like a slave
here<00:04:39.310> because<00:04:39.760> I<00:04:39.790> still<00:04:40.030> haven't<00:04:40.240> caught<00:04:40.540> a

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
here because I still haven't caught a

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.930 
here because I still haven't caught a
single<00:04:40.660> fish<00:04:41.490> which<00:04:42.490> is<00:04:42.610> a<00:04:42.640> little<00:04:42.820> bit

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
single fish which is a little bit

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.910 
single fish which is a little bit
embarrassing<00:04:43.210> so<00:04:43.750> I'm<00:04:43.840> not<00:04:44.050> too<00:04:44.350> sure<00:04:44.650> if<00:04:44.800> the

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
embarrassing so I'm not too sure if the

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.700 
embarrassing so I'm not too sure if the
whole<00:04:45.070> 99<00:04:45.640> is<00:04:45.880> going<00:04:46.090> to<00:04:46.180> make<00:04:46.300> it<00:04:46.450> different

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
whole 99 is going to make it different

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.280 
whole 99 is going to make it different
which<00:04:47.710> is<00:04:47.860> a<00:04:47.890> bit<00:04:48.100> upsetting<00:04:48.930> but<00:04:49.930> whilst<00:04:50.140> we

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
know smell the roses before we get the

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.300 
know smell the roses before we get the
99<00:05:00.760> itself<00:05:01.150> um<00:05:01.680> but<00:05:02.680> here<00:05:02.800> we<00:05:02.890> go<00:05:02.920> one<00:05:03.280> more

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
99 itself um but here we go one more

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.090 
99 itself um but here we go one more
shark<00:05:03.760> and<00:05:04.030> it's<00:05:04.570> hard<00:05:04.750> to<00:05:04.810> build<00:05:05.100> suspense

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
shark and it's hard to build suspense

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.090 
shark and it's hard to build suspense
because<00:05:07.030> it<00:05:07.960> can<00:05:08.200> take<00:05:08.380> after<00:05:08.770> like<00:05:08.890> 30

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
because it can take after like 30

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.150 
because it can take after like 30
seconds<00:05:09.640> to<00:05:09.730> get<00:05:09.850> a<00:05:10.030> single<00:05:10.480> shot<00:05:10.630> which<00:05:11.050> is

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
seconds to get a single shot which is

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.440 
seconds to get a single shot which is
quite<00:05:12.160> annoying<00:05:12.400> considering<00:05:13.180> the<00:05:13.300> level

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
quite annoying considering the level

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.170 
quite annoying considering the level
that<00:05:13.720> I'm<00:05:13.870> at<00:05:13.990> but<00:05:14.980> 99<00:05:15.340> fishing<00:05:15.700> for<00:05:15.880> me<00:05:16.000> has

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
that I'm at but 99 fishing for me has

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.640 
that I'm at but 99 fishing for me has
been<00:05:16.330> a<00:05:16.390> great<00:05:16.510> school<00:05:17.020> to<00:05:17.110> try<00:05:17.290> and<00:05:17.530> it's

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
been a great school to try and it's

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.350 
been a great school to try and it's
really<00:05:17.890> relaxing<00:05:18.720> and<00:05:19.720> it's<00:05:20.620> probably<00:05:20.890> the

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
really relaxing and it's probably the

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.000 
really relaxing and it's probably the
most<00:05:22.360> enjoyable<00:05:22.600> skill<00:05:23.230> I've<00:05:23.350> had<00:05:23.530> because<00:05:23.770> I

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
most enjoyable skill I've had because I

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.410 
most enjoyable skill I've had because I
always<00:05:24.160> do<00:05:24.490> it<00:05:24.550> when<00:05:24.730> I'm<00:05:24.880> doing<00:05:25.060> something

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
always do it when I'm doing something

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.440 
always do it when I'm doing something
else<00:05:25.660> and<00:05:26.490> like<00:05:27.490> whenever<00:05:27.730> I'm<00:05:27.940> editing<00:05:28.330> a

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
else and like whenever I'm editing a

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.510 
else and like whenever I'm editing a
video<00:05:28.570> I'm<00:05:29.020> probably<00:05:29.620> fishing<00:05:30.010> and<00:05:30.250> I<00:05:30.310> think

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
video I'm probably fishing and I think

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.670 
video I'm probably fishing and I think
I'm<00:05:30.610> actually<00:05:30.670> gonna<00:05:30.910> train<00:05:31.180> it<00:05:31.270> after<00:05:31.540> 99<00:05:31.840> but

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
I'm actually gonna train it after 99 but

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.380 
I'm actually gonna train it after 99 but
that's<00:05:33.220> irrelevant<00:05:33.370> at<00:05:33.820> the<00:05:33.910> moment<00:05:34.240> because

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390 
that's irrelevant at the moment because

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.140 
that's irrelevant at the moment because
99<00:05:34.960> is<00:05:35.140> now<00:05:35.380> and<00:05:35.680> I<00:05:36.490> think<00:05:36.640> it's<00:05:36.760> time<00:05:36.910> that<00:05:36.970> we

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
99 is now and I think it's time that we

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.940 
99 is now and I think it's time that we
go<00:05:37.300> get<00:05:37.540> ourselves<00:05:37.690> a<00:05:38.170> 99<00:05:38.950> fishing<00:05:39.370> kay<00:05:40.830> see<00:05:41.830> if
