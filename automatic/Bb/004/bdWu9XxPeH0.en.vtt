00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:02.909
 Hello, fresh episode of the cycle 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:04.300
 cycling alphabet 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.890
 and I am not myself in the pictures 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.029
 team activist under 13 more than that 

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:10.780
 feel spring has come 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.530
 haven't played mountain shoria yet 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.500
 Can you imagine the disassembly of the play 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.799
 Michael theme 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:16.920
 try to figure it out 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.669
 order 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:19.760
 earring 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.860
 Other details and shared trunk 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.199
 today we talk about him 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.140
 it's not even a very important part 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.609
 any course 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.480
 his choice of complete sets to 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.950
 pay special attention 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.640
 thanks to our chinese neighbors 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.090
 the market is flooded with offers 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.810
 but not every trunk can be recognized 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.570
 suitable for travel 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.200
 not to be trapped 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.660
 pay attention to the next moment 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.890
 First look at your first 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.110
 bike availability 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.160
 mount bindings i dont lead expert 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.160
 subject to one which will cover 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.360
 the trunk is not every model of education 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.740
 equally positioned 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.450
 respectively, and each trunk can 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.870
 approach your bike 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.410
 next summer material in which 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.730
 made 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.440
 the most affordable quality 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.080
 material is aluminum 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.690
 trunk long enough 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.140
 enough 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.030
 and wherein 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.490
 will reliably serve you for a long 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.650
 many kilometers 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.700
 for aluminum boot 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.149
 quality of schools is important 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.149
 pay attention to welds 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.630
 if they are not there, both said and hidden 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.060
 the trunk 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.090
 you see here there is 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.670
 bolting 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.750
 of course on earth exist and 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.740
 other types of trunk limits 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.900
 for example from titanium or maybe 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.890
 metals 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.730
 but 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.560
 all the different reasons they would be if there were 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.880
 available in Kazakhstan 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.469
 and not in the trunk they are that it is not very 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:51.810
 Expensive near two thousand five thousand yesterday 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.590
 tenge 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.390
 and sold in virtually any 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.310
 age is important all the same right 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.460
 choose 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.750
 the next moment 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.750
 pay attention is the size of the trunk 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.090
 the program for the miners hurried 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.660
 new forests 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.129
 it is important to know that you need only glad 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.090
 Shklovsky should not be broken 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.169
 centimeters 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:13.169
 but 

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:14.709
 vertical historians 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.260
 shorter than thirty five centimeters all than 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.329
 may not fit or become crooked 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:20.569
 askew 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.080
 what will be her very 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.080
 uncomfortable 

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:27.989
 since we took Armenian as a basis 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.799
 trunk you should know what its 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.569
 load capacity is a maximum of 25 30 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:33.959
 kilogram 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.099
 not worth the truth 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.099
 his visits 

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:42.239
 and huge 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.809
 two four tents 

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:45.729
 need to understand that he 

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:47.859
 the bolivar cannot bear two 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:50.589
 many ask what to do if sharpen 

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:52.199
 disc brake really before 

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:54.769
 it was a big problem and a solution 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:55.680
 this problem required 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.559
 hand-made some 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:59.200
 special linings which 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.599
 could go around 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:03.749
 brake dollars 

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:07.210
 but now the problem is solved much easier 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.740
 the Chinese make 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.750
 the trunk and the expectation that you had 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.899
 stand 

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:14.489
 disk Tomsk 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.999
 here is such a thing now 

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:18.209
 prime minister 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.529
 this is a good boot it has 

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:22.579
 similar carrying capacity he 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:23.169
 possesses similar 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.839
 technical characteristics gave 

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:28.569
 such aluminum is also durable and we 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.579
 check 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.709
 several hundred kilometers 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.199
 keeps but as for 

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:35.999
 exploitation of such trunks 

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:38.069
 there is one simple rule which 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.779
 definitely worth observing 

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:41.409
 necessarily daily before 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:43.689
 check the quality of the connection 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:45.679
 trunk with bike 

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:47.269
 say if they see 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.250
 fairly reliable tightened 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.199
 but if 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:52.679
 you have a trunk such a bolted system 

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:54.669
 connections these notes check also 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:57.399
 be sure to look through 

00:03:57.399 --> 00:03:58.959
 days to reveal flashed 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.749
 opposing the need 

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:03.749
 once she faced a similar one 

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:04.620
 Problems 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.299
 during the Chinese expedition which 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.319
 fell in 2008 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.679
 bolt loosened thread revealed 

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:13.699
 embedded parts about the sphere are also torrential 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:16.019
 attach conversations in general then 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:16.889
 there is nothing 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.030
 we puzzled over how to be in 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.359
 eventually came up with it 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.830
 point limits last whip 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.779
 keeps money 

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:27.969
 but to the sun turned solid but 

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:29.329
 all the same better of course such 

00:04:29.329 --> 00:04:32.099
 experiments to avoid 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:34.199
 held the trunk this time perhaps all 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:35.830
 if you have any questions 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.310
 Of course, write to the email box but 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.220
 dot on the map like a doggie first 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.529
 swallow cube 

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:44.199
 in brussels and tail wind back 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:45.469
 travel by bike
