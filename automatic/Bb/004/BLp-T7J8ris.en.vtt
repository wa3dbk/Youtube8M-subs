00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:08.220
 original bluetooth headset lg lg 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.500
 e730 much to your taste 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.660
 light comfortable and functional and but 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.450
 There is no limit to perfection therefore in the new 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.760
 gs 500 fg models tried to do everything 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.830
 even better the design is simple and concise 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.300
 on both ends of the rubberized handle two 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.279
 plastic block with elements 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.960
 plastic controls are mostly smooth 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.510
 only together where the buttons are located 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.039
 ribbed material not mark prints 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.439
 fingers if you stay then on white 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.450
 discreetly the headphones are inserted into 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.980
 special magnetic grooves at first 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.170
 The headset look is no different from 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.240
 older model lg e730 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.000
 but this is only the first form has changed 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.670
 control units they became a mass country 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.440
 Headphones are now not 32 grams but 29 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.300
 it takes a couple of minutes and a headset 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.400
 stop feeling and just soft 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.070
 the vibrating signal will remind her of her presence 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.720
 if you doom 730 the magnetic grooves were with 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.910
 in the new model 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.620
 down with the front arm 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.570
 far from the first time 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.180
 Well, the most important difference is the window to smoke 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.980
 gs500 has become much smaller to excess 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.170
 don't confuse the headset owner 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.030
 they were left only three comfortable and 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.890
 responsive two buttons on the left block 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.630
 responsible for adjusting the volume and 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.400
 switching and rewinding not me tracks 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.590
 one click will reduce or add 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.510
 volume double click with track keys 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.730
 and clamping includes rewinding to the desired 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.140
 moment is another multifunction 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.170
 the button is located on the right block 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.060
 here is warmer than a pause and taking this call 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.130
 the button is not as convex as those with 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.930
 left side therefore groped not 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.760
 Immediately below the button is a microphone 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.520
 speaking loudly during 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.690
 conversation you will be heard normally 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.820
 Otherwise, the headset will have to 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.320
 push closer charge false tone + 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.180
 can be through micro yusbi 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.760
 he's on dad right block and covered up 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.380
 stub full charge takes two hours 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.510
 and then you can listen to music on 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.120
 seven hours talk time 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.250
 headset hold out 9 next to the micro 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.080
 yusbi there is an LED indicator when 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.840
 the headset is on it is constantly flashing 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.150
 in blue 730 model worked with 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.860
 bluetooth protocol 30 and it was very 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.290
 strange solution in this headset 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.030
 the defect is correct it works with the version 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.429
 bluetooth 4 1 first connection 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.819
 it just happens without a problem smartphone 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.260
 finds a headset 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.790
 with a tambourine begins when needed 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.329
 switch from one device to 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.859
 other 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:16.810
 have to turn off the headset 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:18.549
 disconnect from one device again 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.680
 connect and connect to the second 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.959
 about simultaneous connection with two i 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.650
 Iâ€™m not talking about two smartphones at all 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.810
 connect 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.760
 Yes, and the headset does not see the foot after 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.639
 turning on a cute female voice with headphones 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.689
 will tell you that we have connected a headset 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:33.489
 connected and the battery charge on 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:35.500
 such a level and if you install on 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.180
 smartphone apps elji than into 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.280
 voice can read 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.349
 SMS and even a message from some 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.239
 messengers theory can be given a voice 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.370
 command to headset dialed 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.469
 number in practice she refuses it 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.629
 do and if you already recognized the command 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:51.310
 the pick is still not the number of sound 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:53.469
 We will forgive it yet 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.659
 headset they are audiophile headphones 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:58.120
 music fans will certainly say that there are bass here 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:00.280
 Do not hold out and the sound is unclean to the rest 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.500
 hbs 500 sound is fine 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.349
 the lack of wires greatly simplifies 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.250
 life and home their way and at work 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.290
 the only thing for which is not suitable 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.849
 headset is running it constantly 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.219
 bounces around your neck and appear 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.329
 feeling that she is now flying form 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:15.159
 push pods they hurt 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.650
 and the appropriate size ear cushions can be 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:19.180
 pick up included have interchangeable length 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.250
 wires are regulated by small 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.689
 plastic circles which seamlessly 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.819
 slide in the arc of the headset 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:26.919
 when headphones are not needed they hide in 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.199
 magnetic grooves dangling nothing and not 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:32.139
 interferes with unusual design autonomy 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:34.209
 sound quality all their gs500 is good except 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:36.189
 moreover, they are almost weightless for such 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.669
 lovely and already definitely gets a plus 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:38.769
 feed 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:41.099
 and plus to your karma will add like under 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.099
