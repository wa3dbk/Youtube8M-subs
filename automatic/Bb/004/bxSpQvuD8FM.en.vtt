 Hello dear friends with you resman 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.730
 and as I promised last set video 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.059
 100 likes on gold previous video i 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.630
 I will write a more detailed guide after the winter 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.660
 an elevator 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.609
 Well, I â€™ll keep my promise 100 likes 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.680
 got there 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.750
 let's get started but before that i 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.029
 I want to note a very important event for 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.670
 my channel is something that is already on the channel 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.539
 more than two thousand subscribers have gathered 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.090
 yes yes yes 2000 subscribers 2000, this same 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:38.670
 it's just this is the same as thousands only 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:48.260
 twice yah what is there zalagalo 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:48.260
 all you but 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.610
 well 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.040
 judging by such a result that already two 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.820
 Thousands of subscribers here I already like 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:07.710
 it becomes clear that shoot video has 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.890
 meaning you are interested you like you 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.140
 do 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.390
 pleasant for me that is put huskies 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.140
 subscribe to the channel watch the video and 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.119
 so on then what do I want to tell everyone 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.860
 Thank you very much 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:28.619
 for me this is a great achievement of 2000 already 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:33.009
 to between 2 and 30 and to the nose is very cool 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:38.160
 continue with the cross tutorial trusted guide 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:41.050
 I do not know themselves want to call Well Well 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.700
 as I showed you last release is 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.110
 Now I have this mucus to let fly 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.440
 we will demonstrate once again how he is 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:53.229
 working approach push the button and 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:56.740
 we rise to a given height that 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:01.799
 the section consists of three parts from us first 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.799
 the part is launching on top 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.210
 the second part is already intermediate 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.090
 which pushes us 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.380
 and the third part is final which 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:19.299
 stops us and throws on the floor 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:21.209
 Well, let's see how I will show you all 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:25.540
 working means 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:27.310
 let's start with the launching parts 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.340
 it looks like this 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.940
 that is, an obsidian base such 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.799
 the foundation is sticky piston on it 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.090
 block follow it must necessarily 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:42.910
 stick it out like this 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:47.620
 summed up growth that is click on 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:50.769
 button and ration signal is transmitted to 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.140
 Piston, too, now about 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.510
 intermediate part it looks like we have 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:00.730
 in this way here already 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:03.580
 hooks and threads are involved however 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.670
 care and build is very easy for 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:14.489
 this we are building here is the foundation 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:16.720
 as if the letter g or something yes 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.580
 installed pistons in this way 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.239
 let the company master need it 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.239
 set 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:25.620
 that is, one here and here they are here and so 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:28.420
 and here we put a block of mucus 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.050
 arrested summing up from here this hook 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:35.650
 that is, here put redstone 1 ri Peter 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:38.500
 sent to this on these pistons i'm dreaming 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.560
 here on the top porsche and he stands with us 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.709
 at maximum delay 2 repeater with us 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:48.760
 directs to the second piston and costs 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:52.269
 We have such a way for 1 delay 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:57.400
 and now let's go 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:59.769
 the final part in this way in 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.019
 We look like that is, in fact, this too 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.000
 intermediate part only instead of a 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.580
 here we use communications 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.870
 block and just one piston 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.930
 also about the delay delays and 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:17.970
 the flock is put here in third position 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:22.200
 as the second one, that is the first part 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:27.290
 launches part 2 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.290
 so take the button 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.080
 the second part throws us in and the third 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.080
 part 1 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:45.980
 pushes it all happening during 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:47.110
 Flight is now the most important thing that I forgot 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.510
 to tell 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:53.750
 blocks of mucus intermediate blocks should 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.030
 stand each other height 5 blocks then 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.070
 there is this maximum height and 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:08.030
 optimally selected delay i.e. 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:11.680
 block of mucus such will not stick hand 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:15.260
 connections so let's close by built 3 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.240
 so here are five blocks and for 6 block with us 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:21.310
 Here again is to be mucus block here 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.300
 that is, here's the porsche 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.860
 if you make less or more 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.350
 opportunity the system you will not 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.910
 work reason will work you 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:34.030
 will just throw out of it either 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:37.370
 just kill from a height 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:40.610
 about launching parts as well 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:47.930
 is located in 5 blocks and the final 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:51.500
 part is also located at 5 block 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:55.490
 Well on this, in principle , all thanks to all 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:59.419
 per-view place huskies Well 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:01.750
 let's get the contras get 150 likes to all 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:01.750
 until
