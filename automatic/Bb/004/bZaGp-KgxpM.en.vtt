currently<00:01:31.409> he's<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.710> competition<00:01:32.009> i<00:01:32.250> think

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
currently he's in a competition i think

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.249 
currently he's in a competition i think
the<00:01:32.549> Fate<00:01:32.700> arguably<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.299> favorite<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:34.229> win

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
the Fate arguably the favorite to win

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.620 
the Fate arguably the favorite to win
the<00:01:34.470> TSL<00:01:34.979> Star<00:01:35.220> League<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:36.090> little<00:01:36.540> bit

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
the TSL Star League a little bit

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.020 
the TSL Star League a little bit
redundance<00:01:37.079> there<00:01:37.290> but<00:01:37.590> he<00:01:37.860> he<00:01:38.610> just<00:01:38.850> knocked

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
redundance there but he he just knocked

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.550 
redundance there but he he just knocked
out<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.450> person<00:01:39.750> who<00:01:39.840> was<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.170> favored<00:01:40.470> I

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
out the person who was the favored I

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.719 
out the person who was the favored I
think<00:01:40.710> people<00:01:40.829> are<00:01:41.009> expecting<00:01:41.369> him<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.549> take

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
think people are expecting him to take

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.120 
think people are expecting him to take
it<00:01:41.790> now<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.299> really<00:01:43.170> his<00:01:43.380> MO<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.649> not<00:01:43.829> just

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
it now and really his MO is not just

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.649 
it now and really his MO is not just
having<00:01:44.340> strong<00:01:44.579> bill<00:01:44.759> loaders<00:01:45.030> but<00:01:45.210> really

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
having strong bill loaders but really

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.389 
having strong bill loaders but really
understanding<00:01:45.960> how<00:01:46.590> they<00:01:46.829> worked<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.340> know

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
understanding how they worked and I know

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.859 
understanding how they worked and I know
that<00:01:47.640> he<00:01:47.700> did<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.090> little<00:01:48.360> bit<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.509> work<00:01:48.689> with

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
that he did a little bit of work with

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.840 
that he did a little bit of work with
the<00:01:48.990> beta<00:01:49.170> I'm<00:01:49.619> not<00:01:49.950> quite<00:01:50.220> sure<00:01:50.250> how<00:01:50.460> much

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
the beta I'm not quite sure how much

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.920 
the beta I'm not quite sure how much
work<00:01:51.090> he's<00:01:51.240> done<00:01:51.360> or<00:01:51.540> how<00:01:51.630> men<00:01:51.780> she

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
work he's done or how men she

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.600 
work he's done or how men she
experienced<00:01:52.439> he's<00:01:52.590> had<00:01:52.770> but<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.009> think<00:01:53.399> the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
experienced he's had but I think the

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.270 
experienced he's had but I think the
majority<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:54.479> his<00:01:55.200> time<00:01:55.439> has<00:01:55.770> been<00:01:55.920> devoted<00:01:56.100> to

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
majority of his time has been devoted to

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.280 
majority of his time has been devoted to
starcraft<00:01:56.880> one<00:01:57.060> rather<00:01:57.270> than<00:01:57.390> starcraft<00:01:57.750> 2<00:01:58.079> so

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
starcraft one rather than starcraft 2 so

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.480 
starcraft one rather than starcraft 2 so
i<00:01:58.320> know<00:01:58.439> he's<00:01:58.710> not<00:01:58.799> going<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.979> have<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.310> same

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
i know he's not going to have the same

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.030 
i know he's not going to have the same
degree<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.880> playtime<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:01.200> David<00:02:01.770> Kim<00:02:01.890> has

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
degree of playtime that David Kim has

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.800 
degree of playtime that David Kim has
had<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.430> but<00:02:02.729> nevertheless<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.360> expect<00:02:03.689> a

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
had and but nevertheless I expect a

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.959 
had and but nevertheless I expect a
really<00:02:04.140> good<00:02:04.469> fight<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.100> if<00:02:05.430> anyone<00:02:05.610> can<00:02:05.820> beat

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
really good fight and if anyone can beat

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:06.680 
really good fight and if anyone can beat
him<00:02:06.090> pay<00:02:06.329> maybe

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
him pay maybe

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.630 
him pay maybe
he<00:02:06.870> can<00:02:07.020> looks<00:02:07.560> like<00:02:07.710> he<00:02:07.830> is<00:02:07.860> opening<00:02:08.250> up<00:02:08.369> with

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
he can looks like he is opening up with

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.190 
he can looks like he is opening up with
a<00:02:08.670> gateway<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.360> start<00:02:09.720> he's<00:02:09.900> also<00:02:10.020> putting

a gateway to start he's also putting

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.450 
a gateway to start he's also putting
violence<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.680> on<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:10.979> corner<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.370> he's

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
violence that on the corner and he's

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.130 
violence that on the corner and he's
hitting<00:02:11.850> views<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.330> can<00:02:12.450> see<00:02:12.600> that<00:02:12.630> chrono

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
hitting views you can see that chrono

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.470

starcraft<00:02:19.890> version<00:02:20.370> i<00:02:20.430> think<00:02:20.700> this<00:02:20.850> high

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
starcraft version i think this high

ground<00:02:21.120> is<00:02:21.480> going<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.660> be<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.870> big<00:02:22.050> factor<00:02:22.350> on

this map because and that's going to

this map because and that's going to
give<00:02:24.450> an<00:02:24.540> advantage<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.960> nuni<00:02:25.320> because

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
give an advantage to nuni because

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.800

David Kim has open up with the fast

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
expansion and I would like to say hey

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.810 
expansion and I would like to say hey
this<00:02:58.410> puts<00:02:58.680> them<00:02:58.830> even<00:02:59.100> economically<00:02:59.520> but<00:02:59.760> I

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
this puts them even economically but I

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:00.890 
this puts them even economically but I
honestly<00:02:59.940> don't<00:03:00.240> know<00:03:00.360> I<00:03:00.450> almost<00:03:00.630> feel<00:03:00.840> like

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
honestly don't know I almost feel like

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.630 
honestly don't know I almost feel like

Zerg off two bases is a little bit

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
production works in starcraft 2 because

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.120 
production works in starcraft 2 because
of<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:09.240> lot<00:03:09.360> of<00:03:09.480> new<00:03:09.600> features<00:03:09.780> like<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:10.920> warp

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
of a lot of new features like the warp

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.340 
of a lot of new features like the warp
gates<00:03:11.430> like<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.239> arms<00:03:12.690> i<00:03:12.959> think<00:03:13.140> it's<00:03:13.230> the

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
gates like the arms i think it's the

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.780 
gates like the arms i think it's the
arms<00:03:13.709> lab<00:03:13.920> where<00:03:14.130> you<00:03:14.190> can<00:03:14.340> produce<00:03:14.489> two

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
arms lab where you can produce two

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
like spawn larva with the Queen a lot of

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.870 
like spawn larva with the Queen a lot of
kind<00:03:19.380> of<00:03:19.470> utility<00:03:19.950> things<00:03:20.190> like<00:03:20.430> that<00:03:20.610> you

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
kind of utility things like that you

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.210 
kind of utility things like that you
basically<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:22.050> delay<00:03:22.380> between<00:03:22.440> getting<00:03:23.100> an

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
basically the delay between getting an

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.100 
basically the delay between getting an
economic<00:03:23.850> advantage<00:03:24.209> by<00:03:24.360> placing<00:03:24.630> a<00:03:24.840> second

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
economic advantage by placing a second

economic advantage by placing a second
hatchery<00:03:25.730> versus<00:03:26.730> when<00:03:27.390> that<00:03:27.540> kicks<00:03:27.780> in<00:03:27.959> it's

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
hatchery versus when that kicks in it's

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.479 
hatchery versus when that kicks in it's
a<00:03:28.260> lot<00:03:28.470> shorter<00:03:28.500> than<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.130> original

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
a lot shorter than the original

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.160 
a lot shorter than the original
starcraft<00:03:29.730> so<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.480> can<00:03:30.600> produce<00:03:30.750> a<00:03:30.989> lot<00:03:31.140> of

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
starcraft so you can produce a lot of

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.140 
starcraft so you can produce a lot of
units<00:03:31.530> very<00:03:31.739> quickly<00:03:32.010> as<00:03:32.340> soon<00:03:32.790> as<00:03:32.880> you<00:03:33.030> have

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
units very quickly as soon as you have

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.570 
units very quickly as soon as you have
the<00:03:33.180> minerals<00:03:33.600> available<00:03:34.020> to<00:03:34.170> use<00:03:34.320> and<00:03:34.590> i<00:03:34.860> feel

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
the minerals available to use and i feel

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.300 
the minerals available to use and i feel
like<00:03:35.700> as<00:03:35.820> a<00:03:35.850> result<00:03:36.170> having<00:03:37.170> an<00:03:37.310> economic

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
like as a result having an economic

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.190 
like as a result having an economic
advantage<00:03:38.730> is<00:03:38.910> just<00:03:39.120> all<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.600> more<00:03:39.750> powerful

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
advantage is just all the more powerful

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.479 
advantage is just all the more powerful
looks<00:03:40.620> like<00:03:40.739> new<00:03:40.860> knees<00:03:41.070> already<00:03:41.370> brought

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
looks like new knees already brought

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:42.949 
looks like new knees already brought
some<00:03:41.700> salt<00:03:41.910> off<00:03:42.120> as<00:03:42.300> long<00:03:42.480> as<00:03:42.570> probe<00:03:42.780> looks

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
some salt off as long as probe looks

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.330 
some salt off as long as probe looks
like<00:03:43.170> he's<00:03:43.470> a<00:03:43.500> little<00:03:43.769> bit<00:03:43.920> outnumbered<00:03:44.040> here

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
like he's a little bit outnumbered here

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.250 
like he's a little bit outnumbered here
and<00:03:44.790> it's<00:03:45.239> very<00:03:45.630> likely<00:03:45.810> going<00:03:46.019> to<00:03:46.080> end<00:03:46.200> up

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
and it's very likely going to end up

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.930 
and it's very likely going to end up
losing<00:03:46.680> these<00:03:46.800> troops<00:03:47.160> about<00:03:47.670> aids

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
losing these troops about aids

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.520 
losing these troops about aids
Earthlings<00:03:48.300> popping<00:03:48.660> out<00:03:48.780> that<00:03:49.230> is<00:03:49.320> going<00:03:49.470> to

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
Earthlings popping out that is going to

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.660 
Earthlings popping out that is going to
keep<00:03:49.650> David<00:03:49.890> came<00:03:50.100> from<00:03:50.250> building<00:03:50.370> from

keep David came from building from

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.550 
keep David came from building from
drones<00:03:50.910> keep<00:03:51.150> in<00:03:51.269> mind<00:03:51.450> that<00:03:51.630> these<00:03:51.959> producing

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
drones keep in mind that these producing

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.229 
drones keep in mind that these producing
certain<00:03:52.680> better<00:03:53.160> drones<00:03:53.430> but<00:03:53.640> Nunis<00:03:54.000> going<00:03:54.180> to

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
certain better drones but Nunis going to

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.729 
certain better drones but Nunis going to
end<00:03:54.330> up<00:03:54.390> losing<00:03:54.810> zealots<00:03:55.140> to<00:03:55.290> start<00:03:55.560> and

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
end up losing zealots to start and

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.440 
end up losing zealots to start and
unfortunately<00:03:56.340> I<00:03:56.790> think<00:03:56.880> he's<00:03:57.090> going<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.300> end

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
unfortunately I think he's going to end

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.690 
unfortunately I think he's going to end
up<00:03:57.540> losing<00:03:58.050> probably<00:03:58.890> the<00:03:59.280> scouting

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
up losing probably the scouting

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.610 
up losing probably the scouting
advantage<00:04:00.090> as<00:04:00.239> well<00:04:00.420> at<00:04:01.200> this<00:04:01.350> stage<00:04:01.560> you

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
advantage as well at this stage you

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.259 
advantage as well at this stage you
would<00:04:01.800> take<00:04:01.920> an<00:04:02.070> overlord<00:04:02.489> some<00:04:02.730> time<00:04:02.910> to<00:04:03.150> get

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
would take an overlord some time to get

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.220 
would take an overlord some time to get
up<00:04:03.300> there<00:04:03.510> to<00:04:03.660> provide<00:04:03.900> any<00:04:04.140> additional

up there to provide any additional

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.990 
up there to provide any additional
scouting<00:04:04.800> and<00:04:04.890> by<00:04:05.130> then<00:04:05.310> it<00:04:05.430> might<00:04:05.550> be<00:04:05.700> exposed

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
scouting and by then it might be exposed

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.580 
scouting and by then it might be exposed
to<00:04:06.060> stalkers<00:04:06.540> things<00:04:06.750> like<00:04:06.900> that<00:04:07.050> looks<00:04:07.530> like

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
to stalkers things like that looks like

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.870 
to stalkers things like that looks like
they<00:04:07.739> became<00:04:07.950> also<00:04:08.220> using<00:04:08.459> these<00:04:08.519> ill<00:04:08.730> not

they became also using these ill not

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.220 
they became also using these ill not

in<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.660> meantime<00:04:12.840> you've<00:04:13.140> got<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.470> zerglings

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
in the meantime you've got the zerglings

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.080 
in the meantime you've got the zerglings
a<00:04:14.040> little<00:04:14.430> bit<00:04:14.519> of<00:04:14.610> health<00:04:14.760> they're<00:04:14.910> going<00:04:15.030> to

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
a little bit of health they're going to

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.300 
a little bit of health they're going to
be<00:04:15.150> able<00:04:15.210> to<00:04:15.360> wander<00:04:15.540> up

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
be able to wander up

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.759 
be able to wander up
into<00:04:16.850> Nunis<00:04:17.660> main<00:04:17.900> and<00:04:18.139> noon<00:04:18.320> he's<00:04:18.440> just<00:04:18.650> not

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
into Nunis main and noon he's just not

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:19.750 
into Nunis main and noon he's just not
going<00:04:18.859> to<00:04:18.919> have<00:04:19.040> enough<00:04:19.070> to<00:04:19.340> block<00:04:19.489> it<00:04:19.669> off

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
going to have enough to block it off

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.949 
going to have enough to block it off
he's<00:04:19.940> only<00:04:20.060> got<00:04:20.209> a<00:04:20.239> single<00:04:20.419> zealot<00:04:20.780> where<00:04:20.900> he

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
he's only got a single zealot where he

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.780 
he's only got a single zealot where he
really<00:04:21.169> needs<00:04:21.320> to<00:04:21.530> salts<00:04:21.829> to<00:04:22.280> kind<00:04:22.460> of<00:04:22.520> defend

really needs to salts to kind of defend

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.340 
really needs to salts to kind of defend
this<00:04:22.940> and<00:04:23.270> he's<00:04:23.480> going<00:04:23.570> to<00:04:23.630> be<00:04:23.750> able<00:04:23.810> to<00:04:23.990> looks

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
this and he's going to be able to looks

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.720 
this and he's going to be able to looks
like<00:04:24.500> kill<00:04:24.680> one<00:04:24.950> zergling<00:04:25.310> with<00:04:25.400> that<00:04:25.520> single

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
like kill one zergling with that single

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:26.770 
like kill one zergling with that single
swipe<00:04:25.970> but<00:04:26.150> he's<00:04:26.240> not<00:04:26.330> going<00:04:26.389> to<00:04:26.510> be<00:04:26.570> able<00:04:26.630> to

swipe but he's not going to be able to

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.330 
swipe but he's not going to be able to
stop<00:04:26.870> at<00:04:27.110> second<00:04:27.380> zergling<00:04:27.650> from<00:04:28.100> wandering

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
stop at second zergling from wandering

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.680 
stop at second zergling from wandering
in<00:04:28.550> and<00:04:28.669> seeing<00:04:28.880> his<00:04:29.000> tack<00:04:29.210> and<00:04:29.389> it<00:04:29.450> looks<00:04:29.630> like

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
in and seeing his tack and it looks like

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.750 
in and seeing his tack and it looks like
nuni<00:04:29.990> going<00:04:30.169> up<00:04:30.290> to<00:04:30.410> two<00:04:30.620> gateways<00:04:30.860> and<00:04:31.310> using

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
nuni going up to two gateways and using

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.150 
nuni going up to two gateways and using
the<00:04:31.850> robotics<00:04:32.210> facility<00:04:32.330> and<00:04:32.980> looks<00:04:33.980> like

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
the robotics facility and looks like

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.909 
the robotics facility and looks like
yeah<00:04:34.460> with<00:04:34.610> that<00:04:34.639> robotics<00:04:35.090> facility<00:04:35.740> he<00:04:36.740> can

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
yeah with that robotics facility he can

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:38.080 
yeah with that robotics facility he can
do<00:04:37.070> a<00:04:37.100> lot<00:04:37.280> of<00:04:37.340> things<00:04:37.520> with<00:04:37.700> that<00:04:37.730> first<00:04:38.000> of

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
do a lot of things with that first of

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.129 
do a lot of things with that first of
all<00:04:38.150> you<00:04:38.270> can<00:04:38.360> give<00:04:38.480> an<00:04:38.570> observer<00:04:38.870> out<00:04:39.050> the

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
all you can give an observer out the

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:40.659 
all you can give an observer out the
field<00:04:39.350> keep<00:04:39.830> an<00:04:39.950> eye<00:04:40.010> on<00:04:40.040> what<00:04:40.250> David<00:04:40.490> Kim's

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
field keep an eye on what David Kim's

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:41.830 
field keep an eye on what David Kim's
doing<00:04:40.850> and<00:04:41.120> I<00:04:41.150> think<00:04:41.330> he<00:04:41.389> will<00:04:41.540> end<00:04:41.690> up<00:04:41.810> doing

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
doing and I think he will end up doing

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.510 
doing and I think he will end up doing
that<00:04:42.260> just<00:04:42.650> because<00:04:42.980> from<00:04:43.130> what<00:04:43.250> I<00:04:43.310> know<00:04:43.400> of

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
that just because from what I know of

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.370 
that just because from what I know of
nuni<00:04:43.910> he<00:04:44.090> likes<00:04:44.330> having<00:04:44.540> information<00:04:44.870> he

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
nuni he likes having information he

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.810 
nuni he likes having information he
likes<00:04:45.590> knowing<00:04:45.860> what<00:04:46.070> his<00:04:46.160> opponents<00:04:46.580> up<00:04:46.669> to

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
likes knowing what his opponents up to

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.990 
likes knowing what his opponents up to
he<00:04:47.270> tends<00:04:47.480> to<00:04:47.630> be<00:04:47.780> they<00:04:48.200> say<00:04:48.440> safe<00:04:49.040> but<00:04:49.850> he's

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
he tends to be they say safe but he's

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.340 
he tends to be they say safe but he's
definitely<00:04:50.180> one<00:04:50.510> of<00:04:50.570> those<00:04:50.690> safe<00:04:50.960> players<00:04:51.229> who

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
definitely one of those safe players who

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.650 
definitely one of those safe players who
likes<00:04:51.530> reacting<00:04:52.330> specifically<00:04:53.330> to<00:04:53.450> what<00:04:53.479> his

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
likes reacting specifically to what his

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.200 
likes reacting specifically to what his
opponents<00:04:54.110> doing<00:04:54.320> rather<00:04:54.500> than<00:04:55.030> yeah<00:04:56.030> just

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
opponents doing rather than yeah just

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.090 
opponents doing rather than yeah just
kind<00:04:56.360> of<00:04:56.479> exploiting<00:04:57.200> what<00:04:57.410> what<00:04:57.889> they're<00:04:58.070> up

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
kind of exploiting what what they're up

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.800 
kind of exploiting what what they're up
to<00:04:58.220> exploiting<00:04:58.910> weaknesses<00:04:59.240> and<00:04:59.419> their<00:04:59.600> build

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
to exploiting weaknesses and their build

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.930 
to exploiting weaknesses and their build
rather<00:05:00.380> than<00:05:00.830> trying<00:05:01.160> to<00:05:01.250> have<00:05:01.400> people<00:05:01.700> react

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
rather than trying to have people react

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.580 
rather than trying to have people react
to<00:05:02.060> what<00:05:02.180> he<00:05:02.360> is<00:05:02.450> doing<00:05:02.479> it<00:05:02.750> ultimately<00:05:03.350> ends

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
to what he is doing it ultimately ends

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.320 
to what he is doing it ultimately ends
up<00:05:03.680> that<00:05:03.860> way<00:05:04.070> but<00:05:04.130> nevertheless<00:05:04.790> I<00:05:05.090> think<00:05:05.240> he

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
up that way but nevertheless I think he

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.550 
up that way but nevertheless I think he
likes<00:05:05.450> letting<00:05:05.960> his<00:05:06.050> opponent<00:05:06.380> make<00:05:06.470> the

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
likes letting his opponent make the

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.050 
likes letting his opponent make the
first<00:05:06.770> move<00:05:06.950> and<00:05:07.160> I<00:05:07.460> think<00:05:07.639> he's<00:05:07.729> going<00:05:07.880> to<00:05:07.940> try

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
first move and I think he's going to try

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.510 
first move and I think he's going to try
to<00:05:08.090> follow<00:05:08.330> that<00:05:08.479> up<00:05:08.600> with<00:05:08.660> Colossus<00:05:09.590> once<00:05:10.370> he

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
to follow that up with Colossus once he

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.510 
to follow that up with Colossus once he
gets<00:05:11.000> down<00:05:11.090> the<00:05:11.510> robotics<00:05:11.960> bay<00:05:12.139> and<00:05:12.520> from

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
gets down the robotics bay and from

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.620 
gets down the robotics bay and from
there<00:05:13.669> he'll<00:05:13.790> be<00:05:13.850> able<00:05:14.030> to<00:05:14.150> use<00:05:14.300> this<00:05:14.450> high

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
there he'll be able to use this high

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.240 
there he'll be able to use this high
ground<00:05:14.900> to<00:05:14.960> exploit<00:05:15.320> it<00:05:15.440> and<00:05:15.560> I<00:05:15.950> think<00:05:16.160> his

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
ground to exploit it and I think his

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.469 
ground to exploit it and I think his
best<00:05:16.370> bet<00:05:16.580> will<00:05:16.669> be<00:05:16.729> to<00:05:16.850> support<00:05:17.240> that<00:05:17.270> with

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
best bet will be to support that with

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:18.730 
best bet will be to support that with
stalkers<00:05:17.690> either<00:05:17.990> way<00:05:18.200> I<00:05:18.229> think<00:05:18.440> the<00:05:18.500> best<00:05:18.680> bet

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
stalkers either way I think the best bet

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:19.870 
stalkers either way I think the best bet
for<00:05:18.860> David<00:05:19.190> came<00:05:19.310> looks<00:05:19.490> like<00:05:19.520> he's<00:05:19.669> already

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
for David came looks like he's already

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.790 
for David came looks like he's already
got<00:05:20.060> a<00:05:20.090> roach<00:05:20.270> Warren<00:05:20.600> he<00:05:20.960> is<00:05:21.080> now<00:05:21.200> upgrading

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
got a roach Warren he is now upgrading

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.710 
got a roach Warren he is now upgrading
to<00:05:21.830> layer<00:05:22.160> here<00:05:22.430> and<00:05:22.669> I<00:05:22.820> think<00:05:23.120> he<00:05:23.479> needs<00:05:23.660> to

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
to layer here and I think he needs to

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.690 
to layer here and I think he needs to
get<00:05:23.840> new<00:05:23.990> list<00:05:24.229> as<00:05:24.440> soon<00:05:24.710> as<00:05:24.800> possible<00:05:25.280> to

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
get new list as soon as possible to

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.190 
get new list as soon as possible to
reduce<00:05:25.820> the<00:05:26.090> effectiveness<00:05:26.539> of<00:05:26.630> that<00:05:26.990> high

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
reduce the effectiveness of that high

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.690 
reduce the effectiveness of that high
ground<00:05:27.500> and<00:05:27.620> especially<00:05:27.919> against<00:05:28.250> Colossus

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
ground and especially against Colossus

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.430 
ground and especially against Colossus
the<00:05:29.330> mule<00:05:29.450> escs<00:05:29.780> are<00:05:29.900> very<00:05:30.080> very<00:05:30.229> powerful

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
the mule escs are very very powerful

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.719 
the mule escs are very very powerful
looks<00:05:30.830> like<00:05:30.919> he<00:05:31.010> already<00:05:31.039> has<00:05:31.370> some<00:05:31.550> roaches

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:31.729 
looks like he already has some roaches

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:32.830 
looks like he already has some roaches
that<00:05:32.000> are<00:05:32.090> approaching<00:05:32.450> out<00:05:32.539> the<00:05:32.630> field

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
that are approaching out the field

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.690 
that are approaching out the field
engaging<00:05:33.560> these<00:05:33.770> zealots<00:05:33.950> roaches<00:05:34.430> are<00:05:34.550> very

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
engaging these zealots roaches are very

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.400 
engaging these zealots roaches are very
powerful<00:05:34.880> units<00:05:35.390> against<00:05:35.750> sell<00:05:35.960> its<00:05:36.080> first<00:05:36.289> of

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
powerful units against sell its first of

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:37.810 
powerful units against sell its first of
all<00:05:36.500> they<00:05:36.620> do<00:05:36.710> additional<00:05:37.100> biological<00:05:37.669> damage

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
all they do additional biological damage

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.240 
all they do additional biological damage
and<00:05:38.150> because<00:05:39.110> they<00:05:39.200> regenerate<00:05:39.680> so<00:05:39.830> fast<00:05:40.070> it

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
and because they regenerate so fast it

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.159 
and because they regenerate so fast it
becomes<00:05:40.490> very<00:05:40.550> difficult<00:05:40.840> results<00:05:41.840> to<00:05:41.870> engage

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 
becomes very difficult results to engage

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:43.659 
becomes very difficult results to engage
them<00:05:42.380> it<00:05:42.500> doesn't<00:05:42.680> look<00:05:42.860> like<00:05:42.950> David<00:05:43.400> Kim<00:05:43.520> has

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
them it doesn't look like David Kim has

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:45.430 
them it doesn't look like David Kim has
a<00:05:43.700> burrow<00:05:43.940> but<00:05:44.539> they<00:05:44.630> can<00:05:44.750> keep<00:05:44.900> or<00:05:45.080> treating

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
a burrow but they can keep or treating

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.110 
a burrow but they can keep or treating
and<00:05:45.530> regenerating<00:05:46.100> very<00:05:46.280> rapidly<00:05:46.639> as<00:05:46.820> long<00:05:47.000> as

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
and regenerating very rapidly as long as

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.029 
and regenerating very rapidly as long as
they're<00:05:47.210> not<00:05:47.300> getting<00:05:47.510> hit<00:05:47.950> especially<00:05:48.950> you

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:49.039 
they're not getting hit especially you

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:50.260 
they're not getting hit especially you
like<00:05:49.250> looks<00:05:49.520> like<00:05:49.639> they've<00:05:49.760> can<00:05:49.940> do<00:05:50.030> a<00:05:50.060> pretty

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
like looks like they've can do a pretty

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.700 
like looks like they've can do a pretty
good<00:05:50.330> job<00:05:50.450> micro<00:05:50.870> means<00:05:50.990> already<00:05:51.380> taken<00:05:51.650> out

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
good job micro means already taken out

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:52.779 
good job micro means already taken out
one<00:05:51.770> zealot<00:05:52.130> and<00:05:52.220> he's<00:05:52.310> going<00:05:52.400> to<00:05:52.490> have<00:05:52.580> a<00:05:52.610> hard

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789 
one zealot and he's going to have a hard

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:54.100 
one zealot and he's going to have a hard
time<00:05:52.880> micro<00:05:53.210> against<00:05:53.539> this<00:05:53.600> essentially

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
time micro against this essentially

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.629 
time micro against this essentially
because<00:05:54.560> David<00:05:54.860> Kim<00:05:54.950> can<00:05:55.130> keep<00:05:55.160> using<00:05:55.430> these

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:55.639 
because David Kim can keep using these

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:56.890 
because David Kim can keep using these
in<00:05:55.789> combination<00:05:56.300> looks<00:05:56.450> like<00:05:56.539> he's<00:05:56.660> throwing

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
in combination looks like he's throwing

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.500 
in combination looks like he's throwing
in<00:05:56.990> desert<00:05:57.229> lynxes<00:05:57.440> as<00:05:57.560> well<00:05:57.770> and<00:05:58.150> Nunis<00:05:59.150> got

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
in desert lynxes as well and Nunis got

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.650 
in desert lynxes as well and Nunis got
to<00:05:59.630> keep<00:05:59.750> chasing<00:06:00.110> me<00:06:00.229> keep<00:06:00.440> knees
