00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:10.170
 Hi girls here I am the clean face 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.090
 Let's improve this, I'll go soon. 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.389
 use this base of Mary Kay as you already 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.730
 they saw the title s video about preparation 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.470
 using only products as well as I 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.510
 I really like this base 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.760
 I have not tasted yet I have not tried either 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.119
 say another basis on a younger basis 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.320
 that they have launched the packaging 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.630
 but I'm crazy to test a 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.680
 I buy and tell you that I 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.960
 I found it but this is wonderful, I am 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.770
 in love is very sweet and you go 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.770
 see that it charges a lot 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.350
 all 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.240
 Now we're going to give a concealer on the coae. 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.820
 jury two this color is pink mother then 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.710
 You'll see she gets a little bit 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.899
 too white I'd rather evaluate than it is 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.710
 more yellow than it is stored in 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.509
 somewhere 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.520
 In my entire life I have not been able to 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.729
 find but when I spread and pass 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.310
 bronze 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:53.509
 blush everything else you will see will stay 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:56.289
 cool will stay very of course the region 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.289
 under the eyes not 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.980
 and now I will apply the compact powder 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:16.220
 this is in beige color 1 million so so 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.290
 darker than my skin but I like 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.850
 you'll see what's left of 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.320
 imperceptible 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.840
 I prefer this than to stay one 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.840
 A little bit too white to know 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.550
 This is the bronze I'm going to use it for. 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.150
 has two shades as you can 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:45.180
 see but I get it with a brush passing 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.820
 on the product and then load the two tones 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.130
 It's pretty cool, it 's ideal for 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:54.200
 told in this little potion because he is 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.200
 opaque then it is very discreet 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.960
 the kiss 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.960
 in the afternoon 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.920
 the world 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.610
 and this is the blush that I'm going to wear well day 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.100
 the day I love it it's great for 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.580
 carry in your purse and I'll put in there 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:42.230
 apple and nose then form 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.230
 a little bit to meet with ground 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:03.379
 and that's it - I hope you enjoyed the 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.379
 Kiss and see you next time.
