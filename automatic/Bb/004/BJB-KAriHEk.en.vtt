00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.970 
install we're doubling our capacity for
storage<00:00:08.550> and<00:00:08.910> we<00:00:09.750> basically<00:00:09.990> off-grid<00:00:10.950> for

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
storage and we basically off-grid for

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.700 
storage and we basically off-grid for
our<00:00:11.550> water<00:00:11.849> supply<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:13.700> this<00:00:14.700> thing<00:00:14.940> is<00:00:15.089> that

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
thing actually comes in pieces and they

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.010 
thing actually comes in pieces and they
assemble<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.960> in<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.229> situ<00:01:32.840> once<00:01:33.840> it's

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
assemble in in in situ once it's

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.910 
assemble in in in situ once it's
assembled<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:36.210> bladder<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.780> open<00:01:37.560> up<00:01:37.710> in

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
assembled the the bladder is open up in

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.600 
assembled the the bladder is open up in
in<00:01:38.220> time<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.990> fix<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.380> top<00:01:40.740> so

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
in time and fix it to the top so

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.569 
in time and fix it to the top so
basically<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:44.030> what<00:01:45.030> call<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.570> metal

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
basically this what call is to metal

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.090 
basically this what call is to metal

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
so this is now about three hours into

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:19.670 
so this is now about three hours into
into<00:04:16.049> it<00:04:16.230> and<00:04:17.360> I<00:04:18.360> reckon<00:04:18.959> is<00:04:19.080> about<00:04:19.290> four<00:04:19.560> or

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
into it and I reckon is about four or

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:35.640 
into it and I reckon is about four or
five<00:04:19.920> hours<00:04:23.210> going<00:04:24.210> round<00:04:24.450> ring

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:45.670 

this

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.260 

so<00:04:46.460> this<00:04:46.610> this<00:04:47.000> thing<00:04:47.270> is<00:04:47.479> quite<00:04:47.720> a<00:04:47.780> big<00:04:48.020> and

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
so this this thing is quite a big and

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.990 
so this this thing is quite a big and
the<00:04:50.270> water<00:04:50.600> that<00:04:50.750> fortunate<00:04:51.620> will<00:04:51.949> also<00:04:52.820> be

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
the water that fortunate will also be

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.090 
the water that fortunate will also be
captured<00:04:53.270> and<00:04:53.830> flow<00:04:54.830> into<00:04:55.009> the<00:04:55.160> tank<00:04:55.550> so<00:04:57.100> on

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
captured and flow into the tank so on

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:04.830 
captured and flow into the tank so on
the<00:04:58.280> ages

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.140 

and<00:05:05.740> they<00:05:05.889> actually<00:05:05.950> drill<00:05:06.460> holes<00:05:06.820> on<00:05:07.060> the

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
and they actually drill holes on the

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.080 
and they actually drill holes on the
ages<00:05:07.510> and<00:05:07.720> put<00:05:08.050> the

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
ages and put the

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.050 
ages and put the
rain<00:05:10.690> savers<00:05:11.520> north<00:05:12.520> of<00:05:12.700> the<00:05:12.850> rainwater

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
rain savers north of the rainwater

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.239 
rain savers north of the rainwater
deprotonate<00:05:13.990> with

00:05:17.239 --> 00:05:17.249 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:26.920 

he<00:05:18.249> is<00:05:18.489> really<00:05:18.669> good<00:05:18.939> at<00:05:18.969> just<00:05:19.299> happy

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:38.909 

breathing

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.249 

and<00:05:39.919> it's<00:05:40.069> going<00:05:40.339> round<00:05:40.519> now<00:05:40.759> putting<00:05:41.479> in<00:05:41.869> the

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:42.259 
and it's going round now putting in the

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:47.320 
and it's going round now putting in the
the<00:05:42.769> ring<00:05:42.979> saver<00:05:43.369> so<00:05:44.239> he's<00:05:44.449> drilled<00:05:45.909> 144<00:05:46.909> holes

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
the ring saver so he's drilled 144 holes

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.859 
the ring saver so he's drilled 144 holes
on<00:05:47.689> the<00:05:47.809> top<00:05:48.189> and<00:05:49.189> you're<00:05:49.610> looking<00:05:49.939> at<00:05:50.089> the

00:05:50.859 --> 00:05:50.869 
on the top and you're looking at the

00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:54.879 
on the top and you're looking at the
finish<00:05:51.199> work<00:05:51.379> now<00:05:52.509> tap<00:05:53.509> into<00:05:53.929> the<00:05:54.050> existing<00:05:54.739> a

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:54.889 
finish work now tap into the existing a

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:59.350 
finish work now tap into the existing a
pipeline<00:05:56.050> fully<00:05:57.050> in<00:05:57.289> and<00:05:57.589> then<00:05:57.769> water<00:05:58.369> even

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
pipeline fully in and then water even

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.829 
pipeline fully in and then water even
letting<00:05:59.539> outlets<00:06:00.050> in<00:06:00.529> the<00:06:00.679> same<00:06:00.889> place<00:06:01.509> so<00:06:02.509> I'm

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:02.839 
letting outlets in the same place so I'm

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:05.109 
letting outlets in the same place so I'm
going<00:06:03.050> to<00:06:03.199> drain<00:06:03.860> the<00:06:04.099> water<00:06:04.519> from<00:06:04.729> the<00:06:05.089> other

00:06:05.109 --> 00:06:05.119 
going to drain the water from the other

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:10.119 
going to drain the water from the other
tank<00:06:05.569> to<00:06:05.779> fill<00:06:05.989> up<00:06:06.139> this<00:06:08.589> and<00:06:09.589> water<00:06:09.949> is

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:10.129 
tank to fill up this and water is

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:17.769 
tank to fill up this and water is
flowing<00:06:10.369> in<00:06:10.699> so<00:06:15.669> that's<00:06:16.669> the<00:06:16.939> arrange<00:06:17.269> saver

00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:17.779 
flowing in so that's the arrange saver

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:20.079 
flowing in so that's the arrange saver
so<00:06:18.079> exactly<00:06:18.349> general<00:06:19.039> rain<00:06:19.189> water<00:06:19.429> into<00:06:19.789> the

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:20.089 
so exactly general rain water into the

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:32.370 
so exactly general rain water into the
tank<00:06:20.319> from<00:06:21.319> the<00:06:21.559> roof

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.250 

this<00:06:33.380> is<00:06:33.500> where<00:06:33.740> I<00:06:33.770> will<00:06:33.980> be<00:06:34.100> putting<00:06:34.370> the<00:06:35.260> park

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.260 
this is where I will be putting the park

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:41.440 
this is where I will be putting the park
into<00:06:37.360> from<00:06:38.360> the<00:06:38.390> roof<00:06:39.110> I<00:06:40.150> mean<00:06:41.150> while<00:06:41.330> I'm

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:41.450 
into from the roof I mean while I'm

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.690 
into from the roof I mean while I'm
filling<00:06:41.810> up<00:06:41.930> this<00:06:42.080> tank<00:06:42.410> from<00:06:42.620> the<00:06:42.710> other<00:06:42.980> poor

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:43.700 
filling up this tank from the other poor

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.790 
filling up this tank from the other poor
thing<00:06:43.940> that<00:06:44.180> we<00:06:44.300> have<00:06:44.510> you<00:06:45.020> can<00:06:45.230> see<00:06:45.410> the<00:06:45.560> water

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 
thing that we have you can see the water

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.350 
thing that we have you can see the water
is<00:06:45.950> slowly<00:06:46.450> enough<00:06:47.450> and<00:06:48.160> that<00:06:49.160> is<00:06:49.370> the<00:06:49.670> ionizer

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 
is slowly enough and that is the ionizer

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:56.950 
is slowly enough and that is the ionizer
to<00:06:51.340> prevent<00:06:52.340> rust<00:06:53.440> thanks<00:06:54.440> for<00:06:54.590> watching
