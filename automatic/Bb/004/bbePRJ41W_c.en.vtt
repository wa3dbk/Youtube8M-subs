everything<00:01:18.689> happens<00:01:19.110> how<00:01:19.950> do<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.100> do<00:01:20.220> that

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
everything happens how do you do that

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.679 
everything happens how do you do that
you<00:01:21.900> know<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.350> think<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.520> like<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:24.090> know<00:01:24.210> things

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
you know I think I like you know things

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.789 
you know I think I like you know things
in<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.259> subtle<00:01:25.770> way<00:01:25.799> not<00:01:26.310> just<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.880> your<00:01:27.330> face

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
in in a subtle way not just in your face

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.130 
in in a subtle way not just in your face
and<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:28.979> like<00:01:29.220> also<00:01:29.640> deep<00:01:29.850> music<00:01:30.329> so<00:01:30.659> sometimes

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
and I like also deep music so sometimes

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.170 
and I like also deep music so sometimes
it<00:01:31.259> takes<00:01:31.290> longer<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:32.040> as<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.549> said<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.939> really

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
it takes longer to as you said to really

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.069 
it takes longer to as you said to really
take<00:01:33.390> off<00:01:33.979> but<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.040> think<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.430> way<00:01:35.909> thing<00:01:36.420> when

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
take off but I think the way thing when

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.080 
take off but I think the way thing when
when<00:01:37.439> things<00:01:37.619> get<00:01:37.979> going<00:01:38.189> gets<00:01:38.579> really<00:01:38.850> going

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
when things get going gets really going

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.730 
when things get going gets really going
and<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.270> gets<00:01:39.420> more<00:01:39.570> excited<00:01:40.110> rather<00:01:40.290> than<00:01:40.439> if

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
and it gets more excited rather than if

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.149 
and it gets more excited rather than if
you<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:41.130> go<00:01:41.759> banging<00:01:42.060> from<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.479> start<00:01:42.780> in<00:01:43.770> in

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
you just go banging from the start in in

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.710 
you just go banging from the start in in
normally<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.700> all<00:01:44.820> my<00:01:45.000> sets<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.540> my

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
normally in all my sets and my

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.520 
normally in all my sets and my
compilations<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.649> know

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530

I'm<00:01:51.369> building<00:01:52.149> from<00:01:52.329> there<00:01:52.570> all<00:01:52.719> the<00:01:52.810> time<00:01:52.840> I

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
I'm building from there all the time I

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.319 
I'm building from there all the time I
think<00:01:53.950> is<00:01:54.189> more<00:01:54.369> interesting<00:01:54.880> but<00:01:55.030> it's<00:01:55.210> just

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
think is more interesting but it's just

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:56.789 
think is more interesting but it's just
my<00:01:55.509> point<00:01:55.689> of<00:01:55.869> view<00:01:55.929> all<00:01:56.170> the<00:01:56.259> people<00:01:56.530> thing<00:01:56.679> is

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
my point of view all the people thing is

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:03.270 
my point of view all the people thing is
boring<00:02:01.109> is<00:02:02.109> it<00:02:02.350> something<00:02:02.560> that<00:02:02.710> was<00:02:03.009> with<00:02:03.159> you

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
boring is it something that was with you

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.830 
boring is it something that was with you
from<00:02:03.429> the<00:02:03.579> beginning<00:02:03.670> or<00:02:04.119> does<00:02:04.329> it<00:02:04.450> gradually

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
from the beginning or does it gradually

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.870 
from the beginning or does it gradually
did<00:02:05.319> it<00:02:05.409> gradually<00:02:05.710> shape<00:02:06.100> you<00:02:06.369> or<00:02:06.670> did<00:02:06.850> you

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
did it gradually shape you or did you

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.559 
did it gradually shape you or did you
gradually<00:02:07.780> shape<00:02:08.110> it<00:02:08.319> well<00:02:09.310> I<00:02:09.340> always<00:02:10.000> liked

but there's common denominators that you

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.240 
but there's common denominators that you
always<00:02:17.019> find<00:02:17.319> like<00:02:17.650> you<00:02:17.680> know<00:02:17.890> like<00:02:18.099> the

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
for up for a piece of hardware and

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.340 
for up for a piece of hardware and
software<00:03:43.610> that<00:03:43.820> you<00:03:44.090> you<00:03:44.300> could<00:03:44.510> work<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:45.170> way

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
software that you you could work the way

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.140 
software that you you could work the way
we<00:03:46.250> will<00:03:46.460> be<00:03:46.700> with<00:03:47.420> this<00:03:47.570> machine<00:03:47.900> you<00:03:48.050> know

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
we will be with this machine you know

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.020 
we will be with this machine you know
it's<00:03:50.150> really<00:03:50.420> a<00:03:50.570> step<00:03:51.110> forward<00:03:51.650> in<00:03:51.770> in<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:52.850> way

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
it is a great great step forward it may

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.830 
it is a great great step forward it may
take<00:04:06.530> time<00:04:06.800> for<00:04:07.340> club<00:04:07.760> because<00:04:08.090> the<00:04:08.210> only

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
gonna spread really really quickly so I

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.370 
gonna spread really really quickly so I
look<00:04:22.760> forward<00:04:23.060> to<00:04:23.090> that<00:04:23.210> I<00:04:23.630> look<00:04:24.110> forward<00:04:24.350> to

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.040 

I<00:04:32.070> think<00:04:33.070> the<00:04:33.220> most<00:04:33.400> important<00:04:33.970> thing<00:04:34.150> for<00:04:34.990> a

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
I think the most important thing for a

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.840 
I think the most important thing for a
DJ<00:04:35.850> which<00:04:36.850> in<00:04:37.300> some<00:04:37.690> ways<00:04:37.870> is<00:04:38.169> entertainer<00:04:38.979> is

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
DJ which in some ways is entertainer is

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.180 
DJ which in some ways is entertainer is
the<00:04:40.210> way<00:04:40.389> you<00:04:40.449> entertain<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.169> people<00:04:41.500> not

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
the way you entertain the people not

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.870 
the way you entertain the people not
really<00:04:42.460> how<00:04:43.449> you<00:04:43.509> do<00:04:43.900> it<00:04:44.050> you<00:04:44.919> know<00:04:45.039> I<00:04:45.070> mean<00:04:45.340> so

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
really how you do it you know I mean so

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.580 
really how you do it you know I mean so
the<00:04:46.419> most<00:04:46.660> important<00:04:47.050> thing<00:04:47.199> is<00:04:47.320> what<00:04:47.500> it

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
the most important thing is what it

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.980 
the most important thing is what it
comes<00:04:47.770> from<00:04:47.949> the<00:04:48.100> speakers<00:04:48.539> if<00:04:49.539> you<00:04:49.720> play<00:04:49.930> them

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
comes from the speakers if you play them

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.590 
comes from the speakers if you play them
from<00:04:50.380> vinyl<00:04:50.620> from<00:04:51.070> cities<00:04:51.490> from<00:04:51.880> a<00:04:51.970> laptop<00:04:52.150> or

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
from a harddrive it doesn't really

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.550 
from a harddrive it doesn't really
matter<00:04:54.610> as<00:04:54.880> long<00:04:54.940> as<00:04:55.300> what<00:04:55.870> you<00:04:55.990> do<00:04:56.139> is<00:04:56.320> right
