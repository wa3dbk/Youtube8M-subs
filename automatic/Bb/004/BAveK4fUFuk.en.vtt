is<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.250> method<00:02:17.400> brewing<00:02:17.730> up<00:02:17.820> to<00:02:17.940> do<00:02:18.090> also

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
is the method brewing up to do also

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
another reason to pick this up would be

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.110 
another reason to pick this up would be
