00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.290
 there in apocalypse chapter two 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.290
 verses 6 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:16.139
 we have a reference to the written letter 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:18.750
 to the church of Ephesus and in apocalypse 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.529
 chapter two verses 16 we have another 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:26.160
 reference in the letter written to the 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.380
 the reference that sometimes is a 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.820
 It's a little obscure, sometimes we do not 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.750
 understands very well what is being 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:39.660
 because the reference is the 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.070
 of the nicolai tas and then we get a 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.340
 little lost because we have to 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.039
 turn to the history of the church 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.559
 to know who these nicolasai were 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.629
 which are referred to here because it is not a 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.399
 segment that we have in our 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.320
 more but when we go to aa story 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.809
 we see that the collections 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.920
 they were a segment they met 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:09.090
 inside the church of God but they were 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.640
 a segment that looked exactly 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.299
 this kind of life that we see in 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.310
 contemporary church today is part of the 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.000
 church but does not want much differentiation 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.150
 of the world's lifestyle is part of the 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.860
 church is inside the church and receives 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.290
 blessings of the church because who is in the 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.909
 church ends up receiving some blessing 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:36.810
 but the heart is out there 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:39.390
 the practice of life outside those of colleges 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.500
 they were known for the licentious 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.390
 the moral laxity of 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.450
 practices 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.649
 the nicolai they were known for 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:55.579
 also why they participated 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:58.500
 intensely in the pagan festivities 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:01.100
 seems similar in that situation that 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.500
 we are meeting in our days 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:08.610
 well there in the coffee cycle chapter 6 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.790
 2 writing the church from Ephesus to the church 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.770
 s this is false is praised and says so 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.700
 Do you still have the favor? 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.730
 who hates the works of Nicolai Tas 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.730
 Which ones do I hate too? 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.870
 they were in the middle of the church were 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.580
 part of the church 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.050
 But God is saying I have nothing 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.480
 to do with these works 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:36.210
 they are among my people but not 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:40.110
 are part of my audience and the church of 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:44.340
 Ephesus also reproved the works of the 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.160
 there in the church of Pergamum at a 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.420
 reference to the necklaces in the verse 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:54.660
 16 but it 's different says so 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.160
 also this has jesus who gives 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.720
 same way 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:04.020
 support the Nicolai doctrine of the 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.980
 they were there with intensity inside 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:10.920
 of the church of Pergamum in the church of Ephesus 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.200
 they had been identified and the church 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.710
 had disciplined and had nothing to do with 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.560
 see with them and god praises church but in 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:22.770
 catch church they are in the middle 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:26.610
 of the church and the call is 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:30.900
 so repent if you do not come here 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:36.380
 without delay and against them I fight and with 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.380
 the sword of my mouth
