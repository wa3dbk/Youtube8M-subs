00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:06.279 
this is part two of this never-ending

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:10.450 
this is part two of this never-ending
saga<00:00:08.290> so<00:00:09.290> Chris<00:00:09.560> why<00:00:09.770> are<00:00:09.830> you<00:00:10.010> why<00:00:10.310> do<00:00:10.370> you

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 
saga so Chris why are you why do you

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.920 
saga so Chris why are you why do you
have<00:00:10.550> to<00:00:10.640> take<00:00:10.790> the<00:00:10.910> hub<00:00:11.060> off<00:00:11.270> here<00:00:11.570> we<00:00:11.750> didn't

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:11.930 
have to take the hub off here we didn't

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.450 
have to take the hub off here we didn't
want<00:00:12.080> to<00:00:12.110> dig<00:00:12.290> that<00:00:12.410> far<00:00:12.620> into<00:00:12.830> it<00:00:12.950> all<00:00:13.310> the

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.460 
want to dig that far into it all the

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.179 
want to dig that far into it all the
backing<00:00:13.850> plates<00:00:14.090> are<00:00:14.270> put<00:00:14.420> on<00:00:14.540> backwards

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:15.189 
backing plates are put on backwards

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:17.830 
backing plates are put on backwards
so<00:00:16.189> the<00:00:16.400> brakes<00:00:16.670> were<00:00:16.910> installed<00:00:17.330> backwards

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
so the brakes were installed backwards

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.980 
so the brakes were installed backwards
so<00:00:18.290> you<00:00:18.320> have<00:00:18.590> the<00:00:18.920> the<00:00:19.190> brakes<00:00:20.000> operating<00:00:20.870> as

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
so you have the the brakes operating as

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.170 
so you have the the brakes operating as
if<00:00:21.200> the<00:00:21.530> truck<00:00:21.770> was<00:00:21.950> being<00:00:22.130> driven<00:00:22.400> in<00:00:22.610> Reverse

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
if the truck was being driven in Reverse

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.410 
if the truck was being driven in Reverse
right<00:00:24.050> yeah<00:00:24.500> that's<00:00:24.740> safe<00:00:25.070> these<00:00:25.820> these

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
right yeah that's safe these these

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.720 
right yeah that's safe these these
brakes<00:00:26.930> barely<00:00:27.470> work<00:00:27.710> in<00:00:27.890> Reverse<00:00:28.220> as<00:00:28.460> it<00:00:28.610> is

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
brakes barely work in Reverse as it is

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.250 
brakes barely work in Reverse as it is
so<00:00:29.529> they<00:00:30.529> did<00:00:30.830> it<00:00:30.949> front<00:00:31.190> two<00:00:31.989> will<00:00:32.989> leave<00:00:33.109> the

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
so they did it front two will leave the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.910 
so they did it front two will leave the
front<00:00:33.440> and<00:00:33.739> back<00:00:34.039> Yelp<00:00:34.399> reversed<00:00:35.620> so<00:00:36.620> that's

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
front and back Yelp reversed so that's

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.979 
front and back Yelp reversed so that's
the<00:00:37.159> adjuster<00:00:37.699> for<00:00:37.999> the<00:00:38.059> brake<00:00:38.269> shoe<00:00:38.539> and<00:00:38.809> that

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
the adjuster for the brake shoe and that

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.290 
the adjuster for the brake shoe and that
is<00:00:39.319> to<00:00:39.679> adjust<00:00:39.800> the<00:00:40.129> leading<00:00:40.609> shoe<00:00:40.879> so<00:00:41.149> the

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
is to adjust the leading shoe so the

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.969 
is to adjust the leading shoe so the
shoe<00:00:41.809> that<00:00:41.989> goes<00:00:42.170> in<00:00:42.319> the<00:00:42.379> front<00:00:42.620> the<00:00:42.710> one<00:00:42.829> that

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:42.979 
shoe that goes in the front the one that

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:46.329 
shoe that goes in the front the one that
takes<00:00:43.219> most<00:00:43.609> of<00:00:43.819> the<00:00:44.260> most<00:00:45.260> of<00:00:45.499> the<00:00:45.679> us<00:00:45.859> that

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:46.339 
takes most of the most of the us that

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:48.040 
takes most of the most of the us that
produces<00:00:46.729> most<00:00:46.909> of<00:00:47.030> the<00:00:47.120> stopping<00:00:47.539> power<00:00:47.719> and

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
produces most of the stopping power and

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.399 
produces most of the stopping power and
that's<00:00:48.859> got<00:00:49.489> to<00:00:49.639> be<00:00:49.789> put<00:00:50.539> on<00:00:50.659> that<00:00:50.809> side<00:00:51.139> and

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:51.409 
that's got to be put on that side and

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:53.649 
that's got to be put on that side and
that<00:00:51.469> side<00:00:51.559> has<00:00:52.069> to<00:00:52.159> be<00:00:52.249> put<00:00:52.399> on<00:00:52.519> this<00:00:52.639> side<00:00:52.909> so

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:53.659 
that side has to be put on this side so

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:55.930 
that side has to be put on this side so
all<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.260> hubs<00:00:54.440> need<00:00:54.739> to<00:00:54.829> be<00:00:54.949> taken<00:00:55.549> apart<00:00:55.819> so

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
all the hubs need to be taken apart so

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.639 
all the hubs need to be taken apart so
we<00:00:56.059> can<00:00:56.210> get<00:00:56.299> those<00:00:56.420> backing<00:00:56.690> plates<00:00:57.109> off<00:00:57.379> all

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
we can get those backing plates off all

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.709 
we can get those backing plates off all
the<00:00:58.010> lines<00:00:58.249> need<00:00:58.579> to<00:00:58.729> all<00:00:58.969> the<00:00:59.120> hoses<00:00:59.269> need<00:00:59.600> to

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
the lines need to all the hoses need to

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.919 
the lines need to all the hoses need to
come<00:00:59.870> off<00:01:00.049> again<00:01:00.440> um<00:01:01.179> it's<00:01:02.179> just<00:01:02.569> it's<00:01:02.809> just

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:02.929 
come off again um it's just it's just

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:05.439 
come off again um it's just it's just
going<00:01:03.199> to<00:01:03.289> be<00:01:03.379> a<00:01:03.409> project<00:01:03.649> um<00:01:04.339> you<00:01:04.909> can<00:01:05.059> see<00:01:05.089> we

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
going to be a project um you can see we

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.980 
going to be a project um you can see we
replace<00:01:05.869> the<00:01:06.229> springs<00:01:06.909> because<00:01:07.909> you<00:01:08.780> want<00:01:08.960> to

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
replace the springs because you want to

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.600 
replace the springs because you want to
explain<00:01:09.289> that<00:01:09.350> one<00:01:09.680> Chris<00:01:09.890> why<00:01:10.159> do<00:01:10.219> we<00:01:10.430> have<00:01:10.520> to

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
explain that one Chris why do we have to

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.429 
explain that one Chris why do we have to
replace<00:01:10.909> the<00:01:11.119> springs<00:01:11.420> the<00:01:11.659> front<00:01:12.049> was<00:01:12.200> only<00:01:12.409> a

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
replace the springs the front was only a

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.469 
replace the springs the front was only a
one-inch<00:01:12.799> difference<00:01:13.250> but<00:01:13.850> the<00:01:14.000> rear<00:01:14.180> was<00:01:14.450> a

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
one-inch difference but the rear was a

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.359 
one-inch difference but the rear was a
two<00:01:14.719> inch<00:01:14.899> difference<00:01:15.079> so<00:01:15.320> this<00:01:15.439> thing<00:01:15.649> you're

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
two inch difference so this thing you're

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.190 
two inch difference so this thing you're
probably<00:01:16.609> felt<00:01:17.180> like<00:01:17.329> it<00:01:17.479> was<00:01:17.570> it<00:01:17.750> was<00:01:17.869> leaning

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
probably felt like it was it was leaning

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.899 
probably felt like it was it was leaning
well<00:01:18.350> yeah<00:01:18.560> we'll<00:01:18.829> put<00:01:18.950> we'll<00:01:19.250> put<00:01:19.280> a<00:01:19.430> photo<00:01:19.670> in

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
well yeah we'll put we'll put a photo in

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.050 
well yeah we'll put we'll put a photo in
there<00:01:20.119> of<00:01:20.479> the<00:01:20.630> lean<00:01:21.250> we<00:01:22.250> got<00:01:22.399> this<00:01:22.549> we<00:01:22.789> got<00:01:22.820> the

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
there of the lean we got this we got the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.550 
there of the lean we got this we got the
springs<00:01:23.390> done

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
springs done

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.069 
springs done
we<00:01:25.070> got<00:01:25.219> bump<00:01:25.640> stops<00:01:25.969> in<00:01:26.210> there<00:01:26.450> where<00:01:26.930> those

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
we got bump stops in there where those

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.459 
we got bump stops in there where those
were<00:01:27.259> missing<00:01:27.649> and<00:01:28.659> we<00:01:29.659> started<00:01:30.020> working<00:01:30.259> on

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:30.469 
were missing and we started working on

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:33.310 
were missing and we started working on
the<00:01:30.619> brakes<00:01:30.890> I<00:01:31.359> mean<00:01:32.359> every<00:01:32.689> single<00:01:32.869> part<00:01:33.229> of

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
the brakes I mean every single part of

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.590 
the brakes I mean every single part of
this<00:01:33.409> brake<00:01:33.619> system<00:01:34.039> who<00:01:34.159> was<00:01:34.369> was<00:01:35.000> faulty<00:01:35.450> so

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
this brake system who was was faulty so

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.029 
this brake system who was was faulty so
we<00:01:35.689> started<00:01:36.049> getting<00:01:36.109> the<00:01:36.320> brakes<00:01:36.530> in<00:01:36.770> so<00:01:36.950> we

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
we started getting the brakes in so we

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:39.279 
we started getting the brakes in so we
got<00:01:37.189> the<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:38.119> can<00:01:38.240> see<00:01:38.359> the<00:01:38.450> hydraulic<00:01:39.020> clutch

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
got the you can see the hydraulic clutch

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.950 
got the you can see the hydraulic clutch
system<00:01:40.070> is<00:01:40.490> is<00:01:40.729> almost<00:01:41.179> all<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:41.479> way<00:01:41.600> plumbed

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
system is is almost all the way plumbed

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.529 
system is is almost all the way plumbed
in<00:01:42.200> we<00:01:43.189> got<00:01:43.340> a<00:01:43.369> new<00:01:43.549> reservoir<00:01:43.969> since<00:01:44.359> they

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
in we got a new reservoir since they

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.959 
in we got a new reservoir since they
method<00:01:44.960> since<00:01:45.170> they<00:01:45.320> mangled<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:45.859> the<00:01:46.789> lower

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
method since they mangled the the lower

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.779 
method since they mangled the the lower
feed<00:01:47.329> for<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.659> clutch<00:01:47.929> on<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.200> old<00:01:48.380> one<00:01:48.789> new

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
feed for the clutch on the old one new

rawlings are now in place all right so
you<00:02:14.490> can<00:02:14.520> see<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.880> difference<00:02:15.330> in<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.630> brake

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
you can see the difference in the brake

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.320 
you can see the difference in the brake
line<00:02:16.140> fittings<00:02:16.700> basically<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.880> fitting<00:02:18.240> on

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
line fittings basically the fitting on

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.970 
line fittings basically the fitting on
the<00:02:18.390> left<00:02:18.570> is<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.870> regular<00:02:19.230> British<00:02:19.500> fittings

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
the left is the regular British fittings

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.430 
the left is the regular British fittings
and<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.550> one<00:02:20.760> on<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.970> right<00:02:21.210> is<00:02:21.390> American<00:02:21.900> you

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
and the one on the right is American you

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.410 
and the one on the right is American you
could<00:02:22.590> see<00:02:22.890> that<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.490> American<00:02:23.940> one<00:02:24.120> has

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
could see that the American one has

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.570 
could see that the American one has
threads<00:02:24.990> going<00:02:25.350> all<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.710> way<00:02:25.740> down<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.490> the

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
threads going all the way down to the

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.390 
threads going all the way down to the
end<00:02:26.760> well<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.960> problem<00:02:28.530> is<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:29.220> wheel

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
end well the problem is that the wheel

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.490 
end well the problem is that the wheel
cylinders<00:02:30.000> aren't<00:02:30.660> threaded<00:02:31.080> all<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.320> way

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
cylinders aren't threaded all the way

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.590 
cylinders aren't threaded all the way
down<00:02:31.830> to<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.040> bottom<00:02:32.370> there's<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.610> tiny<00:02:32.910> little

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
down to the bottom there's a tiny little

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.870 
down to the bottom there's a tiny little
spot<00:02:34.590> that<00:02:34.800> isn't<00:02:35.130> threaded<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:35.760> that

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
spot that isn't threaded and that

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.510 
spot that isn't threaded and that
doesn't<00:02:36.210> allow<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.710> line<00:02:37.710> to<00:02:38.010> seat<00:02:38.310> properly

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
doesn't allow the line to seat properly

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.960 
doesn't allow the line to seat properly
in<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.360> in<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.660> wheel<00:02:39.840> cylinder<00:02:40.320> so<00:02:40.850> using<00:02:41.850> a

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
in the in the wheel cylinder so using a

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.260 
in the in the wheel cylinder so using a
fitting<00:02:42.750> like<00:02:42.930> that<00:02:43.140> is<00:02:44.090> just<00:02:45.090> plain

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
fitting like that is just plain

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.940 
fitting like that is just plain
dangerous<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:45.870> mean<00:02:45.900> it's<00:02:46.140> not<00:02:46.230> it's<00:02:46.560> giving

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
dangerous I mean it's not it's giving

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.490 
dangerous I mean it's not it's giving
air<00:02:47.490> a<00:02:47.520> passageway<00:02:48.300> in<00:02:48.720> if<00:02:48.900> it's<00:02:49.050> not<00:02:49.230> sealed

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
air a passageway in if it's not sealed

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.340 
air a passageway in if it's not sealed
perfectly<00:02:50.070> so<00:02:50.430> we<00:02:51.060> need<00:02:51.240> to<00:02:51.420> take<00:02:51.840> every

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
perfectly so we need to take every

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.500 
perfectly so we need to take every
single<00:02:52.740> one<00:02:52.860> of<00:02:52.920> those<00:02:53.130> off<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:53.880> replace<00:02:54.300> it

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510

mangled<00:04:04.160> well<00:04:05.160> it's<00:04:05.310> that<00:04:05.430> goop<00:04:05.670> it<00:04:05.820> looks

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
mangled well it's that goop it looks

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.900 
mangled well it's that goop it looks
like<00:04:06.120> glue<00:04:06.360> yeah<00:04:06.990> it's<00:04:07.140> some<00:04:07.320> kind<00:04:07.560> of<00:04:07.850> sealant

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
like glue yeah it's some kind of sealant

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.150 
like glue yeah it's some kind of sealant
but<00:04:09.540> here's<00:04:10.020> one<00:04:10.290> nut<00:04:10.620> here's<00:04:11.490> a<00:04:11.630> second<00:04:12.630> nut

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
but here's one nut here's a second nut

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.530 
but here's one nut here's a second nut
yeah<00:04:14.160> those<00:04:14.370> are<00:04:14.490> undersized<00:04:14.910> that's<00:04:15.270> not<00:04:15.420> the

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
yeah those are undersized that's not the

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.430 
yeah those are undersized that's not the
right<00:04:15.720> size<00:04:15.930> bolt

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
right size bolt

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.210 
right size bolt
Briella<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.950> whole<00:04:17.100> thing<00:04:17.310> is<00:04:17.430> incorrect<00:04:19.220> why

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
Briella the whole thing is incorrect why

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.800 
Briella the whole thing is incorrect why
would<00:04:20.400> they<00:04:20.489> use<00:04:20.520> undersized<00:04:21.150> bolts<00:04:21.570> on<00:04:21.690> it

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
would they use undersized bolts on it

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:22.970 
would they use undersized bolts on it
and<00:04:21.959> something<00:04:22.260> as<00:04:22.470> important<00:04:22.860> as<00:04:22.920> your

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
and something as important as your

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.350 
and something as important as your
backing<00:04:23.280> as<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:23.730> backing<00:04:24.030> plate<00:04:24.210> and

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
backing as the backing plate and

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.520 
backing as the backing plate and
actually<00:04:24.450> that<00:04:24.690> holds<00:04:24.990> the<00:04:25.080> until<00:04:25.320> you<00:04:25.440> know

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
actually that holds the until you know

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:26.960 
actually that holds the until you know
that<00:04:25.680> holds<00:04:25.860> the<00:04:25.920> entire<00:04:26.010> spindle<00:04:26.640> onto<00:04:26.880> the

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
that holds the entire spindle onto the

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.570 
that holds the entire spindle onto the
axle<00:04:27.360> to<00:04:27.540> those<00:04:28.440> bolts<00:04:28.860> why<00:04:28.980> would<00:04:29.160> they<00:04:29.250> skip

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
axle to those bolts why would they skip

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.760 
axle to those bolts why would they skip
on<00:04:29.760> that<00:04:29.940> no<00:04:30.270> lock<00:04:30.510> washers<00:04:31.050> also<00:04:31.560> no<00:04:31.910> right<00:04:33.770> no

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
on that no lock washers also no right no

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
on that no lock washers also no right no
lock<00:04:35.010> washer<00:04:35.220> so<00:04:35.670> literally<00:04:37.340> it's<00:04:38.340> bosta

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
lock washer so literally it's bosta

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.860 
lock washer so literally it's bosta
they're<00:04:39.030> supposed<00:04:39.240> to<00:04:39.270> have<00:04:39.360> nylock<00:04:39.810> nuts<00:04:40.110> and

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
they're supposed to have nylock nuts and

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.170 
they're supposed to have nylock nuts and
they<00:04:42.870> use<00:04:43.170> no<00:04:43.860> BA<00:04:44.130> kua<00:04:44.190> I<00:04:44.520> mean<00:04:44.670> is<00:04:44.790> that<00:04:44.820> lock

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
they use no BA kua I mean is that lock

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.640 
they use no BA kua I mean is that lock
saitama<00:04:45.600> I<00:04:45.750> don't<00:04:45.930> think<00:04:46.050> that's<00:04:46.170> lock<00:04:46.380> tight

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
saitama I don't think that's lock tight

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.340 
saitama I don't think that's lock tight
yeah<00:04:46.860> it's<00:04:47.360> so<00:04:48.360> something<00:04:48.840> they<00:04:48.930> put<00:04:49.140> some

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
yeah it's so something they put some

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.020 
yeah it's so something they put some
kind<00:04:49.440> of<00:04:49.530> glue<00:04:49.800> on<00:04:49.980> the<00:04:50.070> head<00:04:50.280> of<00:04:50.400> it<00:04:50.520> and<00:04:50.640> apart

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
kind of glue on the head of it and apart

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.660 
kind of glue on the head of it and apart
like<00:04:51.560> a<00:04:52.730> Permatex<00:04:54.050> all<00:04:55.050> right<00:04:55.230> so<00:04:55.380> basically

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
like a Permatex all right so basically

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.730 
like a Permatex all right so basically
these<00:04:56.670> bolts<00:04:57.180> hold<00:04:57.450> the<00:04:57.690> spindle<00:04:57.960> to<00:04:58.260> the<00:04:58.350> axle

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
these bolts hold the spindle to the axle

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.280 
these bolts hold the spindle to the axle
if<00:04:58.950> the<00:04:59.640> nuts<00:04:59.910> vibrate<00:05:00.450> off<00:05:00.600> the<00:05:00.750> back<00:05:00.960> the

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
if the nuts vibrate off the back the

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.020 
if the nuts vibrate off the back the
spindle<00:05:01.680> is<00:05:01.740> gonna<00:05:01.860> fall<00:05:02.100> off<00:05:02.310> and<00:05:02.640> your<00:05:02.850> wheel

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
spindle is gonna fall off and your wheel

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.700 
spindle is gonna fall off and your wheel
is<00:05:03.060> gonna<00:05:03.450> fall<00:05:03.750> off<00:05:03.930> so<00:05:04.170> your<00:05:04.350> wheel<00:05:04.530> is

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
is gonna fall off so your wheel is

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.410 
is gonna fall off so your wheel is
actually<00:05:04.980> gonna<00:05:05.070> fall<00:05:05.400> off<00:05:05.700> the<00:05:05.730> car<00:05:06.150> there's

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420 
actually gonna fall off the car there's

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.910 
actually gonna fall off the car there's
nothing<00:05:06.810> else<00:05:06.930> holding<00:05:07.350> your<00:05:07.470> wheel<00:05:07.680> to<00:05:07.890> the

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
nothing else holding your wheel to the

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.180 
nothing else holding your wheel to the
axle<00:05:08.430> other<00:05:08.880> than<00:05:09.450> these<00:05:09.690> six<00:05:10.020> bolts<00:05:10.260> the

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
axle other than these six bolts the

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.090 
axle other than these six bolts the
right<00:05:11.370> see<00:05:12.090> these<00:05:12.270> washers<00:05:12.830> those<00:05:13.830> lock

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
right see these washers those lock

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.740 
right see these washers those lock
washers<00:05:14.490> are<00:05:14.640> too<00:05:14.790> big<00:05:15.000> there's<00:05:15.300> you<00:05:15.540> have<00:05:15.600> to

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
washers are too big there's you have to

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.480 
washers are too big there's you have to
use<00:05:15.930> the<00:05:16.140> original<00:05:16.560> Land<00:05:16.770> Rover<00:05:17.100> the<00:05:17.190> smaller

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
use the original Land Rover the smaller

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.400 
use the original Land Rover the smaller
lock<00:05:17.790> washers<00:05:18.240> because<00:05:18.690> look<00:05:18.870> it<00:05:19.020> hits<00:05:19.230> the

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
lock washers because look it hits the

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.530 
lock washers because look it hits the
backing<00:05:19.800> plate<00:05:20.010> there<00:05:20.250> it<00:05:20.880> doesn't<00:05:21.330> it

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
backing plate there it doesn't it

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.300 
backing plate there it doesn't it
doesn't<00:05:21.870> well<00:05:22.260> yeah<00:05:22.560> it<00:05:22.680> doesn't<00:05:22.830> they<00:05:23.280> don't

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
doesn't well yeah it doesn't they don't

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.460 
doesn't well yeah it doesn't they don't
it<00:05:23.940> doesn't<00:05:24.060> not<00:05:24.420> work<00:05:24.450> with<00:05:24.840> those<00:05:24.990> you<00:05:25.380> have

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
it doesn't not work with those you have

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.220 
it doesn't not work with those you have
to<00:05:25.590> use<00:05:25.710> the<00:05:25.890> original<00:05:26.310> style<00:05:26.810> so<00:05:27.810> we'll<00:05:28.050> put

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.230 
to use the original style so we'll put

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.850 
to use the original style so we'll put
those<00:05:28.350> in<00:05:28.560> at<00:05:28.680> the<00:05:28.740> same<00:05:28.860> time<00:05:30.710> yeah<00:05:31.710> so

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
those in at the same time yeah so

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.370 
those in at the same time yeah so
basically<00:05:32.160> the<00:05:32.400> the<00:05:32.790> race<00:05:33.000> for<00:05:33.330> the<00:05:33.540> seal<00:05:34.140> is

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
basically the the race for the seal is

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.980 
basically the the race for the seal is
all<00:05:34.560> corroded<00:05:34.800> and<00:05:35.280> pitted<00:05:35.610> and<00:05:35.760> scored<00:05:36.690> so

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
all corroded and pitted and scored so

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.960 
all corroded and pitted and scored so
we'll<00:05:37.140> replace<00:05:37.380> that<00:05:37.680> too<00:05:37.950> because<00:05:38.610> the<00:05:38.820> hub

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
we'll replace that too because the hub

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.760 
we'll replace that too because the hub
seals<00:05:39.210> were<00:05:39.420> leaking<00:05:39.750> and<00:05:39.900> they<00:05:39.960> look<00:05:40.140> new<00:05:40.350> so

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
seals were leaking and they look new so

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.770 
seals were leaking and they look new so
it's<00:05:41.550> probably<00:05:41.880> the<00:05:42.180> problem<00:05:42.390> there<00:05:42.780> and<00:05:43.680> then

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
it's probably the problem there and then

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.030 
it's probably the problem there and then
let's<00:05:45.780> see<00:05:45.930> yeah<00:05:46.080> then<00:05:46.230> we'll<00:05:46.380> put<00:05:46.560> the<00:05:46.680> proper

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.040 
let's see yeah then we'll put the proper

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.490 
let's see yeah then we'll put the proper
size<00:05:47.250> washers<00:05:47.910> lock<00:05:48.180> washers<00:05:48.450> on<00:05:49.050> there<00:05:49.260> see

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
size washers lock washers on there see

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.560 
size washers lock washers on there see
those<00:05:49.650> don't<00:05:49.919> contact<00:05:50.370> the<00:05:51.030> actual<00:05:51.390> wheel

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
those don't contact the actual wheel

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.570 
those don't contact the actual wheel
cylinder<00:05:52.110> or<00:05:52.380> the<00:05:52.680> bridge<00:05:53.040> and<00:05:53.310> the<00:05:53.400> backing

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
cylinder or the bridge and the backing

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.460 
cylinder or the bridge and the backing
plate<00:05:53.940> so<00:05:54.180> those<00:05:54.330> will<00:05:54.540> let<00:05:55.200> the<00:05:55.320> wheel

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
plate so those will let the wheel

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.500 
plate so those will let the wheel
cylinder<00:05:55.680> sit<00:05:56.100> nice<00:05:56.250> and<00:05:56.430> flush<00:05:56.700> on<00:05:57.480> the

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 
cylinder sit nice and flush on the

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:58.430 
cylinder sit nice and flush on the
backing<00:05:57.990> plate

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
backing plate

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.240 
backing plate
unlike<00:05:59.310> those<00:05:59.570> gigantic<00:06:00.740> ones<00:06:01.740> they<00:06:01.919> had<00:06:02.070> on

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
unlike those gigantic ones they had on

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.030 
unlike those gigantic ones they had on
there<00:06:02.720> we<00:06:03.720> got<00:06:03.870> some<00:06:04.080> new<00:06:04.230> seat<00:06:04.530> brackets

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.040 
there we got some new seat brackets

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.150 
there we got some new seat brackets
being<00:06:05.430> painted<00:06:05.700> we<00:06:05.940> just<00:06:06.120> Adam<00:06:06.330> sandblasted

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 
being painted we just Adam sandblasted

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.409 
being painted we just Adam sandblasted
getting<00:06:08.160> these<00:06:08.280> painted<00:06:08.729> because<00:06:08.850> they<00:06:09.240> had

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 
getting these painted because they had

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:12.200 
getting these painted because they had
late<00:06:10.290> series<00:06:10.740> to<00:06:10.979> a<00:06:11.010> seat<00:06:11.370> frames<00:06:11.669> without<00:06:11.910> the

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
late series to a seat frames without the

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.460 
late series to a seat frames without the
seat<00:06:12.419> slides

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
seat slides

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.260

and<00:06:13.560> without<00:06:14.220> the<00:06:14.430> seat<00:06:14.610> slides<00:06:14.790> they're<00:06:15.120> not

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
and without the seat slides they're not

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.420 
and without the seat slides they're not
spaced<00:06:15.720> far<00:06:16.050> enough<00:06:16.170> up<00:06:16.500> from<00:06:16.890> the<00:06:16.980> seat<00:06:17.190> box

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
spaced far enough up from the seat box

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.460 
spaced far enough up from the seat box
to<00:06:18.030> let<00:06:18.180> the<00:06:18.360> seat<00:06:18.570> sit<00:06:18.870> all<00:06:19.050> the<00:06:19.080> way<00:06:19.290> in

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470 
to let the seat sit all the way in

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.590 
to let the seat sit all the way in
there's<00:06:19.710> there's<00:06:20.040> little<00:06:20.790> locators<00:06:21.300> on<00:06:21.510> the

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 
there's there's little locators on the

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.240 
there's there's little locators on the
bottom<00:06:21.840> of<00:06:21.900> the<00:06:21.960> seat<00:06:22.170> that<00:06:22.200> hit<00:06:22.710> the<00:06:22.860> seat<00:06:23.040> box

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250 
bottom of the seat that hit the seat box

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.300 
bottom of the seat that hit the seat box
and<00:06:24.320> doesn't<00:06:25.320> quite<00:06:25.500> work<00:06:25.740> doesn't<00:06:26.160> quite

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
and doesn't quite work doesn't quite

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.450 
and doesn't quite work doesn't quite
work<00:06:26.580> so<00:06:27.020> these<00:06:28.020> will<00:06:28.290> get<00:06:28.650> at<00:06:28.890> least<00:06:28.920> back<00:06:29.280> to

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
work so these will get at least back to

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.080 
work so these will get at least back to
factory<00:06:30.680> also<00:06:31.680> there's<00:06:31.890> no<00:06:32.070> body<00:06:32.370> mount<00:06:32.670> bolts

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090 
factory also there's no body mount bolts

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.390 
factory also there's no body mount bolts
so<00:06:33.900> the<00:06:33.990> body<00:06:34.200> the<00:06:34.680> front<00:06:34.830> of<00:06:34.980> the<00:06:35.040> bottom<00:06:35.310> the

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 
so the body the front of the bottom the

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.370 
so the body the front of the bottom the
rear<00:06:35.580> body<00:06:35.790> is<00:06:36.060> just<00:06:36.450> kind<00:06:36.690> of<00:06:36.810> floating<00:06:37.200> there

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:37.380 
rear body is just kind of floating there

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.740 
rear body is just kind of floating there
there's<00:06:37.680> no<00:06:37.860> there's<00:06:38.820> no<00:06:38.910> fasteners<00:06:39.510> holding

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:39.750 
there's no there's no fasteners holding

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:50.230 
there's no there's no fasteners holding
that<00:06:40.080> to<00:06:40.230> the<00:06:40.320> frame<00:06:47.780> nothing<00:06:48.780> hunt<00:06:48.960> these

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 
that to the frame nothing hunt these

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.910 
that to the frame nothing hunt these
little<00:06:51.240> unbent<00:06:54.050> so<00:06:55.050> okay<00:06:55.350> so<00:06:55.410> again<00:06:55.650> this<00:06:55.800> is

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:55.920 
little unbent so okay so again this is

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.220 
little unbent so okay so again this is
the<00:06:56.010> second<00:06:56.370> axle<00:06:56.760> that<00:06:57.000> where<00:06:57.870> that<00:06:58.020> where

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:58.230 
the second axle that where that where

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.410 
the second axle that where that where
the<00:06:58.320> wheel<00:06:58.500> could<00:06:58.860> have<00:06:59.040> separated<00:06:59.640> from<00:06:59.940> from

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:00.420 
the wheel could have separated from from

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.020 
the wheel could have separated from from
the<00:07:00.600> car<00:07:00.840> so<00:07:01.680> that<00:07:01.710> lock<00:07:02.340> want<00:07:02.610> here<00:07:02.760> I'll<00:07:02.880> just

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:03.030 
the car so that lock want here I'll just

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:04.670 
the car so that lock want here I'll just
show<00:07:03.210> this<00:07:03.390> so<00:07:03.840> odd

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:04.680 
show this so odd

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.440 
show this so odd
so<00:07:04.890> this<00:07:05.070> washer<00:07:05.520> is<00:07:05.610> designed<00:07:05.970> to<00:07:06.120> be<00:07:06.210> bent

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:06.450 
so this washer is designed to be bent

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:08.360 
so this washer is designed to be bent
over<00:07:06.660> on<00:07:06.900> the<00:07:07.200> hub<00:07:07.350> nuts<00:07:07.590> so<00:07:07.860> that<00:07:08.040> they<00:07:08.130> can't

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:08.370 
over on the hub nuts so that they can't

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.659 
over on the hub nuts so that they can't
loosen<00:07:08.820> up<00:07:08.970> and<00:07:09.180> come<00:07:09.360> completely<00:07:09.750> off<00:07:09.870> and<00:07:10.669> if

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:11.669 
loosen up and come completely off and if

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:13.100 
loosen up and come completely off and if
it's<00:07:11.850> not<00:07:11.970> bent<00:07:12.210> over<00:07:12.390> it's<00:07:12.630> not<00:07:12.750> doing<00:07:12.990> any

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:13.110 
it's not bent over it's not doing any

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.150 
it's not bent over it's not doing any
good<00:07:14.000> so<00:07:15.000> this<00:07:15.450> if<00:07:15.720> that<00:07:15.750> outer<00:07:16.020> not<00:07:16.560> loosened

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.160 
good so this if that outer not loosened

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.310 
good so this if that outer not loosened
up<00:07:17.280> and<00:07:17.550> then<00:07:18.120> the<00:07:18.240> inner<00:07:18.390> nut<00:07:18.600> loosened<00:07:18.900> up

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:19.320 
up and then the inner nut loosened up

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.890 
up and then the inner nut loosened up
there's<00:07:20.310> nothing<00:07:20.730> holding<00:07:21.180> the<00:07:21.360> wheel<00:07:21.540> on<00:07:21.780> the

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:21.900 
there's nothing holding the wheel on the

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.360 
there's nothing holding the wheel on the
car<00:07:22.050> it's<00:07:22.169> not<00:07:22.200> like<00:07:22.470> on<00:07:22.620> modern<00:07:22.919> cars<00:07:23.070> we<00:07:23.250> have

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:23.370 
car it's not like on modern cars we have

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:24.860 
car it's not like on modern cars we have
disc<00:07:23.550> brakes<00:07:23.850> and<00:07:24.030> you<00:07:24.120> have<00:07:24.210> a<00:07:24.270> road<00:07:24.480> or<00:07:24.510> that

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:24.870 
disc brakes and you have a road or that

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:26.180 
disc brakes and you have a road or that
it's<00:07:25.020> drum<00:07:25.230> brakes<00:07:25.470> this<00:07:25.680> would<00:07:25.919> have<00:07:26.010> come

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:26.190 
it's drum brakes this would have come

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:27.800 
it's drum brakes this would have come
just<00:07:26.220> as<00:07:26.610> Chris<00:07:26.940> is<00:07:27.090> pulling<00:07:27.330> this<00:07:27.419> off<00:07:27.600> here

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:27.810 
just as Chris is pulling this off here

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.530 
just as Chris is pulling this off here
it<00:07:28.260> would<00:07:28.500> have<00:07:28.530> come<00:07:28.860> off<00:07:29.070> driving<00:07:30.000> down<00:07:30.390> the

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:30.540 
it would have come off driving down the

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.590 
it would have come off driving down the
road<00:07:30.720> and<00:07:30.960> your<00:07:31.080> wheel<00:07:31.290> would<00:07:31.560> just<00:07:32.300> pass<00:07:33.300> you

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:33.600 
road and your wheel would just pass you

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.950 
road and your wheel would just pass you
on<00:07:33.780> the<00:07:33.960> on<00:07:34.140> the<00:07:34.320> side<00:07:34.500> of<00:07:34.530> the<00:07:34.710> road<00:07:35.960> could

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 
on the on the side of the road could

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.330 
on the on the side of the road could
have<00:07:37.050> been<00:07:37.140> a<00:07:37.169> really<00:07:37.380> bad<00:07:37.590> scenario<00:07:38.160> there<00:07:39.140> so

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:40.340 
have been a really bad scenario there so

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.950 
have been a really bad scenario there so
so<00:07:41.340> this<00:07:41.520> side<00:07:41.820> you<00:07:42.060> would<00:07:42.479> have<00:07:42.600> lost<00:07:42.750> your

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 
so this side you would have lost your

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.870 
so this side you would have lost your
entire<00:07:43.320> spindle<00:07:43.919> this<00:07:44.340> side<00:07:44.550> you<00:07:44.700> would<00:07:44.820> have

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:44.880 
entire spindle this side you would have

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.460 
entire spindle this side you would have
just<00:07:45.120> lost<00:07:45.270> the<00:07:45.450> hub<00:07:45.630> but<00:07:45.660> the<00:07:45.960> result<00:07:46.320> would

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:46.470 
just lost the hub but the result would

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:48.979 
just lost the hub but the result would
have<00:07:46.500> been<00:07:46.590> the<00:07:46.710> same
