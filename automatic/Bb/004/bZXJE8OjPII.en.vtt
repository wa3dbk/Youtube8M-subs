00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.129
 and was third has more than 25 years in the 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.379
 world of the horse has tamed ponies done 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:15.910
 dressage jump and currently 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.330
 focused on assisted coaching with 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.330
 horses 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.160
 and this is the power stain 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.200
 in this chapter 04 we are going to update 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.330
 our horse we have here a horse 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.970
 Swedish 12-year-old who has been unemployed 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.400
 year and a half in the field has not had 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.440
 no vision and we aim to 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.540
 that is tuned in two weeks 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.300
 let's give it a little rope 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.630
 we will use a head of knots a rope 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.640
 long and a style now I will teach you 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.050
 afterwards and use a little how to 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.050
 move and see the progression 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.260
 now we will proceed to wind by hand 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.260
 right 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.290
 the horse tries a little bit 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.380
 rigid and with the head looking towards 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.380
 outside 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.440
 keep in mind that the terrain is 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.150
 inclined and is irregular although today 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.370
 we will dedicate ourselves to correct the horse 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.970
 we will simply observe how it moves and 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.370
 work 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.190
 the movements of the horse are nothing 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.640
 wide and in addition there are some trunks a 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.860
 little irregular 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.370
 we can also observe a rigidity 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.060
 quite serious on the back and the 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.060
 later 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.680
 work of which he has had a couple of days of 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.670
 acclimatization to the equestrian and is ready 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.500
 to work 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.430
 we started with trot and then followed 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.010
 gallop 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.780
 or how can we still see the 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.549
 movements are still rigid 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.010
 although the horse presents a good 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:31.019
 attitude and a good balance 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.680
 which will be very important at the time 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:36.629
 of jumping today we are going to try besides 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.530
 make a few little jumps to see 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.530
 how it reacts 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.200
 we have that his attitude is very good is 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.200
 positive and going forward 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.250
 and we will continue and we will put a 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.470
 simple with a little bit bigger 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.760
 on the little screen to see how it reacts 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:05.820
 we have problems and then so that 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.160
 a fight we will perform a trot with the 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.800
 head down the letting the 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.020
 relax 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.580
 it is very important not to work very 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:19.960
 followed but quickly concise and in the 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.000
 moment 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.460
 we have to make a lot of rope to the glass 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.100
 we have to intersperse the times of 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.870
 trot step step so that he is 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.950
 comfortable and the pulsations do not fire 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:36.490
 and muscle and tendon tissue is therefore 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:39.820
 that they also do not suffer 45 minutes of 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:43.030
 trot 2 step three minutes gallop 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:45.310
 one of trote and two of step for example 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.569
 intervals so be a little 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.909
 proportional 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:52.040
 after testing it in the jump we are going to 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:54.290
 relax and make the horse 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.870
 work normally what you do not 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.709
 we want him to express himself 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.709
 or break 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.140
 the first days we will do many 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.239
 string sessions we will interspersed with 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.000
 a lot of trot and canter gallop leaving 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:12.409
 breathe the horse at all times and 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.409
 after four days of amounts 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.750
 always combine we have work with 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.700
 work in freedom 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.560
 so the horse can relax and 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.720
 express yourself this is the second week of 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.750
 I work with 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.260
 the biggest setback has changed a lot of 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.260
 physical 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.810
 has done great things field things 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.810
 as well 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:39.740
 and in two weeks it's that good oil 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:42.789
 we are very happy with the progress and 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.789
 now you will see how work 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.030
 so that the strength of the store always 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.490
 go because it's the same study from the 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.259
 fillet function 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.110
 although we throw up for 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:55.050
 he the vital is always in a straight line 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.300
 with him 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.610
 the horse is already working with 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.789
 normality we started asking 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:05.879
 basic dressage exercises as would be the 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:07.889
 back inside rump although not 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:09.840
 be the most expressive in the world 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.539
 we simply want the horse 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.300
 begins to put the gallop later 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:17.400
 it has to be broad and always 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.490
 trying to make the back move through 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.289
 We will achieve elasticity by doing 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.110
 exercises to lengthen and shorten the 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:26.780
 gallop 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.110
 and in foam in the mouth that is a sign of 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.110
 a good job 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:36.230
 the horse you are torico the clothes go towards 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:39.630
 ahead and a very positive attitude 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:41.700
 obviously the genetics of the variable 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.420
 and it has helped us a lot at the time of 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.420
 work with he 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.030
 look 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.060
 hello hello 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.210
 i 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.720
 i
