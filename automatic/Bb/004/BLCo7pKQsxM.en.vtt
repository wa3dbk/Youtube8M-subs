calf<00:02:23.400> facility<00:02:23.940> is<00:02:24.090> set<00:02:24.360> up<00:02:24.599> is<00:02:25.040> they're

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
calf facility is set up is they're

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.710 
calf facility is set up is they're
almost<00:02:26.250> in<00:02:26.519> their<00:02:26.610> own<00:02:26.819> little<00:02:27.030> quarantine

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
almost in their own little quarantine

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.460 
almost in their own little quarantine
section<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:28.799> each<00:02:29.340> calf<00:02:29.989> tends<00:02:30.989> not<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.319> be

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
section so each calf tends not to be

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.680 
section so each calf tends not to be
able<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.799> touch<00:02:32.190> another<00:02:32.549> calf<00:02:32.849> although<00:02:33.630> you

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
able to touch another calf although you

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.350 
able to touch another calf although you
can<00:02:33.900> see<00:02:34.170> from<00:02:35.160> front<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.549> back<00:02:35.670> there's<00:02:36.180> good

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
can see from front to back there's good

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.300 
can see from front to back there's good
air<00:02:36.540> ventilation<00:02:37.079> but<00:02:37.200> from<00:02:37.380> side<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:37.620> side

they<00:02:38.489> can't<00:02:38.730> contact<00:02:39.209> each<00:02:39.420> other<00:02:39.569> so<00:02:39.810> if<00:02:39.900> one

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
they can't contact each other so if one

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.960 
they can't contact each other so if one
gets<00:02:40.410> sick<00:02:40.680> has<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.010> less<00:02:41.280> likelihood<00:02:41.730> of

affecting<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.540> next<00:02:42.780> one<00:02:43.019> and<00:02:43.500> this<00:02:43.920> calf<00:02:44.220> is

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
affecting the next one and this calf is

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.180 
affecting the next one and this calf is
about<00:02:44.730> as<00:02:44.819> healthy<00:02:45.030> as<00:02:45.600> she<00:02:45.630> can<00:02:46.140> get<00:02:46.350> she's

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
about as healthy as she can get she's

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.550 
about as healthy as she can get she's
she<00:02:47.640> has<00:02:47.730> no<00:02:47.940> disease<00:02:48.299> to<00:02:48.540> speak<00:02:48.780> of<00:02:49.019> she's<00:02:49.380> got
