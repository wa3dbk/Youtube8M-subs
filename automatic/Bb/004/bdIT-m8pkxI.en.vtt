00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:10.839
 so on and on with the skin editing 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:15.329
 Now comes as a last step again a group Germany Bern 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:17.880
 to do so is simple 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.960
 4 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.720
 duplicate the group 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.720
 quickly stood BNP 2 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:29.710
 For the first time, Hausmann looks away 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.790
 every normal equal eliminated the book wrote up the magnifying glass 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.710
 then she makes on the rope Seres now had to make the Mavs again 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.300
 black white fullness 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.670
 and so it's just black would be chips from the 5th 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.720
 in it I can tell how comes the area Fulham he log 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.720
 here use black mode normal corner to 2 0 percent 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.640
 myself this level 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.129
 Schierbrok can start looking forward now 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.260
 and because we have the same problem before we can agree 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.609
 Do not know anymore Moon still has to be worked on means I have to go first 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:03.609
 create another channel mixes 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.900
 monochrome 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.900
 Starter channel emphasize 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.050
 szo around 4,200 percent 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.060
 then something comes out of it and even here you can not be good 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.000
 That's why there is still another level 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.650
 Generation scoring 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.240
 or contrast 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.240
 is now on further designed 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.870
 so had to see so 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.190
 we have to be relatively bright tones 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.440
 pretty darkened, so onlookers is the coal here 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.770
 always moved down 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.330
 and percent here Bern 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.330
 the tones will turn over a bit brighter 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.240
 You can do what you can sometimes deep percent like now percent 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.710
 you can see here 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.880
 for example, Fierce still 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.080
 on the forehead such an area here 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.510
 and what better was no solution to see 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.270
 So here are some areas that work out cables one just here 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.939
 with verve 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:15.709
 then it's time to go 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.009
 maybe a little bigger too 

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:21.199
 this is with low Beckhoff to ten percent 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:25.109
 It works on the forget to eliminate the last changes like 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:28.089
 so im going 

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:31.460
 How about about twelve try the channel Mixa Nolte 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.350
 Revelations curves you will hardly see it is when you see the 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.899
 Authorities still understood after the effect 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:39.230
 Green on 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.459
 rather less we want 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.280
 I show Co his technique that is of course if the skin is not like that 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.540
 beautiful here Danaher municipalities still take this step relatively far 

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:51.089
 and that is why it still showed up 

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:56.149
 right now 4 will have to start again for editing that may take that time as well 

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:57.579
 make a leap in time again 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.579
 Teaching further must therefore look 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:08.089
 so it is about 20 stages later 

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:10.399
 so i can see well if you are on this 

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:14.269
 this along with this channel blender and cut score points if anyone before 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:15.979
 look at half past five 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:17.849
 that is before 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.269
 after that 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.799
 So not enough but Klemens Unger disturbing mans can see well 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:26.650
 but you will be surprised how little you see it 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.489
 if you hide these boars 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.999
 it looks normal 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:34.119
 and now indeed 

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:38.339
 Hardly anything to see until it is in the area of ​​the eye here at the child maybe 

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:40.819
 a little something 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.039
 but minimal so I'm assuming that you're on YouTube at the most 

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:47.079
 here in the eye and then really no longer 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.209
 and sees it solve differently and let Sven Manz print out or percent 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.719
 and let shower report you would look around so at least 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:58.849
 that is big enough for internet users and stress finally 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.489
 barely visible 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.759
 I can understand the two levels 

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:06.759
 There is nothing proven to be useless 

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:09.399
 and maybe now 

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:11.169
 you just close it 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:12.799
 to have a look 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.150
 fib the skin has changed overall and all processing steps 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.069
 that was before 

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:20.499
 that's after 

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:24.019
 So, in particular, companies can see significant improvement in the skin 

00:04:24.019 --> 00:04:27.180
 has become a total of seventh grade to the even 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.280
 it is not as severe as percent on many other faces 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.530
 Male face Huster men make faces and for that very often 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:34.919
 around 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.520
 although not necessarily always the skin is so smooth 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.370
 is 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.460
 but here 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.490
 you are 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.059
 achieved an optimal result 

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:46.669
 the next step if you look at the eyes and then the Nixon video
