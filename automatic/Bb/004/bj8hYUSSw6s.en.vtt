00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
out of this so that's one of the

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.680 
out of this so that's one of the
unfortunate<00:05:20.039> things<00:05:20.430> about<00:05:20.550> this<00:05:21.000> game<00:05:21.270> if

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690

you<00:05:21.750> can<00:05:21.839> get<00:05:22.080> past<00:05:22.349> that<00:05:22.560> there's<00:05:22.889> a<00:05:22.949> really

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
you can get past that there's a really

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.399 
you can get past that there's a really
good<00:05:23.550> roll<00:05:23.789> point<00:05:24.120> game<00:05:24.330> here<00:05:24.599> and<00:05:24.750> I<00:05:24.960> don't

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:25.409 
good roll point game here and I don't

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:26.809 
good roll point game here and I don't
think<00:05:25.770> this<00:05:25.830> game<00:05:26.039> is<00:05:26.099> doing<00:05:26.460> too<00:05:26.610> well<00:05:26.639> out

think this game is doing too well out
there<00:05:26.969> I<00:05:27.180> don't<00:05:27.569> think<00:05:27.810> it's<00:05:28.050> really<00:05:28.319> gonna

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:28.469 
there I don't think it's really gonna

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:30.680 
there I don't think it's really gonna
catch<00:05:28.740> on<00:05:29.069> and<00:05:29.699> it's<00:05:29.969> unfortunate<00:05:30.389> because

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690

hours of it then I got sidetracked into
other<00:07:03.830> games<00:07:04.069> that<00:07:04.370> can<00:07:04.460> happen<00:07:04.669> but<00:07:05.629> the

00:07:05.709 --> 00:07:05.719 
other games that can happen but the

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:07.629 
other games that can happen but the
thing<00:07:05.900> was<00:07:05.990> Mass<00:07:06.169> Effect<00:07:06.499> 2<00:07:06.620> I<00:07:06.650> put<00:07:07.099> it<00:07:07.219> in<00:07:07.370> and

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:07.639 
thing was Mass Effect 2 I put it in and

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:09.070 
thing was Mass Effect 2 I put it in and
I<00:07:08.150> couldn't<00:07:08.659> put<00:07:08.749> it<00:07:08.810> down

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.080 
I couldn't put it down

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.040 
I couldn't put it down
I<00:07:09.319> completed<00:07:10.219> it<00:07:10.430> and<00:07:10.669> in<00:07:11.240> a<00:07:11.509> few<00:07:11.539> sittings

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.050 
I completed it and in a few sittings

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.200 
I completed it and in a few sittings
actually<00:07:12.499> which<00:07:12.650> was<00:07:12.680> quite<00:07:13.310> crazy<00:07:13.580> I<00:07:13.909> liked

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:14.210 
actually which was quite crazy I liked

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:15.670 
actually which was quite crazy I liked
the<00:07:14.330> story<00:07:14.689> I<00:07:14.930> thought<00:07:15.110> the<00:07:15.229> graphics<00:07:15.409> were

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 
the story I thought the graphics were

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.239 
the story I thought the graphics were
really<00:07:15.949> good

00:07:16.239 --> 00:07:16.249 
really good

00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:18.640 
really good
I<00:07:16.279> thought<00:07:16.610> they<00:07:16.759> enhanced<00:07:17.360> the<00:07:17.839> shooting

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:18.650 
I thought they enhanced the shooting

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.110 
I thought they enhanced the shooting
elements<00:07:19.069> in<00:07:19.159> the<00:07:19.249> game<00:07:19.400> is<00:07:19.520> time<00:07:19.699> it<00:07:19.879> played<00:07:20.089> a

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:20.120 
elements in the game is time it played a

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.269 
elements in the game is time it played a
lot<00:07:20.360> more<00:07:20.509> like<00:07:20.629> Gears<00:07:20.960> of<00:07:21.020> War<00:07:21.189> which<00:07:22.189> I

00:07:22.269 --> 00:07:22.279 
lot more like Gears of War which I

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:24.249 
lot more like Gears of War which I
didn't<00:07:22.490> think<00:07:22.520> was<00:07:22.669> a<00:07:22.789> bad<00:07:22.999> thing<00:07:23.270> so<00:07:23.330> I<00:07:23.930> think

00:07:24.249 --> 00:07:24.259 
didn't think was a bad thing so I think

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:25.689 
didn't think was a bad thing so I think
it's<00:07:24.379> setting<00:07:24.710> up<00:07:24.800> the<00:07:24.949> third<00:07:25.189> game<00:07:25.430> really

00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:25.699 
it's setting up the third game really

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:28.300 
it's setting up the third game really
well<00:07:25.819> so<00:07:26.270> can't<00:07:26.779> wait<00:07:26.900> for<00:07:27.110> that<00:07:27.229> guys<00:07:27.979> I

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:28.310 
well so can't wait for that guys I

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.320 
well so can't wait for that guys I
thought<00:07:28.460> it<00:07:28.610> was<00:07:28.699> actually<00:07:28.969> finished<00:07:29.240> the

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:29.330
