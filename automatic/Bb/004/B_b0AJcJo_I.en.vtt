I've<00:00:01.500> run<00:00:01.800> budget<00:00:02.370> stark<00:00:02.610> here<00:00:02.820> thanks<00:00:03.330> for

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
I've run budget stark here thanks for

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.480 
I've run budget stark here thanks for
tuning<00:00:03.570> in<00:00:03.840> again<00:00:04.009> today<00:00:05.009> we're<00:00:05.220> going<00:00:05.310> to<00:00:05.400> be

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
tuning in again today we're going to be

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.039 
tuning in again today we're going to be
doing<00:00:05.640> a<00:00:05.790> quick<00:00:05.940> video<00:00:06.150> and<00:00:06.540> hopefully<00:00:06.750> it

doing a quick video and hopefully it

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.190 
doing a quick video and hopefully it
won't<00:00:07.140> last<00:00:07.410> too<00:00:07.680> long<00:00:07.710> because<00:00:09.200> yesterday

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
won't last too long because yesterday

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.690 
won't last too long because yesterday
and<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.469> couple<00:00:10.650> of<00:00:10.740> days<00:00:10.860> ago<00:00:11.040> I<00:00:11.309> was<00:00:11.340> thinking

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
and a couple of days ago I was thinking

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.520 
and a couple of days ago I was thinking
about<00:00:11.790> these<00:00:12.090> holographic<00:00:12.660> stickers<00:00:13.230> on<00:00:13.410> the

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
about these holographic stickers on the

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.880 
about these holographic stickers on the
back<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:13.980> Patras<00:00:14.880> boxes<00:00:15.269> now<00:00:16.170> most<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:16.770> you

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
back of Patras boxes now most of you

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.710 
back of Patras boxes now most of you
guys<00:00:17.039> who<00:00:17.400> are<00:00:17.430> in<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.730> US<00:00:18.000> would<00:00:18.180> probably

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
guys who are in the US would probably

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.599 
guys who are in the US would probably
never<00:00:19.080> ever<00:00:19.230> have<00:00:19.890> seen<00:00:20.100> these<00:00:20.250> holographic

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
never ever have seen these holographic

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.550 
never ever have seen these holographic
stickers<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.570> I'm<00:00:21.630> going<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.840> show<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.020> what

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.920 
give you some background in Hong Kong we
get<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.370> lot<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.670> fake<00:00:53.850> stuff<00:00:54.090> from<00:00:54.539> fake

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
get a lot of fake stuff from fake

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.250 
get a lot of fake stuff from fake
chicken<00:00:55.469> eggs<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:56.370> fake<00:00:56.670> soya<00:00:57.149> sauce<00:00:57.510> to

chicken eggs to fake soya sauce to
obviously<00:00:58.890> fake<00:00:59.129> DVDs<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.910> blu-rays<00:01:00.390> etc<00:01:00.960> so

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
obviously fake DVDs and blu-rays etc so

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.009 
obviously fake DVDs and blu-rays etc so
fake<00:01:01.770> things<00:01:02.039> are<00:01:02.190> not<00:01:02.340> very<00:01:02.550> uncommon<00:01:03.539> for<00:01:03.930> us

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
fake things are not very uncommon for us

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.690 
fake things are not very uncommon for us

u.s. European UK collectors fakes
forgeries<00:01:09.990> are<00:01:10.500> probably<00:01:10.890> quite<00:01:11.310> rare<00:01:11.640> but<00:01:12.240> we

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
forgeries are probably quite rare but we

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.910 
forgeries are probably quite rare but we
see<00:01:12.630> them<00:01:12.780> all<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.900> time<00:01:13.170> now

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
see them all the time now

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.859 
see them all the time now
when<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.610> first<00:01:14.970> saw<00:01:15.240> these<00:01:15.420> holographic

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
when I first saw these holographic

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.200 
when I first saw these holographic
stickers<00:01:16.439> we<00:01:16.799> called<00:01:17.100> them<00:01:17.280> actually<00:01:17.610> laser

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
stickers we called them actually laser

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.020 
stickers we called them actually laser
labels<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.320> when<00:01:20.040> we<00:01:20.159> first<00:01:20.460> saw<00:01:20.640> these<00:01:20.759> laser

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
labels and when we first saw these laser

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.390 
labels and when we first saw these laser
labels<00:01:21.390> we<00:01:21.810> thought<00:01:22.020> was<00:01:22.229> pretty<00:01:22.830> common<00:01:23.040> it's

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
labels we thought was pretty common it's

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.069 
labels we thought was pretty common it's
not<00:01:23.820> unheard<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.320> however<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:26.119> thought<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.330> a

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.620 

sign<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.259> authenticity<00:01:32.000> then<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.119> realised

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
sign of authenticity then I realised

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.440 
sign of authenticity then I realised
that<00:01:33.750> no<00:01:34.170> one<00:01:34.470> from<00:01:34.979> sideshow<00:01:35.610> I'm<00:01:36.060> not<00:01:36.329> sure

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
that no one from sideshow I'm not sure

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.749 
that no one from sideshow I'm not sure
about<00:01:36.570> big<00:01:36.840> big<00:01:37.619> bad<00:01:37.770> toy<00:01:37.979> store<00:01:38.220> maybe<00:01:38.400> some

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
about big big bad toy store maybe some

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.390 
about big big bad toy store maybe some
of<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:38.970> viewers<00:01:39.210> can<00:01:39.450> confirm<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:39.869> I

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
of you viewers can confirm that I

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.429 
of you viewers can confirm that I
thought<00:01:41.400> sideshow<00:01:42.210> would<00:01:42.869> have<00:01:43.020> them<00:01:43.200> as<00:01:43.290> well

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
thought sideshow would have them as well

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.440 
thought sideshow would have them as well
because<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.920> Marvel<00:01:44.250> product<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.909> they

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
because it's a Marvel product and they

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.090 
because it's a Marvel product and they
were<00:01:45.509> slap<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.930> on<00:01:46.020> but<00:01:46.320> they<00:01:46.409> don't<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.860> haven't

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
were slap it on but they don't I haven't

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.359 
were slap it on but they don't I haven't
seen<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.369> single<00:01:47.840> sideshow<00:01:48.840> figure<00:01:49.290> box<00:01:49.560> with

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
seen a single sideshow figure box with

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.440 
seen a single sideshow figure box with
this<00:01:51.409> sticker<00:01:52.409> on<00:01:52.590> there<00:01:52.770> essentially<00:01:53.450> so

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
this sticker on there essentially so

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.569 
this sticker on there essentially so
I've<00:01:54.899> got<00:01:55.110> thinking<00:01:55.530> hang<00:01:55.770> on<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.950> minute<00:01:56.070> does

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
I've got thinking hang on a minute does

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.300 
I've got thinking hang on a minute does
that<00:01:56.759> mean<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.270> these<00:01:57.960> stickers<00:01:58.320> should<00:01:59.009> be

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
that mean that these stickers should be

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.319 
that mean that these stickers should be
on<00:01:59.460> all<00:01:59.700> of<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.090> products<00:02:00.530> so<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.890> actually<00:02:02.329> was

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
on all of the products so I actually was

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.980 
on all of the products so I actually was

the<00:04:40.319> Marvel<00:04:40.830> sticker<00:04:41.150> so<00:04:42.150> I<00:04:42.479> think<00:04:42.629> some

00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:43.439 
the Marvel sticker so I think some

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:45.290 
the Marvel sticker so I think some
licensees<00:04:44.069> like<00:04:44.279> to<00:04:44.430> put<00:04:44.580> these<00:04:44.729> particular

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
licensees like to put these particular

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.279 
licensees like to put these particular
stickers<00:04:45.840> on<00:04:45.990> them

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
stickers on them

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:49.670 
stickers on them
it<00:04:46.409> gives<00:04:46.830> them<00:04:47.009> either<00:04:47.249> I<00:04:48.560> think<00:04:49.560> it

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
it gives them either I think it

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.189 
it gives them either I think it
indicates<00:04:50.129> the<00:04:50.520> destination<00:04:51.300> of<00:04:51.449> intended

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
indicates the destination of intended

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:53.540 
indicates the destination of intended
sale<00:04:52.469> and<00:04:52.770> that<00:04:52.800> thing<00:04:53.039> that's<00:04:53.219> probably<00:04:53.340> the

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
sale and that thing that's probably the

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.730 
sale and that thing that's probably the
ease<00:04:53.639> is<00:04:53.819> worth<00:04:53.969> thinking<00:04:54.210> about<00:04:54.569> it<00:04:54.810> so<00:04:55.439> if

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
ease is worth thinking about it so if

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.309 
ease is worth thinking about it so if
you<00:04:55.889> see<00:04:56.099> hkg<00:04:56.789> it<00:04:57.210> means<00:04:57.449> Hong<00:04:57.689> Kong<00:04:57.900> if<00:04:58.139> you

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
see PRC it means China so I don't think

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.580 
see PRC it means China so I don't think
you<00:05:02.550> guys<00:05:02.699> can<00:05:02.879> don't<00:05:03.840> want<00:05:03.960> to<00:05:04.020> read<00:05:04.229> too<00:05:04.259> much
