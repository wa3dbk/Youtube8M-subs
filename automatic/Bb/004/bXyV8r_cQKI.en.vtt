government by the US government so

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.860 
government by the US government so
basically<00:02:31.340> with<00:02:31.670> a<00:02:31.700> similar<00:02:32.030> rating<00:02:32.660> and

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.170 
basically with a similar rating and
therefore<00:02:33.560> with<00:02:33.830> a<00:02:33.860> suggested<00:02:34.130> similar<00:02:34.730> level

therefore with a suggested similar level

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.869 
therefore with a suggested similar level
of<00:02:35.299> risk<00:02:35.769> investors<00:02:36.769> could<00:02:36.980> potentially<00:02:37.670> get

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.199 
of risk investors could potentially get
a<00:02:38.090> better<00:02:38.360> yield<00:02:38.750> or<00:02:39.019> return<00:02:39.760> so<00:02:40.760> in<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.090> end

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
a better yield or return so in the end

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.650 
a better yield or return so in the end
and<00:02:42.110> so<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:43.040> triple<00:02:43.370> beo<00:02:43.790> debt<00:02:44.239> was<00:02:44.480> now

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
and so the triple beo debt was now

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.390 
and so the triple beo debt was now
offered<00:02:45.049> in<00:02:45.140> tranches<00:02:45.440> some<00:02:45.980> of<00:02:46.069> it<00:02:46.160> rated

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.580

much higher the only way things could go
wrong<00:02:48.829> effectively<00:02:49.549> is<00:02:49.760> if<00:02:49.970> a<00:02:50.090> large<00:02:50.360> part<00:02:50.780> of
