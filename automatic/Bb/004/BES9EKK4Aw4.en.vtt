00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.900 

yes<00:00:07.440> well<00:00:07.799> I<00:00:07.830> mean<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.429> creepers<00:00:08.790> were

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
yes well I mean the creepers were

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.560 
yes well I mean the creepers were
mistake<00:00:09.300> I'm<00:00:09.630> defined<00:00:10.670> I<00:00:11.670> don't<00:00:12.300> have<00:00:12.389> any

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
mistake I'm defined I don't have any

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.600 
mistake I'm defined I don't have any
modeling<00:00:12.900> programs<00:00:13.290> did<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:14.009> models<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.400> just

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
modeling programs did the models I just

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.400 
modeling programs did the models I just
write<00:00:14.790> them<00:00:14.910> in<00:00:15.000> code<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.420> I<00:00:15.900> accidentally

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
write them in code and I accidentally

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.200 
write them in code and I accidentally
made<00:00:16.619> them<00:00:16.710> tall<00:00:16.920> instead<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.430> log<00:00:17.609> so<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.090> was

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
made them tall instead of log so it was

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.519 
made them tall instead of log so it was
like<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.330> total<00:00:18.539> thing<00:00:18.840> with<00:00:18.960> four<00:00:19.109> little<00:00:19.380> feet

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
like a total thing with four little feet

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.470 
like a total thing with four little feet
and<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:20.460> became<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.789> creeper<00:00:21.150> what's

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
and that became the creeper what's

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.630 
and that became the creeper what's
supposed<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.810> be<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:21.900> pig

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.020 

yeah<00:00:27.390> so<00:00:27.980> for<00:00:28.980> example<00:00:29.370> if<00:00:29.430> I<00:00:29.490> just<00:00:29.520> wanted<00:00:29.940> to

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:30.030 
yeah so for example if I just wanted to

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.760 
yeah so for example if I just wanted to
make<00:00:30.180> this<00:00:30.300> better<00:00:30.930> at<00:00:31.110> aiming<00:00:31.350> when<00:00:31.620> you're

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
make this better at aiming when you're

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.800 
make this better at aiming when you're
strafing<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.369> could<00:00:33.150> just<00:00:33.300> make<00:00:33.450> them<00:00:33.600> try<00:00:33.750> to

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:33.810 
strafing I could just make them try to

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.040 
strafing I could just make them try to
predict<00:00:34.200> where<00:00:34.380> you're<00:00:34.500> going<00:00:35.480> so<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.870> could

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
predict where you're going so I could

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.150 
predict where you're going so I could
actually<00:00:37.110> since<00:00:37.410> I'm<00:00:37.530> running<00:00:37.620> in<00:00:37.830> debug<00:00:38.130> mode

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
actually since I'm running in debug mode

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.550 
actually since I'm running in debug mode
I<00:00:38.370> can<00:00:38.610> just<00:00:38.760> change<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.120> while<00:00:39.270> it's<00:00:39.510> going<00:00:39.690> to

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:40.560 
I can just change it while it's going to

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.930 
I can just change it while it's going to
go<00:00:40.770> into<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.430> skeleton<00:00:41.940> class<00:00:42.360> find<00:00:43.640> with<00:00:44.640> fires

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
go into a skeleton class find with fires

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.360 
go into a skeleton class find with fires
and<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.270> know<00:00:45.620> and<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.680> was<00:00:46.739> trying<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.040> make<00:00:47.250> it

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
and I know and I was trying to make it

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.799 
and I know and I was trying to make it
predict<00:00:47.700> where<00:00:47.880> I'm<00:00:47.940> going<00:00:48.239> or<00:00:48.330> shoot<00:00:48.570> there

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
predict where I'm going or shoot there

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.430 
predict where I'm going or shoot there
instead<00:00:50.150> it's<00:00:51.150> about<00:00:51.360> having<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.960> feel<00:00:52.170> like<00:00:52.410> a

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
instead it's about having it feel like a

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.200 
instead it's about having it feel like a
game<00:00:52.950> like<00:00:53.250> what<00:00:53.430> would<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.580> expect<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.090> game

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
game like what would you expect the game

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.390 
game like what would you expect the game
to<00:00:54.270> do<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:55.730> sickly<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.090> current<00:00:58.190> speed<00:00:59.190> and

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
to do a sickly the current speed and

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.940 
to do a sickly the current speed and
direction<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.970> the<00:01:00.200> target<00:01:01.200> and<00:01:01.530> multiply<00:01:01.890> it

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:01.950 
direction of the target and multiply it

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.520 
direction of the target and multiply it
by<00:01:02.010> some<00:01:02.310> kind<00:01:02.490> of<00:01:02.600> constant<00:01:03.650> fine<00:01:06.259> five<00:01:07.259> for

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
by some kind of constant fine five for

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.170 
by some kind of constant fine five for
now<00:01:09.259> no<00:01:10.280> that<00:01:11.280> didn't<00:01:11.520> work<00:01:11.670> at<00:01:11.759> all<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:11.970> not<00:01:12.119> a

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
now no that didn't work at all so not a

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.210 
now no that didn't work at all so not a
skeleton<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.750> just<00:01:13.229> firing<00:01:13.560> in<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.950> wrong

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
skeleton is just firing in the wrong

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.490 
skeleton is just firing in the wrong
direction<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.880> I'm<00:01:15.450> not<00:01:15.780> entirely<00:01:16.050> sure<00:01:16.229> why

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
direction and I'm not entirely sure why

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.469 
direction and I'm not entirely sure why
that<00:01:17.280> didn't<00:01:17.550> work<00:01:19.729> it<00:01:20.729> says<00:01:20.880> you're<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.119> debug

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
that didn't work it says you're in debug

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.760 
that didn't work it says you're in debug
mode<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.750> can<00:01:21.869> just<00:01:21.899> change<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.410> code<00:01:22.560> and

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
mode you can just change the code and

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.670 
mode you can just change the code and
just<00:01:23.009> instantly<00:01:23.630> changes<00:01:24.630> which<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.110> very

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
just instantly changes which is very

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.480 
just instantly changes which is very
very<00:01:26.270> efficient<00:01:28.220> 16<00:01:29.220> perhaps<00:01:31.040> yeah<00:01:32.040> now<00:01:32.460> I

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
very efficient 16 perhaps yeah now I

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.370 
very efficient 16 perhaps yeah now I
started<00:01:32.790> hitting<00:01:32.909> me<00:01:33.120> when<00:01:33.240> I'm<00:01:33.330> moving<00:01:33.570> not

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
started hitting me when I'm moving not

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.310 
started hitting me when I'm moving not
all<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.650> time<00:01:34.830> but<00:01:35.540> yeah<00:01:36.540> it's<00:01:36.750> more<00:01:36.960> fun<00:01:37.170> if

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
all the time but yeah it's more fun if

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.870 
all the time but yeah it's more fun if
he's<00:01:37.470> gonna<00:01:37.620> if<00:01:37.890> Sable<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.400> dodge<00:01:38.580> it's<00:01:38.760> our

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
he's gonna if Sable the dodge it's our

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.630 
he's gonna if Sable the dodge it's our
problem<00:01:39.299> not<00:01:39.390> keep<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:39.720> behavior<00:01:40.520> also<00:01:41.520> now

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
problem not keep this behavior also now

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.520 
problem not keep this behavior also now
see<00:01:41.909> some<00:01:42.090> kind<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.330> bug<00:01:42.720> with<00:01:42.900> lighting<00:01:43.409> in

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
see some kind of bug with lighting in

see some kind of bug with lighting in
the<00:01:43.619> arrows<00:01:44.869> trying<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.930> see<00:01:46.049> how<00:01:46.140> can

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
the arrows trying to see how can

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.490 
the arrows trying to see how can
reproduce<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.520> we<00:01:47.610> can<00:01:47.760> debug<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.500> this

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
reproduce it so we can debug it this

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:58.789 
reproduce it so we can debug it this
thing<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:49.830> getting<00:01:49.950> kind<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.310> deadly<00:01:50.580> now<00:01:57.799> yeah

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
thing is getting kind of deadly now yeah

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.969 
thing is getting kind of deadly now yeah
I'm<00:01:59.010> disabling<00:01:59.520> lighting<00:02:00.090> in<00:02:00.180> here<00:02:00.860> seems<00:02:01.860> to

I'm disabling lighting in here seems to

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.850 
I'm disabling lighting in here seems to
work<00:02:02.990> debugging<00:02:03.990> in<00:02:04.080> wrong<00:02:04.229> time<00:02:04.260> it's<00:02:04.560> very

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
work debugging in wrong time it's very

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.240 
work debugging in wrong time it's very
efficient<00:02:05.310> yeah<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:06.090> know<00:02:06.650> yeah<00:02:07.650> we<00:02:07.979> get<00:02:08.100> kind
