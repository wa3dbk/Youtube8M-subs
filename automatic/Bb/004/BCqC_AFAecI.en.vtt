00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:06.860 

so<00:00:03.959> to<00:00:04.130> continue<00:00:05.130> on<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.879> poetic<00:00:06.240> astronomy

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
so to continue on the poetic astronomy

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.549 
so to continue on the poetic astronomy
as<00:00:07.500> John<00:00:07.740> said<00:00:08.010> we<00:00:08.309> also<00:00:08.610> created

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559 
as John said we also created

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.200 
as John said we also created
extraordinary<00:00:10.559> dials<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:11.340> one<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:12.120> the

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
extraordinary dials and one of the

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.120 
extraordinary dials and one of the
collections<00:00:12.719> that<00:00:12.809> we<00:00:13.049> created<00:00:13.440> are<00:00:13.950> the

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
collections that we created are the

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.840 
collections that we created are the
zodiac<00:00:14.580> so<00:00:15.120> we<00:00:15.269> have<00:00:15.480> 12<00:00:15.900> signs<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.560> zodiac

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 
zodiac so we have 12 signs of the zodiac

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.300 
zodiac so we have 12 signs of the zodiac
represented<00:00:17.850> in<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.390> feminine<00:00:19.109> dials<00:00:19.529> the

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
represented in the feminine dials the

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.790 
represented in the feminine dials the
idea<00:00:20.730> is<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:21.060> each<00:00:21.330> zodiac<00:00:21.900> sign<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.170> related

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
idea is that each zodiac sign is related

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.950 
idea is that each zodiac sign is related
to<00:00:22.949> an<00:00:23.039> element<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:24.090> what<00:00:24.300> we<00:00:24.570> did<00:00:24.810> the

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
to an element so what we did the

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.929 
to an element so what we did the
creative<00:00:25.470> team<00:00:25.710> came<00:00:25.949> up<00:00:25.980> with<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.430> idea<00:00:26.820> of

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
creative team came up with the idea of

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.630 
creative team came up with the idea of
interpreting<00:00:27.930> different<00:00:28.920> colors<00:00:29.340> and

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
interpreting different colors and

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.429 
interpreting different colors and
different<00:00:29.939> backgrounds<00:00:30.689> for<00:00:30.869> each<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.320> the

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
different backgrounds for each of the

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.830 
different backgrounds for each of the
elements<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.369> have<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.759> air<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.809> earth

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
elements so you have the air the earth

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.920 
elements so you have the air the earth
the<00:00:34.530> fire<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.130> water<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:36.360> if<00:00:36.510> we<00:00:36.630> take<00:00:36.780> an

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
the fire and water so if we take an

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.010 
the fire and water so if we take an
example<00:00:37.050> here<00:00:37.770> with<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.219> fire<00:00:38.700> signs<00:00:39.180> you

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
example here with the fire signs you

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.819 
example here with the fire signs you
will<00:00:40.140> see<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:41.340> there<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.930> red<00:00:43.559> background

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
will see that there is a red background

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.900 
will see that there is a red background
and<00:00:44.430> an<00:00:45.360> interpretation<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:47.190> flames<00:00:47.579> in

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
and an interpretation of the flames in

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.900 
and an interpretation of the flames in
the<00:00:47.969> background<00:00:48.539> engraved<00:00:49.219> here<00:00:50.219> really<00:00:50.640> what

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
the background engraved here really what

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.610 
the background engraved here really what
we<00:00:51.059> tried<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.390> do<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.899> convey<00:00:52.260> as<00:00:52.410> much

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
we tried to do is convey as much

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.950 
we tried to do is convey as much
movement<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.399> volume<00:00:53.969> as<00:00:54.180> possible<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:54.899> is

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
movement and volume as possible this is

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.170 
movement and volume as possible this is
one<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.350> our<00:00:55.469> signatures<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.370> terms<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.789> dials

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
one of our signatures in terms of dials

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.180 
one of our signatures in terms of dials
so<00:00:57.870> here<00:00:58.170> we<00:00:58.320> worked<00:00:58.530> with<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.829> combination

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
so here we worked with the combination

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.520 
so here we worked with the combination
of<00:00:59.550> crafts<00:01:00.059> which<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.510> enameling<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.410> the

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
of crafts which is enameling in the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.060 
of crafts which is enameling in the
background<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.690> mother-of-pearl<00:01:03.830> from<00:01:04.830> some

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
background and mother-of-pearl from some

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.179 
background and mother-of-pearl from some
of<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.309> pieces<00:01:05.549> heart<00:01:06.030> stone<00:01:06.830> engraving<00:01:07.830> and

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
of the pieces heart stone engraving and

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.760 
of the pieces heart stone engraving and
then<00:01:08.909> golden<00:01:09.420> graving<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:09.960> stone<00:01:10.260> setting

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
then golden graving and stone setting

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.020 
then golden graving and stone setting
and<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.280> year<00:01:11.520> we<00:01:12.170> continue<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.710> explore<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
and this year we continue to explore the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.499 
and this year we continue to explore the
chapel's<00:01:16.580> universe<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.939> for<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.150> first<00:01:18.330> time

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
chapel's universe and for the first time

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.160 
chapel's universe and for the first time
we<00:01:18.659> integrate<00:01:19.220> a<00:01:20.220> movement<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:21.360> complication

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
we integrate a movement a complication

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.080 
we integrate a movement a complication
in<00:01:22.770> Jaffer's<00:01:23.630> for<00:01:24.630> us<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.960> challenge<00:01:24.990> was<00:01:25.619> to

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
in Jaffer's for us the challenge was to

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.530 
in Jaffer's for us the challenge was to
integrate<00:01:27.110> a<00:01:28.110> complication<00:01:29.090> maintaining<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
integrate a complication maintaining the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.499 
integrate a complication maintaining the
thinness<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.530> case<00:01:31.860> because<00:01:32.670> purple<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.450> a

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
thinness of the case because purple is a

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.130 
thinness of the case because purple is a
collection<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.409> they<00:01:34.799> tribute<00:01:35.610> to

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
collection that they tribute to

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.980 
collection that they tribute to
masculine<00:01:37.140> elegance<00:01:38.180> we<00:01:39.180> wanted<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.659> create<00:01:39.810> a

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
masculine elegance we wanted to create a

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.760 
masculine elegance we wanted to create a
complication<00:01:40.770> maintaining<00:01:41.869> poetry<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:43.140> story

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
complication maintaining poetry a story

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.620 
complication maintaining poetry a story
behind<00:01:43.979> when<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.909> look<00:01:45.149> at<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.479> watch

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
behind when you look at the watch

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.590 
behind when you look at the watch
actually<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.200> shall<00:01:46.439> say<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.920> idea<00:01:47.220> was<00:01:47.430> to

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
actually I shall say the idea was to

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.289 
actually I shall say the idea was to
have<00:01:48.600> our<00:01:49.439> own<00:01:50.100> interpretation<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.119> dual

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
have our own interpretation of a dual

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.929 
have our own interpretation of a dual
time<00:01:51.600> complication<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.460> have<00:01:53.729> the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
time complication so you have the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.580 
time complication so you have the
signatures<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.780> line<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.200> satchel

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
signatures of the line the satchel

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.100 
signatures of the line the satchel
attachment<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.310> P<00:01:56.490> key<00:01:56.640> motif<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.299> we<00:01:57.329> worked

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
attachment the P key motif and we worked

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.469 
attachment the P key motif and we worked
on<00:01:58.320> an<00:01:58.500> asymmetrical<00:01:59.310> dial<00:01:59.670> with<00:02:00.119> words

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
on an asymmetrical dial with words

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.569 
on an asymmetrical dial with words
written<00:02:00.899> on<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.350> because<00:02:01.680> we<00:02:01.890> want<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.340> pay

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
written on it because we want to pay

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.359 
written on it because we want to pay
tribute<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:03.090> this<00:02:03.390> poetry<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.469> refinement<00:02:05.280> of

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
tribute to this poetry and refinement of

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.999 
tribute to this poetry and refinement of
the<00:02:05.520> Charles<00:02:06.060> line<00:02:06.299> in<00:02:06.719> terms<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.530> movement<00:02:07.770> we

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
the Charles line in terms of movement we

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.160 
the Charles line in terms of movement we
worked<00:02:08.220> with<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.640> general<00:02:09.330> Marquis<00:02:09.629> de<00:02:09.750> reg<00:02:09.929> to

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
worked with a general Marquis de reg to

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.200 
worked with a general Marquis de reg to
develop<00:02:10.619> this<00:02:10.770> new<00:02:11.370> exclusive<00:02:11.760> movement

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
develop this new exclusive movement

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.540 
develop this new exclusive movement
I<00:02:13.330> think<00:02:13.870> one<00:02:14.020> of<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.290> specificities<00:02:15.100> is<00:02:15.340> that

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
I think one of the specificities is that

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.690 
I think one of the specificities is that
we<00:02:15.700> have<00:02:15.910> one<00:02:16.360> sector<00:02:16.930> that<00:02:17.320> enables<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.310> move

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
we have one sector that enables to move

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.570 
we have one sector that enables to move
simultaneously<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:20.170> retrograde<00:02:21.130> minute

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
simultaneously the retrograde minute

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.730 
simultaneously the retrograde minute
hands<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.690> jumping<00:02:23.230> hours

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
hands and the to jumping hours

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.480 
hands and the to jumping hours
everything<00:02:24.520> is<00:02:24.940> jumping<00:02:25.540> at<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.750> same<00:02:25.870> time

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
everything is jumping at the same time

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.720 
everything is jumping at the same time
you<00:02:27.490> can<00:02:27.670> see<00:02:28.050> it's<00:02:29.050> a<00:02:29.260> retro<00:02:29.500> guard<00:02:29.860> with<00:02:30.130> two

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
you can see it's a retro guard with two

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.360 
you can see it's a retro guard with two
jumping<00:02:31.120> hours<00:02:31.650> so<00:02:32.650> this<00:02:32.860> is<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.160> first

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
jumping hours so this is the first

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.120 
jumping hours so this is the first
specificity<00:02:34.120> of<00:02:34.240> having<00:02:34.660> this

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
specificity of having this

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.200 
specificity of having this
simultaneously<00:02:36.130> that<00:02:36.340> enables<00:02:36.760> us<00:02:36.880> to<00:02:36.940> have<00:02:37.180> a

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
simultaneously that enables us to have a

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.180 
simultaneously that enables us to have a
very<00:02:37.480> pure<00:02:37.780> design<00:02:38.170> on<00:02:38.350> the<00:02:38.470> dial<00:02:38.710> the

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
very pure design on the dial the

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.190 
very pure design on the dial the
McWhorter<00:02:39.850> enables<00:02:40.270> us<00:02:40.450> to<00:02:40.510> have<00:02:41.020> this

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
McWhorter enables us to have this

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.460 
McWhorter enables us to have this
automatic<00:02:41.800> watch<00:02:41.980> and<00:02:42.280> keeping<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.060> very

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
automatic watch and keeping the very

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.430 
automatic watch and keeping the very
slim<00:02:44.470> profile<00:02:44.920> of<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.280> watch
