00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:11.880
 you guys so we end up with this 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:14.429
 risk and ypres have killed our co so we 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.789
 make a short video to announce you 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.380
 what will happen on ice world 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.960
 because that's what we have to do 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.850
 does more trauma than the 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.170
 brain is open and there is little and 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.849
 reese and all the stuff like that and everything 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.380
 while there are a lot of problems on 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.119
 the server while there now I 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.780
 see that it's a little near stable 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.130
 too much problem so especially before we 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.800
 will say we got hacked we got 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.090
 looks at repayments or 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.719
 stuff like that puts a little too much 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.200
 abusive 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.930
 so we'll do a little me 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.370
 explain what will happen while at the 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.180
 new update will tell the green the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.680
 veil was enough but here it is 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.370
 big washing of what will happen 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.379
 there is going to be a new spawn he's going 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.250
 see France of a new trailer too 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.039
 because they sort their advice in 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.350
 a little old is a little old he knows 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:10.110
 do a little different from the previous ones 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.490
 after that too, because here we go 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.960
 change spawn oil we will change because 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.240
 that we have a fear at all finally of the ports 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.520
 we actually liked it now we get 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.110
 says it's a bit too iced theme 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.360
 everything even though the serial server sword on 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.020
 will say that there is too much haiti toulouse 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.580
 and roanne 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.659
 too classy too iced all a little bit 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.520
 shit what a bit of a neckache and 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.549
 I have a little and who would have ice I 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.619
 not know about you but me anyway is 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.600
 a little mine we will try to do 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.189
 a new warzone as well 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.600
 clean because here the warzone go on 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.850
 will say that go all flat and where he 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.079
 there are not too many babies because finally 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.939
 I think I see her what I love 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.409
 no it's not at all my style to be 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.149
 flat and where you will not do it either 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.649
 be it with big mountains 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.360
 and or whew but really needs it 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.850
 be a little decorated because there is 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.610
 some small little trees a little 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.290
 sometimes a little shit so I think 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.170
 we will also make a beautiful little 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.210
 warzone to increase the size of 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.070
 mountains ankiba cap and until ya 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.350
 a lot of bach to bekin before on 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.820
 the ancient bret about science yeah 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.869
 yeah that's true too lover yeah 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.179
 unless the law that's where we in 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.349
 moment there are a lot of bugs ap it's it 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.120
 a little shit what we will do too 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.890
 we'll try something too good 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.730
 I do not know if you have any agreements in 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.260
 get to the spawn and something there your 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.500
 without her cow it will be changed my your 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.510
 right you have a trick the 1 v1 after 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.069
 we'll go for a walk after not knowing 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.739
 if you all know it or not but in 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.680
 anyway this is going to be changed 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.000
 its the spawn there so it's going to sound its 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.400
 can not be presented like that we're going 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.920
 to say that to do several panels 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.349
 vain several reports with the big one 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.519
 portals in the middle with this if you 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.829
 do we want to go see we're going to do a 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.700
 tower 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.930
 we will not go for a walk because 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.690
 that in fact wrong I login his 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:55.209
 homework so so here's another one 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.530
 who comes back here 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.250
 so after what is that 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.250
 I can tell you else 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.940
 especially at this level we're going 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:06.829
 change that's a reset it's really 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.209
 a complete stuff like all men 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.859
 them all all who you have in 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.810
 your inventory your deuche is 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:13.160
 all while all while advocating 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.530
 not change the server gameplay has 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.599
 always left as follows with or gives 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.700
 and all the edges of the ain no pop or 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.870
 of strength 2 and or all of them look and 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.549
 reduce to the cinema because that's me 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.599
 seems a little tell me go a little 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.069
 great anyway I think it's 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.630
 30 ministers like that it seems to me a 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.269
 radius 30 minutes of the blow there are some 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.530
 big and 25 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.720
 yeah yeah that's right we're going 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.599
 lower we'll put marion 15000 a 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.130
 starting from scratch 2-0 what then so you 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:40.700
 see joseph as sources who if 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:43.400
 you find a genre you bet yourself and 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:48.760
 at the end of the world do not know it's 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:56.810
 normal even posting videos there so 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:04:01.540
 at 98.87 eu why I believe reached 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:05.569
 at home video yeah so if so if ok 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.530
 short does not care so what is that 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.120
 I said others what is going 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.870
 have again on ice world after 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.190
 after that 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.110
 I said she a new trailer 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:17.820
 a new spawn hiva new warp xp 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:19.290
 a new wattmeter and where the meeting that 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.880
 beat and especially the gameplay it will not 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.150
 at all changed a salon is not afraid 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.290
 yes but not everywhere but also you 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.400
 have everything lose because you have on 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.720
 you so here we have no 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.190
 compensation will not have to leave 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.410
 the whole park also looked at your 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.870
 grade or laura brand new in 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.979
 big the new map is everything and then 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.350
 after I do not know it's pretty much everything 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.520
 what I have to say 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.229
 this is mostly your ranks and you 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.539
 leave all you lose nothing and 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:45.060
 we also validate we will also try 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:47.010
 to change spawn from two sites too 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.560
 because AIDS is a bit it's a 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.930
 little we will say a site of a little danticat 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.900
 glitch was not too yeah I do not like 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.490
 Too much fashion and why not 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.199
 to do precisely during this period 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.080
 a small discount on grades for 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:02.880
 that you can buy you here is in 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.960
 couple but where we will say goodbye we 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.070
 could do something like that because 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.270
 that here after that level yeah we can 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.830
 do something like that because at 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.470
 case where people knew did you know 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.970
 it also rages like that's the good 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.160
 after always have all the servers 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.690
 must they have a breeze and we will say 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.010
 because otherwise it's really there 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.960
 you see there is more than enough ppp the 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.570
 people and we will say that we made 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.000
 leaps was hacker we have a little 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.979
 too geeky people are going to say because 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.260
 we will move the bases and where it was 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.639
 a little anything that's why 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.919
 we prefer to promote the conflict 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:36.960
 skin what was a little brief is a 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:41.010
 little too messy that I think I 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.090
 know that I pressed after that is all 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.949
 what else can you say for 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.660
 Nothing 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:48.060
 and so I do not compensate for a lot 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.669
 quite frankly with multiple servers 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.169
 and / or me it's not too little too much 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.729
 I like to do it's not too my style of 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:54.630
 to do several servers and or after I 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:56.760
 do not know what you think about 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:06:00.000
 manage comments or not but hey it's 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:04.080
 not too my style of the thing it's 1.5 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.330
 billion to lobby with server 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.440
 creative and everything and everything very close 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.990
 if you like that maybe 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.630
 could be done but plans there will be 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.949
 wait a little more rock so that's it 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:18.610
 it's because if you have some 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:26.020
 to say in all the little guys 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:27.000
 no no zerara dia for miss sir 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.159
 the little chefs 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.319
 so here I hope that this little 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:34.750
 video is effect we're going to say pull it off 

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:36.460
 but hey what these outputs is for 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.509
 explain to you what will happen 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.509
 on the history of the feet
