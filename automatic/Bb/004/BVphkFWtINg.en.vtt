really easy glitch you have to be in

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.439 
really easy glitch you have to be in
forge<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.270> you<00:00:18.750> have<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.289> UM<00:00:20.060> be<00:00:21.060> on<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.270> map

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
forge and you have to UM be on the map

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.779 
forge and you have to UM be on the map
use<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.750> break<00:00:21.990> point<00:00:22.230> or<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.500> boneyard

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
use a break point or a boneyard

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.220 
use a break point or a boneyard
I<00:00:23.820> chose<00:00:24.269> break<00:00:24.510> point<00:00:24.750> because<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.080> can

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
I chose break point because you can

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.689 
I chose break point because you can
actually<00:00:25.500> get<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.890> phantom<00:00:26.310> on<00:00:26.490> break

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
actually get in the phantom on break

down get in it and just start shooting
it<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.840> phantom

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.819 

after<00:00:41.230> a<00:00:41.260> while<00:00:41.500> it<00:00:41.739> just<00:00:41.920> goes<00:00:42.100> poof<00:00:43.649> this<00:00:44.649> is

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
after a while it just goes poof this is

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:46.650 
after a while it just goes poof this is
the<00:00:44.920> first<00:00:45.190> stage<00:00:45.489> that's<00:00:45.969> what<00:00:46.120> I<00:00:46.180> call<00:00:46.449> it

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
the first stage that's what I call it

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.810 
the first stage that's what I call it
but<00:00:47.140> you<00:00:47.230> can<00:00:47.379> go<00:00:47.559> inside<00:00:47.949> the<00:00:48.100> Phantom<00:00:48.579> and

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
but you can go inside the Phantom and

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.880 
but you can go inside the Phantom and
get<00:00:49.570> on<00:00:49.690> the<00:00:49.809> turrets<00:00:50.199> this<00:00:50.530> is<00:00:50.649> the<00:00:50.739> only

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
get on the turrets this is the only

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.439 
get on the turrets this is the only
solid<00:00:51.220> part<00:00:51.699> right<00:00:51.879> here<00:00:52.149> that<00:00:52.329> you<00:00:52.420> can

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
solid part right here that you can

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.840 
solid part right here that you can
actually<00:00:52.690> stand<00:00:53.140> on<00:00:53.350> you<00:00:54.190> may<00:00:54.399> get<00:00:54.640> on<00:00:54.760> the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
actually stand on you may get on the

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.880 
actually stand on you may get on the
turns<00:00:55.090> it's<00:00:55.360> kind<00:00:55.600> of<00:00:55.750> difficult<00:00:56.739> sometimes

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
turns it's kind of difficult sometimes

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.970 
turns it's kind of difficult sometimes
to<00:00:57.280> actually<00:00:57.640> grab<00:00:58.210> onto<00:00:58.390> the<00:00:58.570> turret<00:00:58.900> and<00:00:59.079> one

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
to actually grab onto the turret and one

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.100 
to actually grab onto the turret and one
one<00:01:00.280> of<00:01:00.309> one<00:01:00.430> side<00:01:00.909> of<00:01:00.940> the<00:01:01.149> turret<00:01:01.510> is<00:01:01.690> blocked

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
one of one side of the turret is blocked

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.810 
one of one side of the turret is blocked
by<00:01:02.290> barriers<00:01:02.800> so<00:01:02.979> that<00:01:03.010> might<00:01:03.339> be<00:01:03.489> kind<00:01:03.729> of

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
by barriers so that might be kind of

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:28.620 
by barriers so that might be kind of
part<00:01:04.030> of<00:01:04.119> law

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.510 

okay<00:01:29.630> after<00:01:29.840> you<00:01:30.080> play<00:01:30.740> it<00:01:30.800> around<00:01:30.920> in<00:01:31.280> there

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
okay after you play it around in there

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.940 
okay after you play it around in there
now<00:01:32.150> we<00:01:32.180> can<00:01:32.540> actually<00:01:32.660> blow<00:01:32.960> it<00:01:33.020> up<00:01:33.230> blow<00:01:33.710> up

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
now we can actually blow it up blow up

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.310 
now we can actually blow it up blow up
each<00:01:34.160> side<00:01:34.580> of<00:01:34.820> the<00:01:34.940> turrets<00:01:35.360> I've<00:01:35.840> blown<00:01:36.170> up

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
each side of the turrets I've blown up

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.380 
each side of the turrets I've blown up
that<00:01:36.350> side<00:01:36.770> and<00:01:37.070> then<00:01:37.640> you<00:01:37.730> have<00:01:37.760> to<00:01:38.000> blow<00:01:38.210> up

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
that side and then you have to blow up

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.440 
that side and then you have to blow up
the<00:01:38.840> other<00:01:39.050> side<00:01:39.350> as<00:01:39.560> well<00:01:39.970> after<00:01:40.970> blow<00:01:41.390> up

destroyed<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:46.760> phantom<00:01:47.240> on<00:01:47.450> boneyard<00:01:48.140> yeah

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
destroyed the phantom on boneyard yeah

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.590 
destroyed the phantom on boneyard yeah
great<00:01:49.220> point<00:01:49.400> where<00:01:49.670> I<00:01:49.700> said<00:01:49.910> boneyard
