already one of the camera screens is
system<00:01:01.470> restart<00:01:02.040> which<00:01:02.280> tells<00:01:02.610> us<00:01:02.790> all<00:01:02.970> the

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
system restart which tells us all the

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.420 
system restart which tells us all the
errors<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.930> ventilation<00:01:04.650> systems<00:01:05.129> all

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
errors and the ventilation systems all

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.350 
errors and the ventilation systems all
the<00:01:06.150> key<00:01:07.049> things<00:01:07.440> from<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.310> fazbear<00:01:09.030> Freud

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
the key things from the fazbear Freud

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.899 
the key things from the fazbear Freud
attraction<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.200> we<00:01:11.070> don't<00:01:11.250> know<00:01:11.490> yet<00:01:11.700> whether

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
attraction and we don't know yet whether

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.630 
attraction and we don't know yet whether
this<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.180> going<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.479> be<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.380> problem<00:01:13.680> towards<00:01:14.460> us

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
this is going to be a problem towards us

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.870 
this is going to be a problem towards us
and<00:01:14.990> which<00:01:15.990> creates<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.590> new<00:01:16.740> tactic<00:01:17.220> for<00:01:17.460> us<00:01:17.610> to

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
and which creates a new tactic for us to

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.420 
and which creates a new tactic for us to
recover<00:01:18.360> from<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.960> which<00:01:19.920> makes<00:01:20.160> it<00:01:20.310> more

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
recover from and which makes it more

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.860 
recover from and which makes it more
difficult<00:01:20.610> as<00:01:21.030> well<00:01:21.210> because<00:01:21.510> you<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:21.750> see

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
difficult as well because you can see

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.750 
difficult as well because you can see
audio<00:01:22.110> devices<00:01:22.410> camera<00:01:22.860> system<00:01:23.160> ventilation

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
audio devices camera system ventilation

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.210 
audio devices camera system ventilation
all<00:01:23.910> have<00:01:24.210> gone<00:01:24.600> on<00:01:24.810> error<00:01:25.230> and<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.950> looks<00:01:26.130> like

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
all have gone on error and it looks like

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.520 
all have gone on error and it looks like
we<00:01:26.400> have<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.730> do<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.270> system<00:01:27.690> restart<00:01:28.050> to<00:01:28.290> fix

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
we have to do a system restart to fix

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.410 
we have to do a system restart to fix
that<00:01:28.740> well<00:01:29.400> that's<00:01:29.550> not<00:01:29.730> what<00:01:29.910> I<00:01:29.940> want<00:01:30.120> to<00:01:30.210> talk

about guys the next screen is the camera
screen<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.010> as<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.580> can<00:01:35.790> see<00:01:35.820> guys<00:01:36.270> if<00:01:36.510> i<00:01:36.630> can

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
screen and as you can see guys if i can

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.860 
screen and as you can see guys if i can
if<00:01:37.380> i<00:01:37.500> compare<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.340> two<00:01:38.850> screens<00:01:39.360> together

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
if i compare this two screens together

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.960 
if i compare this two screens together
the<00:01:40.800> different<00:01:41.180> they<00:01:42.180> are<00:01:42.210> different<00:01:43.020> screens

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
the different they are different screens

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.720 
the different they are different screens
which<00:01:44.970> means<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.870> this<00:01:46.650> is<00:01:46.830> the<00:01:47.010> video<00:01:47.159> guys

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
which means and this is the video guys

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.200 
which means and this is the video guys
and<00:01:48.120> i<00:01:48.780> think<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:50.070> they're<00:01:50.430> going<00:01:50.550> to<00:01:50.610> be<00:01:50.730> two

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
and i think that they're going to be two

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.960 
and i think that they're going to be two
separate<00:01:51.690> screens<00:01:52.370> and<00:01:53.370> if<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.730> remember

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
separate screens and if you remember

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.630 
separate screens and if you remember
from<00:01:54.150> five<00:01:54.510> nights<00:01:54.780> at<00:01:54.990> Freddy's<00:01:55.290> 2<00:01:55.520> there<00:01:56.520> was

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
from five nights at Freddy's 2 there was

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.270 
from five nights at Freddy's 2 there was
two<00:01:56.880> arrows<00:01:57.360> at<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.600> bottom<00:01:57.720> want<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.950> put<00:01:59.130> on

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
two arrows at the bottom want to put on

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.570 
two arrows at the bottom want to put on
your<00:01:59.520> mask<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.659> hide<00:02:01.050> from<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.890> animatronics

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
your mask to hide from the animatronics

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.910 
your mask to hide from the animatronics
and<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.210> other<00:02:03.360> one<00:02:03.630> was<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.990> camera<00:02:04.409> system

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
and the other one was the camera system

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.430 
and the other one was the camera system
now<00:02:05.700> what<00:02:05.970> I<00:02:06.000> think<00:02:06.479> guys<00:02:06.690> is<00:02:06.930> Scott's<00:02:07.229> going

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
now what I think guys is Scott's going

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.040 
now what I think guys is Scott's going
to<00:02:07.560> use<00:02:07.740> this<00:02:07.979> idea<00:02:08.909> again<00:02:09.390> with<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.810> two

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
to use this idea again with the two

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.309 
to use this idea again with the two
arrows<00:02:10.979> below<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.519> main<00:02:12.450> hood<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.110> game

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
arrows below the main hood of the game

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
another thing guys is that both cameras

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.760 
another thing guys is that both cameras

in your face that's made it really
interesting<00:02:36.010> guys<00:02:36.490> because<00:02:36.850> if<00:02:36.970> you<00:02:37.030> look<00:02:37.150> on

interesting guys because if you look on

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.690 
interesting guys because if you look on
both<00:02:37.510> cameras<00:02:38.170> screens<00:02:38.560> you<00:02:39.220> can<00:02:39.400> see<00:02:39.580> the

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
both cameras screens you can see the

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.300 
both cameras screens you can see the
office<00:02:40.090> behind<00:02:40.300> it<00:02:40.810> now<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:41.620> think<00:02:41.740> again<00:02:42.250> this

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
office behind it now I think again this

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.250 
office behind it now I think again this
is<00:02:42.520> going<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:42.850> be<00:02:43.000> applying<00:02:43.330> of<00:02:43.660> a<00:02:43.780> really

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
is going to be applying of a really

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.199 
is going to be applying of a really
important<00:02:44.709> part<00:02:44.920> of<00:02:45.070> this<00:02:45.220> game<00:02:45.550> is<00:02:45.820> that<00:02:46.180> I

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
important part of this game is that I

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.120 
important part of this game is that I
think<00:02:46.300> when<00:02:46.930> you're<00:02:47.110> looking<00:02:47.470> at<00:02:47.740> the<00:02:47.830> camera

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
think when you're looking at the camera

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.120 
think when you're looking at the camera
and<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:49.810> think<00:02:50.260> something's<00:02:50.800> going<00:02:50.920> to<00:02:51.070> happen

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
and I think something's going to happen

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.670 
and I think something's going to happen
in<00:02:51.550> your<00:02:51.580> office<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:52.150> outside<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.750> office<00:02:53.080> so

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
in your office and outside the office so

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.020 
in your office and outside the office so
you<00:02:53.709> can<00:02:53.830> see<00:02:54.130> some<00:02:54.340> of<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.520> cameras<00:02:54.880> you<00:02:54.910> can

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
you can see some of the cameras you can

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.090 
you can see some of the cameras you can
see<00:02:55.330> outside<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.930> windows<00:02:56.380> and<00:02:56.709> you<00:02:56.770> can<00:02:56.950> see

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
see outside the windows and you can see

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.530 
see outside the windows and you can see
outside<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.580> office<00:02:57.850> you<00:02:57.940> get<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.300> doors

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
outside the office you get to the doors

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.110 
outside the office you get to the doors
and<00:02:58.840> stuff<00:02:59.080> I<00:02:59.459> think<00:03:00.459> when<00:03:00.670> you're<00:03:00.820> looking<00:03:01.030> at

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
and stuff I think when you're looking at

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.240 
and stuff I think when you're looking at
the<00:03:01.239> cameras<00:03:01.720> maybe<00:03:02.320> some<00:03:02.680> things<00:03:02.709> will<00:03:03.100> move

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
the cameras maybe some things will move

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.060 
the cameras maybe some things will move
around<00:03:03.640> in<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.000> windows<00:03:04.510> or<00:03:04.900> things<00:03:05.650> will<00:03:05.860> be

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
around in the windows or things will be

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.699 
around in the windows or things will be
in<00:03:06.220> your<00:03:06.340> office<00:03:06.370> and<00:03:06.880> stuff<00:03:07.150> like<00:03:07.330> that<00:03:07.709> but

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
in your office and stuff like that but

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.550 
in your office and stuff like that but
yeah<00:03:08.950> that's<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.550> majority<00:03:10.300> of<00:03:10.750> this<00:03:11.110> video

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
yeah that's the majority of this video

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.040 
yeah that's the majority of this video
guys<00:03:11.980> I<00:03:12.400> just<00:03:12.730> wanted<00:03:13.000> to<00:03:13.030> let<00:03:13.180> you<00:03:13.360> know<00:03:13.540> guys

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
guys I just wanted to let you know guys

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.380 
guys I just wanted to let you know guys
that<00:03:14.110> these<00:03:14.500> two<00:03:14.890> screens<00:03:15.459> are<00:03:15.760> different

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
that these two screens are different

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.570 
that these two screens are different
they're<00:03:16.600> not<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.930> same<00:03:16.959> screens<00:03:17.769> the

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
they're not the same screens the

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.840 
they're not the same screens the
comparison<00:03:19.330> between<00:03:19.360> them<00:03:20.100> one<00:03:21.100> smaller<00:03:21.580> than

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
comparison between them one smaller than

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.400 
comparison between them one smaller than
the<00:03:21.970> other<00:03:22.000> they've<00:03:22.570> got<00:03:22.720> different<00:03:22.900> screen

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
the other they've got different screen

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.699 
the other they've got different screen
sizes<00:03:23.790> that<00:03:24.790> look<00:03:25.000> very<00:03:25.269> very<00:03:25.450> different<00:03:25.780> so

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
sizes that look very very different so

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.370 
sizes that look very very different so
they're<00:03:27.130> definitely<00:03:27.370> two<00:03:27.850> screens<00:03:28.360> and<00:03:28.750> that

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
they're definitely two screens and that

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.290 
they're definitely two screens and that
these<00:03:29.650> two<00:03:29.980> cameras<00:03:30.550> screens<00:03:30.880> are<00:03:31.030> probably

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
these two cameras screens are probably

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.069 
these two cameras screens are probably
going<00:03:31.480> to<00:03:31.570> be<00:03:31.780> and<00:03:32.130> just<00:03:33.130> like<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.579> Freddy

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
going to be and just like the Freddy

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.479 
going to be and just like the Freddy
system<00:03:35.079> and<00:03:35.200> the<00:03:35.290> camera<00:03:35.650> system<00:03:36.100> on<00:03:36.250> five

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
system and the camera system on five

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.520 
system and the camera system on five
nights<00:03:36.730> at<00:03:36.910> Freddy's<00:03:37.150> to<00:03:37.390> the<00:03:37.930> two<00:03:38.170> arrows

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
nights at Freddy's to the two arrows

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.699 
nights at Freddy's to the two arrows
below<00:03:38.890> the<00:03:39.040> screen<00:03:39.519> on<00:03:39.880> the<00:03:40.000> game<00:03:40.320> to<00:03:41.320> put<00:03:41.500> the

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
below the screen on the game to put the

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.800 
below the screen on the game to put the
mask<00:03:41.890> on<00:03:42.160> to<00:03:42.400> take<00:03:42.640> it<00:03:42.880> off<00:03:43.060> and<00:03:43.420> to<00:03:43.510> put<00:03:43.660> the

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
mask on to take it off and to put the

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.300 
mask on to take it off and to put the
camera<00:03:44.170> on<00:03:44.200> too<00:03:44.440> tight<00:03:44.650> and<00:03:44.829> to<00:03:45.010> take<00:03:45.190> the

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
camera on too tight and to take the

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.860 
camera on too tight and to take the
camera<00:03:45.670> off<00:03:45.700> it's<00:03:46.269> going<00:03:46.420> to<00:03:46.480> be<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:46.660> same

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
camera off it's going to be the same

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.370 
camera off it's going to be the same
finger<00:03:47.350> think<00:03:47.640> we're<00:03:48.640> one<00:03:49.390> of<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:49.750> arrows<00:03:50.200> is

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
finger think we're one of the arrows is

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.780 
finger think we're one of the arrows is
going<00:03:50.590> to<00:03:50.650> let<00:03:50.920> you<00:03:51.040> lift<00:03:51.250> up<00:03:51.400> the<00:03:51.579> system

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
going to let you lift up the system

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.640 
going to let you lift up the system
settings<00:03:52.390> and<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:52.750> other<00:03:52.989> arrows<00:03:53.320> going<00:03:53.350> to

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
settings and the other arrows going to

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.830 
settings and the other arrows going to
let<00:03:53.799> you<00:03:53.980> lift<00:03:54.280> up<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:54.670> camera<00:03:55.120> system<00:03:55.600> that's

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
let you lift up the camera system that's

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.500 
let you lift up the camera system that's
what<00:03:55.989> I<00:03:56.019> think<00:03:56.530> anyway<00:03:56.680> and<00:03:57.250> I<00:03:58.120> think<00:03:58.360> that's

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
what I think anyway and I think that's

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.080 
what I think anyway and I think that's
what<00:03:58.690> he's<00:03:58.810> going<00:03:58.989> to<00:03:59.019> do<00:03:59.230> because<00:03:59.950> there's<00:04:00.940> no

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
what he's going to do because there's no

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.990 
what he's going to do because there's no
Freddie<00:04:01.390> mask<00:04:01.660> on<00:04:02.170> what<00:04:02.709> we<00:04:02.829> can<00:04:03.040> see<00:04:03.280> now<00:04:03.549> what

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
Freddie mask on what we can see now what

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.490 
Freddie mask on what we can see now what
we're<00:04:04.150> going<00:04:04.239> to<00:04:04.329> be<00:04:04.360> able<00:04:04.570> to<00:04:04.810> use<00:04:05.049> so<00:04:05.320> I<00:04:05.350> think

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
we're going to be able to use so I think

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.860 
we're going to be able to use so I think
he's<00:04:05.769> going<00:04:05.950> to<00:04:06.010> just<00:04:06.700> use<00:04:06.940> two<00:04:07.209> cameras<00:04:07.690> this

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
he's going to just use two cameras this

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.319 
he's going to just use two cameras this
time<00:04:08.170> well<00:04:09.010> it's<00:04:09.280> not<00:04:09.430> really<00:04:09.549> a<00:04:09.700> camera<00:04:10.209> it's

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
time well it's not really a camera it's

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.390 
time well it's not really a camera it's
like<00:04:10.540> a<00:04:10.570> commits<00:04:11.320> like<00:04:11.470> a<00:04:11.500> screen<00:04:12.010> it's<00:04:12.250> not

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
like a commits like a screen it's not

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.729

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
really a camera screen saris the system

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.120 
really a camera screen saris the system
saying<00:04:15.100> sorry<00:04:15.549> and<00:04:16.470> well<00:04:17.470> yeah<00:04:17.680> it's<00:04:17.919> just

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
guys it looks difficult we know how big

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.779 
guys it looks difficult we know how big
the<00:04:25.720> map<00:04:25.930> is<00:04:26.110> now<00:04:26.289> as<00:04:26.440> well<00:04:26.680> that<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:27.430> camera

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:27.789 
the map is now as well that the camera

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:29.610 
the map is now as well that the camera
systems<00:04:28.210> just<00:04:28.419> looks<00:04:28.690> completely<00:04:29.320> different

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
systems just looks completely different

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.150 
systems just looks completely different
and<00:04:29.979> pretty<00:04:30.460> difficult<00:04:30.700> in<00:04:31.150> my<00:04:31.300> opinion<00:04:31.660> so

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
and pretty difficult in my opinion so

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.950 
and pretty difficult in my opinion so
we'll<00:04:33.160> see<00:04:33.400> what<00:04:33.520> happens<00:04:33.580> i<00:04:34.240> think<00:04:34.450> this<00:04:34.570> five

that the fact that i think the Scott's
going<00:05:21.519> to<00:05:21.610> be<00:05:21.749> using<00:05:23.219> two<00:05:24.219> screens<00:05:24.459> this<00:05:24.909> time

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:25.239 
going to be using two screens this time

00:05:25.239 --> 00:05:27.209 
going to be using two screens this time
and<00:05:25.539> one's<00:05:26.409> going<00:05:26.649> to<00:05:26.679> be<00:05:26.799> the<00:05:26.889> system

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:27.219 
and one's going to be the system

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:28.769 
and one's going to be the system
settings<00:05:27.519> and<00:05:27.789> one's<00:05:28.149> going<00:05:28.419> to<00:05:28.449> be<00:05:28.599> the

00:05:28.769 --> 00:05:28.779 
settings and one's going to be the

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:31.409 
settings and one's going to be the
camera<00:05:29.110> system<00:05:29.649> and<00:05:29.889> another<00:05:30.819> difference<00:05:31.269> is

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
camera system and another difference is

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.959 
camera system and another difference is
that<00:05:31.479> you<00:05:32.049> can<00:05:32.229> also<00:05:32.409> see<00:05:32.829> the<00:05:32.949> office<00:05:33.369> and<00:05:33.610> the

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:33.969 
that you can also see the office and the

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:35.879 
that you can also see the office and the
window<00:05:34.479> why<00:05:35.110> are<00:05:35.169> you<00:05:35.259> looking<00:05:35.439> at<00:05:35.709> these

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
window why are you looking at these

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.029 
window why are you looking at these
screens<00:05:36.519> which<00:05:37.239> he<00:05:37.389> hasn't<00:05:37.749> done<00:05:37.869> before<00:05:38.349> so<00:05:39.009> I

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 
screens which he hasn't done before so I

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.269 
screens which he hasn't done before so I
think<00:05:39.429> he's<00:05:39.669> doing<00:05:39.909> this<00:05:39.999> for<00:05:40.209> a<00:05:40.239> reason<00:05:40.299> and<00:05:41.279> I

00:05:42.269 --> 00:05:42.279 
think he's doing this for a reason and I

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:43.499 
think he's doing this for a reason and I
think<00:05:42.489> that<00:05:42.609> we're<00:05:42.699> going<00:05:42.789> to<00:05:42.909> be<00:05:42.999> able<00:05:43.089> to<00:05:43.359> see

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:43.509 
think that we're going to be able to see

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:45.509 
think that we're going to be able to see
some<00:05:43.749> things<00:05:43.929> moving<00:05:44.679> around<00:05:44.769> the<00:05:45.039> office<00:05:45.339> or

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:45.519 
some things moving around the office or
