00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.740 
happening as Marines will finally be
added<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.549> can<00:01:53.700> see<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:54.030> spawning<00:01:54.420> pool

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
added you can see that a spawning pool

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.420 
added you can see that a spawning pool
should<00:01:55.020> be<00:01:55.170> added<00:01:55.500> here<00:01:55.530> in<00:01:55.829> just<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.130> moment

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
should be added here in just a moment

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.609 
should be added here in just a moment
that<00:01:56.850> maaga<00:01:57.119> needs<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.630> spawning<00:01:57.899> pool<00:01:58.200> he

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
that maaga needs that spawning pool he

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.069 
that maaga needs that spawning pool he
should<00:01:58.829> not<00:01:59.040> go<00:01:59.280> for<00:01:59.490> gas<00:01:59.700> as<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.780> would<00:02:00.960> be

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
should not go for gas as that would be

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.719 
should not go for gas as that would be
that<00:02:01.409> would<00:02:01.469> just<00:02:01.710> end<00:02:01.829> up<00:02:01.950> hurting<00:02:01.979> them<00:02:02.340> even

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
that would just end up hurting them even

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.609 
that would just end up hurting them even
more<00:02:02.759> in<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.149> long<00:02:03.360> run<00:02:03.420> as<00:02:03.750> Marines<00:02:04.170> are<00:02:04.439> now

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
more in the long run as Marines are now

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.039 
more in the long run as Marines are now
being<00:02:04.950> added<00:02:05.369> one<00:02:05.880> marine<00:02:06.210> being<00:02:06.450> added<00:02:06.750> here

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
being added one marine being added here

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.260 
being added one marine being added here
we'll<00:02:07.829> see<00:02:08.009> what<00:02:08.039> exactly<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.640> spawning<00:02:08.940> pool

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
we'll see what exactly the spawning pool

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.059 
we'll see what exactly the spawning pool
will<00:02:09.479> know<00:02:09.629> he<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:09.989> going<00:02:10.259> for<00:02:10.349> gas<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.860> that

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
will know he is going for gas and that

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.030 
will know he is going for gas and that
is<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.280> really<00:02:11.730> really<00:02:11.760> dangerous<00:02:12.390> dangerous

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
is a really really dangerous dangerous

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.610 
is a really really dangerous dangerous
choice<00:02:14.819> there<00:02:15.209> as<00:02:15.390> going<00:02:16.049> for<00:02:16.230> gas<00:02:16.409> and

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
choice there as going for gas and

choice there as going for gas and
metabolic<00:02:17.040> boost<00:02:17.189> will<00:02:17.489> keep<00:02:17.790> those<00:02:17.969> earnings

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
metabolic boost will keep those earnings

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.209 
metabolic boost will keep those earnings
or<00:02:18.450> allow<00:02:18.689> those<00:02:18.870> zerglings<00:02:19.379> to<00:02:19.650> get

or allow those zerglings to get
metabolic<00:02:20.640> boost<00:02:20.790> faster<00:02:21.299> but<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.900> is<00:02:22.439> going

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
metabolic boost faster but it is going

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.380 
metabolic boost faster but it is going
to<00:02:22.799> really<00:02:23.069> hurt<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.579> total<00:02:23.939> number<00:02:24.359> of

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390
