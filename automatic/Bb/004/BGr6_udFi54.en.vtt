00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.089
 their cooking potato immediately 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.359
 with meat usually this dish is very tasty 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.570

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:24.420
 decoction of 34 pork and can be used 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.390
 on then I'm a fairly large onion 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.010
 I chop I chop larger because I 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.529
 then I will be still with the meat 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.510
 twist if you basically love 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.020
 and u when you come across pieces 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.120

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.870
 chop it smaller yes and fry and not 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.660
 twist such a current cut then 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.340
 fry in a pan until golden 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.649
 colors in this way then I 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.770
 scratched potatoes and put them to cook up 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.289

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:18.180
 onion meat becomes much juicier 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:20.070
 flavored and tastier in principle or not 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.950
 so you know how crumbly when 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.939
 onions you twist there is not exactly 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.280

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:49.200
