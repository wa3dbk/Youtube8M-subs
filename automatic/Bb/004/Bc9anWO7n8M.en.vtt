00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
sweat off my nutsack sheesh well here we
are<00:04:07.330> at<00:04:07.540> the<00:04:07.690> Hortons<00:04:08.310> London<00:04:09.310> this<00:04:09.520> time<00:04:09.760> holy

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
are at the Hortons London this time holy

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.830 
are at the Hortons London this time holy
but<00:04:11.320> I<00:04:11.950> think<00:04:12.760> this<00:04:12.940> is<00:04:13.120> the<00:04:13.300> type<00:04:13.480> of<00:04:13.510> fence

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
but I think this is the type of fence

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.570 
but I think this is the type of fence
they're<00:04:14.020> they're<00:04:14.410> going<00:04:14.680> for<00:04:15.010> here<00:04:15.340> and<00:04:15.459> they

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
they're they're going for here and they

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.000 
they're they're going for here and they
just<00:04:15.820> they<00:04:16.090> just<00:04:16.380> couldn't<00:04:17.380> sort<00:04:17.680> of<00:04:17.799> grasp

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
just they just couldn't sort of grasp

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.220 
just they just couldn't sort of grasp
but<00:04:18.220> notice<00:04:18.520> how<00:04:18.670> they<00:04:18.790> used<00:04:19.060> fence<00:04:19.750> boards

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
but notice how they used fence boards

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:21.470 
but notice how they used fence boards
for<00:04:20.410> a<00:04:20.440> fence

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
for a fence

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.570 
for a fence
you<00:04:22.200> know<00:04:22.350> pressure-treated<00:04:22.920> so<00:04:23.310> they<00:04:23.430> don't

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
you know pressure-treated so they don't

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.970 
you know pressure-treated so they don't
just<00:04:23.790> friggin<00:04:24.120> rot<00:04:24.390> away<00:04:24.570> and<00:04:24.990> friggin<00:04:25.620> to

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
just friggin rot away and friggin to

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.850 
just friggin rot away and friggin to
turn<00:04:26.190> to<00:04:26.340> masks<00:04:26.580> in<00:04:26.880> like<00:04:27.180> minutes<00:04:27.830> they<00:04:28.830> I

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
turn to masks in like minutes they I

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.800 
turn to masks in like minutes they I
highly<00:04:29.790> doubt<00:04:29.940> they're<00:04:30.180> gonna<00:04:30.300> be<00:04:30.540> anything

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
highly doubt they're gonna be anything

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.200 
highly doubt they're gonna be anything
