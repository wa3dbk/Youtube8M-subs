00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
does look a little bit more like an

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:43.940 
does look a little bit more like an
animation<00:01:43.020> just<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.439> little<00:01:43.680> bit<00:01:43.799> more

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
animation just a little bit more

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
realistic your arm isn't just like a

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.910 
realistic your arm isn't just like a
straight<00:01:45.689> rectangle<00:01:46.290> which<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.439> pretty<00:01:46.770> nice

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
straight rectangle which is pretty nice

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.469 
straight rectangle which is pretty nice
and<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.640> only<00:01:47.759> problem<00:01:48.000> I've<00:01:48.149> seen<00:01:48.299> with<00:01:48.390> it

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
and the only problem I've seen with it

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.240 
and the only problem I've seen with it
so<00:01:48.630> far<00:01:48.840> as<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.079> guys<00:01:49.200> can<00:01:49.380> see<00:01:49.590> now<00:01:49.740> there's

so far as you guys can see now there's

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.460 
so far as you guys can see now there's
like<00:01:50.369> these<00:01:50.549> little<00:01:50.820> black<00:01:51.180> shades<00:01:51.659> in<00:01:51.960> the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.969 
and knees and all that kind of stuff
which<00:01:57.810> kind<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.380> know<00:01:58.500> lowers<00:01:58.860> the

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
which kind of you know lowers the

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.770 
which kind of you know lowers the
quality<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.670> look<00:01:59.850> of<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.119> but<00:02:00.149> if<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.509> could

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
quality and look of it but if that could

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.639 
quality and look of it but if that could
get<00:02:00.869> fixed<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.259> would<00:02:01.350> look<00:02:01.439> definitely

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
get fixed it would look definitely

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.350 
get fixed it would look definitely
really<00:02:02.040> awesome<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:02.939> that's<00:02:03.000> really<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.299> only

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
really awesome so that's really the only

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.260 
really awesome so that's really the only
part<00:02:03.780> we<00:02:03.930> need<00:02:04.140> fixed<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.969> other<00:02:05.969> than<00:02:06.180> that

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
part we need fixed and other than that

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.760 
part we need fixed and other than that
it's<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.570> pretty<00:02:06.719> flawless<00:02:06.990> mod<00:02:07.350> nothing<00:02:07.649> else

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
it's a pretty flawless mod nothing else

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.469 
it's a pretty flawless mod nothing else
much<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.129> say<00:02:08.280> about<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.520> quite<00:02:08.819> aesthetic<00:02:09.360> and

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
much to say about it quite aesthetic and

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.720 
much to say about it quite aesthetic and
as<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.379> guys<00:02:10.530> saw<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.860> other<00:02:11.099> little<00:02:11.310> update

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
as you guys saw the other little update

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.820 
as you guys saw the other little update
to<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.209> when<00:02:12.870> you're<00:02:12.989> riding<00:02:13.140> uphill

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
to it is when you're riding uphill

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.199 
to it is when you're riding uphill
when<00:02:14.830> you're<00:02:14.950> writing<00:02:15.160> a<00:02:15.220> pig<00:02:15.459> with<00:02:15.670> a<00:02:15.700> saddle

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
when you're writing a pig with a saddle

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.600 
when you're writing a pig with a saddle
it<00:02:16.569> also<00:02:16.720> updates<00:02:16.959> it<00:02:17.319> so<00:02:17.560> your<00:02:17.950> legs<00:02:18.190> kind<00:02:18.520> of

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
it also updates it so your legs kind of

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.280 
it also updates it so your legs kind of
stick<00:02:18.850> out<00:02:18.970> in<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.300> nice<00:02:19.480> manner<00:02:19.750> but<00:02:19.990> right<00:02:20.140> now

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
stick out in a nice manner but right now

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.270 
stick out in a nice manner but right now
they're<00:02:20.470> inside<00:02:20.770> the<00:02:20.800> pig

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
they're inside the pig

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.770 
they're inside the pig
so<00:02:21.610> hopefully<00:02:21.819> that<00:02:22.060> can<00:02:22.150> be<00:02:22.209> fixed<00:02:22.540> because

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
so hopefully that can be fixed because

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.750 
so hopefully that can be fixed because
that<00:02:23.140> doesn't<00:02:23.350> really<00:02:23.560> look<00:02:23.740> correct<00:02:24.160> but

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
that doesn't really look correct but

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.520 
that doesn't really look correct but
your<00:02:25.300> your<00:02:25.660> arms<00:02:25.870> also<00:02:26.110> look<00:02:26.260> like<00:02:26.380> they're

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
your your arms also look like they're

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.930 
your your arms also look like they're
kind<00:02:26.740> of<00:02:26.800> holding<00:02:27.069> the<00:02:27.220> top<00:02:27.400> of<00:02:27.520> the<00:02:27.610> pig<00:02:27.790> if

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
kind of holding the top of the pig if

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.059 
kind of holding the top of the pig if
you<00:02:28.060> have<00:02:28.240> a<00:02:28.270> little<00:02:28.660> carrot<00:02:29.080> and<00:02:29.200> stick<00:02:29.470> like

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
you have a little carrot and stick like

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.680 
you have a little carrot and stick like
so<00:02:30.340> it<00:02:30.459> looks<00:02:30.610> really<00:02:30.819> good<00:02:31.060> like<00:02:31.120> you're<00:02:31.480> kind

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
so it looks really good like you're kind

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.000 
so it looks really good like you're kind
of<00:02:31.750> ready<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:32.020> actually<00:02:32.260> wrap<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.739> pig<00:02:32.890> and

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
of ready to actually wrap the pig and

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.229 
of ready to actually wrap the pig and
only<00:02:33.190> problem<00:02:33.520> with<00:02:33.610> it<00:02:33.640> right<00:02:33.880> now<00:02:34.030> is<00:02:34.150> you

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
only problem with it right now is you

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:35.790 
only problem with it right now is you
can<00:02:34.270> rotate<00:02:34.540> your<00:02:34.750> head<00:02:34.989> as<00:02:35.110> much<00:02:35.319> as<00:02:35.440> you<00:02:35.560> want

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
can rotate your head as much as you want

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.130 
can rotate your head as much as you want
which<00:02:36.220> obviously<00:02:36.550> isn't<00:02:36.819> too<00:02:37.090> realistic<00:02:37.450> but

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
which obviously isn't too realistic but

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.630 
which obviously isn't too realistic but
nevertheless<00:02:38.470> I'm<00:02:38.890> sure<00:02:39.040> this<00:02:39.190> mod<00:02:39.370> will<00:02:39.400> get

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
nevertheless I'm sure this mod will get

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.250 
nevertheless I'm sure this mod will get
updated<00:02:39.940> somewhat<00:02:40.420> so<00:02:40.540> it<00:02:40.660> will<00:02:40.750> be<00:02:40.840> fixed<00:02:41.050> but

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
updated somewhat so it will be fixed but

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.900 
updated somewhat so it will be fixed but
you<00:02:41.319> can<00:02:41.440> just<00:02:41.560> be<00:02:41.709> like<00:02:41.860> whoa<00:02:42.069> look<00:02:42.700> at<00:02:42.760> my
