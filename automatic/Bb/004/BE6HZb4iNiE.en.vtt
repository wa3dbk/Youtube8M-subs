00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
collected and down to the condenser this

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.510 
collected and down to the condenser this
is<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.119> condenser<00:01:18.659> it's<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.930> coil<00:01:19.250> we<00:01:20.250> fill

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
is the condenser it's a coil we fill

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.730 
is the condenser it's a coil we fill
that<00:01:20.640> with<00:01:20.759> ice<00:01:20.939> because<00:01:21.270> what<00:01:21.930> we<00:01:22.049> want<00:01:22.290> is

this to be ice cold with this to the
red-hot<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:25.049> soon<00:01:25.320> as<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.530> vapor<00:01:25.740> touches

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
red-hot so soon as the vapor touches

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.340 
red-hot so soon as the vapor touches
here<00:01:26.400> yeah<00:01:26.790> it's<00:01:27.509> straight<00:01:27.780> away<00:01:27.990> liquid

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
here yeah it's straight away liquid

again alright swallows down here we

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.609 
again alright swallows down here we
collect<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:31.610> comes<00:01:32.610> out<00:01:32.700> eighty-six<00:01:33.420> percent

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
collect it comes out eighty-six percent
