00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.490
 now wants to come to a small one 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.750
 player search video invests but so 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.150
 I am now hard times more often 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.040
 actually every day on a few people 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.660
 together between and we are always looking for 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.679
 even more players to play because that 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.049
 all the time really a hardcore 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.230
 team game and also makes more fun more 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.510
 people and it is therefore when you are here 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.410
 so storm address at play you can 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.810
 contact you 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.080
 you can me here medicus 21 90 m 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.830
 then ball by me automatically 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:35.010
 not as a team but in the attic 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.860
 said please, you are properly maintained, however 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.059
 know battle.net exactly and take 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.989
 I always ask you others if 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.850
 we want to play 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.460
 if you said okay I'm actually 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.980
 rather the brand new is a beta key 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.660
 you could get it all - can you still? 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.329
 Report because we often just like 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.199
 she gives these 17 different games 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.629
 This is the war this one sees 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.399
 with gamer probably the child does not care 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.230
 that now off the ligue west and 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.949
 to learn heroes and things 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.359
 try 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.159
 Everyone can join in no matter 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.540
 which didnt matter if he did 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.640
 Player today has got power 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.320
 easy with then 51 always funnier and 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.689
 Super beginners are always with people 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.420
 not to know would have to have ts 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.860
 quality and then it works 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.530
 and it makes me less see 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.640
 sight is allowed to play with turn 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.490
 that we have the whole trailer maybe 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.130
 lust among you and others like that 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.210
 euroleague plays as nick and that 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.829
 is a bit better then 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.210
 Well, I'm not good 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.130
 I'm in the top 28 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.350
 but also not that one necessarily 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.700
 still beginners are more complete than us 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.470
 wanted to make play look too 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.880
 still people then you have to have one 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.900
 be a bit more ambitious and also 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.180
 professional to the story 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.259
 Reach and deal with your heroes 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.880
 you can also need a relative 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.780
 Great repertoire keeps it up 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.970
 Of course, no sense 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.079
 struggled to play it I can both 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.270
 swap the parts 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.680
 you have to actually stop the 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.820
 make pixels that they can make sense 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.649
 and for that, many need so much 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.210
 experience so that says he with it 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.829
 he also wanted to make welcome 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.020
 In any case, do not rescue and let me know 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.430
 say and he fits he is necessary as 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.229
 said that always lost itself 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.350
 has been interpreted in ambitious already 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.310
 We can use three hard into the shelf I 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.780
 just play to win if the 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.770
 Complete playing with a game mode 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.209
 Game is just for you to try 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.140
 and to learn and have fun 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.520
 support 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.480
 game mode and accordingly should 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.459
 the players also the attitude 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.470
 bring it we do not have to wrestle 28 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.390
 but now be a core question this 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.420
 system has certainly one too 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.830
 bit makes little sense so yes how 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.510
 said if you want to have then ends 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:34.050
 not just here is again the day 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:35.580
 medicus 26 90 indiscriminately so 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.600
 class we do not need Bob say 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.220
 because as I said everyone actually too 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.480
 Everyone must be able to play because they are 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.880
 No bright swap can change the system 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.080
 moment is only and therefore why 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.670
 Nice that I have a little something you have 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.870
 However, a little preference can there 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.850
 you might also control a bit 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.290
 but everyone should actually all 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:55.739
 can play and what more 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.660
 is to say you christ hollow the 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:01.800
 40 patients catastrophically bad 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.360
 catastrophically bad that was it on 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.860
 Every case and then I'm looking forward to it 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.180
 on the first messages or caring 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.500
 Already tomorrow evening together 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.209
 so they actually play 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.660
 almost every day in any case also on 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.790
 weekend hardcore and see you next 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.220
 then play with oh so a thing 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.480
 maybe even if you join in 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.980
 the likelihood is never so low 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.400
 did you ever appear in the video? 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.420
 midlife ts or as a replay recording so 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.799
 Just get in touch if he so too 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.250
 agree that with time, too 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.250
 are not here
