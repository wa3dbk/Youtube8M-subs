 I started to pm the car start listening to my belly talking to me minutes 

00:02:57.429 --> 00:03:00.039
 dunga was like that 

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:03.349
 in that confusion that gave in the first post gazoli created to qualify

 newspaper that will make them tick

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:34.899
 the fox 2 

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:36.269
 Then I'll go to Ignatius. 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.010
 the iad donated to the light of the bay had erased I would say ascended I will do 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.860
 more with the same panorama pt refers to the light when I entered as it was 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.930
 but this technology is an awesome business to be able to appreciate 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:47.760
 it turned us on 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.379
 so everyone without surprises 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:50.879
 I entered 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:55.249
 I have that little black hair and such and I saw that the delay only those whistle that you 

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:56.399

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:57.659
 laughs 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:00.880
 staying in the bank we can only have that in that situation 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.410
 today it will take a while to delay the first thing that speeds up the burning 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.569
 newspaper or magazine did not have any of this 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.999
 I saw those phrases on the door of the volleyball toilet these phases 

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:11.980
 as I have already passed the 40 years of the bossa nova round 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.019
 corporal hair and had not helder gouvea September I was approaching 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:20.100
 tunnel next year there she was there without total dad she proves every day the damned 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.200
 there may be serious business 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.270
 when I went to get the paper to go away the light off nothing 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.410
 Today, the guy is a process that needs to be 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.590
 33 7% correct 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.130
 me 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.610
 dilma has to wait someone was being made 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.270
 after about ten minutes between a citizen as a citizen and a supporter 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.270
 again thanks god I was catching pope to the country although the karate around the 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.309
 side of the vase on the thick side has a granite stone separating us 

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:51.309
 it can only if such current values ​​are okay 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:54.569
 they also know 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:56.550
 I think he saw me coming in here. 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.509
 is the one that would match the face of this month is always being much inside 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.620
 the defeat of bnb 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.129
 Are you coming to the river? 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:06.960
 the event comes from rio de janeiro 39 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.180
 victory that was the way of victory 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.020
 What are you doing? 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.600
 I'm a humorist and I was working as a show 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.379
 and I will deny the personal support rio had fun was very cool 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:19.129
 this turn that happens 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:21.919
 ig what would kill me teresa piggy pt is not that ended up advertisement 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.919
 irregular 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:35.469
 every season 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:36.990
 we have ours 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.949
 vandinho 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:41.370
 before what in your evaluation 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.650
 the use and occupation of iraq or what 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:48.779
 this time it was different from the final game sp 

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:51.779
 the soldiers were better than the characters 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:54.849
 this time nike so 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:57.999
 it's even harder to make a clean face goal than with the character 

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:00.480
 but I think the o landmarks castro son 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.369
 ombudsman 

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:03.689
 forum - I assumed the presidency 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:07.599
 ministry took over the audience took over the stage 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:11.669
 that they are really good, that they are prepared and that they 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:13.770
 they are already real professionals 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.360
 the other 4 or I think the one mille 4 the july pine 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.430
 it was also well 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.580
 already with the character but the number one the car to a person to have done the 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.300
 banner round psp of a protest cube 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.259
 I think this time 

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:31.879
 the best three for me were the last three to 1400 civilians
