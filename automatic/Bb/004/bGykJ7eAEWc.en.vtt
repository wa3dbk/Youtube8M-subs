00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.570
 and rest of welcome to a review that 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:12.089
 is perhaps already known by many but I 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.280
 I know that for many others not because I gave 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:17.640
 account in the face that many do not know 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.610
 like how to create a game or comment 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.560
 an online game of pixel goal I tell you 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.030
 maybe some of you already know our 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.040
 previous but good if you want to sell a 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.530
 challenge me and if not then minimum let me 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.480
 you like us for today I say if you already know 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.009
 not good as you know the piston is 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.360
 totally free in the play on which 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.399
 down is the description clean if not 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.739
 you want to look for the egg simply 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.230
 click there weighs 175 megs then 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.149
 good campaign I think not in that 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.210
 he saw them the campaign really is of 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.519
 survival is simply a way in 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.019
 the one that is is to make a sand type and 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:50.550
 Stay list of guayas and you have to 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.350
 killing him is very good to practice myself 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.030
 I recommend that you first 20 in the 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.649
 campaign and play a good time a 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.960
 survival so that for that great practice 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.760
 so that it takes little money or more than anything 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.159
 to be able to buy things and play in 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.010
 Chinese online is not good yesterday I got it 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:07.259

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.760
 well tasty but good what else 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.200

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.180

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.950

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.630
 name if you did not know god and it's the first 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.250
 once you play this here obviously 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.870
 you can give him here or here if 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.130
 you want to see different skins or if 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.560
 you want to add the study of minecraft 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.250
 the only thing you have to do 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.500
 obviously get your minecraft to my 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.070
 minecraft skin in point png as it is 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.990
 this case 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.840
 today you put the name like that 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.210
 multi and a low skin skin good forgiveness 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.360
 below zero ok as is with a capital 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.060
 multi all that point png then this one what 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.470
 we are going to copy in what part although 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.090
 it's not good that's the point png image 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.350
 that you have to copy did not decide the 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.780
 change of name and havana are going to 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.420
 go to the android folder then to data it 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.750
 are going to go to the pixel part a 3d and 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.750
 here is 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.190
 so that h and here is where they are 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.570
 all the skins that are supposed to 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.090
 shows the game the only thing you have to 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.530
 to do is substitute this so you have 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.690
 that put this same name very well 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.570
 under skin and subzero obviously 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.430
 you put it to you skin what copies and what 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.260
 you paste in this folder replacing this 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.440
 obviously and then good so you're going to 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.720
 to be able to choose your simple skin 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.200
 let's go now yes to what is this play 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.640
 online let's go to multiplayer we give in 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.650
 cooperative there is not much difference 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.040
 what in cooperative the only 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.710
 difference this is that it will not give you the 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.440
 world worldwide or local option 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.510
 some strange reason 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.600
 in cooperatives and these are the same 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.370
 steps to create a session and to 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.170
 join but what is not going to add is 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.730
 this option in this case the eggs we 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.070
 let's go to the match section ok 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.110
 I say them for the local they will follow the 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.090
 almost good we will see also 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.280
 local riva no if you go to local you will 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.360
 leave this part and here they will appear 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.010
 previously the networks that are 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.250
 connected to the internet 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.020
 if you want to create a new one you give ingrid 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.210
 the map you choose then you will give it 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.400
 to the button of this part here obviously 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.860
 you can assign maximum numbers of players 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.480
 I think the maximum is 8 and the number of 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.000
 deaths is like that I think there is no limit 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.420
 and here you put the name of your server 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.370
 ok to the session that you are going to create ready you 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.050
 you go to the next one and if you and cialis to 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.270
 start charging not if you're the one 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.820
 will join 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.650
 and obviously you go to this part and here 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.930
 the simple name has to appear 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.510
 it's a touch and you come in now let's go to 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.340
 word white that is the rust for 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.140
 cards that want to play with me and the 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.820
 pixel with a little bit we are going to go to 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.930
 worldwide english 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.730
 obviously some will be blocked 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.340
 I suppose the two blocks in mode 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.410
 campaign cities in random you will 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.900
 send to any map what wei with the 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:49.390
 widgets that are and charalÃ¡ not if you give 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.970
 only in start 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.819
 but well let's go here to the custom 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.560
 to create our our session here 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.180
 It is also the same but you can choose 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.240
 what you want or can you give in 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.910
 search to find a session or tell us 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:07.310
 that we are first to do a great 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:10.310
 obviously here you are going to put the name 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.190
 and sorry 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.810
 first in search of searching here you 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.370
 we are going to obviously put the name of the 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.250
 of the session you're looking for and be 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.690
 it's that simple if you have a password 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.639
 they had to have passed, he puts it on 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.650

 we are going to give you in create let's choose 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.889
 some map that we want then 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.380
 believe the coliseum will show you in this 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:33.860
 little button here and here obviously here 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.389
 as it worked in the land we are going to 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.180

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.780
 others to the guys who are going to join them 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.780
 they have to pass the ip that in this case 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.580
 of states and the password ok then 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.530
 Well, it's easy that I do not tell them 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.110
 to look for it simply on the button 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.479
