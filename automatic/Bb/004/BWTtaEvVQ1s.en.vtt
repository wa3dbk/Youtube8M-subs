00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:23.400
 you will see an order it cost me I 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.900
 believe 70 euros without shipping costs 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.510
 are the discounts on the costs of 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.000
 customs and so there's been done 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.500
 go through dhl 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.489
 although cucumber more precisely 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.760
 and so I got there now and like 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.969

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:07.890
 to see there to put in the stadium 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.649
 maths when we can see it's the nerve 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.900

 beautiful so here are some timers next 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.980
 a bag for timer so z cube the the 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.519
 mark as being able to fit in 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:35.220

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:39.989

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:49.140

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:53.340
 mad that is 3 to 103 for this timer I 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:59.730
 do not know if we have a paper that is not used to 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:04.890
 nothing and here it is just that me 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:07.829
 so let's down here the spitz the 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.850
 later matt third czar 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:13.620

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.680

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:20.180
 proud this one he is beautiful he is well 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.180
 finally Julian really to say on 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:27.680
 Here we put that aside because 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:27.680
 it takes a little bit of class 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:40.410
 then the brass then two tubes and 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:43.530
 stones here we do not count the 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.090
 stickers so it's out of the water 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.070
 fluorescent stickers to letters by 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.130
 three so 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:52.500
 but it's the same two except that there is 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.660
 has one who is white and has black feet and 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.120
 this is the stick of stickers 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.260
 fluorescent worried white finally 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.750
 learnedly me that TV 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.200
 why we were two so I know you 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:07.770
 are stickers then 1 2 by 2 so 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:12.030
 I took 8 and n 1 because I love 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.950
 the cannage a pop feeling that goes great 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:18.180
 well 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:22.910
 the so I am and even interrupted 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:26.250
 then there 8 and n 1 of the mark 8 eden 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.050
 so we'll try to train them 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.560
 property except that he is pale heightened he 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:37.590
 is super tight but its center is good 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:40.320
 So these jealous black neighborhoods 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.840
 it's the noise I see enough 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:51.390
 particular whose marc daily for 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:59.480
 those who do not trust the cusm with the 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:59.480
 eden so here is a second version 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:12.810
 here and the new way so have a mark 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.220
 that I do not know too much I hesitate to 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.180
 buy it first but when I saw the 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.740

 saint-flo cube store and when I saw 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.400

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.150
 see these are not colors 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.990
 classics there are fluorescents so 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.550
 frankly I find pretty good so he 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.610
 there is the white of the yellow claude huber flotho 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.040
 violence related to the tubes the pdc to 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.720

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:50.610

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:53.970
 pieces if I get to so I try to 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:06:02.610

00:05:53.970 --> 00:06:10.640

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:10.640

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.690
 frankly it's great a bit if the 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:21.560
 classes so the window get wet or in 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:21.560
 Japanese or otherwise the box 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:28.139
 here 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:30.389
 so the cube I really like 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:33.719
 it is so good, so pale 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:35.520
 camera not yet tripod take the 

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:37.800
 side of the buy I think I'm going 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.169
 watch as much as I can see a little 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.960
 show them that you frankly teresa 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:52.009
 super good girl since I think that 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:55.650
 it's him the boy when marketing the 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:57.330
 wii then against that a jogging there 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.819

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:03.020
 little the thresholds so they tight enough 

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:06.889
 but my name was very fast 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:09.419
 Ok, that's fine, so 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:14.249
 this is what I recommend to patients 

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:17.339
 nor its causes why there what I have 

00:07:14.249 --> 00:07:19.020

00:07:17.339 --> 00:07:20.639
 dead does so I hope his complaint 

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:23.009

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:25.319
