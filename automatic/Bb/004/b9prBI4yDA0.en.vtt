Nassif<00:00:12.210> they<00:00:12.330> seemed<00:00:12.570> durable<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.230> me<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:13.940> i

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
Nassif they seemed durable to me and i

Nassif they seemed durable to me and i
replied<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.450> comment<00:00:15.839> that<00:00:15.990> yeah<00:00:16.320> they

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
replied in the comment that yeah they

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.519 
replied in the comment that yeah they
did<00:00:16.710> but<00:00:17.660> maybe<00:00:18.660> i<00:00:18.779> do<00:00:18.840> some<00:00:19.140> destructive

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
did but maybe i do some destructive

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.429 
did but maybe i do some destructive
testing<00:00:20.070> see<00:00:20.910> exactly<00:00:21.630> how<00:00:21.900> much<00:00:22.050> strain

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
testing see exactly how much strain

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.519 
testing see exactly how much strain
these<00:00:22.650> things<00:00:22.859> can<00:00:23.070> bear<00:00:23.539> this<00:00:24.539> one<00:00:24.779> i've<00:00:25.410> been

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
these things can bear this one i've been

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.029 
these things can bear this one i've been
using<00:00:25.710> for<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.039> few<00:00:26.279> months<00:00:27.740> doesn't<00:00:28.740> have<00:00:28.859> its

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
using for a few months doesn't have its

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.519 
using for a few months doesn't have its
original<00:00:29.460> edge<00:00:29.580> on<00:00:29.820> anymore<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.599> it's<00:00:31.439> going

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
original edge on anymore so it's going

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.260 
original edge on anymore so it's going
to<00:00:31.590> be<00:00:31.679> our<00:00:31.890> sacrificial<00:00:32.790> lamb<00:00:35.030> one<00:00:36.030> thing<00:00:36.210> i

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
to be our sacrificial lamb one thing i

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.520 
to be our sacrificial lamb one thing i
want<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.450> show<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.500> amount<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:37.980> five

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
want to show you is the amount of five

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.369 
want to show you is the amount of five
flex<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.600> handle<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.870> put<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.170> under

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
flex in the handle and put it under

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.170 
flex in the handle and put it under
strain<00:00:43.710> let's<00:00:44.010> put<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.280> very<00:00:44.520> badly<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.090> i'm

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
strain let's put in very badly so i'm

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.060 
strain let's put in very badly so i'm
putting<00:00:45.329> on<00:00:45.539> some<00:00:45.719> leather<00:00:45.870> gloves

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.530 

and<00:00:53.920> so<00:00:54.920> let's<00:00:55.100> say<00:00:55.250> you<00:00:55.340> have<00:00:55.610> it<00:00:55.760> jammed<00:00:56.360> in

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
and so let's say you have it jammed in

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:04.009 
and so let's say you have it jammed in
something<00:00:57.460> there's<00:00:58.460> straight

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.870 

that's<00:01:04.680> what<00:01:04.979> happens<00:01:05.280> with<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.489> handle

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
that's what happens with the handle

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.840 
that's what happens with the handle
things<00:01:06.689> under<00:01:06.990> strange<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:08.250> case<00:01:08.490> it's

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
things under strange in this case it's

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.870 
things under strange in this case it's
actually<00:01:09.030> bent<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:10.320> blade

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
actually bent the blade

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.610 
actually bent the blade
because<00:01:12.509> of<00:01:12.600> where<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.780> was<00:01:12.869> grabbing<00:01:13.229> it

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
because of where I was grabbing it

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.770 
because of where I was grabbing it
and<00:01:14.740> that<00:01:15.310> is<00:01:15.430> the<00:01:15.580> standard<00:01:15.880> reaction<00:01:16.180> with

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
and that is the standard reaction with

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.690 
and that is the standard reaction with
the<00:01:16.810> razors<00:01:17.290> when<00:01:17.620> you<00:01:17.710> put<00:01:17.920> stress<00:01:18.160> directly

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
the razors when you put stress directly

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.680 
the razors when you put stress directly
on<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.030> blade

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.150 

so<00:01:24.230> you<00:01:24.320> can<00:01:24.470> straighten<00:01:24.770> this<00:01:24.830> out<00:01:24.950> a<00:01:25.010> little

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
so you can straighten this out a little

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:31.790 
so you can straighten this out a little
bit

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.300 

kind<00:01:32.800> of<00:01:32.860> wavy<00:01:33.100> now

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
kind of wavy now

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.630 
kind of wavy now
so<00:01:35.020> yeah<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.350> on<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:37.159> razor's<00:01:37.579> the<00:01:39.640> actual

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
so yeah the on the razor's the actual

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.359 
so yeah the on the razor's the actual
blade<00:01:40.909> itself<00:01:41.350> is<00:01:42.350> quite<00:01:42.560> thin<00:01:42.920> so<00:01:43.250> it's

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
blade itself is quite thin so it's

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.230 
blade itself is quite thin so it's
pliable<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:46.100> backing<00:01:46.579> this<00:01:46.909> Ridge

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
pliable and the the backing this Ridge

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.520 
pliable and the the backing this Ridge
here<00:01:47.720> is<00:01:47.869> thicker<00:01:49.509> but<00:01:50.509> it's<00:01:50.689> a<00:01:50.929> fairly<00:01:51.170> soft

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
here is thicker but it's a fairly soft

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.639 
here is thicker but it's a fairly soft
material<00:01:52.189> so<00:01:52.369> we'll<00:01:52.670> bend<00:01:52.939> under<00:01:53.649> major

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
material so we'll bend under major

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.550 
material so we'll bend under major
stress

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.399 

but<00:01:58.220> has<00:01:59.180> for<00:01:59.689> the<00:01:59.869> handle<00:02:00.170> itself<00:02:02.110> so<00:02:03.110> we<00:02:03.259> can

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
but has for the handle itself so we can

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:10.859 
but has for the handle itself so we can
do<00:02:03.530> with<00:02:03.649> this

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.740 

got<00:02:11.500> some<00:02:11.680> stress<00:02:12.090> fractures<00:02:13.090> showing<00:02:13.450> up<00:02:13.599> a

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
got some stress fractures showing up a

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.110 
got some stress fractures showing up a
lot<00:02:13.989> fractures<00:02:14.470> actually<00:02:14.950> it's<00:02:15.489> discoloring

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
lot fractures actually it's discoloring

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.010 
lot fractures actually it's discoloring
under<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.239> bending<00:02:19.569> force

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.520 

why<00:02:25.590> before<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:26.070> breaks

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
why before it breaks

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.380 
why before it breaks
can<00:02:28.040> actually<00:02:28.310> bend<00:02:28.520> this<00:02:28.640> handle<00:02:29.030> right<00:02:29.180> over

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
can actually bend this handle right over

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.470 
can actually bend this handle right over
double<00:02:33.490> well<00:02:34.490> you<00:02:34.610> can<00:02:34.730> go<00:02:34.850> back<00:02:35.000> into<00:02:35.240> shape

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
double well you can go back into shape

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:42.140 
double well you can go back into shape
more<00:02:36.110> or<00:02:36.200> less

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.410 

yeah<00:02:42.810> so<00:02:43.200> there<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:44.040> go<00:02:44.069> these<00:02:44.670> things

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.800 

I<00:02:49.630> basic<00:02:50.630> thesis<00:02:51.500> for<00:02:51.980> this<00:02:52.130> video<00:02:52.459> is<00:02:52.810> yeah

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
I basic thesis for this video is yeah

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.420 
I basic thesis for this video is yeah
these<00:02:54.020> things<00:02:54.080> are<00:02:54.470> pretty<00:02:54.620> durable<00:02:54.920> for<00:02:55.340> a

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
these things are pretty durable for a

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.040 
these things are pretty durable for a
very<00:02:55.610> small<00:02:55.849> lightly<00:02:56.239> built<00:02:56.450> to<00:02:56.660> all<00:02:56.840> they

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
very small lightly built to all they

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.320 
very small lightly built to all they
will<00:02:57.170> bend<00:02:57.440> but<00:02:58.430> they<00:02:58.550> probably<00:02:58.790> won't<00:02:59.030> break

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
will bend but they probably won't break

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.960 
will bend but they probably won't break
I<00:03:00.250> don't<00:03:01.250> know<00:03:01.370> for<00:03:01.550> sure<00:03:01.580> what<00:03:01.849> will<00:03:01.940> happen

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
I don't know for sure what will happen

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.699 
I don't know for sure what will happen
to<00:03:02.300> the<00:03:02.390> saw<00:03:02.569> blade<00:03:02.870> if<00:03:03.020> I<00:03:03.140> bent<00:03:03.319> one<00:03:03.470> of<00:03:03.590> those

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
to the saw blade if I bent one of those

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.890 
to the saw blade if I bent one of those
but<00:03:04.010> those<00:03:04.610> are<00:03:04.760> a<00:03:04.819> bit<00:03:04.910> more<00:03:05.030> expensive<00:03:05.330> and<00:03:05.720> I
