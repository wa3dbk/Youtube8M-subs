00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 A.M 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.460
 in today's video we decided to have 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.100
 some questions so that they know us more 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.440
 but not behind what you call yourself 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.180
 they extend the already not fashionable 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.119
 our questions that are now of 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.859
 fashion that you prefer so you're going to 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.900
 decide here in the comments who 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:25.659
 wins depends on your answers what is 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.499
 the best which ones pleases more because 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:28.499
 we have a news 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:36.800
 but well here we are going to be 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.510
 climbing things nonsense challenges all 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.760
 what you leave us also awaits 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.800
 They are not calling in the 100 to 3 Saturdays 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.020
 let's put a punishment on the loser 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.800
 then of his three Saturdays the one that 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.800
 have more votes 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.170
 the fourth Saturday is going to be a punishment of 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:01.000
 one to the other because he lost in those three 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.829
 Saturdays that passed and you will be able to 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:10.780
 get to help what will be the punishment 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:12.850
 that will help us choose the punishment 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.640
 that we are going to put one to the other but 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.640
 if we pass so it has produced 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.330
 drink water from a puddle or eat mud 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.000
 I think it 's lame water from a puddle 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.520
 but is that it leads as the left as 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.190
 worms little things that moved active in 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.190
 the water too but how black 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.960
 of eating raw chicken like this with all the 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.610
 blood if you're well rich or eat a day 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.610
 fish and seafood 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:02:05.340
 the chicken since it is a chocolate with 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.660
 popis flavor 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.500
 eat chocolate depends 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.470
 the chocolate 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.120
 and I say it's going to have a rich flavor and that 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.890
 is points in exchange if you eat a 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.960
 chocolate the chocolate in case the coffee and 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.550
 soon that is for little it is going to be worse 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.140
 then I prefer the little flavored 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.140
 chocolate always nothing will be of view 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.500
 A) Yes 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:58.840
 in underwear or clothes like that 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:58.840
 but they do not teach you 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:11.190
 is having those special laughs that 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.890
 sneeze so you're in ferments going 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:20.070
 to take a lot of diarrhea and sneeze 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:23.040
 because he is alive here or having a leg 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.140
 Broken on vacation all your vacations 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.940
 you can not move, I prefer that 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.440
 break the skin or I hope it does not happen 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.240
 but that because you imagine 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.920
 well you can perceive in my things 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.209
 or like having a slave so that I 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.970
 bring and I took the things and I 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:40.950
 order the uis 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:45.510
 many guys 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.580
 what happened to nihuil prefer not to have 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.890
 sense of smell or that you do not have 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.019
 sense of taste makes sense 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.930
 of humor you understood why or sense 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:58.140
 of humor and me without what has not 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.950
 and the smell or sense of taste or 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.950
 Sense of the vote 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.450
 I prefer not to read because he does very 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:18.560
 bad 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:21.560
 I prefer the handsome ones but I prefer 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.560
 pleasures 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:39.870
 I prefer to lose the sense of smell and 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:43.430
 not of taste is not to have hello very 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:48.260
 good the 22 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.260
 the racist child 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.880
 here 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.529
 but you prefer 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:12.629
 not having hair or vice versa having a lot 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:14.899
 hair but a lot of hair for nothing but not 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:14.899
 it's like that 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:27.629
 but I would prefer to have nothing nothing nothing 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:30.929
 more I do not have but will have depends on me 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:36.529
 already his wig a wig 

00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:36.529
 a hair 

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:45.929
 for properties mar and wish timerman and 

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:48.050
 wing have nothing money nothing of 

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:52.439
 money 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:54.829
 but to be very happy already throws a title 

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:57.629
 prefers to be a lot of money like that 

00:05:54.829 --> 00:05:59.729
 conventions the lingus elbows but not 

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:02.729
 have feelings or mess 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:05.680
 teeth you do not feel like but you have 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:08.480
 a lot of money I do not like 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:11.650
 in the money but nothing 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.650
 half because no no 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.529
 but the truth is I prefer to find a 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.379
 person that loves me 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:23.040
 with sincere words to those of mingo that 

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:25.940
 having no feelings 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.940
 that exists 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:34.910
 the poor but happy but good that was 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.910
 all for today's video 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:42.710
 to me there is no so he wants to say something 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:46.099
 down here 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:49.509
 portman and wish we are going to check and 

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:49.509
 in the next video we are going to say that 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.000
 this Saturday 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:03.770
 and put them as what challenges you 

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:03.770
 I would like to talk 

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:14.090
 I give them a kiss if they tell me that I 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:16.130
 I win, I give them where now nothing else 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:18.230
 what I do not understand is the people 

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:20.540
 because people care so much as 

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:23.449
 she gets so nervous on a first date 

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:25.340
 because now yes in the first appointment is 

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:26.810
 when everything is decided when you finish and 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.460
 you're going to really like you men 

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.840
 they are very very complicated 

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.610
 more than women then we're going to 

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.680
 do a little but nothing is a little 

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:35.300
 complicated in certain things nothing more 

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.470
 like for example when we like 

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.180
 someone when we have nothing that 

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:41.320
 put on when we are at school 

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.320
 when we are with friends
