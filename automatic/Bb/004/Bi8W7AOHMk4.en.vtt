00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
came up with the idea of this five

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.140 
came up with the idea of this five
minute<00:03:05.430> just<00:03:06.180> toss<00:03:06.860> toss<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:08.130> and<00:03:08.280> fry<00:03:08.640> Livia

minute just toss toss it and fry Livia
and<00:03:09.840> I<00:03:10.620> told<00:03:10.860> her<00:03:11.130> that<00:03:11.540> pocket<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:12.660> Cosmo

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
and I told her that pocket and Cosmo

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.010 
and I told her that pocket and Cosmo
back<00:03:14.100> in<00:03:14.370> a<00:03:14.460> kinda<00:03:14.820> Monroe<00:03:15.420> all<00:03:15.540> we<00:03:15.780> need<00:03:15.930> to

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
back in a kinda Monroe all we need to

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.860 
back in a kinda Monroe all we need to
put<00:03:16.200> is<00:03:16.320> just<00:03:16.530> vinegar<00:03:16.710> in<00:03:17.070> and<00:03:17.660> installed<00:03:18.660> and

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
put is just vinegar in and installed and

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.960 
put is just vinegar in and installed and
stuff<00:03:19.140> so<00:03:19.590> I<00:03:19.620> thought<00:03:20.010> that<00:03:20.310> maybe<00:03:20.340> when

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
stuff so I thought that maybe when

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.430 
stuff so I thought that maybe when
making<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.390> look<00:03:21.540> that<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:22.080> don't<00:03:22.260> necessarily

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
making a look that you don't necessarily

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.100 
making a look that you don't necessarily
have<00:03:22.950> to<00:03:23.130> subtract<00:03:23.670> it<00:03:23.820> so<00:03:24.000> this<00:03:24.750> is<00:03:24.870> how<00:03:25.050> the

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
have to subtract it so this is how the

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.800 
have to subtract it so this is how the
idea<00:03:25.320> came<00:03:25.680> about<00:03:25.890> let<00:03:26.550> me<00:03:26.670> make<00:03:26.850> this<00:03:27.060> we<00:03:27.630> had
