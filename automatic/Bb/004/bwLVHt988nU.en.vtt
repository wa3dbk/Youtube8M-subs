idea i I have the sand

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.150 
idea i I have the sand
I<00:00:20.810> already<00:00:21.810> spread<00:00:22.289> out<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.769> had<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.010> pool

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
I already spread out and I had the pool

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.070 
I already spread out and I had the pool
up<00:00:23.369> last<00:00:23.640> year<00:00:23.880> but<00:00:24.060> every<00:00:24.210> year<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.510> got<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.779> real

up last year but every year I got a real
level<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.949> surface<00:00:26.570> so<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:27.779> year<00:00:28.019> thought

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
level the surface so this year thought

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.290 
level the surface so this year thought
of<00:00:28.529> something<00:00:28.859> easy<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.529> kind<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.650> fun<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:32.040> use

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
center point which is 9 feet in my case

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.900 
center point which is 9 feet in my case
and<00:00:38.730> then<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.719> put<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.530> peg<00:00:40.829> down<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.730> put<00:00:41.879> a

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.569 
hand I have a board tied to a dolly so
and<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.750> got<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.930> rope<00:00:49.170> there<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:50.160> what<00:00:50.340> I'm<00:00:50.430> going

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
and I got a rope there so what I'm going

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.430 
and I got a rope there so what I'm going
to<00:00:50.610> do<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:51.120> I'm<00:00:51.719> going<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.930> start<00:00:52.079> pulling<00:00:52.350> my

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
to do is I'm going to start pulling my

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.010 
to do is I'm going to start pulling my
rope<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.980> go<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.190> circles<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:54.020> everything

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
rope and go in circles and everything

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.040 
rope and go in circles and everything
should<00:00:55.199> level<00:00:55.410> out<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.980> see<00:00:56.340> any<00:00:56.489> gaps<00:00:56.899> I'll<00:00:57.899> put

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
should level out I see any gaps I'll put

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.810 
should level out I see any gaps I'll put
some<00:00:58.260> sand<00:00:58.530> in<00:00:58.710> those<00:00:58.829> areas<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.399> then<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.520> spin

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
some sand in those areas and then I spin

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.720 
some sand in those areas and then I spin
around<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.210> couple<00:01:00.420> more<00:01:00.660> times<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.250> here<00:01:02.250> we<00:01:02.340> go

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
around a couple more times so here we go

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.450 
around a couple more times so here we go
we're<00:01:03.660> going<00:01:03.899> for<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.199> pool<00:01:04.439> leveling<00:01:04.890> ride

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.620 

OOP

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.070 

as<00:01:12.530> you<00:01:12.950> can<00:01:13.070> see<00:01:13.220> some<00:01:13.460> gaps<00:01:13.729> under<00:01:14.030> there<00:01:14.180> so

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
as you can see some gaps under there so

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.260 
as you can see some gaps under there so
when<00:01:15.350> we<00:01:15.439> go<00:01:15.560> around<00:01:15.890> I<00:01:16.189> spread<00:01:16.640> sand<00:01:16.939> around

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
when we go around I spread sand around

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.390 
when we go around I spread sand around
and<00:01:17.540> then<00:01:18.320> it<00:01:18.470> should<00:01:18.710> pick<00:01:18.890> it<00:01:18.950> up<00:01:19.130> and<00:01:19.280> bring

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
and then it should pick it up and bring

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:38.510 
and then it should pick it up and bring
it<00:01:19.549> across

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.920 

there<00:01:39.520> you<00:01:39.640> go<00:01:39.790> it's<00:01:40.000> pulling<00:01:40.330> the<00:01:40.420> sand<00:01:40.690> we

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
there you go it's pulling the sand we

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.620 
there you go it's pulling the sand we
spit<00:01:41.410> around<00:01:41.680> once<00:01:41.950> right<00:01:42.190> now<00:01:42.480> we're<00:01:43.480> going

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
spit around once right now we're going

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.230 
spit around once right now we're going
to<00:01:43.690> go<00:01:43.810> over<00:01:44.080> one<00:01:44.290> more<00:01:44.410> time<00:01:44.470> and<00:01:44.980> then<00:01:45.910> really

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
to go over one more time and then really

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.660 
to go over one more time and then really
pay<00:01:46.420> attention<00:01:46.870> to<00:01:46.960> any<00:01:47.110> gaps<00:01:47.440> that<00:01:48.340> you<00:01:48.460> see

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
pay attention to any gaps that you see

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:57.840 
pay attention to any gaps that you see
under<00:01:48.850> that<00:01:49.060> board<00:01:52.410> and<00:01:53.410> start<00:01:53.680> to<00:01:53.830> get<00:01:53.950> DZ<00:01:56.850> see

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
under that board and start to get DZ see

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.850 
under that board and start to get DZ see
how<00:01:58.060> it's<00:01:58.240> nice<00:01:58.480> leveling<00:01:59.020> flattening<00:01:59.560> it<00:01:59.710> out

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
how it's nice leveling flattening it out

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:09.359 
how it's nice leveling flattening it out
I<00:02:07.290> hope<00:02:08.290> you<00:02:08.470> learned<00:02:08.649> something<00:02:08.950> today

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
I hope you learned something today

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.270 
I hope you learned something today
