 on 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.320
 Ambassador Miguel Berger my little dark-skinned man 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.750
 originally from a small remote colony on the but 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.940
 Mercury came

 otherwise bald spots represent sprouts 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:35.900
 although the population of Mercury since colonization in 2000 169 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.950
 just tens of millions 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.340
 she insisted she stand independent from interstellar treaties 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.650
 To be action 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.940
 Mercury's resources and associated wealth were to this 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.050
 Time for human concepts inexhaustible 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.030
 and sufficient to form a central depot in the solar system 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.290
 nevertheless, best first residents built an impregnable with time 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.700
 Fortress from military headquarters as an appointment yards and yeasts around 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.260
 to give an indisputable advantage so a deep came into being 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.240
 Divide between in the planetary powers 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.160
 and it did not burst in 2198, 30 years after the settlement of Mercury 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.280
 the first world-wide war for supremacy in the solar system 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.950
 it was supposed to last about half a century for about half a billion 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:31.890
 Victim 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.530
 Primarily on the part of the old planets, the former Ali 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.970
 here OCZ wants to accept and after that 2257 finally pulled her claim that 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.150
 Despite their small number, Mercury Honor has a considerable and not 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.000
 underestimated force and the underground mines of the 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.910
 planet 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.690
 to promote valuable watches for the interplanetary industry necessary heart 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.990
 that proclaimed peace despite the fact that extremists were fighting each other 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.480
 Associations continue on both sides and should not face attacks 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.550
 on the civilian population 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.480
 in the Koran one wrapped over the decades of independence 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.320
 a peculiar mentality and especially amused by earthlings them 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.069
 were convinced of their physical strength and resilience and 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.099
 that it is due to the most inhospitable conditions of the planetary surface 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:30.439
 which up to 4000 degrees Celsius from where they look huge from where 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.599
 she was heated a quarter of the race covered 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.069
 however, it was contrary to that 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.869
 that they are hermetically sealed over a long period of time 

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:45.769
 Bioton with low gravity lived what even to a degeneration of the 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.749
 Body led 

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:51.699
 Most residents of this virus were unable to land today 

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:55.969
 to survive under terrestrial conditions too weak of the earthly 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:57.889
 To resist gravity 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:03.549
 more Werra even bugs on the Merkur lived on but since 20 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.919
 Years as a mediator between nations on earth 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.799
 the conflict between the inhabitants of Mercury and ravings had turned into 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.120
 The past few years has again been aggravated as a myth in which all people 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.419
 Life was destroyed until ten years ago was the population of the 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:24.839
 Solar System has been unequivocally convinced that the on the 

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:29.559
 Planets and asteroids would last forever 

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:31.009
 one percent too 

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:35.359
 as early as 20 years, scientists had predicted 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.790
 One would consider the exorbitantly high demands of the interplanetary 

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:42.049
 Industry can no longer cover resources 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:46.409
 the increasing tension across all strata of the population "was that 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:51.870
 Strohfeuer under which the SFK a militant rebel association the 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.130
 Schonzeit prewar times existed 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.180
 to a serious threat to county house and peace in the country 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.619
 Solar system had developed 

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:04.929
 this eventually led to the high pressure research and development 

00:04:04.929 --> 00:04:06.969
 Boyzone World Generator 

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:09.269
 the superluminal drive 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.670
 he was the new hope and way out of his misery 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.870
 leading to the next and probably last war between 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.109
 could develop the worlds 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.569
 were clear 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:25.110
 If it were to prove itself, it would be possible for people to cover large areas of the world 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.330
 Milky Way and its resources to harness for themselves 

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:33.680
 although Mercury had made its share in the construction of the Pegasus 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.290
 when the Werra is the only representative there after all 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.520
 but Mercury was not a driver 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.500
 but usually lived all their lives in the sheltered underground 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.330
 Stations of your planet 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.480
 the Pegasus would return home successfully 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.920
 This would not only give rise to hope for the continued existence of 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.309
 Give humanity 

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:57.330
 but also to stabilize the peace 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.669
 the Werra organized a small one in the largest hold of the ship 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:06.430
 Address to which all resigned 9 crew members were invited 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.710
 before the Pegasus stops its first scheduled 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.560
 on the edge of the Milky Way would be a symposium to the peaceful 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.309
 Cohabitation of the people 

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:19.309
 independent of Planeta pure origin 

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:24.069
 this thought won the Werra an amused smile that would be a 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:25.259
 recognized no 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:29.439
 There was still room for about 20 crew members, Friedrich said 

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:31.589
 Brian Croll breather 

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:33.389
 well done little 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:36.719
 To achieve this, they only have to give their speech twice 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:39.069
 Coulter joked 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:41.020
 that will not be necessary 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.060
 The Werra grabbed for a protective vest and pulled it under the standard 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.569
 Crew Sunny forms 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:52.699
 beside the erect naked cross symbol of unity through religion he 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:55.270
 he looked at a surprised ensign 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.490
 they do not really think they're going to intervene at the rally 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.129
 becomes 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:03.509
 the security staff will also be present you can never be sure enough 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:04.569
 his 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:06.279
 said Werner 

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:07.639
 knowing 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:11.610
 that this protective vest Hitman save a few hours the life
