00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.890
 the box the box is pretty kion and in general 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:27.039

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.570
 consider here we have brief 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.689
 specifications 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.730
 16 gigabyte version is my version 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.960

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.879

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.339
 open the box and see what 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:45.339
 Well, of course, the samsung smartphone itself 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:47.940
 galaxy s4 so far we set it aside 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:53.530
 next we have documentation too 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:55.449
 texture tree everything is exactly the same 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.780
 paper here, though such a film 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:02.170
 pasted unusually was black farther off 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:05.939
 we are cable microusb and little white 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:09.340
 cable is such a white cable 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.240
 charging where without it all all 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.660

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:21.310
 white and headphones are such headphones 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:24.100
 gag such here and let's move on 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.620
 to the appearance of the device the appearance of 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.230
 it is the same as samsung galaxy s3 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.970
 that is, it is all the same plastic 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.520
 water yes you might even think what 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.240
 This is a metal rim but 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.060
 nifiga 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.850
 After all, a smartphone made of plastic, like all 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.700
 samsung galaxy galaxy models ie 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.220
 here we have the menu button the home button and 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.050
 back button like all samsung design 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.060
 not at all surprising and let's 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.320
 look at the connector buttons which 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.950
 here we have here the power button 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.690

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.680
 headphone volume control 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.620
 13 megapixel camera which made 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.680
 makes just great shots even 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.630
 better than iphone 5 i think so here 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.780
 us front camera and let's 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.970
 let's go to the smartphone with all my heart 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.269
 smartphone is an eight core 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.920
 samsung exynos clock processor 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.950
 frequency of 1 and 6 megahertz 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.250
 but you can have 44 quad 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.250
 then what is your model 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:30.070
 with my 9500 on an 8-core processor 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:33.110
 the screen here is super amoled with resolution 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.730
 1920 to 1080 display just 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.320
 I like wonderful even more 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.120
 what to do with Ivan here 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.250
 vigorous here 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.459
 viewing angles are also just awesome 2 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:50.840
 gigabytes of ram batteries on 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:52.880
 2600 billionaire she gives power 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.250
 your smartphone for the day 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.530
 you have enough for a day and let's 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.950
 look at what is capable of this 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:04.580
 smartphone go to the tests and look under 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.580
 axis shoe gives 29,000 97 points or 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.610
 parrots outlines the standard he gives 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.880
 13000 222 points 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.160
 Tanki cool results simply 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.790
 stunning results 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.709
 the smartphone itself also makes me very happy 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.520
 I think this can be finished, but no, I 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:27.680
 forgot something who watched the presentation 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.720
 samsung galaxy s4 these will understand me then 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.150
 have all been presented and these new 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.580
 chips but I'm half chips on included 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.890
 because well because they are first 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.010
 batteries and I don't need them even 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.500
 half did not understand them in these chips 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.140
 but one thing and still I turned on 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.880
 I'll show you what she is 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.100
 we wave our hand like this before 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.709
 a smartphone and it should show if u 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.579
 us missed calls or not should 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:57.560
 light up blue garbage come on 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:04:01.670
 Come on Masha is doing something wrong 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.799
 it turned out well come on dude I'm upset 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.230
 I'm all blue This is garbage 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.030
 caught fire and we see here but 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.930
 missed calls 0 text messages 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.700
 and 90 percent of the charge, I think everything is possible 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.230
 everything about this smartphone tell more 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.950
 can you tell what the case is not 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.959
 demountable 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.329
 that is, there we have one SIM card slot 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:24.350
 and cards krusty that is, buy 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:27.490
 because at 16 gigabytes and + card at 64 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.669
 gigov you get dofigischa just 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.220
 of memory 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.729
 and in 6 van so you will not work there 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.580
 I think the minimum size 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:38.249
 it is 32 gigabytes and there is no micro sd slot 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.379
 like as i read out power left no place 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:42.930
 as some wrote I do not know believe 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:45.509
 this or not so thank you all 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.279
