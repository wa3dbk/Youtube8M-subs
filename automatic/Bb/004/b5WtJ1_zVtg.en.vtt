00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.830 

we<00:03:54.110> almost<00:03:54.290> get<00:03:54.530> a<00:03:54.560> little<00:03:54.770> bit<00:03:54.860> of<00:03:54.980> that<00:03:57.700> damn

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
we almost get a little bit of that damn

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.730 
we almost get a little bit of that damn
nailed<00:03:59.840> it<00:04:00.020> a<00:04:00.820> little<00:04:01.820> bit<00:04:01.970> of<00:04:02.090> that<00:04:02.240> carbon

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
nailed it a little bit of that carbon

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.380 
nailed it a little bit of that carbon
but<00:04:03.740> it's<00:04:03.890> not<00:04:04.070> with<00:04:04.670> the<00:04:04.790> meat<00:04:04.970> it's<00:04:05.150> good

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
but it's not with the meat it's good

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.150 
but it's not with the meat it's good
because<00:04:05.510> you<00:04:05.660> think<00:04:05.810> you're<00:04:05.990> eating<00:04:06.140> it<00:04:06.440> from

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
because you think you're eating it from

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.680 
because you think you're eating it from
the<00:04:07.280> grill<00:04:08.710> it's<00:04:09.710> it's<00:04:09.830> not<00:04:09.980> gritty<00:04:10.570> it's<00:04:11.570> a

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
the grill it's it's not gritty it's a

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.690 
the grill it's it's not gritty it's a
little<00:04:12.050> bit<00:04:12.230> gritty<00:04:12.410> but<00:04:12.650> it's<00:04:12.770> okay<00:04:13.070> because

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
little bit gritty but it's okay because

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.380 
little bit gritty but it's okay because
it<00:04:13.910> plays<00:04:14.090> well<00:04:15.220> in<00:04:16.220> the<00:04:16.459> meat<00:04:16.670> because<00:04:17.269> you

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
it plays well in the meat because you

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.090 
it plays well in the meat because you
would<00:04:17.510> expect<00:04:17.840> that<00:04:17.870> from<00:04:18.019> a<00:04:18.500> grilled<00:04:18.890> piece

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
would expect that from a grilled piece

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.370 
would expect that from a grilled piece
of<00:04:19.280> meat<00:04:19.400> anyway<00:04:19.730> but<00:04:20.570> it's<00:04:20.720> not<00:04:20.900> from<00:04:21.200> the

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
of meat anyway but it's not from the

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.780 
of meat anyway but it's not from the
grill<00:04:21.560> it's<00:04:21.739> from<00:04:21.950> this<00:04:22.310> vessel

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.300
