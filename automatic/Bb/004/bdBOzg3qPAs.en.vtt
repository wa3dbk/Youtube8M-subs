00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
way you can test out the temperature of

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.260 
way you can test out the temperature of
the<00:00:43.440> syrup<00:00:43.739> when<00:00:43.920> we<00:00:44.010> get<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.430> point<00:00:44.730> so

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
the syrup when we get to that point so

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.410 
the syrup when we get to that point so
you<00:00:45.360> also<00:00:45.629> need<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.230> nice<00:00:46.680> heavy<00:00:47.100> pot<00:00:47.460> here<00:00:47.940> so

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
you also need a nice heavy pot here so

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.389 
you also need a nice heavy pot here so
this<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:49.020> what<00:00:49.170> you're<00:00:49.320> going<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.590> use<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.860> put

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
this is what you're going to use to put

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.500 
this is what you're going to use to put
everything<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.090> we're<00:00:51.210> going<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.390> cook

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
this on the stove and then I have a

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.650 
this on the stove and then I have a
baking<00:00:53.640> sheet<00:00:53.910> with<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.180> little<00:00:54.480> bit<00:00:54.570> of

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
baking sheet with a little bit of

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.540 
baking sheet with a little bit of
parchment<00:00:55.140> paper<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.949> sprayed<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.399> with

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
parchment paper and I sprayed it with

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.340 
parchment paper and I sprayed it with
some<00:00:56.910> nonstick<00:00:57.059> spray<00:00:57.449> just<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.020> make<00:00:58.199> it

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
some nonstick spray just to make it

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.410 
some nonstick spray just to make it
slick<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.430> Apple<00:00:59.850> when<00:01:00.090> we're<00:01:00.239> done

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
slick so that the Apple when we're done

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.110 
slick so that the Apple when we're done
with<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.750> does<00:01:01.109> not<00:01:01.260> stick<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.489> what<00:01:03.000> we're

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
with it does not stick so what we're

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.939 
with it does not stick so what we're
going<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.270> do<00:01:03.420> first<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.989> take<00:01:04.350> these<00:01:04.619> little

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
going to do first is take these little

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.370 
going to do first is take these little
sticks<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.580> poke<00:01:05.909> them<00:01:06.150> into<00:01:06.689> our<00:01:06.869> apples

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
sticks and poke them into our apples

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.100 
sticks and poke them into our apples
shove<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.189> right<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.729> there<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.510> important

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
shove that right in there it's important

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.440 
shove that right in there it's important
to<00:01:10.229> wash<00:01:10.470> them<00:01:10.860> because<00:01:11.490> sometimes<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.299> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
to wash them because sometimes in the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.719 
to wash them because sometimes in the
grocery<00:01:12.869> stores<00:01:13.200> they<00:01:13.710> have<00:01:13.740> wax<00:01:14.220> on<00:01:14.580> the

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
grocery stores they have wax on the

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.749 
grocery stores they have wax on the
apples<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.659> could<00:01:16.020> interfere<00:01:16.770> with<00:01:17.460> the

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
apples and that could interfere with the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.390 
apples and that could interfere with the
way<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.180> candy<00:01:18.689> sticks<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.560> Apple<00:01:19.979> so

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
way the candy sticks to the Apple so

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.830 
way the candy sticks to the Apple so
make<00:01:20.670> sure<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.939> get<00:01:21.090> them<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.479> know<00:01:21.600> washed

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
make sure you get them you know washed

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.200 
make sure you get them you know washed
off<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.229> then<00:01:22.680> also<00:01:22.950> just<00:01:23.610> Pat<00:01:23.820> them<00:01:24.000> dry

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
off and then also just Pat them dry

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.390 
off and then also just Pat them dry
nicely<00:01:26.119> now<00:01:27.119> into<00:01:28.020> our<00:01:28.140> pot<00:01:28.439> what<00:01:29.100> we're<00:01:29.250> going

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
nicely now into our pot what we're going

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.149 
nicely now into our pot what we're going
to<00:01:29.430> do<00:01:29.579> first<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.150> take<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:31.229> white<00:01:31.770> granulated

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
to do first is take the white granulated

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.410 
to do first is take the white granulated
sugar<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:33.030> just<00:01:33.270> dump<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.810> in<00:01:35.090> along<00:01:36.090> with

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
sugar and just dump that in along with

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.550 
sugar and just dump that in along with
the<00:01:36.570> water<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:39.020> our<00:01:40.020> corn<00:01:40.619> syrup<00:01:42.320> then<00:01:43.320> you

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
the water and our corn syrup then you

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.260 
the water and our corn syrup then you
have<00:01:43.740> your<00:01:43.920> red<00:01:44.130> food<00:01:44.399> coloring<00:01:44.850> now<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.119> is

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
have your red food coloring now this is

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.149 
have your red food coloring now this is
optional<00:01:45.750> but<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.380> what<00:01:46.530> makes<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.890> red

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
optional but this is what makes it red

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.980 
optional but this is what makes it red
so<00:01:47.490> otherwise<00:01:47.970> it's<00:01:48.570> just<00:01:48.630> going<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.899> be<00:01:48.960> a

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
so otherwise it's just going to be a

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.260 
so otherwise it's just going to be a
clear<00:01:49.290> glaze<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.040> you'll<00:01:50.430> see<00:01:50.640> your<00:01:50.880> Apple

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
clear glaze and you'll see your Apple

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.429 
clear glaze and you'll see your Apple
through<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.810> could<00:01:51.930> do<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.229> if<00:01:52.350> you

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
through it so you could do that if you

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.499 
through it so you could do that if you
want<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.710> but<00:01:52.979> really<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:53.970> all<00:01:54.119> about<00:01:54.149> the

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
want to but really it's all about the
