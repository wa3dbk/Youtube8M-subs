I'm learning very slowly but surely to

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.340 
I'm learning very slowly but surely to
loosen<00:01:20.670> my<00:01:20.790> grasp<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.299> my<00:01:21.479> agenda<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.080> just

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
loosen my grasp on my agenda and to just

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.320 
loosen my grasp on my agenda and to just
kind<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.890> course<00:01:23.070> have<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> plan<00:01:23.580> but<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.090> go

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
kind of of course have a plan but to go

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.999 
kind of of course have a plan but to go
with<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.600> flow<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.930> day<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.200> be<00:01:25.470> flexible

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.530 
with the flow of the day to be flexible
I<00:01:26.220> think<00:01:26.610> that's<00:01:26.759> one<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.060> main<00:01:27.270> things

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
I think that's one of the main things

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.880 
I think that's one of the main things
that<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:27.720> as<00:01:27.900> women<00:01:28.080> have<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.500> have<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.860> that

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
that we as women have to have and that

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.270 
that we as women have to have and that
is<00:01:29.100> an<00:01:29.570> okayness<00:01:30.570> if<00:01:31.049> that's<00:01:31.259> word<00:01:31.470> with<00:01:32.009> being

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
is an okayness if that's word with being

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.160 
is an okayness if that's word with being
flexible<00:01:33.119> with<00:01:33.299> what<00:01:33.630> may<00:01:33.810> happen<00:01:34.020> so

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
flexible with what may happen so

the little interruptions you know which
really<00:01:44.250> aren't<00:01:44.549> interruptions<00:01:45.119> because

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
really aren't interruptions because

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.410 
really aren't interruptions because
whatever<00:01:46.020> your<00:01:46.320> primary<00:01:46.770> focus<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:48.119> is

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
right and if they're not then we've got

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.469 
right and if they're not then we've got

half foot right I'm supposed to be
spending<00:03:19.989> time<00:03:20.140> with<00:03:20.320> him<00:03:20.530> so<00:03:20.890> I<00:03:20.920> have<00:03:21.100> to<00:03:21.220> kind

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
spending time with him so I have to kind

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.880

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
of revert my attention back on to what

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.560 
of revert my attention back on to what
the<00:03:24.010> goal<00:03:24.190> was<00:03:24.220> you<00:03:24.549> know<00:03:24.670> right<00:03:24.850> and<00:03:25.180> I<00:03:25.329> think

the goal was you know right and I think

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.360 
the goal was you know right and I think
isn't<00:03:26.079> this<00:03:26.320> like<00:03:26.530> our<00:03:26.709> relationship<00:03:27.250> with
