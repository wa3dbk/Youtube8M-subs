 To ride the Splash Mountain at Disneyland 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:29.150
 It was in line with all the fans of the will 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:32.300
 There was a bright woman friend who talks well next to the seat but she suddenly becomes faint 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.550

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:39.220
 Everyone wants great pains not do Dan So ride but 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:44.350
 Eventually she will follow her opinion 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:47.640
 Even after riding on Splash Mountain, she has always been to the most powerful places 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.640

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:24.760
 I was a bit scary all the time, I was thinking only 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:26.370
 It's a bit scary that it's a bit of a tall elevator in the air, not a height fear. 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.880
 It's a trauma 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:35.350
