00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:09.200
 I am I am workers to continue with the 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.350
 mini guide macros goest to do 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.350
 your own macros and what I'm going to 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.210
 do today is to explain the soul tip that the 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.520
 last week he taught us but not what 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:23.039
 explain what it is worth and make macros 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.169
 to do things about 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.730
 players or npc is that we do not have 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:33.790
 selected or about the pet this 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:37.000
 late first thing the show all kinds 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.550
 it's not just for appearance to do 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.200
 pretty the macro is not at all in 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.190
 special does not do not have any 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.800
 activity at the time of 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.110
 nothing is neither the macro start nor anything to 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.890
 what 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.750
 to space and the name of the skill 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.640
 that we put him for what he is going to do 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.960
 is when we put the mouse of a 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.000
 skill down to the right if you 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.810
 you fix a small box with the name 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.780
 of the skill of the approach that costs 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:08.010
 whatever the scope that is that and that 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.590
 show us the kind of skill 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.480
 like when we created a macro without a name 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.380
 as taught by putting a space and without 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:21.220
 icon for what catches us is the icon and 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.810
 all the properties of the icon of the 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.060
 first life that we put in the macro 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.390
 there is like the first one that we put is the one of 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.000
 the 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.040
 first we put that its author type and 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.860
 will take us the icon of that skill and 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.280
 the tulip tilde that life also for that 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.890
 it is an aspect 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.670
 once done that I will teach how to do 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.310
 macros 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.229
 to throw a skill on something 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.340
 that we do not have selected although 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.909
 let's have selected 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.460
 for that I'm going to make a new macro 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:55.829
 although before good first book of 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.060
 spells to do it as I teach it a 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:02.340
 new name space and without icon with the 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.319
 question not the first thing that's going to 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.319
 put that show pad 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.520
 last space then he heard a lot the 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.170
 keyboard and you hear lie of the 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:20.270
 will try not to listen too 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:22.520
 and I'll look left left click 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.280
 for she puts it here for the canoe 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.720
 of the solo 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.720
 I'm going to put it is a skill 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.260
 to the address and again 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.970
 and for the canon I told you that it is going to 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.060
 teach to throw more than one skill to 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.459
 the time today but 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.489
 with a global cool down I will not make 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:46.190
 this the most important thing because if I go 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.780
 to explain is that if you put in a macro 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.280
 a lot of skills that do not have 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.500
 the al kurd although they are those that 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.569
 when you use them they do not put in time 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.390
 of reuse the rest of skills 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.980
 for a second 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.990
 you can put all those that do not have 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.510
 global cool down all you want and 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:05.209
 at the end at the end always at the end a 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.860
 with global ass something but the macro is 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.810
 short where it is is the one that has what 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.000
 calculate why I put the arcane shot 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.160
 after redirection and also like this 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.050
 the redirection is going to throw it before so 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.330
 so much what I put there will catch me 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.720
 the agro of the first shoots to the channel 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.600
 for nothing now I'm going to go to 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.010
 to the redirection line to this is 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.569
 can use with anything not 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.730
 just for the hunter here 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:35.749
 to put a space I'm going to open 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:38.719
 I'll put an arroba and for 

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:41.209
 this macro I'm going to put p 3 I'm going to close 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:43.849
 the bracket and web good the other space 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:47.060
 been placed therefore I am left 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:51.379
 the line is going to throw space brackets 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.079
 p closed bracket space redirection of 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:56.719
 save beige has already caught the icon 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:59.419
 all the tour tip for a perfect macro 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:01.969
 a normal skill appears and makes a 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:03.430
 couple of things therefore now what 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:06.390
 I'm going to do 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.760
 is to throw the stick 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.130
 and the macro what it does is it is 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:15.470
 pulling the direction of the pet without 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.470
 12 select pets with nothing 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.829
 instead of 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.170
 and I will leave for the two 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.200
 here after the place of pep is 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.210
 you can put a target that does it on the 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.160
 target that we have at that moment that 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.370
 that suits us well for skills 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.370
 pets both of the guard those of 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:40.360
 magician hunter of all who have 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.729
 mascot suits us well 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.889
 because we make the pet take 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.659
 our our tablet what we have 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.550
 selected us how can you 

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:50.830
 put pet to throw it on the pet 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.990
 then you can put player to 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:57.310
 throw it on us you can not 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:05:00.180
 put focus focus for 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.470
 throw on what we have 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.090
 framed of focus at this time I by 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.710
 example now I have a stick I do not know which 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.860
 it's the left 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.790
 that this if you have done ride or sands 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.730
 surely you have used some 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:16.400
 time on some special occasion 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:21.420
 If I'm giles I'll use it a lot 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:22.830
 and you can also put it after 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.710
 I'm going to leave everything written to the 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:29.300
 description because I know that my English is 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:32.479
 almost perfect but it is not to you 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.789
 and sand one for the player once in 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:36.440
 sands we have a list on the right the 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:39.319
 first player of the sand list 2 for 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.900
 the second arena 3 to 4 in the 5 in the 

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:45.289
 list in order from the right and also 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:47.990
 you can put names of players in 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:52.610
 specific I can put there after 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:54.710
 for example 0 live turn off I threw to me the 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:58.270
 skill that you put there there is indeed 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:01.450
 here in this I have it made 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:05.470
 I give him here he throws it to me I do not have to 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:06.070
 cheated player but he did have 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.950
 selected 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:11.380
 over cheated but without having it 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:14.860
 selected now you will see me going to 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:17.050
 throw me soothes the spirit of 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:20.110
 pet without having months in fact I'm going to 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:23.700
 take the stick and everything to see if it returns there 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:26.290
 an excess to agree or can join 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.760
 a kong skill they hide it or at the end 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.969
 of the macro with all those that do not have 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.510
 a club to the thumb that you want 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:34.340
 Y 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.870
 after throwing and before the 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.910
 skill with a space always for 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:42.740
 medium 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:45.170
 and between brackets pe player target focus 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:48.200
 sand 1 sand 2 or the name of a 

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:49.790
 character is worth now without cheating 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.140
 and immaculate min 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.070
 if we do not have that selected to me 

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.080
 same 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.100
 because I have since I throw it over 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.750
 my 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:02.910
 I hope the video serves or searches and 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.910
 tomorrow more until tomorrow
