00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.920 
beta's basically it's a long story short
you'll<00:02:52.459> want<00:02:52.640> to<00:02:52.730> do<00:02:52.940> it<00:02:53.090> as<00:02:53.269> I<00:02:53.480> say<00:02:53.720> when

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
you'll want to do it as I say when

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.910 
you'll want to do it as I say when
starting<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.260> engine<00:02:54.680> and<00:02:55.420> basically<00:02:56.420> you'll

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
starting the engine and basically you'll

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.350 
starting the engine and basically you'll
want<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:58.010> bring<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.459> thralls<00:02:58.760> into<00:02:59.060> reverse

feather switch click it to the left we

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.280 
feather switch click it to the left we
come<00:03:04.760> outside<00:03:04.940> there's<00:03:05.480> a<00:03:05.540> small<00:03:05.870> hydraulic

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
come outside there's a small hydraulic

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.270 
come outside there's a small hydraulic

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
pump moving the left engine blades so

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.949 
pump moving the left engine blades so
they<00:03:10.370> deflect<00:03:10.730> into<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.150> windy<00:03:11.420> easier<00:03:11.810> to

they deflect into the windy easier to

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.890 
they deflect into the windy easier to
start<00:03:13.000> then<00:03:14.000> you<00:03:14.090> want<00:03:14.239> to<00:03:14.329> read<00:03:14.480> vance<00:03:14.720> the

airplane engine startup we'll look at

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.020 
airplane engine startup we'll look at
the<00:03:31.459> gauges<00:03:31.880> or<00:03:32.120> we'll<00:03:32.329> look<00:03:32.450> outside<00:03:34.030> uh-oh

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.950 

here's<00:03:47.510> our<00:03:47.600> RPM<00:03:48.110> it's<00:03:49.420> our<00:03:50.420> form<00:03:50.780> of<00:03:50.870> the

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:50.960 
here's our RPM it's our form of the

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.300 
here's our RPM it's our form of the
intense<00:03:51.230> coming<00:03:51.560> up<00:03:53.770> basically<00:03:54.770> the<00:03:54.890> RPM<00:03:55.220> will

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
intense coming up basically the RPM will

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.790 
intense coming up basically the RPM will
come<00:03:55.460> up<00:03:55.580> and<00:03:55.850> once<00:03:56.000> it<00:03:56.180> reaches<00:03:56.630> around

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
come up and once it reaches around

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.380 
come up and once it reaches around
seventy<00:03:57.800> percent<00:03:57.950> the<00:03:58.400> egt<00:03:58.700> will<00:03:58.970> fall<00:03:59.180> back

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
seventy percent the egt will fall back

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.870 
seventy percent the egt will fall back
down<00:03:59.420> which<00:03:59.960> is<00:04:00.140> good<00:04:00.380> and<00:04:00.910> it<00:04:01.910> does<00:04:02.230> excellent

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
down which is good and it does excellent

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.390 
down which is good and it does excellent
next<00:04:04.880> you'll<00:04:05.090> want<00:04:05.150> to<00:04:05.530> start<00:04:06.530> the<00:04:07.010> number<00:04:07.250> to

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
next you'll want to start the number to

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.760 
next you'll want to start the number to
the<00:04:07.580> right<00:04:07.610> engine<00:04:07.910> to<00:04:08.510> do<00:04:08.660> that<00:04:08.900> wait<00:04:09.470> they

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
the right engine to do that wait they

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.610 
the right engine to do that wait they
get<00:04:10.160> the<00:04:11.020> generator<00:04:12.020> around<00:04:12.290> it<00:04:12.380> out<00:04:12.470> of<00:04:12.560> the

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
get the generator around it out of the

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.720 
get the generator around it out of the
way<00:04:12.740> so<00:04:12.800> you<00:04:13.010> want<00:04:13.160> to<00:04:13.220> turn<00:04:13.370> to<00:04:13.400> your<00:04:13.670> left

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
way so you want to turn to your left

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:21.949 
way so you want to turn to your left
generator<00:04:14.570> on<00:04:15.670> external<00:04:16.670> generator<00:04:17.180> off

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.240 

good<00:04:22.590> we<00:04:22.889> still<00:04:23.130> have<00:04:23.250> enough<00:04:23.400> volts<00:04:23.729> I<00:04:25.250> don't

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
good we still have enough volts I don't

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.460 
good we still have enough volts I don't
forget<00:04:26.520> to<00:04:26.910> unfit<00:04:27.419> of<00:04:27.569> the<00:04:27.690> engine<00:04:28.020> so<00:04:28.289> let's

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
forget to unfit of the engine so let's

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.260 
forget to unfit of the engine so let's
bring<00:04:28.710> the<00:04:28.830> throttles<00:04:29.190> back<00:04:29.400> unlock<00:04:32.270> you'll

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
bring the throttles back unlock you'll

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.890 
bring the throttles back unlock you'll
see<00:04:33.479> our<00:04:33.630> the<00:04:34.050> pumps<00:04:34.410> deflecting<00:04:35.160> the<00:04:35.280> blades

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
see our the pumps deflecting the blades

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.650 
see our the pumps deflecting the blades
this<00:04:36.900> takes<00:04:37.259> about<00:04:37.680> 10<00:04:38.069> seconds<00:04:38.580> to<00:04:38.849> do<00:04:39.030> so<00:04:39.419> you

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
this takes about 10 seconds to do so you

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.330 
this takes about 10 seconds to do so you
just<00:04:39.810> look<00:04:40.050> out<00:04:40.229> and<00:04:40.440> watch<00:04:40.590> it<00:04:40.830> or<00:04:40.949> just<00:04:41.099> count

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
just look out and watch it or just count
