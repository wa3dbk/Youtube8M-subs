concealer around my eyes especially the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.610 
concealer around my eyes especially the
corners<00:00:35.480> where<00:00:35.660> I<00:00:35.720> tend<00:00:35.960> to<00:00:36.050> get<00:00:36.140> quite<00:00:36.320> a<00:00:36.440> lot

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620

corners where I tend to get quite a lot
of<00:00:36.650> redness<00:00:37.040> there<00:00:37.280> and<00:00:37.489> I<00:00:38.270> used<00:00:38.420> a<00:00:38.510> concealer

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
of redness there and I used a concealer

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.209 
of redness there and I used a concealer
brush<00:00:38.930> for<00:00:39.290> that<00:00:39.320> and<00:00:39.530> prefer<00:00:39.770> fluffier

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
brush for that and prefer fluffier

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:41.860 
brush for that and prefer fluffier
brushes<00:00:40.670> but<00:00:40.940> I<00:00:41.149> think<00:00:41.329> I've<00:00:41.449> mentioned<00:00:41.629> that

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870
