00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.700
 the vehicle the twizy that we just 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.170
 lend to ecuador couriers so that 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.750
 make the delivery tests of 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.670
 correspondence is a vehicle in the first 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.860
 place is a hundred percent vehicle 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.410
 electric second to that 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.770
 resembles resembles a vehicle in 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:40.400
 first of four wheels but that 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:43.309
 it does the services of similar to a 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.309
 technologically speaking motorcycle is 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:51.370
 a really important vehicle in 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.370
 terms of technology and security 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.340
 always leads the entrance to a new 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.400
 technology takes time before 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:04.390
 can democratize in a market and 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:07.990
 our role is to explain it and also 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.270
 of making people can try it so 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.180
 mails as Ecuador today because 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.810
 really try it is to adopt them here in 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.960
 Ecuador we have a lot of expectation because 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.820
 the government has begun to develop a 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.290
 plan electric vehicle 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.720
 links to your matrix change 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.260
 energetic and we have seen in others 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:32.260
 japan europe countries of the usa 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.200
 than the support or accompaniment of 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:39.119
 public authorities is essential for 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.119
 launch those new technologies 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.330
 and we have at this moment 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.310
 trucks and we have bikes that can 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.290
 be replaced successfully with these 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.750
 electric vehicles 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.690
 and with this we killed several birds of a 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.730
 shot 'on the one hand we support the change of 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.220
 the energy matrix of the country the country already 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.380
 is about to be able to generate a 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.660
 great surplus of electrical energy that 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.850
 should be and that we can take advantage of and 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.460
 we must take advantage of the change with the 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.100
 I change the induction cookers with and 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.360
 now with the new vehicles this is 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.920
 the second type of vehicle that 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.950
 we are going to have two weeks 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.990
 in working in real work with our 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.330
 postmen going up to all the hills of 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.220
 I take away the same thing that we did with the 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.630
 previous vehicles after that 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.820
 we will begin to analyze the subject 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.890
 financial will give us a quote 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.480
 formally of these vehicles we have to 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.709
 look at the legal issue with the agency 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.330
 national transit so that these 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.040
 vehicles can circulate and in that 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.590
 moment we will make a decision about the 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.080
 size of the fleet and even on the 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.630
 brand of vehicles that we are going to acquire 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.240
 but but if the ecuador's mail is 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.610
 firmly committed 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.720
 have to do the pioneers in the use of 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.720
 electric vehicles in the country
