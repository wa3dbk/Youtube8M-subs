for you to build some some good
creations<00:03:19.160> like<00:03:20.060> huge<00:03:20.480> huge<00:03:21.410> art<00:03:21.709> texture<00:03:22.669> art

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
creations like huge huge art texture art

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.229 
creations like huge huge art texture art
basically<00:03:23.599> and<00:03:24.069> yeah<00:03:25.069> it<00:03:25.130> goes<00:03:25.760> pretty<00:03:25.940> far

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
basically and yeah it goes pretty far

it's it's just cool finding seats like
this<00:03:30.680> that<00:03:31.099> are<00:03:31.130> flat<00:03:31.609> I<00:03:31.910> think<00:03:32.780> these<00:03:32.870> are

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
this that are flat I think these are
