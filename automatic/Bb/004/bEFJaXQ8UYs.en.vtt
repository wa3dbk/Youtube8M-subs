really<00:01:51.450> fun<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.170> was<00:01:52.399> 1284<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.490> bottom

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
instead of doing like a mix and match

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.169 
instead of doing like a mix and match
thing<00:02:07.799> especially<00:02:08.039> because<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.849> my<00:02:08.940> red<00:02:09.149> hair
