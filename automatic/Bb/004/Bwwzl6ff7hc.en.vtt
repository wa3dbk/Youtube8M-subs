00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
want to work fairly quickly the optic

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.580 
want to work fairly quickly the optic
0.0<00:01:51.270> actually<00:01:51.630> has<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.810> slower<00:01:52.140> curing<00:01:52.440> time

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
0.0 actually has a slower curing time

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.010 
0.0 actually has a slower curing time
than<00:01:52.830> the<00:01:52.890> optic<00:01:53.190> guard<00:01:53.400> so<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:54.659> usually<00:01:54.960> got

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
than the optic guard so it usually got

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.480 
than the optic guard so it usually got
about<00:01:55.260> a<00:01:55.320> minute<00:01:55.620> two<00:01:55.740> minutes<00:01:56.070> before<00:01:56.430> it

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490
