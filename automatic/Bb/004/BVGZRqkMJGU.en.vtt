00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
welcome back so we've got the head valve

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.950 
welcome back so we've got the head valve
cover<00:00:05.460> off<00:00:05.549> I've<00:00:06.330> just<00:00:06.600> covered<00:00:07.379> it<00:00:07.500> over<00:00:07.649> and

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960 
cover off I've just covered it over and

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.470 
cover off I've just covered it over and
I<00:00:10.010> went<00:00:11.010> ahead<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:11.190> I<00:00:11.400> labeled<00:00:11.790> my<00:00:11.910> injectors

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
I went ahead and I labeled my injectors

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.780 
I went ahead and I labeled my injectors
one<00:00:13.019> through<00:00:13.259> four<00:00:13.500> label<00:00:14.429> them<00:00:14.580> so<00:00:14.730> you

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
one through four label them so you

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.550 
one through four label them so you
remember<00:00:15.089> which<00:00:15.269> way<00:00:15.450> they<00:00:15.630> go<00:00:15.660> go<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.350> next

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
remember which way they go go the next

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.650 
remember which way they go go the next
step<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:16.890> going<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.100> be<00:00:17.160> taking<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:18.180> intake

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
step is going to be taking the intake

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.580 
step is going to be taking the intake
manifold<00:00:19.350> off<00:00:19.590> with<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:21.330> throttle<00:00:22.320> body

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
manifold off with the throttle body

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.710 
manifold off with the throttle body
housing<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.519> really<00:00:24.000> quickly<00:00:24.359> I've<00:00:24.480> already

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
housing and really quickly I've already

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.529 
housing and really quickly I've already
kind<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:24.930> got<00:00:25.080> into<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.560> but<00:00:26.330> basically<00:00:27.330> what

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
kind of got into it but basically what

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.359 
kind of got into it but basically what
you're<00:00:27.630> gonna<00:00:27.720> do<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.380> you're<00:00:29.310> gonna

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
you're gonna do is you're gonna

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.950 
you're gonna do is you're gonna
disconnect<00:00:29.789> some<00:00:30.090> things<00:00:30.359> whatever<00:00:30.810> you're

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
disconnect some things whatever you're

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.179 
disconnect some things whatever you're
comfortable<00:00:31.140> with<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.560> lot<00:00:31.769> of<00:00:31.830> things<00:00:32.009> I

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
comfortable with a lot of things I

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.830 
comfortable with a lot of things I
didn't<00:00:32.399> have<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.640> label<00:00:32.820> because<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.780> know

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
didn't have to label because I know

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.690 
didn't have to label because I know
where<00:00:34.050> they<00:00:34.140> go<00:00:34.350> but<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:35.219> can<00:00:35.340> be<00:00:35.430> pulling<00:00:35.640> a

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
where they go but you can be pulling a

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.900 
where they go but you can be pulling a
lot<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.850> hoses<00:00:36.300> off<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:37.219> clips<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.399> terminals

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
lot of hoses off and clips and terminals

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.110 
lot of hoses off and clips and terminals
and<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.809> label<00:00:40.469> them<00:00:40.590> as<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.770> go<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.940> rest

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
and so label them as you go so the rest

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.190 
and so label them as you go so the rest
of<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:43.160> tubing<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:45.090> top<00:00:45.660> half<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.079> air

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
of the tubing the top half of the air

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.010 
of the tubing the top half of the air
mass<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:47.070> notice<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.610> was<00:00:47.670> one<00:00:47.940> extra<00:00:48.300> these

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
mass you notice it was one extra these

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.950 
mass you notice it was one extra these
had<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.260> couple<00:00:49.469> connections<00:00:50.039> took<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.670> off<00:00:50.960> I

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
had a couple connections took that off I

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.760 
had a couple connections took that off I
was<00:00:52.260> able<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.530> get<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.579> flame<00:00:54.420> trap<00:00:54.770> this

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
was able to get to the flame trap this

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.760 
was able to get to the flame trap this
is<00:00:56.250> part<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.730> crankshaft<00:00:57.149> ventilation<00:00:58.079> be

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
is part of the crankshaft ventilation be

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.049 
is part of the crankshaft ventilation be
able<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.039> get<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.699> you're<00:00:59.969> gonna

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
able to get that this you're gonna

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.029 
able to get that this you're gonna
inspect<00:01:00.449> later<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.199> your<00:01:01.469> flame<00:01:01.710> trap

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
inspect later this is your flame trap

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.160 
inspect later this is your flame trap
this<00:01:02.280> always<00:01:02.579> gets<00:01:02.789> clogged<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.600> blows<00:01:03.989> out

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
this always gets clogged that blows out

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.840 
this always gets clogged that blows out
seals<00:01:04.530> you're<00:01:05.280> going<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.460> want<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.640> take<00:01:05.820> a

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
seals you're going to want to take a

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.210 
seals you're going to want to take a
look<00:01:06.119> at<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.799> the<00:01:07.799> next<00:01:08.010> thing<00:01:08.130> that's

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
look at that the next thing that's

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.980 
look at that the next thing that's
important<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.210> throttle<00:01:09.600> body<00:01:09.720> it's

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
important is the throttle body it's

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.750 
important is the throttle body it's
connected<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.650> found<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.070> easiest<00:01:11.100> thing<00:01:11.610> is

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
connected I found the easiest thing is

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.030 
connected I found the easiest thing is
to<00:01:11.970> disconnect<00:01:12.510> these<00:01:12.750> two<00:01:12.960> bolts<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.830> hold

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
to disconnect these two bolts that hold

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.910 
to disconnect these two bolts that hold
the<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:15.030> bracket<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.080> put<00:01:16.350> these<00:01:16.500> bolts<00:01:16.770> back

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
the this bracket in put these bolts back

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.620 
the this bracket in put these bolts back
so<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.159> don't<00:01:17.280> lose<00:01:17.460> them<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.790> disconnect

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
so you don't lose them and disconnect

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.780 
so you don't lose them and disconnect
these<00:01:18.750> from<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.590> mechanism<00:01:20.220> that's<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
these from the mechanism that's the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.130 
these from the mechanism that's the
easiest<00:01:21.060> thing<00:01:21.180> now<00:01:21.450> it's<00:01:21.630> out<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.960> way

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
easiest thing now it's out of the way

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.590 
easiest thing now it's out of the way
the<00:01:22.799> next<00:01:23.400> thing<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.549> disconnect<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.420> you're

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
the next thing to disconnect is you're

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.149 
the next thing to disconnect is you're
gonna<00:01:24.720> eventually<00:01:24.900> disconnect<00:01:25.740> your<00:01:25.890> fuel

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
gonna eventually disconnect your fuel

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.249 
gonna eventually disconnect your fuel
lines<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.090> fuel<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.930> it's<00:01:28.140> the

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
lines this is the fuel in and it's the

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.260 
lines this is the fuel in and it's the
fuel<00:01:28.500> return<00:01:28.979> you're<00:01:29.490> gonna<00:01:29.610> put<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.060> think

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
fuel return you're gonna put I think

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.690 
fuel return you're gonna put I think
it's<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.479> 15<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.140> 17<00:01:31.170> on<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.280> comes<00:01:32.490> off

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
it's a 15 and a 17 on that and comes off

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.510 
it's a 15 and a 17 on that and comes off
this<00:01:33.210> comes<00:01:33.509> back<00:01:33.689> from<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.170> fuel<00:01:35.130> regulator

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
this comes back from that fuel regulator

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.429 
this comes back from that fuel regulator
so<00:01:36.360> you're<00:01:36.509> going<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.659> get<00:01:36.840> those<00:01:37.020> out<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.350> the

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
so you're going to get those out of the

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.660 
so you're going to get those out of the
way<00:01:38.420> let's<00:01:39.420> see<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:39.810> clip<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.770> if<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.579> were

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
way let's see this clip the if you were

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.980 
way let's see this clip the if you were
taking<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:41.970> throttle<00:01:42.270> bar<00:01:42.420> up<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.689> clean<00:01:42.869> it

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
taking the throttle bar up to clean it

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.899 
taking the throttle bar up to clean it
whether<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.439> clip<00:01:43.710> it's<00:01:44.159> got<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.399> little<00:01:44.700> a

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
whether this clip it's got a little a

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.850 
whether this clip it's got a little a
joint<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.659> like<00:01:46.229> kind<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.470> like<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.649> ball<00:01:46.799> and

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
joint I like kind of like a ball and

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.530 
joint I like kind of like a ball and
socket<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.729> it's<00:01:47.939> pretty<00:01:48.119> simple

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
socket and it's pretty simple

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.270 
socket and it's pretty simple
there's<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.960> little<00:01:49.140> tab<00:01:49.320> here<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.770> press<00:01:50.040> up

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
there's a little tab here you press up

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.340 
there's a little tab here you press up
for<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.030> case<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.479> press<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.810> down<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.259> then

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
for this case you press it down and then

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.170 
for this case you press it down and then
this<00:01:52.470> just<00:01:52.680> plops<00:01:52.979> out<00:01:53.159> from<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.610> and

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
this just plops out from that and

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.170 
this just plops out from that and
disconnect<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:55.430> just<00:01:56.430> because<00:01:56.729> eventually

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
disconnect that just because eventually

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.120 
disconnect that just because eventually
going<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.570> want<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.750> take<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:58.049> off<00:01:58.290> clean<00:01:59.040> it

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
going to want to take this off clean it

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.100
