00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:18.030
 hello dear hungry today is one 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.670
 small delicacy on the food or 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.350
 work schedule and we'll see you will leave 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.450
 the preparation of this culinary 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.550
 gem afloat heard is very nice 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.800
 also that this basin is full of fruits 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.900
 on the one hand, rolls wonderfully 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.870
 fingerfood is suitable for the buffet and you 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.280
 on the other hand also as a supplement for 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.630
 example potato or just seed 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.680
 wonderfully suitable 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.050
 we need dried fruit and me for that 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.070
 I'm here for dates apricots and 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.080
 plums decided 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.910
 even figs could be a variant 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.530
 But listen to more suitable 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.420
 I can not think of soaps 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.310
 but you are many and they are 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.750
 collective wisdom already becomes the 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.030
 one or the other clever idea 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.260
 bacon we need her 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.880
 Of course you can also change another 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.470
 to use a breakfast 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.630
 but this one is doing well 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.210
 nice and crunchy and very different 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.950
 we still need 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.549
 We start by slicing the pans 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.420
 to halve and some of it ever 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.420
 to bring into position 

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:20.820
 then we attack us draw a dattel 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.390
 this something apart and give one 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.829
 almond into it 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:30.229
 Now we place our way from the pool 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:30.229
 and roll the dattel fixed in a 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.490
 Next, take the apricot again 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.390
 almond into it and these in the 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.390
 wrapping basin 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:57.409
 and so do we with the plum 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:59.390
 so that the trio is complete and because it is 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.549
 is so beautiful all over again from the of 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.970
 almonds the date in and then in the 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.079
 curl up the basin 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.030
 also the apricot comes with a 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:11.019
 tacked on and then from the 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.019
 treated 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.540
 and then we will proceed again 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.100
 the plum and you see the whole 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.100
 Affair is really easy 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.790
 now you can pray for mandel fruits 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.640
 rolls are served single or 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.380
 just on small skewers and that 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.400
 I always do that I use 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.590
 Needles 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.780
 but also spit with shashlik or 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.140
 if you only take two tubes with you 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.760
 that's just how it works 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.770
 and if you do not succeed by the 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.390
 by stabbing almonds you have to 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:02.470
 players as well to one side over 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:04.020
 you can do that already 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.880
 we cover a baking tray with baking paper 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.690
 i take again usable and 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.830
 put the prepared tubes on top 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.210
 and now everything comes in the oven 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.890
 under the grill 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.380
 I have the grill at the highest level 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.610
 put and the sheet on the second 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.140
 rail given from above 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.380
 but you can also variable 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.480
 handle is important only stays with it 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.330
 depending on about two to three minutes 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.590
 All have to be taken care of 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.590
 how to demonstrate it here 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.920
 then close the oven door again 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.130
 and for another two to three minutes 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.840
 to grill the other side 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.730
 yes and we are done with that 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.230
 and we can feed ourselves the tubes 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.460
 to let 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.650
 By the way, she forgot that in the beginning 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.900
 They also say they are appetizers 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.950
 wonderfully suitable 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.450
 I really have the taste 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.960
 convinced and I hope I am doing it 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.540
 just like that 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.570
 This is really a delicious fast 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.310

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.770
 pretty good appetite 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.480
 if he does not have any fruit 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.490
 but rather potatoes in ham 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.260
 coat or even after one 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.960
