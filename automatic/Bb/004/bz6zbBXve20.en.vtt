00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 that will be the alliances a lot has been 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.400
 talked about alliances in 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.190
 the game but they are exactly when 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.080
 they will leave in what they will consist 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.790
 many of these questions have made me 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.500
 this week and then here a brief 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.560
 explanation of what is known up to 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.560
 now from level 17 we can 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.600
 create or join alliances these are a 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.910
 kind of clans that we can do with 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.710
 our friends can unite us all 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.279
 to battle together and win various 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.230
 awards when creating an alliance we can 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.480
 give it a name and choose any of 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.910
 these 19 flags they see in image 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.980
 right now although it is unknown 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.160
 they will be unlocked from the beginning 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.620
 Furthermore, by creating an alliance, 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.410
 add players remove them and change them 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.350
 of rank not only that, 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.230
 will implement a chat in the game if as 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.180
 they heard a chat inside the game did not 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.670
 knows when they will come out and in what format 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.129
 now I show you the descriptions of 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.110
 what the alliances will be these are not 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.880
 the officers in Spanish because they were 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.900
 translated from the English version and 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.420
 can change it 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.550
 the mind in its official translation for 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.280

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.970
 zeppelin after those descriptions 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.550
 come what would be when you start 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.619
 team wars are enough and they 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.710

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.729
 they say that you and your team will be in a 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.680
 Two-day battle against another team 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.990
 where they will fight a fight for 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.880
 battle coins that team that 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.220
 I managed to have more battle coins at 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.960
 finish the two days will be the winner and 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.850
 will take the battle coins that 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.100
 they got during the dispute and the 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.020
 resources that earned these coins 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.180
 will be used to buy monsters 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.079
 exclusive as general tuna

 link bar general tetis among others 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:20.189
 thing is that apparently only the leaders 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.349
 and sub-leaders of an alliance may 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:24.450
 start a team war so 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.579
 both the other members if they want 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.439
 start one will have to convince the 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.650
 leaders to initiate it through the 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:32.439
 chats 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.120
