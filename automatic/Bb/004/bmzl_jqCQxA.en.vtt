00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.590

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.069
 and do not cover it 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.280
 and we turn on the equipment 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:14.470
 he vibrates before starting to light and 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.470
 shows us its home screen 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.290
 shows us what movistar does not have 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.400
 No sound I guess it's because 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.680
 they are at this moment is silent 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.420
 the phone but it should sound the 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.040
 distinctive song of movistar 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.790
 let's unlock them and let's go up 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.790
 the brightness to the screen 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.840
 well now serving let's make a 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.840
 little zoom 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.740
 for you to see it here then 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.160
 let's see the characteristics of 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.160
 phone 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.030
 about the phone we're going to see the the 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.860
 software that has information from 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.460
 software tells me that it comes with a 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.340
 version of Android 4.0 point 4 true 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:21.079
 what are you ice cream sandwich remember 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.079
 android 4.0 point 4 james sandwich 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.009
 alright then let's go in here 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:30.180
 smart to see what we have in the 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:30.180
 equipment hardware 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.130
 to close here information 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:45.340
 we are going info but we get with 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:48.850
 a font model on gp 768 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.770
 cpu dual core armv7 at a frequency of 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:55.949
 eight thousand megas hertz a resolution of 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:05:00.970
 540 x 960 a density of 240 and a gpu 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:03.639
 powervr sgx540 remember this was the gpu 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:06.940
 that we got on the samsung galaxy s 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:10.969
 1 a version of open gl 2.0 a memory 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:13.219
 2,385 megas 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:15.189
 that this is what we would use to 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:19.159
 application installation a run of 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:21.379
 767 mega which we will round it would be 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:24.349
 a giga that the rest would be reserved 

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:28.309
 for the system and a memory 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:30.979
 of 2gb sd good here says 1919 6 

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:32.959
 megas but good are two gigas a 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:35.029
 8 megapixel rear camera and one 

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:36.679
 0.3 megapixel front camera good 

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:38.689
 we had already seen that it has a version 

00:05:36.679 --> 00:05:41.119
 from android 4.0 point 4 then 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:43.999
 let's hope it can be updated 

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:46.590
 aie living know a little what is the 

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:48.480
 gym interface 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.129
 it is enough for itself high guys of 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.479
 samsung 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:54.539
 retains many of the features 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:57.119
 well here it does not divide us 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:59.279
 applications that are the total of 

00:05:57.119 --> 00:06:00.449
 applications and good what you downloaded and 

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:02.280
 well we also have a tab 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:04.139
 widgets 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.370
 another one of the characteristics that conserves 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:06.810
 is that good when I'm going to unlock it 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.780
 I have shortcuts to my 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.190
 applications as you can see here email 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.520

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.520

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:23.509
 directly and I can access the camera 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.569
 and good with nothing more to say this was 

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:28.490
