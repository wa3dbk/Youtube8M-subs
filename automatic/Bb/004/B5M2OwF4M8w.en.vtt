00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.930
 whipped cream 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.940
 The first thing you're going to do is very 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.750
 important, you are going to wash your 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.269
 dams 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.489
 then you will remove the green and the 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:41.710
 You are going to cut into lines also the 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.970
 you can cut blocks into blocks 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.160
 count them on casters 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.080
 in a container you will put all your 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.690
 strawberries that you already cut and then you're going to 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.240
 add sugar to taste and one more milk or 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:57.640
 less like 3 tablespoons of sugar then 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.640
 I put them in the freezer for 15 minutes 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.350
 and that you put your presses in the 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.600
 freezer meanwhile we are going to 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.909

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.909

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.640
 to liquefy what is a half can 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.549

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.799
 can of condensed milk also if 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.979
 you like you can put strawberries and I put 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:27.250
 like 8 strawberries this is going to give flavor and 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.800
 It will also give you a little color 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.840
 then you are going to put everything you mix 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.430

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.310
 ingredients that are the strawberries with the 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.260
 sugar and how do you see my container here 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.390
 be as vaporised because hardly 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.479
