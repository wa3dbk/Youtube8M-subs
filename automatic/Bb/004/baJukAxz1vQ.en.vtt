00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
the next one is extensibility if that

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.840 
the next one is extensibility if that
muscle<00:03:00.510> fiber<00:03:00.930> is<00:03:01.080> pulled<00:03:01.590> on<00:03:01.860> it<00:03:02.130> needs<00:03:02.490> to<00:03:02.700> be

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
muscle fiber is pulled on it needs to be

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.080 
muscle fiber is pulled on it needs to be
able<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.270> stretch<00:03:03.630> so<00:03:04.490> this<00:03:05.490> basically<00:03:05.970> just

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
able to stretch so this basically just

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:14.290 
able to stretch so this basically just
means<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.750> can<00:03:06.959> stretch

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.390 

and<00:03:14.390> then<00:03:15.050> the<00:03:15.170> last<00:03:15.380> major<00:03:15.830> one<00:03:16.130> that<00:03:16.280> we'll

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
and then the last major one that we'll

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.890 
and then the last major one that we'll
talk<00:03:16.610> about<00:03:16.670> is<00:03:17.620> elasticity

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.740 

when<00:03:24.500> we<00:03:24.680> say<00:03:24.980> that<00:03:25.250> something<00:03:25.670> is<00:03:25.879> elastic

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
when we say that something is elastic

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.800 
when we say that something is elastic
that<00:03:27.739> it<00:03:27.920> has<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:28.549> property<00:03:29.090> of<00:03:29.120> elasticity

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
that it has the property of elasticity

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.160 
that it has the property of elasticity
what<00:03:30.799> we<00:03:30.920> mean<00:03:31.129> is<00:03:31.459> after<00:03:32.390> being<00:03:32.540> stretched

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
what we mean is after being stretched

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.300 
what we mean is after being stretched
that<00:03:33.940> expect<00:03:34.940> extensibility<00:03:35.650> oops<00:03:36.650> I<00:03:36.860> just<00:03:36.920> I

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
that expect extensibility oops I just I

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.030 
that expect extensibility oops I just I
suppose<00:03:37.489> extensibility<00:03:38.360> wrong<00:03:41.739> just<00:03:42.739> notice

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
suppose extensibility wrong just notice

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.319 
suppose extensibility wrong just notice
that<00:03:43.090> after<00:03:44.090> it's<00:03:44.780> been<00:03:44.959> extended<00:03:46.000> once<00:03:47.000> the

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
that after it's been extended once the

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.770 
that after it's been extended once the
pressure<00:03:47.599> extending<00:03:48.230> it<00:03:48.319> is<00:03:48.409> released<00:03:49.780> the

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
pressure extending it is released the

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.600 
pressure extending it is released the
fact<00:03:51.110> that<00:03:51.409> it<00:03:51.530> comes<00:03:51.739> back<00:03:51.920> into<00:03:52.370> its

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
fact that it comes back into its

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.110 
fact that it comes back into its
original<00:03:52.700> shape<00:03:53.120> is<00:03:54.220> what<00:03:55.220> elasticity<00:03:55.970> is

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
original shape is what elasticity is

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.110 
original shape is what elasticity is
talking<00:03:56.569> about<00:03:56.810> so<00:03:57.739> when<00:03:58.340> we<00:03:58.489> say<00:03:58.670> something's

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
talking about so when we say something's

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.630 
talking about so when we say something's
elastic<00:03:59.750> we're<00:04:00.680> saying<00:04:00.980> that<00:04:01.160> it's<00:04:01.310> able<00:04:01.489> to

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
elastic we're saying that it's able to

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.589 
elastic we're saying that it's able to
go<00:04:01.849> back<00:04:02.180> into<00:04:02.540> its<00:04:02.690> original<00:04:03.140> shape<00:04:04.599> imagine

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
go back into its original shape imagine

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:06.940 
go back into its original shape imagine
I<00:04:05.660> had<00:04:05.840> a<00:04:05.870> rubber<00:04:06.140> band<00:04:06.410> here<00:04:06.739> and<00:04:06.859> I'm

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
I had a rubber band here and I'm

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.559 
I had a rubber band here and I'm
stretching<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:07.489> rubber<00:04:07.700> band<00:04:08.090> the

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
stretching the rubber band the

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.170 
stretching the rubber band the
stretching<00:04:09.140> of<00:04:09.230> the<00:04:09.290> rubber<00:04:09.590> band<00:04:09.890> shows<00:04:10.879> that

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
stretching of the rubber band shows that

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.649 
stretching of the rubber band shows that
the<00:04:11.299> rubber<00:04:11.510> band<00:04:11.780> is<00:04:12.079> extensible<00:04:13.629> when<00:04:14.629> I

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:14.659 
the rubber band is extensible when I

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:16.420 
the rubber band is extensible when I
release<00:04:15.379> the<00:04:15.590> pressure<00:04:15.769> from<00:04:16.070> the<00:04:16.250> rubber

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
release the pressure from the rubber

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.640 
release the pressure from the rubber
band<00:04:16.729> and<00:04:17.090> it<00:04:17.269> goes<00:04:17.449> back<00:04:17.720> into<00:04:17.959> its<00:04:18.199> original

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
band and it goes back into its original

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.670 
band and it goes back into its original
shape<00:04:18.880> that's<00:04:19.880> the<00:04:20.180> property<00:04:20.570> of<00:04:20.680> elasticity

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
shape that's the property of elasticity

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.600 
shape that's the property of elasticity
so<00:04:23.050> those<00:04:24.050> are<00:04:24.199> all<00:04:24.289> the<00:04:24.440> major<00:04:24.470> properties<00:04:25.340> of

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
so those are all the major properties of

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.690 
so those are all the major properties of
