00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
that really doesn't matter just make

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.630 
that really doesn't matter just make

sure you actually have super cars as the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.039 
sure you actually have super cars as the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
with because for some reason when you

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.399 
with because for some reason when you
race<00:01:26.909> with<00:01:27.090> super<00:01:27.360> cars<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:27.990> win<00:01:28.170> races

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
race with super cars and you win races

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.200 
race with super cars and you win races
you<00:01:28.680> actually<00:01:29.070> like<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.400> upgrades<00:01:29.759> for<00:01:29.909> every

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
you actually like the upgrades for every

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.569 
you actually like the upgrades for every
other<00:01:30.390> type<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.750> class<00:01:31.259> also<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:32.340> make<00:01:32.460> it

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
other type of class also to make it

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.700 
other type of class also to make it
quicker<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.060> should<00:01:33.270> probably<00:01:33.509> do<00:01:33.720> one<00:01:34.049> lap<00:01:34.380> I

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
quicker you should probably do one lap I

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.469 
quicker you should probably do one lap I
you<00:01:35.189> know<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.430> start<00:01:35.640> there's<00:01:35.850> five<00:01:36.150> I'm<00:01:36.329> just

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
you know you start there's five I'm just

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.480 
you know you start there's five I'm just
change<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.810> one<00:01:37.079> standard<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.310> know<00:01:38.430> you

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
change it to one standard you know you

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.530 
change it to one standard you know you
can<00:01:38.670> leave<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.090> doesn't<00:01:39.329> really<00:01:39.420> matter

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
can leave that it doesn't really matter

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.200 
can leave that it doesn't really matter
what<00:01:39.960> race<00:01:40.170> type<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.619> don't<00:01:40.770> think<00:01:40.979> but<00:01:41.460> as<00:01:42.000> you

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
what race type I don't think but as you

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.219 
what race type I don't think but as you
see<00:01:42.270> right<00:01:42.420> here<00:01:42.540> these<00:01:42.750> are<00:01:42.899> some<00:01:43.020> good

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
see right here these are some good

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.300 
see right here these are some good
settings<00:01:43.590> obviously<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.130> don't<00:01:44.220> want

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
settings obviously you don't want

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.889 
settings obviously you don't want
traffic<00:01:44.579> want<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.030> level<00:01:45.210> all<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.600> stuff<00:01:45.750> off

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
traffic want to level all that stuff off

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.330 
traffic want to level all that stuff off
but<00:01:46.320> once<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.619> get<00:01:46.680> all<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:46.920> stuff<00:01:46.979> set<00:01:47.310> up

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
but once you get all that stuff set up

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.499 
but once you get all that stuff set up
all<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.759> don't<00:01:47.880> want<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.060> do<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.270> start<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
all you don't want to do is start the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.450 
all you don't want to do is start the
race<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.259> once<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.500> started<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.920> race<00:01:50.100> you're

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
race so once you started the race you're

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.679 
race so once you started the race you're
going<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.670> want<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.909> win<00:01:51.180> you're<00:01:51.390> gonna<00:01:51.479> want

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
going to want to win you're gonna want

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.300 
going to want to win you're gonna want
to<00:01:51.720> make<00:01:51.869> your<00:01:51.990> friend<00:01:52.259> just<00:01:52.380> sit<00:01:52.860> there<00:01:53.070> you

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
to make your friend just sit there you

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.020 
to make your friend just sit there you
know<00:01:53.399> do<00:01:53.520> nothing

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
know do nothing

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.580 
know do nothing
like<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.329> said<00:01:54.390> criminal<00:01:54.899> records<00:01:55.229> this<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.439> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
like I said criminal records this is the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.380 
like I said criminal records this is the
one<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.860> takes<00:01:56.009> about<00:01:56.189> 32<00:01:56.579> seconds<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.060> think<00:01:57.180> as

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
one it takes about 32 seconds I think as

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.660 
one it takes about 32 seconds I think as
you<00:01:57.479> see<00:01:57.630> right<00:01:57.750> here<00:01:57.780> but<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:59.130> want<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.369> win

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
you see right here but you want to win

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.880 
you see right here but you want to win
the<00:01:59.850> race<00:01:59.880> obviously<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:01.290> can<00:02:01.469> alternate

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
the race obviously you can alternate

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.170 
the race obviously you can alternate
this<00:02:02.040> with<00:02:02.219> your<00:02:02.340> friends<00:02:02.640> if<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.759> wants<00:02:03.060> the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
this with your friends if you wants the

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.880 
this with your friends if you wants the
engine<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.630> all<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.140> upgrades<00:02:04.619> for<00:02:04.799> the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
engine and all that upgrades for the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.740 
engine and all that upgrades for the
cars<00:02:05.100> as<00:02:05.280> well<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.909> can<00:02:06.000> go<00:02:06.090> back<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.540> forth

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
cars as well you can go back and forth

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.389 
cars as well you can go back and forth
but<00:02:07.259> as<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.439> see<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.619> came<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:07.979> first<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.280> you

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
but as you see I came in first and you

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.040 
but as you see I came in first and you
actually<00:02:08.550> get<00:02:08.729> about<00:02:08.910> four<00:02:09.330> thousand<00:02:09.810> dollars

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
actually get about four thousand dollars

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.110 
actually get about four thousand dollars
and<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.229> think<00:02:10.500> about<00:02:10.679> 1500<00:02:11.520> are

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
and I think about 1500 are

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.849 
and I think about 1500 are
I<00:02:12.150> think<00:02:12.659> depending<00:02:12.959> on<00:02:13.079> like<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.290> times<00:02:13.560> and

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:13.859 
I think depending on like the times and

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:15.830 
I think depending on like the times and
stuff<00:02:14.340> what<00:02:14.549> you<00:02:14.670> do<00:02:14.819> I<00:02:14.849> think<00:02:14.999> actually

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
stuff what you do I think actually

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.030 
stuff what you do I think actually
depending<00:02:16.170> on<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.319> race<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.709> actually<00:02:16.950> have

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
depending on the race you actually have

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.989 
depending on the race you actually have
more<00:02:17.159> stuff<00:02:17.400> so<00:02:17.519> if<00:02:17.609> you<00:02:17.670> want<00:02:17.819> to<00:02:17.849> pick<00:02:17.969> a

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:17.999 
more stuff so if you want to pick a

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:19.699 
more stuff so if you want to pick a
better<00:02:18.180> race<00:02:18.389> as<00:02:18.569> more<00:02:18.780> money<00:02:19.019> you<00:02:19.469> can<00:02:19.499> do

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
better race as more money you can do

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.349 
better race as more money you can do
that<00:02:19.829> as<00:02:20.010> well<00:02:20.159> but<00:02:20.400> like<00:02:20.790> I<00:02:20.879> said<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.150> main

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:21.359 
that as well but like I said the main

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:22.759 
that as well but like I said the main
reason<00:02:21.389> I<00:02:21.689> chose<00:02:21.870> criminal<00:02:22.290> records<00:02:22.590> it's

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
reason I chose criminal records it's

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.259 
reason I chose criminal records it's
because<00:02:23.010> it's<00:02:23.129> a<00:02:23.219> short<00:02:23.400> amount<00:02:23.609> of<00:02:23.760> time<00:02:23.819> and

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
because it's a short amount of time and

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.059 
because it's a short amount of time and
if<00:02:24.359> you<00:02:24.450> can<00:02:24.569> do<00:02:24.659> this<00:02:24.749> watch<00:02:24.930> 30<00:02:25.560> something

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
if you can do this watch 30 something

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.979 
if you can do this watch 30 something
times<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.489> unlock<00:02:26.639> the<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.420> know<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.629> engine

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
times to unlock the you know the engine

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.690 
times to unlock the you know the engine
for<00:02:28.260> upgrades<00:02:28.739> and<00:02:28.920> stuff<00:02:29.099> for<00:02:29.250> your<00:02:29.340> vehicles

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700
