to go off at digital so put in sleep
mode<00:01:52.470> what<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.829> goes<00:01:52.950> up<00:01:53.100> I'll<00:01:53.250> demonstrate

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.690

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
let's see if it actually turned it off

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.319 
let's see if it actually turned it off
or<00:02:04.350> if<00:02:04.409> it's<00:02:04.530> actually<00:02:04.829> sleep<00:02:05.130> mode<00:02:05.399> that's

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
or if it's actually sleep mode that's

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.340 
or if it's actually sleep mode that's
interesting<00:02:06.780> i<00:02:06.810> can't<00:02:07.079> believe<00:02:07.259> i<00:02:07.320> missed

sure<00:02:32.980> you<00:02:33.070> can<00:02:33.190> do<00:02:33.310> this<00:02:33.340> with<00:02:33.490> it<00:02:33.790> out<00:02:34.120> of

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
sure you can do this with it out of

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.820 
sure you can do this with it out of
sleep<00:02:34.690> mode<00:02:34.810> as<00:02:34.930> well<00:02:34.960> with<00:02:35.200> it<00:02:35.350> woke<00:02:35.560> in<00:02:35.770> the

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
sleep mode as well with it woke in the

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.030 
sleep mode as well with it woke in the
you<00:02:36.670> know<00:02:36.700> wait<00:02:37.210> mode<00:02:38.020> when<00:02:38.320> it's<00:02:38.440> actually<00:02:38.800> on

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
the same thing might put it in sleep

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.120 
the same thing might put it in sleep
mutter<00:02:44.260> in<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.380> process<00:02:44.830> though<00:02:44.980> i<00:02:45.010> don't

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130

off<00:04:13.860> I<00:04:14.010> kind<00:04:14.190> of<00:04:14.250> figured<00:04:14.370> it<00:04:14.610> would<00:04:14.700> do<00:04:14.790> that<00:04:14.940> I

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
off I kind of figured it would do that I

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.930 
off I kind of figured it would do that I
mean<00:04:16.019> you<00:04:16.139> know<00:04:16.260> so<00:04:17.160> if<00:04:17.400> you<00:04:17.459> have<00:04:17.579> the<00:04:17.669> snooze

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
mean you know so if you have the snooze

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.849 
mean you know so if you have the snooze
mode<00:04:18.180> on<00:04:18.510> that<00:04:18.959> kind<00:04:19.109> of<00:04:19.169> acts<00:04:19.320> as<00:04:19.440> a<00:04:19.470> physical

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
mode on that kind of acts as a physical

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.820 
mode on that kind of acts as a physical
snooze<00:04:20.250> button<00:04:20.579> I<00:04:21.449> know<00:04:22.350> it's<00:04:22.440> getting<00:04:22.560> kinda

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
redundant I've only got two more tests

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.120 
redundant I've only got two more tests
planned<00:04:24.600> i'm<00:04:24.750> actually<00:04:24.840> going<00:04:25.050> to<00:04:25.139> do<00:04:25.229> one

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
planned i'm actually going to do one

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.939 
planned i'm actually going to do one
more<00:04:26.430> of<00:04:26.729> these<00:04:27.510> with<00:04:27.750> it<00:04:27.870> actually<00:04:28.199> you<00:04:28.800> know

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
more of these with it actually you know

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.939 
more of these with it actually you know
out<00:04:29.639> of<00:04:29.699> sleep<00:04:30.330> mode<00:04:30.479> with<00:04:30.630> it<00:04:30.750> actually<00:04:31.080> you

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
out of sleep mode with it actually you

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:33.560 
out of sleep mode with it actually you
know<00:04:32.070> with<00:04:32.250> it<00:04:32.370> not<00:04:32.520> in<00:04:32.729> standby<00:04:33.090> mode<00:04:33.120> and

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
know with it not in standby mode and

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.600 
know with it not in standby mode and
then<00:04:33.660> i'm<00:04:34.320> going<00:04:34.440> to<00:04:34.500> do<00:04:34.650> it<00:04:34.800> with<00:04:34.949> the<00:04:35.160> actual

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
then i'm going to do it with the actual

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.870 
then i'm going to do it with the actual
stopwatch<00:04:36.330> so<00:04:37.310> again<00:04:38.310> cut<00:04:38.880> to<00:04:39.000> the<00:04:39.030> alarm<00:04:39.389> I

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
stopwatch so again cut to the alarm I

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.570 
stopwatch so again cut to the alarm I
should<00:04:41.880> have<00:04:41.940> any<00:04:42.180> minute<00:04:42.449> now<00:04:42.479> there<00:04:43.470> we<00:04:43.680> go

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.310 

yep<00:04:47.580> it<00:04:47.820> does<00:04:48.030> but<00:04:48.060> it<00:04:48.300> puts<00:04:48.479> in<00:04:48.570> sleep<00:04:48.810> mode<00:04:48.960> so

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
yep it does but it puts in sleep mode so

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.070 
yep it does but it puts in sleep mode so
that<00:04:49.880> might<00:04:50.880> be<00:04:50.910> a<00:04:51.030> bit<00:04:51.180> annoying<00:04:51.360> but<00:04:51.510> you<00:04:51.900> do

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
that might be a bit annoying but you do

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.400 
that might be a bit annoying but you do
indeed<00:04:52.350> have<00:04:52.380> a<00:04:52.590> physic<00:04:53.160> about<00:04:53.370> it<00:04:53.520> actually

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
indeed have a physic about it actually

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.830 
indeed have a physic about it actually
so<00:04:55.410> if<00:04:55.530> you're<00:04:55.680> in<00:04:55.800> its<00:04:56.130> in<00:04:56.340> sleep<00:04:56.669> mode<00:04:56.849> that's

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
so if you're in its in sleep mode that's

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.810 
so if you're in its in sleep mode that's
I<00:04:57.960> do<00:04:58.020> it<00:04:58.169> so<00:04:58.349> say<00:04:58.860> you're<00:04:59.010> like<00:04:59.099> in<00:04:59.280> a<00:04:59.370> meeting
