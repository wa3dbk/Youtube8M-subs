00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
takes a lot for it um for anything to

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.459 
takes a lot for it um for anything to
get<00:01:59.250> through<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.640> so<00:02:00.119> if<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.899> got<00:02:00.990> any<00:02:01.049> hear

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.840 
any noise just my air conditioning it
takes<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.770> while<00:02:04.920> for<00:02:04.979> things<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.430> get<00:02:05.640> through

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
takes a while for things to get through

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.670 
takes a while for things to get through
it<00:02:05.969> like<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.270> could<00:02:06.479> do<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:06.990> much<00:02:07.140> damage<00:02:07.200> my

it like I could do so much damage my
skin<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.129> it<00:02:08.220> would<00:02:08.340> even<00:02:08.580> go<00:02:08.700> through<00:02:08.910> like<00:02:09.330> I

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
skin and it would even go through like I

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.940 
skin and it would even go through like I
could<00:02:10.110> put<00:02:10.319> creams<00:02:11.069> lotions

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.170 
but as far as my acne marks here I still
there<00:03:35.740> I'm<00:03:36.340> still<00:03:36.550> looking<00:03:36.790> for<00:03:36.940> something

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
there I'm still looking for something

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.550 
there I'm still looking for something
else<00:03:37.270> because<00:03:37.480> this<00:03:37.810> did<00:03:37.960> not<00:03:38.080> work<00:03:38.290> as<00:03:38.470> you

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
else because this did not work as you

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.490 
else because this did not work as you
can<00:03:38.590> see<00:03:38.800> the<00:03:38.920> bottle<00:03:39.250> is<00:03:39.400> still<00:03:39.760> full<00:03:40.500> and

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
can see the bottle is still full and

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.450 
can see the bottle is still full and
it's<00:03:42.160> like<00:03:42.370> a<00:03:42.400> really<00:03:42.820> thick<00:03:43.180> cream<00:03:43.830> and<00:03:44.830> yeah

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:45.460 
it's like a really thick cream and yeah

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.720 
it's like a really thick cream and yeah
it<00:03:46.180> does<00:03:46.500> say<00:03:47.500> that<00:03:47.680> it<00:03:47.860> takes<00:03:48.040> time<00:03:48.370> because<00:03:48.640> I

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
it does say that it takes time because I

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.270 
it does say that it takes time because I
used<00:03:48.880> it<00:03:49.000> for<00:03:49.030> almost<00:03:49.840> a<00:03:49.960> month<00:03:50.110> on<00:03:50.350> you<00:03:51.160> know

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
used it for almost a month on you know

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.210 
used it for almost a month on you know
kind<00:03:51.490> of<00:03:51.520> on<00:03:51.700> and<00:03:51.880> off<00:03:51.940> a<00:03:52.000> little<00:03:52.330> bit<00:03:52.450> but

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
kind of on and off a little bit but

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.350 
kind of on and off a little bit but
consistent<00:03:54.220> I<00:03:54.280> guess<00:03:54.460> at<00:03:54.580> the<00:03:54.640> same<00:03:54.790> time<00:03:55.000> but

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
consistent I guess at the same time but

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.110 
consistent I guess at the same time but
I<00:03:55.600> don't<00:03:56.260> know<00:03:56.350> so<00:03:57.160> I<00:03:57.190> do<00:03:57.520> want<00:03:57.730> to<00:03:57.760> say<00:03:57.910> that<00:03:58.060> he

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
I don't know so I do want to say that he

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.880 
I don't know so I do want to say that he
did<00:03:58.270> did<00:03:58.720> okay<00:03:59.110> but<00:03:59.170> I<00:03:59.470> think<00:03:59.650> it<00:03:59.710> could<00:03:59.800> have

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
did did okay but I think it could have

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:00.300 
did did okay but I think it could have
been<00:03:59.980> better

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
been better

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.280 
been better
I'm<00:04:00.910> certain<00:04:01.240> I<00:04:01.300> decided<00:04:01.630> to<00:04:01.870> get<00:04:01.990> rid<00:04:02.110> of<00:04:02.170> it

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
I'm certain I decided to get rid of it

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.840 
I'm certain I decided to get rid of it
or<00:04:02.380> not<00:04:02.640> I<00:04:04.860> was<00:04:05.860> reading<00:04:06.160> reviews<00:04:06.220> on<00:04:06.550> it<00:04:06.610> and

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
or not I was reading reviews on it and

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.090 
or not I was reading reviews on it and
they<00:04:06.940> get<00:04:07.120> saying<00:04:07.390> that<00:04:07.570> it<00:04:08.020> works<00:04:08.290> because<00:04:08.860> I

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
they get saying that it works because I

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.250 
they get saying that it works because I
got<00:04:09.280> the<00:04:09.370> extra<00:04:09.670> extra<00:04:10.150> strength<00:04:10.570> formula<00:04:10.840> and

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
got the extra extra strength formula and

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.360 
got the extra extra strength formula and
I<00:04:11.320> thought<00:04:11.470> that<00:04:11.650> would<00:04:11.740> really<00:04:11.770> work<00:04:11.950> but<00:04:12.220> it

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
I thought that would really work but it

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.530 
I thought that would really work but it
didn't<00:04:12.640> leave<00:04:12.790> me<00:04:12.880> any<00:04:13.000> more<00:04:13.120> it<00:04:13.270> wasn't<00:04:13.390> a

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
didn't leave me any more it wasn't a

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.580 
didn't leave me any more it wasn't a
strong<00:04:13.780> anyway<00:04:15.120> and<00:04:16.120> before<00:04:17.020> I<00:04:17.049> finish<00:04:17.200> the

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
strong anyway and before I finish the

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.720
