i'm<00:01:28.740> not<00:01:28.859> sure<00:01:28.950> if<00:01:29.039> it's<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.189> DC<00:01:29.549> or<00:01:29.729> what<00:01:29.939> went

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
i'm not sure if it's a DC or what went

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:32.840 
i'm not sure if it's a DC or what went
what<00:01:30.749> went<00:01:30.960> wrong<00:01:31.229> but<00:01:31.920> as<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.429> can<00:01:32.520> see<00:01:32.670> here

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
what went wrong but as you can see here

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.550 
what went wrong but as you can see here
he<00:01:32.939> teleports<00:01:33.479> back<00:01:33.659> in<00:01:33.840> everybody<00:01:34.200> see<00:01:34.409> it

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
he teleports back in everybody see it

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.899 
he teleports back in everybody see it
seems<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.920> have<00:01:35.009> gone<00:01:35.130> back<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.490> normal<00:01:35.789> so

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
seems to have gone back to normal so

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.999 
seems to have gone back to normal so
maybe<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.149> was<00:01:36.240> just<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.479> DC<00:01:36.899> or<00:01:37.139> lag<00:01:37.799> or

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
maybe it was just a DC or lag or

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.139 
maybe it was just a DC or lag or
something<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.399> that<00:01:38.429> nature<00:01:38.549> but<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.030> thought

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
something of that nature but I thought

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:40.190
