00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
really weird right now but this is the

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.440 
really weird right now but this is the

color that he gave me and I'm in love
with<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:51.930> color<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.290> cannot<00:01:52.740> wait<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.850> wear<00:01:54.060> it

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
with this color I cannot wait to wear it

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.280 
with this color I cannot wait to wear it
um<00:01:55.549> the<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.579> length<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.390> she<00:01:57.630> gave<00:01:57.810> me<00:01:58.020> was<00:01:58.259> a

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
um the the length that she gave me was a

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.819 
um the the length that she gave me was a
18<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.189> 20<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.579> 22

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
18 and 20 and a 22

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.679 
18 and 20 and a 22
but<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:02.040> think<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:02.610> color<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.180> gonna<00:02:03.509> be
