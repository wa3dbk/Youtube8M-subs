the other part of the shoulder when I

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.470

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
can actually went back and recover

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.299 
can actually went back and recover
because<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:58.050> realized<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.680> where<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.070> labor

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
because I realized that where the labor

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.340 
because I realized that where the labor
was<00:00:59.609> on<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.059> inside<00:01:00.210> when<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.750> pull<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.140> tight

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
was on the inside when you pull it tight

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.660 
was on the inside when you pull it tight
and<00:01:01.500> stretch<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.800> was<00:01:02.070> rolling<00:01:02.399> over<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
and stretch it was rolling over the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.640 
and stretch it was rolling over the
front<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.180> just<00:01:03.870> be<00:01:03.989> mindful<00:01:04.199> when<00:01:04.500> you're

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
front so just be mindful when you're

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.630 
front so just be mindful when you're
cutting<00:01:04.799> through<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.280> want<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.460> cut

hard work straight off the ship okay and

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.690 
hard work straight off the ship okay and
then<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:31.439> your<00:01:31.710> slaves<00:01:32.009> we've<00:01:32.250> cut<00:01:32.460> off<00:01:32.549> the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
then on your slaves we've cut off the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.240 
then on your slaves we've cut off the
edge<00:01:32.850> find<00:01:33.810> your<00:01:34.020> Center<00:01:34.079> on<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.619> top<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.070> cut

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
edge find your Center on the top and cut

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.460 
edge find your Center on the top and cut
straight<00:01:35.579> from<00:01:35.850> there<00:01:36.140> actually<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.229> top

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
straight from there actually a top

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.170 
straight from there actually a top
shoulder<00:01:37.860> sleep<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.549> then<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.759> can<00:01:38.909> pull

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
shoulder sleep and then you can pull

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.240 
shoulder sleep and then you can pull
those<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.869> create<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.290> nice<00:01:40.439> open<00:01:40.770> sleep

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
those to create that nice open sleep

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.070 
those to create that nice open sleep
there

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
there

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.690 
there
so<00:01:42.320> that's<00:01:42.500> pretty<00:01:42.710> much<00:01:42.830> it<00:01:42.890> for<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:43.400> back<00:01:43.550> of

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
so that's pretty much it for the back of

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.300 
so that's pretty much it for the back of
the<00:01:43.790> shirt<00:01:44.000> or<00:01:44.870> the<00:01:44.930> what<00:01:45.530> was<00:01:45.800> the<00:01:45.830> back<00:01:46.130> is

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
the shirt or the what was the back is

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.190 
the shirt or the what was the back is
now<00:01:46.430> going<00:01:46.550> to<00:01:46.610> be<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:46.820> front<00:01:47.080> now<00:01:48.080> this

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
now going to be the front now this

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.200 
now going to be the front now this
records<00:01:48.680> be<00:01:48.800> different<00:01:49.160> so<00:01:50.530> this<00:01:51.530> is<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:53.030> back

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
records be different so this is the back

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.890 
records be different so this is the back
of<00:01:53.330> my<00:01:53.450> shirt<00:01:53.660> now<00:01:55.090> now<00:01:56.090> when<00:01:56.450> we<00:01:56.480> cut<00:01:56.750> the

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
of my shirt now now when we cut the

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.950 
of my shirt now now when we cut the
front<00:01:57.670> around<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:58.760> neckline<00:01:58.940> I<00:01:59.390> only<00:01:59.630> cut

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
front around the neckline I only cut

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.030 
front around the neckline I only cut
that<00:02:00.440> later<00:02:00.940> so<00:02:01.940> when<00:02:02.090> we<00:02:02.240> flip<00:02:02.480> it<00:02:02.630> over<00:02:03.040> let

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
that later so when we flip it over let

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.360 
that later so when we flip it over let
me<00:02:04.130> find<00:02:04.250> my<00:02:04.460> scrap<00:02:05.770> when<00:02:06.770> we<00:02:06.920> flip<00:02:07.100> it<00:02:07.220> over

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
me find my scrap when we flip it over

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.870 
me find my scrap when we flip it over
and<00:02:08.860> again<00:02:09.860> I've<00:02:10.040> cut<00:02:10.250> a<00:02:10.280> bit<00:02:10.460> more<00:02:10.610> away

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
and again I've cut a bit more away

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.250 
and again I've cut a bit more away
second<00:02:11.780> go-round<00:02:11.930> but<00:02:13.150> basically<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:15.140> want

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
second go-round but basically you want

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.610 
second go-round but basically you want
to<00:02:15.380> cut<00:02:15.590> from<00:02:16.070> where<00:02:16.310> you<00:02:16.490> join<00:02:16.700> us<00:02:16.910> here

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
to cut from where you join us here

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.890 
to cut from where you join us here
across<00:02:18.620> down<00:02:19.490> to<00:02:19.730> roughly<00:02:19.940> in<00:02:20.360> line<00:02:20.420> with

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
across down to roughly in line with

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.180 
across down to roughly in line with
where<00:02:21.050> your<00:02:21.230> armpits<00:02:21.740> are<00:02:22.459> on<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.120> sleeves<00:02:24.190> so

where your armpits are on the sleeves so

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.580 
where your armpits are on the sleeves so
I<00:02:25.280> put<00:02:25.790> that<00:02:25.940> scoop<00:02:26.209> out<00:02:26.390> there<00:02:26.660> then<00:02:27.560> I

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
I put that scoop out there then I

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.940 
I put that scoop out there then I
started<00:02:28.130> here<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:29.690> actually<00:02:29.930> cuts<00:02:30.590> over<00:02:30.890> the

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
straight light on the edge here about

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.400 
straight light on the edge here about
here<00:02:36.620> here<00:02:36.920> so<00:02:37.160> cut<00:02:37.400> from<00:02:37.610> here<00:02:38.080> and<00:02:39.080> cut<00:02:39.380> a

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
continuous curve all the way up to where

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.509 
continuous curve all the way up to where
that<00:02:43.340> point<00:02:43.640> is<00:02:43.910> and<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:45.890> same<00:02:46.130> on<00:02:46.160> this<00:02:46.459> side

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
that point is and the same on this side

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.150 
that point is and the same on this side
cut<00:02:47.090> a<00:02:47.120> continuous<00:02:47.720> curve<00:02:47.959> all<00:02:48.320> the<00:02:48.500> way<00:02:48.620> up<00:02:48.800> to

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
cut a continuous curve all the way up to

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.520 
cut a continuous curve all the way up to
here<00:02:49.880> so<00:02:50.780> that's<00:02:50.930> what<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:51.140> cutting<00:02:51.440> I've

should have scented it further forward
um<00:03:36.739> I'm<00:03:37.370> quite<00:03:37.610> happy<00:03:37.730> with<00:03:37.850> anyway<00:03:38.330> it<00:03:38.989> still
