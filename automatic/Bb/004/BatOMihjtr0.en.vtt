00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:09.210
 since its inception the faculty of 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.300
 pindamonhangaba fapi has always worked 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.580
 social and develops on its campus 2nd 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.189
 clinical center a place that offers 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.830
 service to the population in the areas of 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:22.080
 dentistry and physiotherapy 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.680
 all the attendance is done by students 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.150
 with the supervision of teachers 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.490
 this exchange is very important because 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.610
 population receives a treatment of 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.360
 quality made with a lot of care by 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.070
 students 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.350
 the students are all time 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.480
 supervised by teachers toni 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.840
 they are in the learning phase then 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.460
 We 're there all the time watching. 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.890
 teaching punctuation look this is not 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.350
 so just so, so and so it goes 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.329
 professionally growing the student and 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.219
 for the patient is being treated in 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.239
 an institution that, in addition to the student 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.250
 Is doing 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.680
 the teacher is also following 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.710
 so this is very important is in 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.690
 terms of quality of service and in the 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.619
 our institution, we value the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.869
 quality 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.450
 So what we like here is that we do not 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.799
 do the treatment that in volume 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.500
 We want it to be a treatment. 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.450
 very well executed has quality and 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.549
 not only quantity in the care 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.159
 although there are a lot of 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.189
 day care here on the fifth but 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.530
 all are made with a lot of quality 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.049
 technical quality of 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.490
 quality human service because 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.590
 how alone do you make all the difference 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.409
 during a treatment between a 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.479
 health professional of a patient not 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.180
 is actually established a condition of 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.640
 a link of trust between the parties 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.860
 so it's very gratifying for us to see 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.470
 the clinic functioning in this system is a 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.890
 environment as you can see a man of 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.930
 work is not only work it is 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.000
 of great harmony we do not have a 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.130
 problems precisely because there is 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.430
 in compliance with the 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.200
 close to individualized treatment 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.100
 humanized in doing everything with 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.800
 quality 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.920
 I thought it was important for you to have this 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.110
 chemical experience is that our area 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.120
 Dentistry is an area that is not enough 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.890
 you have only the theory you have to have the 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.260
 practice also for you to enter the 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.140
 job market is interesting you 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.709
 already has an experience in the practice of 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.360
 What you chose is to work power. 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.930
 have the opportunity to learn from 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.180
 he 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.420
 he also has this opportunity to 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.420
 do some outside work 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.380
 I would not have the condition I think 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.690
 very interesting, we have much to 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.239
 learn from them that is very interesting 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.470
 the professional here of the college he leaves 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.840
 very well prepared 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.870
 so they come out very well prepared as 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.390
 a general practitioner a general practitioner 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.350
 to solve most of the cases in the 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.270
 population 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.030
 however it always us is 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.190
 encourage them to pursue 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.489
 improvement postgraduate courses 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.650
 specialization so that it can 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.799
 to evolve over the years 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.799
 that his 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.799
 ae 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.040
 I believe that today in all areas 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.420
 only in the areas of biological sciences but 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.980
 in all areas 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.590
 is a professional and can not stay 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.760
 stagnant because news is coming 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.950
 at all times 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.260
 then you are in the case of biology area 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.720
 in the case of biological sciences 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.020
 which was perhaps an absolute truth 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.510
 let's say ten years ago today 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.640
 it is no longer done that it is not wrong 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.640
 but it has already passed and you already have 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.320
 a better and more accurate technique 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.340
 brings better results from your 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.130
 patients 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.780
 then there is your professional success it 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.000
 will always walk along with your 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.920
 professional improvement because this is 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.470
 perceived not only by the patients but 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.510
 also by its ads then game 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.370
 that today the professional has to 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.440
 see the graduation as a first 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.480
 step and then continue 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.150
 improving by making specializations 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.280
 to do a master's degree or maybe even a 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.830
 doctorate for him and reaching a 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.850
 of professional excellence each time 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.700
 bigger 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.739
 I think without this improvement to the 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.260
 Throughout his career I think 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.700
 can not survive 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.700
 properly for many years 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.060
 ae
