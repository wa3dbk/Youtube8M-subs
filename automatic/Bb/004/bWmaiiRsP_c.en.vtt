00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.870
 Hello, I'm Anna Oskina and welcome 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.970
 to my channel today we 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.730
 fly a balloon to new and 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.400
 interesting techniques it will be a mixture 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.780
 stained glass imitation techniques as well 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.500
 cloisonne enamel 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.810
 stay with me at work i will 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.900
 use polymer clay with effect 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.670
 gold extruder and nozzle with small 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.900
 kneading the golden one well 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.570
 polymer clay 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.430
 it should be warm and soft to 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.010
 it was easier to extrude from the extruder 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:43.260
 I put polymer clay in the tool and 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:45.690
 I twist together with the nozzle and I 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:53.640
 It turns out a long golden noodles 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:55.920
 colors on a sheet of paper I drew 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.350
 pencil put balloons 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.690
 this piece of glass and now all 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.149
 I will lay out the drawing exactly on 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.019
 I will use glass in my work 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.450
 metal 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.850
 fimo igloo very neatly around the contour 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.240
 which is under glass i 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.640
 I spread the line from the outer layer 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.939
 and then spread and internal 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.939
 partitions 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.280
 if glass slides on the working 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.740
 the surface can be fixed with tape 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.290
 when laying out these lines you need 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.020
 work very carefully and strive for 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.810
 so that the lines fit tightly to each other. 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.150
 to a friend between these lines is not 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.159
 there were gaps because through these 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.950
 clearances may later mix 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.530
 I use the filler very carefully 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.100
 a metal bun and a knife with a sharp 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.920
 tip 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.549
 I spread the whole whole picture of the whole 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.310
 circuit 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.750
 all partitions that will merge 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.210
 drawing and splitting different colors 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.440
 when the whole drawing is laid out I take 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.930
 three paints 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.060
 these are watercolor paints in a tube also 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.820
 You can use oil paint and 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.820
 I put on a drop of paint on the glass 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.560
 now until the paint is dry i mix 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.500
 her gel with liquid plastic and carefully 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.660
 I mix all three of these separately. 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.240
 colors when mixing you may notice 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.490
 that in a mixture you form small 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.370
 the dots of the color you are 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.770
 use this pigment usually than 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.260
 the more expensive the paint the smaller this pigment 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.510
 or it will not be visible at all in his 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.760
 I use inexpensive watercolor 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.070
 paint from the tubes so you can 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.650
 notice further work small 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.600
 dots as dots can be visible 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.480
 if you mix gel liquid plastic 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.880
 with the bed if you mix 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.070
 polymer clay with ink or mascara 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.440
 this dot is almost not visible 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.750
 because these materials are generally 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.630
 have a very very small moment and 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.670
 when all colors are thoroughly mixed i 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.220
 starting to fill the inner 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.200
 balloon space is very 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.470
 neatly using ordinary wooden 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.269
 toothpicks i fill the space between 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.459
 do not pour too many partitions 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.860
 helium otherwise it may just run out 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.780
 through the septum and when all colors 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.019
 will be filled baked 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.370
 bake right on the glass I put the glass in 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.410
 cold oven 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.579
 then put the required temperature 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.010
 roasting 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.350
 for each polymer clay it has its own and and 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.510
 You will find on the packaging of the polymer 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.360
 clay from which you sculpt and after 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.810
 baking i give cool glass too 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.810
 the oven 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.879
 after baking I take out products from 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.829
 glass and very carefully remove it 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:00.049
 thanks to the fact that watercolor paint 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:02.629
 has a light transparent structure 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:04.459
 the balloon turned out transparent on 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:07.819
 clearance and thanks to the gel 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:10.549
 he bends easily , that is, he is flexible 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:13.099
 I make a little bit by hand 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.670
 hole in the top of the air 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:17.359
 ball 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.970
 and then very carefully I cover it 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.030
 gloss varnish to make it 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.490
 just like a piece of glass but not seemingly 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.979
 forget the product turned out flexible and 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.470
 very light almost weightless 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.630
 air balloon varnish two 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.030
 sides after the lacquer dries 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.539
 you just have to pass the ring and 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.610
 chain beautiful pendant ready to look 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:43.100
 what interesting decorations i have 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.919
 turned out you can make air 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.650
 balls of all colors and any shape 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:51.020
 it is very light almost weightless 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.840
 decorations in this technique will be obtained 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.660
 beautiful earrings whichever 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.060
 on any background color are the product 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.240
 slightly changed on a light background 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.669
 the product is lighter it is darker more 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.520
 dark light passes through it 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:09.680
 if through his stained-glass panel 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.510
 Works performed at the master class you 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.150
 can you post to my group 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.400
 contact or instagram with the tag she 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.220
 Riona I will be very interesting to see 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.830

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.530
 my master classes and don't miss my 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.639

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.880
 ethnic style 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:31.820
