00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
again I assume now be animated in some

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.490 
again I assume now be animated in some
way<00:01:38.700> but<00:01:39.180> you've<00:01:39.270> got<00:01:39.450> three<00:01:39.689> reticles<00:01:40.350> which

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
way but you've got three reticles which

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.990 
way but you've got three reticles which
genuinely<00:01:41.070> look<00:01:41.280> like<00:01:41.430> they<00:01:41.549> could<00:01:41.729> be<00:01:41.759> very

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
genuinely look like they could be very

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.389 
genuinely look like they could be very
good<00:01:42.299> especially<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.780> reflex<00:01:43.350> sight<00:01:43.619> on<00:01:43.860> the

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
good especially the reflex sight on the

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.160 
good especially the reflex sight on the
far<00:01:44.640> left<00:01:44.939> there<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.360> think<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.600> breech<00:01:45.840> one

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
far left there so I think the breech one

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.870 
far left there so I think the breech one
will<00:01:46.380> actually<00:01:46.710> be<00:01:46.799> used<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.220> useful<00:01:47.700> if<00:01:47.790> you

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
will actually be used so useful if you

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.999 
will actually be used so useful if you
like<00:01:48.060> using<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.600> reflex<00:01:49.020> sight<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.799> third

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
like using the reflex sight the third

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.850 
like using the reflex sight the third
one<00:01:50.189> we've<00:01:50.310> got<00:01:50.340> here<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.850> desert<00:01:51.619> coyote<00:01:52.619> and

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
one we've got here is desert coyote and

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.789 
one we've got here is desert coyote and
the<00:01:52.920> actual<00:01:53.850> camo<00:01:54.240> itself<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.990> pretty<00:01:55.409> cool

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
the actual camo itself is pretty cool

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.069 
the actual camo itself is pretty cool
it's<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.219> lighter<00:01:56.579> orange<00:01:57.000> compared<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.810> breech

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
it's a lighter orange compared to breech

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.920 
it's a lighter orange compared to breech
and<00:01:58.350> it's<00:01:58.500> got<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.710> mixture<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.310> the<00:02:00.149> grey<00:02:00.780> and

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
and it's got a mixture of the grey and

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.719 
and it's got a mixture of the grey and
white<00:02:01.140> in<00:02:01.439> there<00:02:01.710> basically<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.310> desert

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
white in there basically a desert

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.100 
white in there basically a desert
inspired<00:02:03.329> camo

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
inspired camo

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.260 
inspired camo
you've<00:02:04.409> got<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.590> nice<00:02:04.799> little<00:02:05.159> calling<00:02:05.969> card<00:02:06.180> in

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
you've got a nice little calling card in

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.969 
you've got a nice little calling card in
the<00:02:06.329> bottom<00:02:06.630> there<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:06.990> then<00:02:07.200> you've<00:02:07.380> got<00:02:07.619> the

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
the bottom there and then you've got the

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.520 
the bottom there and then you've got the
reflex<00:02:08.550> ACOG<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.330> yo<00:02:09.750> tech<00:02:10.050> sights<00:02:10.349> again

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
reflex ACOG and yo tech sights again

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.370 
reflex ACOG and yo tech sights again
again<00:02:11.280> I'd<00:02:11.400> say<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.790> only<00:02:11.910> one<00:02:12.060> it's<00:02:12.180> you

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
again I'd say that the only one it's you

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.230 
again I'd say that the only one it's you
for<00:02:12.530> they're<00:02:12.650> probably<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.370> reflux<00:02:13.910> the

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
for they're probably the reflux the

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.290 
for they're probably the reflux the
makeover<00:02:15.110> looks<00:02:15.320> really<00:02:15.890> dodgy<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.520> triangle

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
makeover looks really dodgy a triangle

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.760 
makeover looks really dodgy a triangle
which<00:02:17.390> doesn't<00:02:17.660> actually<00:02:17.960> directly<00:02:18.200> point<00:02:18.560> at

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
which doesn't actually directly point at

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.080 
which doesn't actually directly point at
where<00:02:18.860> you're<00:02:18.980> shooting<00:02:19.340> I<00:02:19.400> think<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.700> center

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
where you're shooting I think the center

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.580 
where you're shooting I think the center
of<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.240> triangle<00:02:20.600> will<00:02:21.080> be<00:02:21.200> where<00:02:21.350> you<00:02:21.410> shoot

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
of a triangle will be where you shoot

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.690 
of a triangle will be where you shoot
from<00:02:21.710> the<00:02:21.830> area<00:02:22.160> I'm<00:02:22.310> not<00:02:22.430> sure<00:02:22.580> how

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
from the area I'm not sure how

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.220 
from the area I'm not sure how
useful<00:02:22.910> that<00:02:23.090> will<00:02:23.360> be<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.840> next<00:02:24.020> one<00:02:24.080> we've

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
useful that will be the next one we've

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.870 
useful that will be the next one we've
got<00:02:24.260> here<00:02:24.380> is<00:02:24.680> glam<00:02:25.130> and<00:02:25.400> this<00:02:25.490> is<00:02:25.610> sort<00:02:25.820> of

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
got here is glam and this is sort of

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.920 
got here is glam and this is sort of
like<00:02:26.000> a<00:02:26.060> lady<00:02:26.510> sort<00:02:26.960> of<00:02:27.020> accessorize<00:02:27.770> and

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
like a lady sort of accessorize and

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.960 
like a lady sort of accessorize and
jewelry<00:02:29.930> inspired<00:02:30.380> pack<00:02:31.040> you've<00:02:31.520> got<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.760> very

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
jewelry inspired pack you've got a very

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.150 
jewelry inspired pack you've got a very
cool<00:02:32.240> fashionable<00:02:33.050> camo<00:02:33.530> you've<00:02:33.920> got<00:02:34.130> a

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
cool fashionable camo you've got a

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.820 
cool fashionable camo you've got a
little<00:02:34.400> purse<00:02:34.670> there<00:02:35.090> like<00:02:35.330> a<00:02:35.360> golden<00:02:36.020> part<00:02:36.680> to

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
little purse there like a golden part to

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.920 
little purse there like a golden part to
the<00:02:36.920> side<00:02:37.160> into<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:37.640> center<00:02:38.090> for<00:02:38.660> your

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
the side into the center for your

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.140 
the side into the center for your
calling<00:02:39.620> card<00:02:39.650> then<00:02:40.190> you've<00:02:40.310> got<00:02:40.490> three<00:02:40.850> quite

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
calling card then you've got three quite

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.780 
calling card then you've got three quite
cool<00:02:41.770> sights<00:02:42.770> I<00:02:42.980> think<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.220> ACOG<00:02:43.550> in<00:02:43.700> the

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
cool sights I think the ACOG in the

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:44.710 
cool sights I think the ACOG in the
center<00:02:44.120> actually<00:02:44.210> looks<00:02:44.450> like<00:02:44.540> could<00:02:44.690> be

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
center actually looks like could be

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.210 
center actually looks like could be
fairly<00:02:44.990> decent<00:02:45.530> so<00:02:45.680> it<00:02:45.740> could<00:02:45.950> be<00:02:46.070> quite

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
fairly decent so it could be quite

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.460 
fairly decent so it could be quite
useful<00:02:46.760> as<00:02:46.910> well<00:02:47.480> and<00:02:47.750> then<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.200> next<00:02:48.410> one

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
useful as well and then the next one

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.380 
useful as well and then the next one
we've<00:02:48.590> got<00:02:48.740> here<00:02:48.950> is<00:02:49.130> pack-a-punch<00:02:49.820> the<00:02:50.240> one

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
we've got here is pack-a-punch the one

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.000 
we've got here is pack-a-punch the one
that<00:02:50.540> you<00:02:50.630> guys<00:02:50.780> really<00:02:51.050> want<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:51.410> see<00:02:51.590> so

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
that you guys really want to see so

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.200 
that you guys really want to see so
they've<00:02:52.130> gone<00:02:52.310> with<00:02:52.550> the<00:02:52.730> original

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
they've gone with the original

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.600 
they've gone with the original
pack-a-punch<00:02:53.600> camo<00:02:54.290> it<00:02:54.500> looks<00:02:54.950> pretty<00:02:55.310> cool<00:02:55.520> I

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
pack-a-punch camo it looks pretty cool I

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.400 
pack-a-punch camo it looks pretty cool I
think<00:02:55.850> this<00:02:55.940> will<00:02:56.090> look<00:02:56.240> better<00:02:56.540> in<00:02:56.780> action

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
think this will look better in action

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.320 
think this will look better in action
now<00:02:58.190> you've<00:02:58.370> got<00:02:58.490> to<00:02:58.610> remember<00:02:58.760> that<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.090> past

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
now you've got to remember that the past

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.270 
now you've got to remember that the past
two<00:02:59.510> camera<00:02:59.990> packs<00:03:00.230> actually<00:03:00.710> had<00:03:00.830> animated

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
two camera packs actually had animated

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.190 
two camera packs actually had animated
cooling<00:03:01.760> cards<00:03:02.060> and<00:03:02.210> the<00:03:02.720> cameras<00:03:03.050> themselves

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
cooling cards and the cameras themselves

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.140 
cooling cards and the cameras themselves
animated<00:03:04.070> a<00:03:04.100> little<00:03:04.340> bit<00:03:04.460> so<00:03:04.670> hopefully<00:03:05.060> I'll

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
animated a little bit so hopefully I'll

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.280 
animated a little bit so hopefully I'll
be<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.300> same<00:03:05.480> with<00:03:05.600> all<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.750> cameras<00:03:06.170> I'm

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
be the same with all the cameras I'm

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.990 
be the same with all the cameras I'm
showing<00:03:06.470> with<00:03:06.590> in<00:03:06.710> this<00:03:06.890> video<00:03:07.220> you've<00:03:07.850> got<00:03:07.970> a

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
showing with in this video you've got a
