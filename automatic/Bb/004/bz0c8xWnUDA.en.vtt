about or your max depending again on the

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:42.379 
about or your max depending again on the
texture<00:06:40.889> our<00:06:41.219> creators<00:06:41.849> whether<00:06:42.120> it's<00:06:42.330> a

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:42.389 
texture our creators whether it's a

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:44.149 
texture our creators whether it's a
matte<00:06:42.599> lipstick<00:06:43.050> or<00:06:43.259> a<00:06:43.289> glossy<00:06:43.620> lipstick

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:48.419 
because they have less moisture in them

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:51.260 
because they have less moisture in them
so<00:06:49.319> it's<00:06:49.710> it's<00:06:49.949> it's<00:06:50.279> the<00:06:50.460> same<00:06:50.669> rule<00:06:50.879> of<00:06:50.999> thumb

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:51.270 
so it's it's it's the same rule of thumb

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.149 
so it's it's it's the same rule of thumb
what<00:06:52.020> about<00:06:52.229> putting<00:06:52.379> lipsticks<00:06:52.889> in<00:06:53.039> the

door that was full of lipsticks and as a

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.800 
door that was full of lipsticks and as a
child<00:06:59.789> I<00:06:59.969> could<00:07:00.240> never<00:07:00.389> tell<00:07:00.629> the<00:07:00.779> difference

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:00.810 
child I could never tell the difference

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.230 
child I could never tell the difference
whether<00:07:01.319> they<00:07:01.499> were<00:07:01.560> fine<00:07:01.919> or<00:07:02.249> not<00:07:02.520> so<00:07:02.879> does<00:07:03.090> it

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 
whether they were fine or not so does it

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.450 
whether they were fine or not so does it
really<00:07:03.360> make<00:07:03.629> any<00:07:03.689> difference<00:07:03.960> not<00:07:04.830> really<00:07:05.340> in

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:05.460 
really make any difference not really in

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.909 
really make any difference not really in
fact<00:07:05.729> I<00:07:05.939> think<00:07:06.300> keeping<00:07:06.900> lipsticks<00:07:07.650> in<00:07:07.800> the

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:07.919 
fact I think keeping lipsticks in the

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:10.429 
fact I think keeping lipsticks in the
fridge<00:07:08.250> will<00:07:08.669> kind<00:07:08.969> of<00:07:09.150> alter<00:07:10.139> their

00:07:10.429 --> 00:07:10.439 
fridge will kind of alter their

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:12.320 
fridge will kind of alter their
consistency<00:07:11.400> a<00:07:11.430> little<00:07:11.789> break<00:07:11.969> you<00:07:12.150> know<00:07:12.240> you

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.330 
consistency a little break you know you

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.480

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.150 
the condensation yeah and that tends to

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:21.260 
the condensation yeah and that tends to
change<00:07:18.439> the<00:07:19.439> lipstick<00:07:19.909> consistency<00:07:20.909> a<00:07:20.939> little
