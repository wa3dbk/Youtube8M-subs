00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680
 It goes to China and looks in shortly 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.090
 the attitude what I have so well 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.639
 here I still do not recognize here 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.960
 what should be different 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.540
 imagine now, the opponents including on 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.949
 20 I believe when I started 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:25.170
 I had the true strength at 30 I hope 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:28.019
 me that the oil has like on it 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.980
 I put the time history out that 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.750
 now with the with the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:40.200
 tire wear so defined 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:42.570
 is that actually that's out of there 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.629
 I then slowly with my knowledge 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.700
 in the end, the only question is what 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:56.219
 rather than for a car 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:59.309
 I had that I think that already 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:03.449
 Thief 4 in the 3 you have really good 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.810
 Experiences with the bmw made it alas 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.760
 i think i'm next to the x 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.670
 It does not always have to be total 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.830
 madness in the car to be what I then anyway 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:19.200
 can not control it can yes 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:21.720
 even if it is now again 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.200
 with the boxing then is over as 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.200
 gratifying 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.430
 bmw also makes beautiful 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.410
 robert is one 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.410
 he is 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.150
 So far, I do not believe anyone yet 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.320
 big crashed 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.340
 to 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.340
 here the first turn 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.820
 The car is also driving again 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.170
 the whole thing nervous 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.940
 be predicted 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.220
 I think the dare like that one 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.220
 little 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.810
 Approach everyday model match 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.500
 has built up best relationship to the 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.220
 8 if it does us 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.379
 dive 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.900
 yes, because the class of the vehicle 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.900
 over the shore 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.340
 otherwise commercial if it is then again 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.430
 above only in the direction of supersports 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.260
 Unfortunately , disadvantage would be the last 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.870
 box 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.450
 but still stop 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:03.239
 it is already faster 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.769
 For example , he plays 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.280
 I was never interested 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:11.760
 the verivox lick me in the ass with a 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.069
 Box is interested in the supercars 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:23.049
 So then fails completely 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:26.760
 ask twice because there are also 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:31.780
 really fun the bike is 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:36.930
 that has somehow got me more exciting and 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:40.200
 if it's only one or two kilos 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:43.170
 - the car then just such a stretch 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:48.620
 was pretty full drive to drive 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.620
 disgusting in Saxony goes through 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.190
 too much bold 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.280
 I had to 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.280
 says loud 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.930
 but too fast 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.780
 Part about the partner is also like that 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.780
 turns crazy if you somehow 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.920
 on the steering wheel turns 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.920
 totally shit 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.030
 the head over it 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.150
 Yes 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.420
 hello I am 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:05:00.559
 new jaguar advertising believe that it is with 

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:02.560
 the shuffle played the new one 

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:04.600
 boys 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:08.849
 I do not know if that 's it 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:13.169
 should be somehow with the export 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:15.780
 but if I partly already totally 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.940
 advertising with yet 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:21.050
 service coming 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.050
 I believe that bacteria 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:30.360
 for holding it would be strange because 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.550
 so now for the old one 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.380
 do advertising and the context that 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.980
 nobody noticed who was there 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:40.580
 the crew was and what was that 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.580
 operation is 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.550
 on the ware comes for zouaghi 

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:58.929
 at least rather for jaguar weather 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:58.929
 the overture from there through to 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:18.419
 believed year 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:18.419
 Bochum 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:26.070
 or 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.070
 by the optical damage to 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.470
 30 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.470
 picture part brought forward 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.610
 yes we guys yes because I from 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.770
 the ford mustang drive so totally 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.550
 years 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:59.000
 working game 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.970
 for speed or so as the basics of 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:09.490
 continues to expand 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:11.320
 the best thing was that a bit 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:14.590
 had autumn mood 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:17.440
 it was also on the xbox 360 

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:19.690
 a little later 

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.900
 This is not the most popular 

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.310
 firmly 

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.350
 after that is and quite nice 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:29.120
 downhill with the series then came back up 

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:29.120
 on wind 

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.110
 then it goes on again and now it is 

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:38.030
 pause 

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:38.030
 although this year is complete again 

00:07:40.529 --> 00:07:46.129
 time of its sales as nothing except that 

00:07:43.829 --> 00:07:46.129
 mobile 

00:07:48.709 --> 00:07:55.639
 those were easy course but was neat 

00:07:52.709 --> 00:07:57.899
 but the car was something through this 

00:07:55.639 --> 00:08:00.389
 boss boxing lane of course 

00:07:57.899 --> 00:08:05.689
 totally pointless again but what the hell 

00:08:00.389 --> 00:08:05.689
 Simon's minister in the last test
