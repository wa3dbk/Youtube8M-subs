we just click here and then scroll up to
google<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.209> then<00:03:24.959> on<00:03:25.170> google's<00:03:25.590> are<00:03:25.890> for<00:03:26.430> siri

google and then on google's are for siri
we<00:03:27.209> just<00:03:27.420> hold<00:03:27.630> it<00:03:27.720> like<00:03:27.900> this<00:03:27.930> so<00:03:28.350> let's<00:03:29.070> go

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
we just hold it like this so let's go

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.720 
we just hold it like this so let's go
ahead<00:03:29.220> and<00:03:29.340> stop<00:03:29.820> that<00:03:30.030> for<00:03:30.270> a<00:03:30.300> second<00:03:31.730> all

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.210 
ahead and start with something simple
two<00:03:46.020> plus<00:03:46.320> two<00:03:47.930> the<00:03:48.930> answer<00:03:49.260> is<00:03:49.290> for<00:03:49.800> this

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
two plus two the answer is for this

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
they both got them right on google voice

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.810 
they both got them right on google voice
was<00:03:54.930> definitely<00:03:55.320> faster<00:03:55.560> than<00:03:55.890> Cirie<00:03:56.130> was<00:03:56.370> you

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
was definitely faster than Cirie was you

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.699 
was definitely faster than Cirie was you
need<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.060> tell<00:03:57.270> that<00:03:57.540> on<00:03:57.780> the<00:03:57.959> nexus<00:03:58.320> 7<00:03:58.620> it

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
need to tell that on the nexus 7 it

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.229 
need to tell that on the nexus 7 it
fills<00:03:58.890> up<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.040> whole<00:03:59.220> screen<00:03:59.459> here<00:03:59.760> in<00:03:59.910> serie

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
fills up the whole screen here in serie

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.870 
fills up the whole screen here in serie
um<00:04:00.720> only<00:04:01.290> covers<00:04:01.800> up<00:04:01.950> this<00:04:02.070> tiny<00:04:02.370> little<00:04:02.580> area

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
um only covers up this tiny little area

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.670 
um only covers up this tiny little area
here<00:04:03.030> so<00:04:03.660> that's<00:04:03.840> that<00:04:03.959> main<00:04:04.260> difference

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
here so that's that main difference

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.040 
here so that's that main difference
between<00:04:04.850> the<00:04:05.850> size<00:04:06.090> of<00:04:06.390> Siri<00:04:06.690> and<00:04:06.810> Google

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
between the size of Siri and Google

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.040 
between the size of Siri and Google
Voice<00:04:07.470> on<00:04:07.800> each<00:04:08.100> so<00:04:08.880> let's<00:04:09.540> try<00:04:09.720> another<00:04:09.810> one

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
Voice on each so let's try another one

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:20.599 
Voice on each so let's try another one
here<00:04:13.310> is<00:04:14.310> Siri<00:04:14.790> or<00:04:15.060> google<00:04:15.630> voice<00:04:15.989> better<00:04:19.609> let

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
here is Siri or google voice better let

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.940 
here is Siri or google voice better let
me<00:04:20.760> think<00:04:20.940> about<00:04:21.090> that<00:04:21.270> if<00:04:21.930> you<00:04:22.169> like<00:04:22.440> I<00:04:22.770> can

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
me think about that if you like I can

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.850 
me think about that if you like I can
search<00:04:23.400> the<00:04:23.640> web<00:04:23.789> for<00:04:23.870> its<00:04:24.870> area<00:04:25.289> or<00:04:25.440> google

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
search the web for its area or google

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.220 
search the web for its area or google
voice

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
voice

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.980 
voice
better<00:04:26.670> so<00:04:27.670> google<00:04:27.940> voice<00:04:28.060> is<00:04:28.300> obviously<00:04:28.690> run

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
better so google voice is obviously run

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.540 
better so google voice is obviously run
by<00:04:29.170> google's<00:04:29.590> so<00:04:29.800> you<00:04:29.860> know<00:04:30.070> it<00:04:30.190> pulls<00:04:30.400> up

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
by google's so you know it pulls up

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.890 
by google's so you know it pulls up
google<00:04:30.910> straight<00:04:31.240> away<00:04:31.450> it<00:04:31.510> doesn't<00:04:31.630> even

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
google straight away it doesn't even

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.570 
google straight away it doesn't even

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
have to launch into a browser because it

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.940 
have to launch into a browser because it
is<00:04:33.790> right<00:04:34.180> here<00:04:34.510> let's<00:04:35.350> go<00:04:35.470> ahead<00:04:35.560> and<00:04:35.680> try<00:04:35.890> a
