00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:03.850
 public services crowded with people 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.850
 the jams and especially the important rise in the price of fuel 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.240
 have led a significant number of drivers to look for alternatives 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.529
 transport for urban journeys 

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:17.359
 see them or electrically assisted bicycles have a small 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.289
 electric motor that activates when the cyclist starts pedaling minimizing 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:22.589
 your effort 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.829
 thanks to the see and the electric bike 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:30.159
 you have an alternative method of transportation does not pollute does not bother to 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:34.250
 other people because it does not make noise and has a quite affordable price here what 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.210
 we have in off 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.319
 for the plain 

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:40.319
 and in position for slopes on the other 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.660
 last year in france more than 10 thousand electric bicycles were sold 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.690
 70 percent more than a year before 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.890
 a moderate figure compared to that of its neighboring countries 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.400
 in 2007 in Germany some 60 thousand electric bicycles were sold 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.080
 this number is expected to double during 2008 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.000
 also last year about 90 thousand dutch did with one of these 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 units twice as much as a year before 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.640
 despite the fact that the French figures are still far from those of the Netherlands or 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.440
 german 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.320
 the number of establishments where you can find bicycles 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.390
 Electricity has exploded in recent years 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.090
 three years ago I was asked what an electric bicycle was like how it works 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.250
 I did not know there was something like that 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.010
 nowadays people come in knowing perfectly what it is they just need 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.240
 Tips to choose the model that best fits what they want 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.900
 the drawback is that its price is still relatively high 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.660
 the price range of these vehicles ranges from 700 euros for the model 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.270
 cheaper to the more than three thousand that can be one of the most 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.080
 sophisticated 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.230
 The positive part, however, is that in order to drive them you do not need to hire 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.680
 no insurance 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.970
 china produces about 5 like 5 million of these electric bikes of which 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.970
 3 million three million were destined for export 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.330
 this supposed a volume of business near the 3 thousand 700 million 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.180
 euros 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.030
 according to the Chinese cycling association 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.510
 p 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.179
 It's everyone's five years are during a trip to China 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.889
 we saw some Chinese are mounted on rare machines do it with pedals she 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:19.489
 they moved almost without pedaling and we thought how curious does not make noise 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.909
 contaminates that is an electric bike if this one 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.479
 hosokawa but success 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.749
 Electric bicycles have a range of about 30 kilometers 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:32.169
 they do not rid their users of pedaling 

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:35.529
 but with the mass in the effort and can reach a maximum speed of about 

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:38.789
 25 kilometers per hour 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:42.509
 in paris the town hall and the electric company from efe have 

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:45.629
 decided to contribute to the proliferation of this type of electric vehicles 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.909
 installing charging points throughout the city
