I'm making a short video to illustrate

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.370 
I'm making a short video to illustrate
the<00:00:08.370> action<00:00:08.970> of<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.389> secret<00:00:09.750> compartment<00:00:09.870> in

this<00:00:10.559> desk<00:00:11.660> this<00:00:12.660> is<00:00:12.840> not<00:00:13.080> my<00:00:13.320> original<00:00:13.559> idea

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
this desk this is not my original idea

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.460 
this desk this is not my original idea
but<00:00:14.610> were<00:00:14.790> rather<00:00:15.000> shown<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.599> me<00:00:15.690> about<00:00:16.049> 25

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
but were rather shown to me about 25

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.120 
but were rather shown to me about 25
years<00:00:16.920> ago<00:00:17.039> by<00:00:17.609> my<00:00:17.789> mentor<00:00:18.650> he<00:00:19.650> had<00:00:19.740> built<00:00:19.980> his

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
years ago by my mentor he had built his

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.160 
years ago by my mentor he had built his
first<00:00:20.340> secret<00:00:20.699> compartment<00:00:21.359> using<00:00:21.750> this<00:00:21.869> same

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
first secret compartment using this same

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.060 
first secret compartment using this same
principle<00:00:22.439> in<00:00:23.060> 1958<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.710> cannot<00:00:25.710> say<00:00:26.039> for

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
principle in 1958 I cannot say for

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.650 
principle in 1958 I cannot say for
certain<00:00:26.369> where<00:00:27.060> he<00:00:27.180> learned<00:00:27.420> this<00:00:27.510> little

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
certain where he learned this little

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.320 
certain where he learned this little
trick<00:00:27.920> or<00:00:28.920> even<00:00:29.189> if<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.429> was<00:00:29.580> entirely<00:00:29.939> his<00:00:30.150> own

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
trick or even if it was entirely his own

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.040 
trick or even if it was entirely his own
I<00:00:30.720> do<00:00:31.470> not<00:00:31.859> ever<00:00:32.099> know<00:00:32.369> 6<00:00:32.850> desks<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.690> contain

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
I do not ever know 6 desks that contain

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.260 
I do not ever know 6 desks that contain
his<00:00:34.200> feature<00:00:34.440> either<00:00:35.040> built<00:00:35.399> by<00:00:35.579> him<00:00:36.000> or

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
his feature either built by him or

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.369 
his feature either built by him or
myself<00:00:38.090> after<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.210> lid<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.079> center

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
myself after the lid and the center

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:52.920 
myself after the lid and the center
prospect<00:00:40.920> door<00:00:41.160> are<00:00:41.520> over

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.890 

you<00:00:53.440> can<00:00:53.620> see<00:00:53.890> that<00:00:54.580> the<00:00:54.790> whole<00:00:55.060> center

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
you can see that the whole center

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.110 
you can see that the whole center
section<00:00:56.730> will<00:00:57.730> pull<00:00:57.940> entirely<00:00:58.420> out<00:01:00.120> it's

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
section will pull entirely out it's

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.750 
section will pull entirely out it's
there's<00:01:01.810> some<00:01:02.110> resistance<00:01:02.440> you<00:01:03.280> won't<00:01:03.550> come

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
there's some resistance you won't come

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.840 
there's some resistance you won't come
out<00:01:03.790> easily<00:01:04.270> it's<00:01:05.170> due<00:01:05.950> to<00:01:06.400> the<00:01:06.520> fact<00:01:06.729> that

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
out easily it's due to the fact that

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.400 
out easily it's due to the fact that
it's<00:01:07.060> a<00:01:07.150> tight<00:01:07.390> fit<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:09.810> when<00:01:10.810> you<00:01:10.930> pull<00:01:11.170> this

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
it's a tight fit and when you pull this

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.500 
it's a tight fit and when you pull this
out<00:01:11.680> of<00:01:12.040> that<00:01:12.160> space<00:01:12.550> you're<00:01:12.940> creating<00:01:13.420> a

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
out of that space you're creating a

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.680 
out of that space you're creating a
vacuum<00:01:15.000> now<00:01:16.000> when<00:01:16.660> you<00:01:16.720> take<00:01:16.930> that<00:01:17.110> out<00:01:17.320> you

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
vacuum now when you take that out you

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.780 
vacuum now when you take that out you
look<00:01:19.690> in<00:01:19.840> that<00:01:19.869> space<00:01:20.350> you<00:01:20.830> can<00:01:21.010> see<00:01:21.250> the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
look in that space you can see the

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.590 
look in that space you can see the
backside<00:01:22.030> of<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:23.530> secret<00:01:23.890> compartment<00:01:24.600> but

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
backside of the secret compartment but

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.120 
backside of the secret compartment but
there's<00:01:25.750> really<00:01:25.899> not<00:01:26.110> any<00:01:26.350> way<00:01:26.560> to<00:01:26.619> get<00:01:26.890> down

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
there's really not any way to get down

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.870 
there's really not any way to get down
because<00:01:28.060> it's<00:01:28.330> completely<00:01:28.600> smooth<00:01:29.880> it's

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
because it's completely smooth it's

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.060 
because it's completely smooth it's
