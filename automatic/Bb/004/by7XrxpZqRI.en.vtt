00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.130
 what has happened since 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.360
 virtue is very expensive it happened 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.770
 two edges 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.970
 google had a success that I 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.750
 did not expect me so that's okay 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.640
 give me the chance to dalÃ© 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.400
 a little bit on stage and at the meeting 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.720
 of the public to defend 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.300
 before it was 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.520
 a lot of work I was not 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.900
 you are at the scene worship 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.900
 the song the dance is not bad money 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.310
 he loses his share to hyper rewarding 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:55.370
 for me it made me evolve 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:57.420
 and then we were a bit likely 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.710
 the adventurous started in place over 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.040
 it was necessary to think of 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.610
 to something else and and a second album 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.510
 then there 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.070
 Yes Yes 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.350
 solid world on a small moment 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.520
 of anxiety because actually my first 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.259
 album it was it compilation 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.719
 two titles that I had accumulated since 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.460
 over five years and the press is an album 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:23.960
 I give you to reindeer 0 I never 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.490
 afraid first because generation 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.840
 current it's going to be a super strong title 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.049
 who had a success so I was scared 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.569
 first of all to not be able to succeed 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.700
 remake again as hard and especially 

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:36.709
 how 7 0 and from nothing 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.720
 generation that happens the party 

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:42.800
 military hardly weird like feeling 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.320
 really really body first 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.330
 that I find myself resting and 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.220
 here I come 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.960
 inspiration and I'm trying to think 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.050
 a little to the subjects I wanted to 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.910
 treat that I dream 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.580
 islands how how I wanted 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.000
 to tackle this album it takes time and 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.000
 me hello 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.400
 who 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.780
 I started a little bit to put in 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.700
 the bath of this 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.330
 this new album starts to have this 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.790
 new album 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.510
 in fact I have not I have not looked for 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.590
 not sought to do business what made me 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.470
 this is something that is needed 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.420
 a little bit naturally by listening in 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.760
 listening to what is being done 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.350
 I sought to be with really 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.010
 sincere natural 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.840
 do what I love and so here I am 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.820
 think we can not we can not 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.710
 convince convincing people are not 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.320
 already convinced 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.610
 because we bring is the first 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.250
 person after sale in this new 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.940
 adventure it was me is rather 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.940
 difficult 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:01.100
 this album will be different I want to 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.900
 say yes and no no because that's 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.850
 always me who write and who writes that 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.590
 my songs and who compose them so 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.360
 people who liked the first album 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.209
 they will find a little style 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.450
 here and my way 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:19.080
 ask the words and write but do not believe 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.569
 that with the experience I took 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.609
 a little bottle of pastis and 1 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.130
 in any case that I took I took a 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.630
 little maturity and 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.440
 so I think that the texts they 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.430
 have worked more beautiful melodies 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.280
 really 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.480
 resulted in a nice difference too 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.030
 I think in the orchestration of 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.420
 songs because we played sideways 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:46.299
 the politics of which one and who is slow down 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.280
 keyboard battery all acoustic 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.650
 there is a brass sections because 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.530
 that there is a little retro side in this 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.709
 new album that I love 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.349
 particularly 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:04:00.370
 especially in a title called the 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:18.340
 ball beds and foams a-data not 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:20.889
 bamba and how they want this world 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:26.560
 around you and yet so much 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:30.000
 it's the paranoia the people's gaze 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:35.670
 modify gotha transport tour 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:39.380
 we look in the water welcome to the bar 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.380
 here we do not dance 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.470
 and 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:09.470
 one of the titles of the album that speaks to 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:11.150
 women yeah I'll say 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.220
 Parisian chicken wanted to be Parisian 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.920
 because it's a piece I love 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.690
 who's talking to women because I'm putting myself 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.600
 in the position of a guy that's who 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.860
 idrac dredge is done and that makes him 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.720
 discover his universe 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:28.910
 I discover the universe as 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.910
 World Cup here actually have 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.910

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:46.800
 I was even taking a small side of 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:48.900
