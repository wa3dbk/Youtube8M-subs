00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.410
 It was a newlywed couple with a 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.020
 plan that was already called eba let's say 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.930
 the dan bought that apartment with her patio 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.020
 I would swear that goodbye paradise came out 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.610
 cheaper a modest piece than with 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.279
 Swedish furniture aaron furniture with 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.410
 urgency with a swing on the tree 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.360
 science and a beautiful illusion I've 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.780
 made a predictor one day I painted everything 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.120
 Rose recalls Eva through the alley still 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.280
 I wonder who created it could only be 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.860
 God ran naked but it is neither 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.380
 nothing in the room I thought a little more 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.600
 to see them every morning having breakfast 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.850
 leftovers from the romantic dinner 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.610
 petit indigestion of champagne and apples 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.590
 if you've never spied on them in your window 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.810
 you will not understand that he was given moved to 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.790
 first go for those first ones that 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.549
 someone safe and adam said a 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.740
 rib in the bank mortgaging and if 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.140
 everything was like in the genesis of Jesus 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.939
 every appearance of god would be a paston 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.040
 in light every Sunday afternoon 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.100
 sitting in the park as two 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.830
 teenagers felt great about the 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.530
 security that gives the stability of them 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.600
 called the bar let's say they give it and they 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.940
 They also found in their garden 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.220
 Eden happy food and kisses you like 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.680
 age they were so good 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.870
 that the seconds were slow and the years 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.780
 from ten to ten and they were so 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.930
 all right 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.800
 the garden of e3 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.220
 they also found that more 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.220
 you can ask 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.560
 and how many years of work and what to give them 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.080
 viper that I feel so much in the chair 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.690
 of the branch I dreamed in an Eden without 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.270
 condition or owner no longer without reasons the 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.790
 hangover from the dream and this is not a fable 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.310
 that the parable is running and money the 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.680
 only god that can evict you from 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.020
 paradise that is a half decent house 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.560
 and the forbidden apple are bitten by 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.570
 above 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.670
 I can not understand what sin 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.190
 they committed that it was not trying to 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.530
 survive without rest yet I can not 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.150
 understand what the error was I can not for 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.450
 God will send you a letter of 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.130
 eviction in the name of a man a 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.560
 animal for which they did not find a 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.930
 man I'm going to where I already had it 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.570
 on the day that God decided that there is no 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.660
 that's not for any worker and 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:47.810
 They decided to fight against the established 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.790
 as a heavenly law and so was the 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.890
 psychology of ornament against the door 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.960
 but that the celestial force of the 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.000
 capital and as a redeeming angel 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.820
 they entered through the balcony and there goes the 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.620
 they beat up and he committed suicide like a 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.450
 angel without wings or forces to fight 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.730
 she was called eba 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.739
 let's say the lady and they were 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.599
 well in your fucking garden of the law of 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.550
 happy food and kisses you like 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:13.310
 beautify they were also 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:17.060
 that the seconds were slow and the years 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.600
 ten in ten and they were also 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.700
 in your art garden 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.840
 and they were also 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.840
 the most you can ask for
