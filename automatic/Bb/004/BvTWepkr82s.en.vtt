00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 yann hi to all and local to leucan 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.910
 point fr la suite was released yesterday on 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.960
 ios obviously the iphone the ipad and 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.970
 the ipod touch etc 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.500
 even the apple tv behind that is a 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.269
 slaughter and today I propose you 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.469
 so to watch what is changing 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.469
 compared to ios is 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.619
 so he must then it's not really 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.689
 the big update as was ios 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.190
 is compared to ios August 6 or the 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.170
 design changed and we spent hours 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.980
 all on our phones to say or to 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.450
 cerizoles and there no the interface is 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.489
 always more or less the same and at 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.370
 some small we find men's as we 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.480
 says but but overall the interface 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.860
 is always the same there are just 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.780
 additional functions that will allow 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.320
 including integration with the next 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.300
 mac os x system that comes out mac os x and 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.620
 unity instead of marc ex currently 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.989
 among its functions there is for example 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.879
 continuous cnn daf continuity who you 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.440
 will start for example a 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.670
 message on your iphone to arrive on 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.260
 the computer and that you have in the 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.729
 dock the little icon message you click 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.340
 above and you resume your message 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.780
 exactly where you were on your 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.369
 iphone or your ipad it works too 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.990
 in the other direction you can start 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.690
 to write an email on your computer 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.159
 get it back on your iphone or do it 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.150
 a peaches presentation to recover 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.040
 your phone etc 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.350
 it will happen once this one 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.549
 will be available end of October normal then 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.869
 first thing that changes to you and 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:27.700
 next it is the possibility of being able 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.720
 customize the menu that he has ay if 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.969
 you see I have an application 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.979
 third weezer pro who is here in my 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:35.380
 notification to do this it is sufficient 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.700
 just go crazy is said here and there 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.530
 you have all the applications that 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.090
 will allow you to manage this center 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.799
 of notifications so here I can add 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.530
 willa holland will modify their 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.329
 surplus that's pretty cool then 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.399
 that is that it has some in photos 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.679
 the ability to share photos 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.390
 on other stuff that's planned 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.579
 by photos that obviously emails 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.990
 the photo and cloud sharing feeds 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.299
 twitter facebook flickr etc 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.399
 and if we click on the little mauricie where 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.749
 more a French I guess I have the 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.210
 possibility by the man to integrate 

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:05.859
 in one I click on one and the 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.749
 shot in the end I can take this picture 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:09.850
 send it to the diwan for directly 

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:11.590
 make an entry in the diwan that's 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.150
 pretty cool me for example I do not serve 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.750
 never facebook tests a little 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.880
 Facebook 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.650
 so we'll go back here because I 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.390
 use it a lot and we'll put it here 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.170
 that's not bad either 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.450
 and then suddenly you can 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.980
 customize like that totally your 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.530
 menus so you see that my coming here has 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.410
 been cursed 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.790
 if I come now on safari I 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.290
 will have the same thing but with 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.860
 kangwon application integration 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.590
 password 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.720
 to do this the same I come here on 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.040
 my menus and there you see you a 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.350
 colander to integrate because enough 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.150
 to come surely and become add or 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.830
 in colander here as it's a trick that 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.380
 I will often use in relation to 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.030
 rest I just put a colander from the 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.850
 and suddenly a touch less password 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.200
 bim sa offers me automatically 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.370
 to open the application to enter the 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.680
 passwords on safari 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.480
 it was very very much different 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.080
 this time in the app 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.530
 posts 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.459
 you have the opportunity to rename 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.900
 conversations you see here I called 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.790
 that the wood bus since people with 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.350
 who I discuss habito bull but there is 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.610
 has to all that one of the problems all the 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.739
 world has problems and if I come 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.700
 in detail I can see all the 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.360
 people who are in this 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.670
 conversation 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.500
 the map the place exactly a 106 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.510
 shared the cagi the localization 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.560
 I can share my location 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.120
 with all the people of this 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.250
 conversation and I can 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.620
 here the photos that were shared with 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.120
 me or they are already super nice 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.739
 photos that were shared with me I 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.000
 can even say well done they make me 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.829
 shit when he's writing all the time 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.269
 because they send all 40 sms to the 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.340
 seconds blade 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.200
 so I do not bother and suddenly 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.250
 I will not be notified any more messages 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.110
 who arrive in this conversation 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.700
 particular seems once again 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.079
 it's very much another little thing that 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.180
 change since that's the purpose of this 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.010
 video if you take a picture you 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.900
 you can ask for the focus 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.700
 is overpriced you see a small index of 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.739
 brightness you will be able to ask 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.090
 focusing and moving 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.070
 your finger on the side of the setting 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.709
 point you can change the brightness 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.890
 of the display and that's it you 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:03.470
 can correct from the logic of ios 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.030
 who says sometimes we will be too enlightened 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.260
 and it's like I take a picture there 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.489
 it's all too light so I can tell you 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.380
 go down to have a little more 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.090
 contrast on the dronne and that's it you 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.739
 allows you to really have more control 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.170
 if I want to take this picture by 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:17.269
 example I obviously have filters by 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.190
 default here I do not want I stay 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.930
 I take my picture and coming search 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.270
 my photo here i will then have the 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.860
 possibility to edit them with the same 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.479
 filter that previously Saharan 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.449
 new but especially with a lot of 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:30.550
 settings here I can come resume d 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:32.559
 hb of light and change the light 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.479
 tomorrow photo g the little point from below 

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:36.969
 which I use as benchmark for return I 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:39.610
 can come back up say that these balms 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:40.900
 for example and that is badly done by 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.430
 against the fact that we can come back 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.289
 on the conso budget settings of all of 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.639
 school and saturation I can tell 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:47.439
 but I want like in red be a little 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.210
 more red as tiled either 

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:50.800
 almost young in reality and I can 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.779
 do that I can go back to the menu 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.949
 in the presence added a few contracts 

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:55.389
 from an angle on the contrary I'm doing 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:57.099
 voluntarily a photo but finally I 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.659
 make a picture that looks like nothing but 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:04:59.800
 the idea is that I can change the 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:01.960
 values ​​of black and white etc 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.279
 we really have our hands especially on 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.719
 photos and it will help to share 

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:06.370
 photos that will be directly in 

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:08.789
 better quality that's enough 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.789
 cool too 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.250
 on the other hand in the application photos this 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.110
 that has been changed that there is no longer the 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.640
 film and that's a shame because 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.260
 that suddenly you do not know what the 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.710
 photos are stored locally on your 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.480
 phone 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.400
 and what photos are actually in 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.150
 a club where we are and synchronized by 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.560
 your computer 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.690
 I guess that's a version 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.910
 temporary application photos and 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.440
 that there will be a cleaner version 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.150
 more square we understand a little more 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.320
 integration when there also mongrel will be 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.170
 of exit finally other novelty 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.150
 the application elf who re who come 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.680
 on ios switzerland that did not exist before 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.720
 and to taste some little things here 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.940
 if you ever do not know it is enough 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.500
 just to go in there to say by 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.030
 example I want to know how much I take 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.760
 of protein per day to type prote 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.470
 here and there you add to the dashboard everything 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.730
 simply and it will take a little bit 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.750
 that applications can be 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.370
 update since the yard at the moment 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.660
 where do you see I have a gold factory in 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.220
 test course but within the 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.020
 not synchronize the data does not 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.970
 sync not my pressure either 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.380
 blood pressure neither my weight nor my 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.790
 percentage of body fat and this 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.950
 work still syncs not the 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.970
 distance made by bike there are a lot of 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.380
 small updates made on 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.150
 applications at the same time a law more 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.290
 and go out but at the same time it makes 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.940
 still a moment that it's in beta 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.040
 to finish if you have questions 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.970
 on you then there is apple that to pass 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.860
 to all you have a small application 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.990
 ancient 6 6 which must be called council 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.370
 in French or something like that and on 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.680
 which you are going to have a lot of 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.750
 little tutorial that will allow you to 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.000
 take a little more thinned bone of 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.630
 generally and ios continued in 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.600
 particular 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:43.960

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.250
 ios obviously it's to be simple 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.200
 when you see a few things 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:49.120
 that improves it does not change life but 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.860

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.110
 dares with the possibility of 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.880
 customize a little more the menus of 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.590
