 must be prior 1 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.909
 not sure whether to do it through the tarp 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:33.790

 their advances and sohu with 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.610
 hard situations 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.820
 solutions are new lands here 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.000
 If this happens, I'll keep pretending. 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 in these two days 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.430
 It can work perfectly 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.790
 hence 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.300
 that the industry insists on 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.900
 seven months 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.190
 the sock is 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.430
 I speak here like 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.430

 How can I not go on? 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:19.299
 hugo 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.199
 if you but me 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:23.630
 and some people complained 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.979
 Later I heard that I'm going and here in Sepang. 

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:31.499

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:32.979
 that I would be free 

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:36.119
 He is manager on the sofa. 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:39.459
 so you click here and you're running 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.449
 here in the document he will create a team does the design 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:44.939
 he will create here a 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:46.809
 ef 

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:49.809
 all cast e-books books 2 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.309
 what else happens here shows you how it works 

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:58.529
 the first when sawa the indesc between fear and the clip incisively that 

00:02:58.529 --> 00:02:59.809
 you do not want it 

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:01.809

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:03.390
 I'm going to give up on one now 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.319
 in units the victim has been removed 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.819
 so it works like this 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.019
 certain is the title ibama here is the content 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:13.679
 good dewey 

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:17.499
 and this is the scrap book two if it will open the contents of the book 2 7 

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:22.309
 then we see that it portrays this in here from here for example that I come back 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:24.769
 francisco 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.289
 is about 

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:27.659
 what do you do 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.189
 about being 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:31.190
 is that we strengthen the content 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.190
 the use of parents 

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:41.989
 and here I'll put it here 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.989
 south of the river 

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:48.189
 ney wilson 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:51.439
 Good here for him is opening this person 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:54.479
 that part you want this one of the little eye in which I like the situation 

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:56.439
 horrible looks 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:58.469
 and wanted to show the content here 

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:01.499
 then the one that you put your content here from the south 2010 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:05.639
 gecoc here 

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:09.259
 the one that unites everything 

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:13.279
 neville 

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:16.109
 by the service to hi that once again 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.659
 and then here 12 

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:22.689
 you see here that we already have two that I title and the right content 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.199
 so we are also changing the options here, for example. 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.990
 when hugo that ricardinho disability is the one from here I think he changes and call 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.650

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.620
 beijing 6 may end up a bit of dani's site 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.379
 so we can do it 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:40.610
 mt in source code 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.169
 We'll see that I 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:44.219
 these classes 

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:48.669
 Then he said that it was that they walked the green glow ready there already 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.760
 You know it's the title here. 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.729
 I was happy here 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.300
 So, you come here, I do not know if we'll be right. 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.650
 spherical in the background ccs inside the mirror when it happened 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.650
 you will find more corrupt and others almost right 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.650
 it is January when it assumes that government support 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.389
 the archer can treat cancer 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:13.779

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.260
 welcomed him with the videos either when mousse and brightening the night was long 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.849
 but around here 1 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:31.490

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.050

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:47.159
 liverpool peixoto 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:49.639

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:05.740
 loop but that 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.740
 The secret is on this part I think they went through 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.070

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:16.369

 You will see that I 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.220
 the point is that even though I'm all selected and you come here 

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:05.020
 you put for example quoting a source 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.369
