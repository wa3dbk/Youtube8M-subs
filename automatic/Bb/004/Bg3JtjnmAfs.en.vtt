00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.010 

probably<00:05:12.930> kind<00:05:13.170> of<00:05:13.320> boring<00:05:13.650> but<00:05:14.870> to<00:05:15.870> watch

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
probably kind of boring but to watch

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.060 
probably kind of boring but to watch
it's<00:05:16.320> almost<00:05:16.560> like<00:05:16.800> but<00:05:17.100> yeah<00:05:17.880> so<00:05:19.040> anyway<00:05:20.040> I

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
it's almost like but yeah so anyway I

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.250 
it's almost like but yeah so anyway I
saw<00:05:20.430> there's<00:05:20.610> a<00:05:20.700> vehicle<00:05:21.090> idea<00:05:21.390> because<00:05:21.870> it

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
saw there's a vehicle idea because it

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.700 
saw there's a vehicle idea because it
holds<00:05:22.920> quite<00:05:23.460> a<00:05:23.520> bit<00:05:23.850> and<00:05:24.060> they<00:05:24.990> don't<00:05:25.110> eat<00:05:25.380> a

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
holds quite a bit and they don't eat a

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.800 
holds quite a bit and they don't eat a
lot<00:05:26.040> so<00:05:26.340> I<00:05:26.940> figured<00:05:27.270> this<00:05:27.300> would<00:05:27.450> be<00:05:27.510> perfect

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
lot so I figured this would be perfect

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.080 
lot so I figured this would be perfect
for<00:05:28.050> like<00:05:28.200> I<00:05:28.350> was<00:05:28.440> going<00:05:28.620> out<00:05:28.890> and<00:05:29.220> it<00:05:29.700> just<00:05:29.910> has
