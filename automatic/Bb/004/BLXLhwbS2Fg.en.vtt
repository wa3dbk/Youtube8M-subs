00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.730
 initiates 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:13.490
 we use every day 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.689
 in great quantity 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:19.409
 we observe how much energy is being used at the moment 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.810
 in fact we continue to use it in the same proportion 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.470
 the world demand for energy generated by conventional sources will reach levels 

00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:35.190
 by the year 2030, further contributing to an increase in the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.910
 of global CO2 emissions 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.770
 and thus generating a huge impact on the climate in the future 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.710
 today there are six comma 5 billion people in the world 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.180
 in 2030 will be very linked 3 billion people 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.160
 our energy consumption will be higher with population growth 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.949
 exerting enormous pressure on our sources 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:05.860
 in our climate 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.590
 with this pace of growth until 2030 our energy demand 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.090
 will be implemented 20 53% 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.079
 which in turn could raise global co2 emissions by 55% 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.550
 if there are no changes we will be able to maintain our comfort 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.780
 carry people and things 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.500
 protect our climate 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.100
 survived 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.760
 what the future holds 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.760
 from where will come so much energy 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.740
 which is the most important in single future source of energy 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.480
 energy efficiency 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.499
 we need to get more 

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:58.540
 with me say 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.749
 energy efficiency 

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:02.450
 all areas of life 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.770
 can help protect the climate 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.120
 to act with energy efficiency in the transportation and housing industry 

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:12.839
 will bring countless benefits 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.489
 our energy efficiency can be even more significant 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.489
 an optimization of industrial production processes 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:27.769
 our industries do not always take advantage of these materials in resources used 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:31.620
 joining the best technologies 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.489
 the days available 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.719
 either using criscito these are industrial products 

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:40.379
 and optimizing processes 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:45.099
 we can reduce the amount of energy required to operate in these units 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.099
 and produce our products. 

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:50.450
 products 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.610
 can also help protect our customer 

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:55.700
 in the breast 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.270
 energy efficiency that can be even greater with the use of our 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:06.230
 the energy we use to move our vehicles is consumed. 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.640
 quickly because they are relatively heavy if you copy by replacing parts 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.640
 heavy christmas for light plastics 

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:18.999
 optimizing engines and fuels for increased performance 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:24.219
 improving aerodynamics we can reduce the amount of energy 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:27.219
 necessary to move our vehicles 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.539
 yea 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:36.959
 we can increase our energy efficiency by providing insulation in 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.799
 our houses 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:44.209
 the energy we use for which it is useful for those who appreciate our houses to be 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:45.599
 quickly 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:50.959
 applying surface thermal insulation before specializing in 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.809
 in open systems 

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:55.299
 welcome windows 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:00.390
 we can reduce the amount of energy needed for this to be ours. 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:01.749
 City 

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:03.559
 d 

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:09.399
 the body's energy efficiency is the most important and unique source of 

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:11.309
 energy culture 

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:16.599
 the combination of crumb efficiencies in the transport and housing industry 

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:21.669
 would have a major impact on our energy consumption 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.689
 reducing our CO2 emissions 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:30.729
 only through the incidence of exeter is it possible to maintain our 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:36.869
 increasing energy demand by only 16 percent and co2 emissions in 

00:04:36.869 --> 00:04:39.949
 11% by the year 2030 

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:45.859
 energy efficiency is the most important and unique source 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.449
 pure demagoguery 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:52.900
 Do you want to know the situation? 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.289
 get more with one less 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:59.289
 we already have the technologies 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:03.009
 put your energy efficiency epe 

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:05.529
 note the sources 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:08.529
 that's why I wanted 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.900
 chemistry or against me
