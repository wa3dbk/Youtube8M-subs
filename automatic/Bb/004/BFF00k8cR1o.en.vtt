percent right here in the corner yeah

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.690 
percent right here in the corner yeah
this<00:03:18.560> is<00:03:18.739> when<00:03:18.860> I<00:03:18.890> figured<00:03:19.250> percolation

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
this is when I figured percolation

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.520 
this is when I figured percolation
should<00:03:19.970> have<00:03:20.060> broke<00:03:20.239> what<00:03:20.720> just<00:03:21.200> took<00:03:21.350> the

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
should have broke what just took the

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.560 
should have broke what just took the
damage<00:03:21.890> and<00:03:22.010> then<00:03:22.190> if<00:03:22.459> he<00:03:22.760> got<00:03:22.910> mixed<00:03:23.120> up<00:03:23.299> again

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
damage and then if he got mixed up again

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:29.229 
damage and then if he got mixed up again
whatever<00:03:25.450> eleven<00:03:26.450> percent<00:03:26.750> alright<00:03:28.239> when

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
whatever eleven percent alright when

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:30.610 
whatever eleven percent alright when
I'll<00:03:29.360> Carl<00:03:29.600> has<00:03:29.720> the<00:03:29.750> opportunity<00:03:29.989> come<00:03:30.410> back
