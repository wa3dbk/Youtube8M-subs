00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460
 yes hello the schnitzel here I report 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.700
 me back live from the institution and 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:13.769
 yes it is time for sponge again 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:16.289
 and brush and a lot of color so 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.039
 we have a little bit to ourselves again 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.690
 beautify 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.690
 in spite of this 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.800
 we want a little today 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.690
 Violet makeup is what we need 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.329
 different colors little blood 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.710
 brush sponges et cetera all sorts 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.360
 I use the things I use, I grab you 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.770
 as always infobox we start 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.949
 I take as always the well-known 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.410
 cool aqua humor in this sense is like that 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.690
 to take 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.510
 a little bit of water you can do that now 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.500
 either with sponge I do it 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.500
 like the fingers 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.450
 homberg 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.570
 unusual 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.050
 make this eye mushy 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.820
 I belong 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.820
 also in this sense for it 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.590
 what you should pay attention to is that you 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.149
 the color is not exactly on one point 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.039
 centered but that you always 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.630
 already blurred a bit 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.180
 that does not look like it 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.979
 would that be a partner but as if it were 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.090
 just a miracle a bruise etc 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.810
 in that a bruise everyone 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.009
 had determined easily from the 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.539
 I was noticed differently 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.920
 also use different colors 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.920
 for example , a nice feeling 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.560
 if you have the feeling that it's a 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.510
 have too little of the green ones 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.119
 no problem just a little bit 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.120
 Water is not too much, it was called aqacur 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.850
 but you do not have the color 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.990
 drown 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:21.520
 then you just take another 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:23.800
 bit the red the better 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.970
 that you wanted to have improved 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.130
 Now I have a new one here 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.900
 delimited yellow now I'm doing there 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.900
 want to set some bright spots 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.939
 med 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:49.400
 if all the others can ask you 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.400
 a bit black namely too much 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.700
 do a little bit more now 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.700
 brighter good 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.110
 for the waterline down here with it 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.880
 who stop have a bit 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.280
 This may look a bit prettier 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.280
 I have so much lipliner here 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.780
 his punches of pizza 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.840
 that's a lady's name is that 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:27.040
 hue simply good can also be all truth 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.790
 take if a great one 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.290
 we can do that a bit more 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.700
 to work the blood 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.959
 to tidy a somewhat absorbent 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.150
 Court has already happened 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.810
 that the skin does not tear up in place 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.909
 Three, therefore, take us easy now 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.950
 something of the wonderful scratch 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:45.950
 Lingerie really can recommend to anyone 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.180
 for the fine finish 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.920
 the eye is still a bit 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.660
 clearly wanting to have blood more blood 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.400
 you can also like such a pile 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.090
 take a sponge there gets the whole thing 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.090
 nice structure 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:05:00.650
 I manage would be finished it looks 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:05:01.790
 wonderfully broken from our facebook 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.710
 post page 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.810
 I hope I could do it all to you 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:11.360
 show how to make such a beautiful 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:12.650
 blue make-up with a few pans 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.720
 and so on 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.490
 if you have any suggestions 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.710
 have for almeida which is still 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.330
 Try to scare once down 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.790
 in the comments 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.830
 I'll take a look at it and 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.560
 watch what can somehow implement 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:30.740
 In that sense I'm curious what 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.670
 for creative ideas and what i am in 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.670
 end effect can implement 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.050
 then I wish you one more now
