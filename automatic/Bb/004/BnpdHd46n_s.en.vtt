00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.860
 good as i am saying 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.240
 I have no reason has Caesar 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.669
 porec who 

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:10.169
 I travel always alone 

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:12.779
 do not give you something 

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.009
 of road 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.019
 and then for the psoe 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:18.579
 I do not see it very well 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:20.880
 very necessary in the case 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.310
 what I do have is the traction control 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.589
 and at the same time the abc for me 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:28.470
 it is imperative 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.239
 essential 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.570
 and then I compromise because it does not hurt 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.900
 although the subject of electronic things increasingly makes me more afraid 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.490
 for reliability 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.060
 we will have to trust a little 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.060
 that they are better 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.400
 I believe that 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.480
 we do not have much left 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.530
 good yes the alternator theme 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.980
 what is the battery alternator 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.110
 the carnival goes from being 600 to 700 meters 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.990
 i 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.030
 the above the least is different 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.030
 creams charge 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.530
 that there will be no problems like 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.840
 like the previous version 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.000
 in my case 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.030
 and eight months and 68 thousand kilometers 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.050
 it was three batteries that 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.180
 those that helmet 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.980
 and in two cases of them percent 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.980
 bum bum bum bum bum 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.910
 but the backing of coach andrade 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.880
 the little hands 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.020
 they are adjustable 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.350
 they are very comfortable arguments 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.050
 the expression is regulated 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.670
 In the distance 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.070
 and then also what I really liked is the 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.800
 the new kind of guardian 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.920
 which is removed 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.090
 p on the button of the turn signals on the reverse 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.110
 to the extreme right 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.540
 effectively enable the hand of the command a stop to avoid it
