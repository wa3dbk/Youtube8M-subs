00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
most part because obviously a lot of

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.000

people run windows on their computers
and<00:01:42.130> stuff<00:01:42.280> i<00:01:42.490> don't<00:01:43.180> think<00:01:43.450> that<00:01:44.110> a<00:01:44.260> lot<00:01:44.530> of

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
and stuff i don't think that a lot of

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.800 
and stuff i don't think that a lot of
people<00:01:44.710> would<00:01:45.400> switch<00:01:45.670> over<00:01:46.060> and<00:01:46.090> jump<00:01:46.540> ship

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
people would switch over and jump ship

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.810 
people would switch over and jump ship
to<00:01:47.080> a<00:01:47.110> Windows<00:01:47.560> Phone<00:01:47.830> or<00:01:48.010> Windows<00:01:48.400> tablet

to a Windows Phone or Windows tablet
just<00:01:48.850> for<00:01:49.210> the<00:01:49.270> mobile<00:01:49.570> version<00:01:49.600> of<00:01:49.869> Minecraft

just for the mobile version of Minecraft

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.020 
just for the mobile version of Minecraft
I<00:01:50.320> could<00:01:50.560> be<00:01:50.650> wrong<00:01:50.680> but<00:01:51.460> that's<00:01:51.640> just<00:01:51.880> what

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
I could be wrong but that's just what

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.310 
I could be wrong but that's just what
I'm<00:01:52.119> thinking<00:01:52.479> but<00:01:52.720> with<00:01:52.840> all<00:01:52.960> that<00:01:52.990> talk

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
I'm thinking but with all that talk

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.770 
I'm thinking but with all that talk
about<00:01:53.350> changes<00:01:53.979> side<00:01:54.130> I<00:01:54.310> don't<00:01:54.640> think

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
about changes side I don't think

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.910 
about changes side I don't think
Microsoft<00:01:55.780> was<00:01:55.869> going<00:01:56.080> to<00:01:56.170> make<00:01:56.409> many<00:01:56.799> changes

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
Microsoft was going to make many changes

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.980 
Microsoft was going to make many changes
to<00:01:57.520> Minecraft<00:01:58.000> in<00:01:58.119> terms<00:01:58.270> of<00:01:58.390> what<00:01:58.570> platform

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
to Minecraft in terms of what platform

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.210 
to Minecraft in terms of what platform
it's<00:01:59.110> on<00:01:59.200> and<00:01:59.320> what<00:01:59.409> platform<00:01:59.860> gets<00:02:00.070> this

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
it's on and what platform gets this

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.980 
it's on and what platform gets this
content<00:02:00.700> what<00:02:00.820> platform<00:02:01.180> gets<00:02:01.330> content<00:02:01.900> I

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
content what platform gets content I

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.780 
content what platform gets content I
think<00:02:02.590> it<00:02:02.770> would<00:02:02.860> be<00:02:02.950> in<00:02:03.100> their<00:02:03.250> best<00:02:03.280> interest

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
think it would be in their best interest

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:04.980 
think it would be in their best interest
and<00:02:03.850> I<00:02:03.909> think<00:02:04.210> they're<00:02:04.360> going<00:02:04.509> to<00:02:04.630> just<00:02:04.810> leave

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
and I think they're going to just leave

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.440 
and I think they're going to just leave
it<00:02:05.140> alone<00:02:05.259> because<00:02:06.040> minecraft<00:02:06.759> is<00:02:06.909> a<00:02:06.970> very

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
it alone because minecraft is a very

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.240 
it alone because minecraft is a very
very<00:02:07.689> successful<00:02:07.960> game<00:02:08.470> already<00:02:08.890> it's<00:02:09.099> like

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
very successful game already it's like

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.699 
very successful game already it's like

instead of only focusing on the

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.459 
the game even bigger than it is right
now<00:02:47.370> which<00:02:47.700> if<00:02:47.879> that<00:02:48.060> happens<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:49.019> would<00:02:49.260> be

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:49.469 
now which if that happens it would be

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:51.199 
now which if that happens it would be
absolutely<00:02:49.950> amazing<00:02:50.430> for<00:02:50.670> minecraft<00:02:51.000> because

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
absolutely amazing for minecraft because

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.390 
absolutely amazing for minecraft because
like<00:02:51.329> I<00:02:51.420> said<00:02:51.480> before<00:02:51.859> minecraft<00:02:52.859> is<00:02:52.980> already

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
like I said before minecraft is already

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.670 
like I said before minecraft is already
huge<00:02:53.730> but<00:02:54.389> if<00:02:54.510> they<00:02:54.629> invest<00:02:54.959> more<00:02:55.230> money<00:02:55.290> into

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
huge but if they invest more money into

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.170 
huge but if they invest more money into
it<00:02:55.829> and<00:02:55.950> make<00:02:56.159> it<00:02:56.189> even<00:02:56.400> better<00:02:56.609> than<00:02:56.790> already

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
it and make it even better than already

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.750 
it and make it even better than already
is<00:02:57.299> now<00:02:57.590> imagine<00:02:58.590> what<00:02:59.189> the<00:02:59.340> possibilities

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
is now imagine what the possibilities

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.300 
is now imagine what the possibilities
could<00:03:00.150> be<00:03:00.209> with<00:03:00.720> Minecraft<00:03:01.230> overall<00:03:01.889> though<00:03:02.099> I

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
could be with Minecraft overall though I

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.949 
could be with Minecraft overall though I
don't<00:03:02.609> think<00:03:02.939> Microsoft<00:03:03.480> purchasing

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
don't think Microsoft purchasing

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.330 
don't think Microsoft purchasing
minecraft<00:03:04.409> is<00:03:04.530> going<00:03:04.739> to<00:03:04.799> be<00:03:04.859> that<00:03:05.010> big<00:03:05.189> of<00:03:05.220> a

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
minecraft is going to be that big of a

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.319 
minecraft is going to be that big of a
deal<00:03:05.489> in<00:03:05.639> fact<00:03:05.819> I<00:03:05.879> think<00:03:05.939> it's<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.180> rather

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
deal in fact I think it's a rather

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:07.789 
deal in fact I think it's a rather
neutral<00:03:06.599> thing<00:03:06.989> it's<00:03:07.139> not<00:03:07.200> really<00:03:07.530> good<00:03:07.769> but

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
neutral thing it's not really good but

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.379 
neutral thing it's not really good but
it's<00:03:08.069> not<00:03:08.129> bad<00:03:08.489> at<00:03:08.609> the<00:03:08.669> same<00:03:08.879> time<00:03:09.090> so

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
it's not bad at the same time so

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:10.909 
it's not bad at the same time so
therefore<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:09.810> makes<00:03:09.959> in<00:03:10.079> neutral<00:03:10.470> because

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:10.919 
therefore that makes in neutral because

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:13.280 
therefore that makes in neutral because
Microsoft<00:03:11.669> is<00:03:11.849> a<00:03:11.879> very<00:03:12.269> very<00:03:12.510> smart<00:03:12.780> company

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
Microsoft is a very very smart company

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.319 
Microsoft is a very very smart company
I'm<00:03:13.709> pretty<00:03:14.129> sure<00:03:14.310> they<00:03:14.430> already<00:03:14.459> see<00:03:15.000> all<00:03:15.209> the

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
I'm pretty sure they already see all the

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:16.819 
I'm pretty sure they already see all the
success<00:03:15.689> that<00:03:15.720> minecraft<00:03:16.290> has<00:03:16.409> had<00:03:16.590> on<00:03:16.620> its

success that minecraft has had on its

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.440 
success that minecraft has had on its
own<00:03:16.950> so<00:03:16.980> there's<00:03:17.400> really<00:03:17.489> no<00:03:17.730> need<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:18.120> try<00:03:18.329> and

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
own so there's really no need to try and

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.599 
own so there's really no need to try and
help<00:03:18.569> it<00:03:18.810> be<00:03:18.959> successful<00:03:19.560> when<00:03:20.099> it's<00:03:20.220> already

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
help it be successful when it's already

help it be successful when it's already
