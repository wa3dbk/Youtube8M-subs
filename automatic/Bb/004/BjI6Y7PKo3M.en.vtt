so<00:00:06.200> in<00:00:06.290> station<00:00:06.710> four<00:00:06.920> were<00:00:07.070> asked<00:00:07.400> to<00:00:07.520> look<00:00:08.030> at

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:08.149 
so in station four were asked to look at

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:10.180 
so in station four were asked to look at
the<00:00:08.270> hand<00:00:08.570> and<00:00:08.870> there's<00:00:09.410> a<00:00:09.530> lot<00:00:09.770> of<00:00:09.889> different

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 
the hand and there's a lot of different

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.740 
the hand and there's a lot of different
aspects<00:00:10.670> of<00:00:10.820> the<00:00:10.970> hand<00:00:11.180> that<00:00:11.270> we'll<00:00:11.420> cover

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:11.750 
aspects of the hand that we'll cover

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.100 
aspects of the hand that we'll cover
firstly<00:00:12.590> we've<00:00:12.799> got<00:00:12.980> 27<00:00:13.879> total<00:00:14.480> bones<00:00:14.840> in<00:00:15.020> the

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.110 
firstly we've got 27 total bones in the

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.680 
firstly we've got 27 total bones in the
hand<00:00:15.290> made<00:00:15.770> up<00:00:15.920> of<00:00:16.100> eight<00:00:16.580> carpal<00:00:17.000> bones<00:00:17.360> and

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
hand made up of eight carpal bones and

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.180 
hand made up of eight carpal bones and
the<00:00:17.810> couple<00:00:18.110> bones<00:00:18.289> of<00:00:18.470> these<00:00:18.590> short<00:00:18.950> bones

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:19.190 
the couple bones of these short bones

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.320 
the couple bones of these short bones
found<00:00:19.490> here<00:00:19.789> in<00:00:19.910> the<00:00:20.000> wrist

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
found here in the wrist

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
found here in the wrist
there's<00:00:21.230> five<00:00:21.910> meta<00:00:22.910> couples<00:00:23.630> which<00:00:24.050> are<00:00:24.230> the

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
there's five meta couples which are the

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.800 
there's five meta couples which are the
long<00:00:24.560> bones<00:00:24.860> in<00:00:25.190> your<00:00:25.370> hand<00:00:25.610> and<00:00:25.850> then<00:00:26.300> 14

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
long bones in your hand and then 14

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.420 
long bones in your hand and then 14
phalanges<00:00:27.440> and<00:00:27.650> your<00:00:27.740> flanges<00:00:28.070> are<00:00:28.250> your

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.430 
phalanges and your flanges are your

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.139 
phalanges and your flanges are your
digits<00:00:28.820> or<00:00:29.030> fingers<00:00:30.370> so<00:00:31.370> first<00:00:31.640> of<00:00:31.760> all<00:00:31.850> start

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
digits or fingers so first of all start

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.600 
digits or fingers so first of all start
by<00:00:32.180> looking<00:00:32.540> at<00:00:32.840> the<00:00:33.079> why<00:00:34.040> there's<00:00:34.309> so<00:00:34.489> many

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
by looking at the why there's so many

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.270 
by looking at the why there's so many
bones<00:00:34.940> well<00:00:35.570> there's<00:00:35.899> many<00:00:36.289> reasons<00:00:36.679> for<00:00:37.070> why

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
bones well there's many reasons for why

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.950 
bones well there's many reasons for why
there's<00:00:37.519> so<00:00:37.670> many<00:00:37.789> bones<00:00:38.089> but<00:00:38.359> that<00:00:38.570> probably

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
there's so many bones but that probably

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.959 
there's so many bones but that probably
the<00:00:39.050> primary<00:00:39.530> role<00:00:39.739> is<00:00:39.920> to<00:00:40.070> allow<00:00:40.640> for<00:00:40.850> all<00:00:40.940> the

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
the primary role is to allow for all the

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:42.849 
the primary role is to allow for all the
fine<00:00:41.239> movements<00:00:41.749> don't<00:00:42.170> we<00:00:42.289> move<00:00:42.409> our<00:00:42.589> hand

00:00:42.849 --> 00:00:42.859 
fine movements don't we move our hand

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:45.549 
fine movements don't we move our hand
any<00:00:43.249> number<00:00:43.820> of<00:00:43.879> ways<00:00:44.030> it<00:00:44.329> really<00:00:44.449> does<00:00:44.809> do<00:00:45.530> a

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
any number of ways it really does do a

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.259 
any number of ways it really does do a
lot<00:00:45.859> of<00:00:45.890> little<00:00:46.190> fine<00:00:46.429> things<00:00:46.789> and<00:00:47.030> it's<00:00:47.149> all

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:47.269 
lot of little fine things and it's all

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:49.119 
lot of little fine things and it's all
these<00:00:47.420> small<00:00:47.749> bones<00:00:47.989> that<00:00:48.260> allows<00:00:48.589> us<00:00:48.890> such

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
these small bones that allows us such

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.229 
these small bones that allows us such
great<00:00:49.339> movement<00:00:50.829> so<00:00:51.829> a<00:00:52.190> lot<00:00:52.609> of<00:00:52.640> people<00:00:52.999> will

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
great movement so a lot of people will

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:54.759 
great movement so a lot of people will
become<00:00:53.420> confused<00:00:54.170> with<00:00:54.350> looking<00:00:54.589> for

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
become confused with looking for

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:57.309 
become confused with looking for
technical<00:00:55.039> names<00:00:55.370> for<00:00:55.789> a<00:00:56.449> lot<00:00:56.809> of<00:00:56.839> the<00:00:57.140> names

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:57.319 
technical names for a lot of the names

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:59.829 
technical names for a lot of the names
of<00:00:57.499> these<00:00:57.649> bones<00:00:57.920> for<00:00:58.699> example<00:00:59.149> your

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
of these bones for example your

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:01.840 
of these bones for example your
metacarpals<00:01:00.550> distinguishing<00:01:01.550> the

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
metacarpals distinguishing the

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.729 
metacarpals distinguishing the
difference<00:01:02.179> between<00:01:02.389> the<00:01:02.629> metacarpals<00:01:03.260> is<00:01:03.440> as

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
difference between the metacarpals is as

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.370 
difference between the metacarpals is as
simple<00:01:04.100> as<00:01:04.250> metacarpal<00:01:05.089> one<00:01:05.300> being<00:01:06.050> the

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
simple as metacarpal one being the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.280 
simple as metacarpal one being the
bigger<00:01:06.640> you<00:01:07.640> know<00:01:07.729> the<00:01:07.850> thumb<00:01:08.120> which<00:01:09.020> is<00:01:09.140> also

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
bigger you know the thumb which is also

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.539 
bigger you know the thumb which is also
called<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:09.680> pollak<00:01:10.009> so<00:01:10.159> this<00:01:10.310> would<00:01:10.460> be

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
called the pollak so this would be

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.899 
called the pollak so this would be
metacarpal<00:01:11.180> one<00:01:11.710> metacarpal<00:01:12.710> two<00:01:12.920> three<00:01:13.549> four

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
metacarpal one metacarpal two three four

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:15.969 
metacarpal one metacarpal two three four
and<00:01:14.180> five<00:01:14.360> so<00:01:15.140> that's<00:01:15.229> how<00:01:15.469> we<00:01:15.530> distinguish

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
and five so that's how we distinguish

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:17.620 
and five so that's how we distinguish
between<00:01:16.040> them<00:01:16.520> it's<00:01:16.670> a<00:01:16.759> one<00:01:16.969> two<00:01:17.180> three<00:01:17.210> four

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
between them it's a one two three four

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.410 
between them it's a one two three four
five<00:01:17.899> count<00:01:18.320> so<00:01:19.280> with<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:19.520> phalanges<00:01:19.969> they

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
five count so with the phalanges they

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.170 
five count so with the phalanges they
counted<00:01:20.780> one<00:01:21.049> two<00:01:21.079> three<00:01:21.979> four<00:01:22.340> five<00:01:22.640> again

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
counted one two three four five again

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.069 
counted one two three four five again
from<00:01:23.509> the<00:01:23.630> Pollack's

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
from the Pollack's

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:27.100 
from the Pollack's
or<00:01:24.170> thumb<00:01:24.500> side<00:01:25.240> but<00:01:26.240> notice<00:01:26.479> in<00:01:26.600> a<00:01:26.689> flanger

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
or thumb side but notice in a flanger

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.050 
or thumb side but notice in a flanger
there's<00:01:27.320> different<00:01:27.680> sections<00:01:27.829> so<00:01:28.789> in<00:01:28.850> here

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
there's different sections so in here

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.999 
there's different sections so in here
we've<00:01:29.210> got<00:01:29.390> two<00:01:29.630> sections<00:01:29.960> you<00:01:30.380> have<00:01:30.590> got<00:01:30.860> one

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
we've got two sections you have got one

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.249 
we've got two sections you have got one
two<00:01:31.159> three<00:01:31.280> sections<00:01:32.060> one<00:01:32.360> two<00:01:32.750> three<00:01:33.049> and<00:01:33.200> all

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
two three sections one two three and all

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.410 
two three sections one two three and all
the<00:01:33.439> remaining<00:01:33.619> digits<00:01:33.950> so<00:01:34.939> one<00:01:35.090> of<00:01:35.119> the<00:01:35.240> major

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
the remaining digits so one of the major

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.810 
the remaining digits so one of the major
differences<00:01:35.810> between<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:36.710> Pollux<00:01:37.100> and<00:01:37.250> there

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
differences between the Pollux and there

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.730 
differences between the Pollux and there
are<00:01:37.939> the<00:01:38.240> rest<00:01:38.420> of<00:01:38.600> the<00:01:38.689> flanges<00:01:39.140> is<00:01:39.380> that<00:01:39.649> the

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
are the rest of the flanges is that the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.029 
are the rest of the flanges is that the
Pollux<00:01:40.070> only<00:01:40.399> contains<00:01:40.880> two<00:01:41.259> flanges<00:01:42.259> whereas

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
Pollux only contains two flanges whereas

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:45.219 
Pollux only contains two flanges whereas
all<00:01:43.399> the<00:01:43.789> other<00:01:43.820> digits<00:01:44.299> contain<00:01:44.689> three

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
all the other digits contain three

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.669 
all the other digits contain three
sections<00:01:45.859> to<00:01:46.009> a<00:01:46.039> flange<00:01:46.340> II<00:01:47.049> so<00:01:48.049> the<00:01:48.170> closest

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
sections to a flange II so the closest

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:51.849 
sections to a flange II so the closest
are<00:01:49.210> slanting<00:01:50.210> to<00:01:50.539> the<00:01:50.869> you<00:01:51.619> know<00:01:51.740> the

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:51.859 
are slanting to the you know the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:53.800 
are slanting to the you know the
metacarpals<00:01:52.429> here<00:01:52.579> is<00:01:52.939> called<00:01:53.359> the<00:01:53.600> proximal

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
metacarpals here is called the proximal

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.109 
metacarpals here is called the proximal
phalanges<00:01:54.710> and<00:01:54.829> the<00:01:55.280> furthest<00:01:55.670> is<00:01:55.789> called<00:01:56.000> the

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
phalanges and the furthest is called the

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.240 
phalanges and the furthest is called the
distal<00:01:56.420> plenty

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
distal plenty

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.410 
distal plenty
again<00:01:58.250> over<00:01:58.520> here<00:01:58.549> but<00:01:58.880> we've<00:01:59.030> got<00:01:59.119> a<00:01:59.149> third

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
again over here but we've got a third

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.760 
again over here but we've got a third
piece<00:01:59.689> so<00:01:59.899> that's<00:02:00.079> called<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.380> proximal

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
piece so that's called the proximal

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.169 
piece so that's called the proximal
phalanges<00:02:01.219> it's<00:02:01.579> called<00:02:01.789> the<00:02:01.880> middle

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
phalanges it's called the middle

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:03.020 
phalanges it's called the middle
phalanges

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
phalanges

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.210 
phalanges
and<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.479> distal<00:02:03.810> plan<00:02:04.020> G<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.950> another

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
and this is the distal plan G so another

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.520 
and this is the distal plan G so another
difference<00:02:05.400> between<00:02:06.049> you<00:02:07.049> have<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.260> thumb

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
difference between you have the thumb

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.740 
difference between you have the thumb
and<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.799> remaining<00:02:08.490> digits<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.569> does

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
and the remaining digits is that it does

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.020 
and the remaining digits is that it does
not<00:02:09.959> contain<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.530> middle<00:02:10.770> flange<00:02:11.009> so<00:02:11.520> you

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
not contain the middle flange so you

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.150 
not contain the middle flange so you
must<00:02:12.209> always<00:02:12.450> have<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:13.080> most<00:02:13.590> proximal<00:02:13.890> or

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
must always have a most proximal or

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.559 
must always have a most proximal or
closest<00:02:14.670> then<00:02:14.850> you<00:02:14.940> must<00:02:15.120> always<00:02:15.300> have<00:02:15.420> a

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
closest then you must always have a

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.270 
closest then you must always have a
distal<00:02:15.959> but<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.260> don't<00:02:16.470> always<00:02:16.740> have<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.190> have

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
distal but you don't always have to have

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.510 
distal but you don't always have to have
the<00:02:17.430> middle<00:02:18.620> now<00:02:19.620> one<00:02:19.860> of<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.010> more<00:02:20.280> confusing

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
the middle now one of the more confusing

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.820 
the middle now one of the more confusing
parts<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.390> this<00:02:21.540> is<00:02:21.810> what<00:02:22.110> are<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.410> names<00:02:22.650> of

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
parts to this is what are the names of

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.620 
parts to this is what are the names of
all<00:02:23.010> these<00:02:23.160> individual<00:02:23.730> bones<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.270> there's

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
all these individual bones and there's

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.960 
all these individual bones and there's
eight<00:02:24.900> lines<00:02:25.500> through<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.040> section<00:02:26.340> here<00:02:26.610> so

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
eight lines through this section here so

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.940 
eight lines through this section here so
there's<00:02:27.270> one<00:02:27.450> there<00:02:27.660> on<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.260> a3<00:02:28.680> there's

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
there's one there on to the a3 there's

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.010 
there's one there on to the a3 there's
this<00:02:29.340> fourth<00:02:29.670> pieces<00:02:30.180> on<00:02:30.330> top<00:02:30.510> of<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:30.750> so

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
this fourth pieces on top of that so

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.229 
this fourth pieces on top of that so
it's<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.200> separate<00:02:31.470> bone<00:02:31.709> one<00:02:32.550> here<00:02:32.819> one<00:02:33.209> here

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
it's a separate bone one here one here

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.560 
it's a separate bone one here one here
one<00:02:33.720> here<00:02:33.750> one<00:02:34.170> here<00:02:34.200> so<00:02:35.100> it's<00:02:35.489> like<00:02:35.640> two<00:02:36.000> rows

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
one here one here so it's like two rows

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.560 
one here one here so it's like two rows
of<00:02:36.959> four<00:02:37.350> two<00:02:37.709> distinct<00:02:38.040> rows<00:02:38.220> at<00:02:38.370> all<00:02:38.550> so<00:02:39.510> the

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
of four two distinct rows at all so the

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.660 
of four two distinct rows at all so the
easy<00:02:39.810> way<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.989> describe<00:02:40.890> that<00:02:40.950> is<00:02:41.160> it's<00:02:41.430> just

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
easy way to describe that is it's just

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.150 
easy way to describe that is it's just
drawing<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.180> simple<00:02:42.480> picture<00:02:42.870> or<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.320> free<00:02:43.920> body

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
drawing a simple picture or a free body

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.850 
drawing a simple picture or a free body
diagram<00:02:44.670> of<00:02:44.850> what<00:02:45.150> these<00:02:45.300> rows<00:02:45.690> are<00:02:45.930> for<00:02:45.959> look

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
diagram of what these rows are for look

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.930 
diagram of what these rows are for look
like<00:02:48.739> and<00:02:49.739> I'll<00:02:49.830> put<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.100> rest<00:02:50.280> of<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.670> hand

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
like and I'll put the rest of the hand

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.690 
like and I'll put the rest of the hand
in<00:02:51.150> there's<00:02:51.330> your<00:02:51.480> thumb<00:02:51.750> or<00:02:52.200> two<00:02:52.860> three<00:02:53.160> four

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
in there's your thumb or two three four

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.729 
in there's your thumb or two three four
okay<00:02:54.239> so<00:02:54.300> it's<00:02:54.569> just<00:02:54.630> a<00:02:54.840> real<00:02:55.019> simple<00:02:55.290> picture

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
okay so it's just a real simple picture

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:56.990 
okay so it's just a real simple picture
what<00:02:55.920> this<00:02:56.040> would<00:02:56.190> look<00:02:56.220> like<00:02:56.370> these<00:02:56.730> would<00:02:56.880> be

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
what this would look like these would be

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.660 
what this would look like these would be
your<00:02:57.150> metacarpals<00:02:57.750> your<00:02:57.870> flanges<00:02:58.260> across

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
your metacarpals your flanges across

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.790 
your metacarpals your flanges across
continuing<00:02:59.670> off<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.880> rest<00:03:00.060> of<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.209> page<00:03:00.800> if

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
continuing off the rest of the page if

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.250 
continuing off the rest of the page if
we<00:03:01.860> go<00:03:02.400> across<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:02.850> bottom<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.390> label<00:03:03.989> it<00:03:04.110> as

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
we go across the bottom and label it as

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.590 
we go across the bottom and label it as
a<00:03:04.290> Ryan<00:03:04.620> it's<00:03:04.920> called<00:03:05.160> Sally<00:03:05.610> left<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.180> party

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
a Ryan it's called Sally left the party

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.470 
a Ryan it's called Sally left the party
to<00:03:06.900> take<00:03:07.470> Kathy<00:03:08.160> home<00:03:08.430> so<00:03:09.000> this<00:03:09.209> would<00:03:09.360> be

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
to take Kathy home so this would be

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.610 
to take Kathy home so this would be
Sally<00:03:09.870> left<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:11.370> party<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.799> take<00:03:13.799> Kathy<00:03:14.549> home

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
Sally left the party to take Kathy home

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.289 
Sally left the party to take Kathy home
and<00:03:16.620> this<00:03:16.769> forms<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.280> first<00:03:17.459> letter<00:03:17.820> of<00:03:18.000> each

and this forms the first letter of each

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.770 
and this forms the first letter of each
of<00:03:18.540> these<00:03:18.870> bones<00:03:19.230> so<00:03:20.010> we<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:21.060> S<00:03:21.239> for<00:03:21.540> Sally
