for<00:01:50.710> the<00:01:50.830> yard<00:01:51.070> I<00:01:51.310> think<00:01:52.300> a<00:01:52.570> lot<00:01:52.780> of<00:01:52.810> a<00:01:53.020> year<00:01:53.260> can

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
for the yard I think a lot of a year can

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.410 
for the yard I think a lot of a year can
be<00:01:53.950> considered<00:01:54.490> almost<00:01:54.670> an<00:01:54.970> open<00:01:55.240> palette

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
be considered almost an open palette

be considered almost an open palette
like<00:01:55.720> you<00:01:55.840> walk<00:01:55.990> into<00:01:56.200> a<00:01:56.260> house<00:01:56.410> it's<00:01:56.650> like<00:01:56.680> the

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
like you walk into a house it's like the

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.249 
like you walk into a house it's like the
fridge<00:01:57.400> goes<00:01:57.670> there<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:58.060> TV<00:01:58.330> goes<00:01:58.510> there<00:01:58.750> you

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
fridge goes there the TV goes there you

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:00.749 
fridge goes there the TV goes there you
know<00:01:59.380> you<00:01:59.440> know<00:01:59.650> where<00:01:59.800> this<00:01:59.890> stuff<00:02:00.130> is<00:02:00.190> what

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759

you walk into a yard looks like well you

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.330 
you walk into a yard looks like well you
know<00:02:02.590> go<00:02:03.130> ahead<00:02:03.280> it's<00:02:03.880> your<00:02:04.420> own<00:02:04.509> space<00:02:05.080> and

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
know go ahead it's your own space and
