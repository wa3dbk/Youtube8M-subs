 ana 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.670
 Say okay 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:16.720
 Tennis lesson project 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:20.260
 The tennis player should know more than 90% of penis troubles 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.530
 The solution if you learn how the body works and how to move it 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.780
 It is instructor An Jay Murakami 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.870
 Oh in that lesson project 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.380
 Player's form as in other lessons 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:36.480
 Heavy snow does not do 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:39.630
 In addition , it is neither ah nor the progress only to imitate nine players 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:46.920
 Needs deep money and effort like players 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:49.630
 Description was based on the use of reasonable body of anyone capable of realizing the technology rather than the introduction in difficult Tech 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.860
 I'd like to introduce 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:59.240
 The theme of horse Saab Mase after birth if English that extend from the deeply bending the knee 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:03.800
 There is a case that the knee is stretched at the time of toss up 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:09.770
 This form is easy to raise the ball using the power to stretch the knee 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:15.330
 If you hit the ball from this position, the trajectory of the racket will be in the direction of down strike 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:21.030
 In addition, under spin rotation is likely to occur and the ball is likely to lift up 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:27.740
 Here's why it's easy to fault as you speed up the serve 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.740
 Let's review the toss-up attitude first to be able to speed up the serve 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.720
 At Toss Up I hold my knees deep 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:39.420
 This form is called a trophy pose 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.420
 After this , hit the ball while stretching your knees 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:51.850
 The upward movement is reflected in the swing trajectory of the racket and the top spin rotation is natural for the ball 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.979
 It becomes easy to take 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:59.110
 It becomes easy to enter the service box and you can hit a ball with a stretch after bouncing 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:05.140
 It will be 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:08.649
 The trigger for the exercise chain to occur in the form of a serve is the knee flexion and extension 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:14.370
 The pelvis automatically turns by bending and stretching 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:21.590
 The state moves with it around and with shoulders and arms 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:21.590
 Strong and let's review also First feet to beat the good control Saab 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:31.020
 Tennis is not a difficult sport 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:35.790
 Also First, the mechanism of the body from carp to simplify the face 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:43.019
 If you know how to play tennis, you will make mistakes 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:46.019
 A person who is interested in how to convey the person who wants to receive specific guidance and the body they want to use 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:49.330
