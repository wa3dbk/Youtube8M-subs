think most do you guys know this because

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.789 
think most do you guys know this because
a<00:01:33.390> lot<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.750> guys<00:01:33.900> who<00:01:34.110> play<00:01:34.259> samurai<00:01:34.590> siege

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
also play clash of clans so really it's

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.929

just<00:01:37.380> like<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.590> mass<00:01:37.890> balloon<00:01:38.310> raid<00:01:38.610> here<00:01:38.909> I

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
just like a mass balloon raid here I

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.760 
just like a mass balloon raid here I
mean<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.299> minions<00:01:39.659> were<00:01:39.869> kind<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.650> a

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
mean the minions were kind of a

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.200 
mean the minions were kind of a
distraction<00:01:41.130> kind<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.610> just<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.880> pick<00:01:42.060> off<00:01:42.180> a

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
distraction kind of just to pick off a

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.880 
distraction kind of just to pick off a
few<00:01:42.360> buildings<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.020> front<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.470> mainly<00:01:43.860> I

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
few buildings in the front and mainly I

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.230 
few buildings in the front and mainly I
kind<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.280> dropped<00:01:44.430> them<00:01:44.640> just<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.909> see<00:01:45.060> if<00:01:45.149> we

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
kind of dropped them just to see if we

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.670 
kind of dropped them just to see if we
can<00:01:45.360> take<00:01:45.450> out<00:01:45.600> some<00:01:45.780> air<00:01:45.960> mines<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.409> front

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
can take out some air mines in the front

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.440 
can take out some air mines in the front
so<00:01:46.860> they<00:01:47.310> wouldn't<00:01:47.520> hurt<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.880> balloons<00:01:48.180> but

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
so they wouldn't hurt the balloons but

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.389 
so they wouldn't hurt the balloons but
overall<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.409> was<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.530> pretty<00:01:49.619> good<00:01:50.009> raid<00:01:50.220> the

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
overall it was a pretty good raid the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.920 
overall it was a pretty good raid the
balloons<00:01:50.729> did<00:01:51.030> their<00:01:51.180> thing<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.630> my<00:01:51.720> aura

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
balloons did their thing in my aura

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.749 
balloons did their thing in my aura
Queen<00:01:52.290> actually<00:01:52.710> saved<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.100> day<00:01:53.220> she<00:01:53.490> stays

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
Queen actually saved the day she stays

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.429 
Queen actually saved the day she stays
back<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.240> actually<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.689> able<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.079> pick<00:01:55.259> off

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
back and actually is able to pick off

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.080 
back and actually is able to pick off
that<00:01:55.590> Town<00:01:55.860> Hall<00:01:56.070> which<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.670> was<00:01:56.790> very<00:01:56.969> very

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
that Town Hall which I was very very

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.999 
that Town Hall which I was very very
happy<00:01:57.479> about<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:58.079> we<00:01:58.200> actually<00:01:58.619> do<00:01:58.740> end<00:01:58.950> up

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
happy about so we actually do end up

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.980 
happy about so we actually do end up
getting<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.310> two<00:01:59.490> star<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.969> think<00:02:00.600> we<00:02:00.659> got<00:02:00.689> like

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
getting a two star I think we got like

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.469 
getting a two star I think we got like
60<00:02:01.680> percent<00:02:02.430> or<00:02:02.610> something<00:02:02.939> around<00:02:03.060> there<00:02:03.299> but

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
60 percent or something around there but

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.030 
60 percent or something around there but
overall<00:02:04.020> pretty<00:02:04.140> good<00:02:04.409> rate<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.829> probably

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
overall pretty good rate I probably

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.550 
overall pretty good rate I probably
could<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.640> don't<00:02:06.390> know<00:02:06.479> switched<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.380> up<00:02:07.439> a

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
could I don't know switched it up a

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.779 
could I don't know switched it up a
little<00:02:07.680> maybe<00:02:07.950> used<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.399> little<00:02:08.580> bit<00:02:08.670> more

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
little maybe used a little bit more

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.160 
little maybe used a little bit more
strategy<00:02:09.300> instead<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.599> just<00:02:09.720> dropping<00:02:09.929> like

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
strategy instead of just dropping like

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.199 
strategy instead of just dropping like
9,000<00:02:10.800> blues<00:02:10.979> on<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.220> top<00:02:11.459> but<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:11.879> know<00:02:11.970> I
