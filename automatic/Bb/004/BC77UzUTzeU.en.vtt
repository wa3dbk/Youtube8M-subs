soil or amended soil or blended growth

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.240 
soil or amended soil or blended growth
media<00:02:32.940> like<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.420> like<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.840> green<00:02:34.110> roof<00:02:34.410> but<00:02:34.830> of

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
media like a like a green roof but of

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.650 
media like a like a green roof but of
course<00:02:35.460> we<00:02:35.940> don't<00:02:36.000> need<00:02:36.240> to<00:02:36.330> be<00:02:36.420> lightweight

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
course we don't need to be lightweight

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.700 
course we don't need to be lightweight
like<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.140> green<00:02:37.440> roof<00:02:38.750> but<00:02:39.750> it<00:02:40.200> seems<00:02:40.470> like<00:02:40.560> we

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
like a green roof but it seems like we

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.560 
like a green roof but it seems like we
get<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.980> red<00:02:41.130> combination<00:02:41.460> we<00:02:41.880> got<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.180> right

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
get the red combination we got the right

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.470 
get the red combination we got the right
plants<00:02:43.020> in<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.230> right<00:02:43.440> place<00:02:43.770> and<00:02:44.330> we've<00:02:45.330> got

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
plants in the right place and we've got

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.300 
plants in the right place and we've got
the<00:02:45.600> right<00:02:45.780> soil<00:02:46.050> and<00:02:46.560> everything<00:02:46.950> seems<00:02:47.220> to

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
the right soil and everything seems to

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.820 
the right soil and everything seems to
be<00:02:47.370> flourishing<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:48.090> my<00:02:48.810> bet<00:02:49.080> is<00:02:49.110> if<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:49.770> came

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
be flourishing and my bet is if I came

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.350 
be flourishing and my bet is if I came
back<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.250> took<00:02:50.520> a<00:02:50.640> look<00:02:50.670> at<00:02:50.880> this<00:02:51.030> in<00:02:51.240> the

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
back and took a look at this in the

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.840 
back and took a look at this in the

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
summer we'd really see some phenomenal

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.740 
summer we'd really see some phenomenal
growth<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.300> we<00:02:54.390> wouldn't<00:02:54.780> see<00:02:54.960> blocks<00:02:56.750> and

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
growth and we wouldn't see blocks and

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.500 
growth and we wouldn't see blocks and
