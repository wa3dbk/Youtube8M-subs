00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.480
 zombie series version 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.680
 if you followed the channel for some time 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.359
 You already know that Simon Jatene 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.220

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.710
 view the version of books in a version one 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.599
 little difference today should answer this 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.090
 video is a bit old so take the 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.290
 scenarios and take to my person but 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.090
 you want to watch 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.270
 It's not for me to ask you, I'm going to guide you. 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.820
 cruel program of channel 8 more then 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.930
 Thank you is timely integrated I think 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.360
 ask the questions 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.280
 and look, I'll leave it to you I could 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.710
 answer these questions with any 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.899
 character in the series again then I 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.289
 decide not to put so many characters 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.840
 so actually there's only one so let's go 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.510
 start the first question is choice 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.040
 a water that I chose the macana from here 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.560
 nakamura from tin oo and people a macana 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.909
 Accompanying her is sensational 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.810
 she has shock power that 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.490
 practically never uses but she is 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.280
 essential for everything but everything 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.040
 cool she is good at the turnstile I always 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.700
 wanted to fight with a macana because only 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.170
 we cut the middle with the macana 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.509
 Sensational I'm going to skip the second 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.670
 She asks why she 's asking 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.380
 I choose four characters to 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.229
 join the group but I liked 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.860
 him after I expressed rather talk 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.820
 them after being the question is choice 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.310
 a leader 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.470
 I really thought a lot and I ended up 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.120
 arriving on day 1 boss of super series 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.640
 show because he already has a lot 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.580
 very very very long time and that the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.450
 series then exists of old ecoponto and 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.850
 he always fought against floods 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.680
 supernatural and international 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.500
 So I decided to choose the day because of 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.470
 addition the fourth question is 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.210
 doctor and I thought hard and I do not 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.360
 told me to have a doctor then 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:16.140
 I chose the charmed linen the book is a 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:19.290
 a light light one thing is as it were 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:23.940
 an angel of light and he heals people with 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.710
 his divine light, then surely one 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.840
 injured person would be 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.360
 book and everything would be happy and 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.960
 always helped to feel willing to fight 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.400
 against the other 61 lots to be 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.440
 that they had at their hand 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.590
 then the lion granted would be a good 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.550
 doctor and, moreover, can fight with 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.260
 people 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.030
 the fifth question to choose the 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.720
 intelligence group I chose one 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.720
 series cisco afterwards because one it is 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.989
 super people it would help me a lot 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.300
 never plans for the group and 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.400
 second because he would love to be in the 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.640
 zombie apocalypse and killed many 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.410
 people then how very cool I two 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.989
 Brazilians for him to kill several 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.120
 clubs but this question is 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.640
 combatant and no doubt I 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.720
 I chose oil collected because rosemary 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:18.200
 is the garden and he lived five years one 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.120
 island on top as several villains 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.060
 and the seasons he or she has 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:28.830
 series and he managed to live can be 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.780
 a healthy person and he is also a lot of people 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.420
 then it will help the risks he has 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.610
 some mandingas in makes you heal to watch 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.000
 us bullet leading the closed and takes 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.400
 then it will also help the lion scorecard 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.710
 as a doctor and on top of it he will 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.470
 help everyone by beating us 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.450
 the mis sounds trying to save our skin to 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.820
 7 A question is a character for 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.280
 turn zombie only for later if you kill 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.900
 and this person is the gilbert arena of 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.240
 lift ages 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.430
 I stopped watching this series in this 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.950
 journey that is happening now because 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.740
 I can not stand it follows that in 18 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.930
 Even one day back to watch it already has 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:10.200
 to complex at one time but I do not 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.360
 I can bear Helena more then one 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.790
 guide soon and then end the 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.489
 question is the channel choice on youtube 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.070
 to join the group I choose my 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.460
 friend Eduardo from the weight of the books because 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.070
 because the event giving people one with 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.640
 one fighting one if making one plan 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:32.040
 saving another dying and I 'm going to stay 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:36.960
 speaking that they started the Eduardo show 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:38.340
 It's starting Michoacan Chat because it's 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.110
 This is what I'm going to do because I have 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.450
 sure it does not last long in this 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.580
 time he realizes even nothing question is 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.950
 the group is at risk and you can only 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.000
 choose three people to save whom 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.890
 you save 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.230
 I choose oliver because he goes 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:55.290
 keep on killing an encore I also choose 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:58.710

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:00.360
 I heal I hurt nobody in this 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.990
