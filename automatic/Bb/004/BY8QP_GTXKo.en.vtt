management in more than 30 years of my
practice<00:00:17.880> this<00:00:18.880> amazing<00:00:19.480> technology<00:00:20.140> which

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:20.349 
practice this amazing technology which

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:22.890 
practice this amazing technology which
is<00:00:20.500> called<00:00:20.740> photonic<00:00:21.310> stimulation<00:00:21.970> is

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 
is called photonic stimulation is

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.290 
is called photonic stimulation is
something<00:00:23.380> that<00:00:23.500> passes<00:00:24.070> infrared<00:00:24.670> light<00:00:24.939> at

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
something that passes infrared light at

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.019 
something that passes infrared light at
about<00:00:25.480> 860<00:00:26.260> nanometers<00:00:27.039> into<00:00:27.400> the<00:00:27.519> body<00:00:27.730> and

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
about 860 nanometers into the body and

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.480 
about 860 nanometers into the body and
it<00:00:28.539> penetrates<00:00:28.750> according<00:00:29.590> to<00:00:29.710> NASA<00:00:29.949> studies

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
it penetrates according to NASA studies

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.829 
it penetrates according to NASA studies
by<00:00:31.060> 10<00:00:31.449> inches<00:00:31.839> to<00:00:32.500> get<00:00:32.710> great<00:00:33.040> penetration

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:33.839 
by 10 inches to get great penetration

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:37.320 
by 10 inches to get great penetration
about<00:00:35.129> 60%<00:00:36.129> of<00:00:36.190> the<00:00:36.250> light<00:00:36.400> goes<00:00:36.670> four<00:00:37.089> inches

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:37.330 
about 60% of the light goes four inches

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.719 
about 60% of the light goes four inches
deep<00:00:37.540> and<00:00:37.780> another<00:00:38.170> 40%<00:00:38.920> goes<00:00:39.129> down<00:00:39.370> to<00:00:39.549> about

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:39.729 
deep and another 40% goes down to about

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:42.119 
deep and another 40% goes down to about
10<00:00:39.940> inches<00:00:40.120> so<00:00:41.019> you<00:00:41.049> can<00:00:41.170> get<00:00:41.500> to<00:00:41.650> the<00:00:41.769> areas

10 inches so you can get to the areas

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:43.829 
10 inches so you can get to the areas
where<00:00:42.280> you<00:00:42.400> need<00:00:42.580> to<00:00:42.790> to<00:00:43.059> get<00:00:43.180> the<00:00:43.330> effects<00:00:43.659> of

a light ray the infrared light ray hits
a<00:00:54.250> blood<00:00:54.430> vessel<00:00:54.820> wall<00:00:55.030> it<00:00:55.600> causes<00:00:56.140> an<00:00:56.290> instant

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:56.799 
a blood vessel wall it causes an instant

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:58.770 
a blood vessel wall it causes an instant
release<00:00:57.189> of<00:00:57.460> a<00:00:57.640> compound<00:00:58.059> called<00:00:58.330> nitric

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
release of a compound called nitric

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.289 
release of a compound called nitric
oxide<00:00:59.199> and<00:00:59.439> nitric<00:01:00.309> oxide<00:01:00.760> causes

instantaneous pop-open of a blood vessel
so<00:01:04.720> suddenly<00:01:05.170> you<00:01:05.320> have<00:01:05.500> a<00:01:05.530> change<00:01:05.920> in

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
so suddenly you have a change in

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.609 
so suddenly you have a change in
circulation<00:01:06.700> that's<00:01:07.030> dramatic<00:01:07.570> and<00:01:07.750> for

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
circulation that's dramatic and for

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.169 
circulation that's dramatic and for
tissues<00:01:09.039> that<00:01:09.310> don't<00:01:09.490> have<00:01:09.700> good<00:01:09.939> circulation

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:10.179 
tissues that don't have good circulation

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:12.389 
tissues that don't have good circulation

are able to respond to nitric oxide and
increase<00:01:22.149> flow<00:01:22.450> to<00:01:22.509> those<00:01:22.780> tissues<00:01:23.049> that

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
increase flow to those tissues that

all but are barely able to stay alive

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.410 
all but are barely able to stay alive
until<00:01:28.329> you<00:01:28.810> change<00:01:29.259> what's<00:01:29.649> happening<00:01:30.070> there

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
until you change what's happening there

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.149 
until you change what's happening there
it<00:01:31.420> also<00:01:31.600> causes<00:01:32.079> a<00:01:32.289> reduction<00:01:33.039> in

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
it also causes a reduction in

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.980 
it also causes a reduction in
inflammation<00:01:33.460> that<00:01:34.240> happens<00:01:34.569> very<00:01:34.749> quickly

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
inflammation that happens very quickly

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.039 
inflammation that happens very quickly
as<00:01:35.829> well<00:01:36.100> it<00:01:36.819> increases<00:01:37.270> lymphatic<00:01:37.719> drainage

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
as well it increases lymphatic drainage

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.830 
as well it increases lymphatic drainage
it<00:01:38.890> increases<00:01:39.549> the<00:01:39.670> activity<00:01:39.819> of<00:01:40.299> white<00:01:40.569> cells

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
it increases the activity of white cells

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.200 
it increases the activity of white cells
so<00:01:41.109> they<00:01:41.259> clean<00:01:41.499> up<00:01:41.530> debris<00:01:41.829> faster<00:01:42.460> and<00:01:42.670> it

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
so they clean up debris faster and it

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.389 
so they clean up debris faster and it
has<00:01:43.390> an<00:01:43.569> amazing<00:01:44.170> effect<00:01:44.289> on<00:01:44.679> nerves<00:01:45.039> it

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
has an amazing effect on nerves it

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.139 
has an amazing effect on nerves it
causes<00:01:46.390> nerve<00:01:46.810> fiber<00:01:47.439> nerve<00:01:48.429> fibers<00:01:48.969> that<00:01:49.090> are

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
causes nerve fiber nerve fibers that are

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.709 
causes nerve fiber nerve fibers that are
pain<00:01:49.539> fibers<00:01:50.170> to<00:01:51.130> calm<00:01:51.549> down<00:01:51.909> and<00:01:52.210> not<00:01:52.270> cause

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 
pain fibers to calm down and not cause

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:55.980 
pain fibers to calm down and not cause
so<00:01:52.929> much<00:01:53.079> pain<00:01:53.999> there<00:01:54.999> are<00:01:55.119> a<00:01:55.149> wide<00:01:55.420> number<00:01:55.780> of

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
so much pain there are a wide number of

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.109 
so much pain there are a wide number of
conditions<00:01:56.499> that<00:01:56.710> are<00:01:57.039> responsive<00:01:57.789> to<00:01:57.999> this

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119

that<00:04:57.449> doesn't<00:04:57.720> respond<00:04:58.320> to<00:04:58.500> infrared<00:04:58.889> light

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:01.490 
that doesn't respond to infrared light
therapy<00:04:59.699> and<00:05:00.330> I<00:05:00.389> think<00:05:00.660> that<00:05:00.870> the<00:05:01.050> field<00:05:01.289> is

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
therapy and I think that the field is

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.529 
therapy and I think that the field is
promising<00:05:02.039> and<00:05:02.310> my<00:05:02.490> suspicion<00:05:03.090> is<00:05:03.210> that<00:05:03.240> over

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 
promising and my suspicion is that over

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:05.840 
promising and my suspicion is that over
the<00:05:03.630> next<00:05:03.810> few<00:05:04.050> years<00:05:04.110> while<00:05:05.010> the<00:05:05.190> FDA<00:05:05.340> is

the next few years while the FDA is

the next few years while the FDA is
