00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
this is excellent for the end of the

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.740 
this is excellent for the end of the
cable<00:02:31.940> right<00:02:32.629> here<00:02:33.910> we<00:02:34.910> use<00:02:35.090> it<00:02:35.269> to<00:02:35.420> hold<00:02:35.629> the

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
cable right here we use it to hold the

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.190 
cable right here we use it to hold the
cable<00:02:36.549> you<00:02:37.549> have<00:02:37.700> both<00:02:37.910> sides<00:02:38.180> under<00:02:38.599> tension

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
cable you have both sides under tension

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.039 
cable you have both sides under tension
now<00:02:39.590> watch<00:02:41.500> you<00:02:42.500> see<00:02:43.480> if<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:44.569> get<00:02:44.629> that<00:02:44.870> right

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
now watch you see if I get that right

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.050 
now watch you see if I get that right
now<00:02:45.709> usually<00:02:46.010> we<00:02:46.129> have<00:02:46.190> a<00:02:46.250> spring<00:02:46.579> right<00:02:46.790> here

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
now usually we have a spring right here

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.539 
now usually we have a spring right here
and<00:02:47.470> it<00:02:48.470> what<00:02:48.680> it<00:02:48.769> does<00:02:48.799> is<00:02:49.099> it<00:02:49.220> holds<00:02:49.340> the

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
and it what it does is it holds the

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.580 
and it what it does is it holds the
spring<00:02:49.849> on<00:02:50.030> so<00:02:50.690> that<00:02:50.840> you<00:02:50.959> can<00:02:51.109> get<00:02:51.319> this

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
spring on so that you can get this

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.339 
spring on so that you can get this
little<00:02:51.980> lead<00:02:52.730> ball<00:02:53.030> into<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:54.440> carburetor

do

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.449 
do
if<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.209> carburetor<00:03:29.630> is<00:03:29.690> on<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:29.900> bike<00:03:30.079> I'll

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
if the carburetor is on the bike I'll

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.640 
if the carburetor is on the bike I'll
loosen<00:03:31.459> up<00:03:31.609> the<00:03:31.760> front<00:03:32.540> part<00:03:32.810> and<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.079> back<00:03:33.260> or

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
carburetor a little bit like that

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.159 
carburetor a little bit like that
away<00:03:37.669> from<00:03:37.849> the<00:03:37.940> body<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:38.690> body's<00:03:38.989> right

right here and then we take these off

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.400 
right here and then we take these off
now<00:03:44.900> what<00:03:45.079> we're<00:03:45.230> doing<00:03:45.260> is<00:03:45.530> is<00:03:45.849> demystifying

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
now what we're doing is is demystifying

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.140 
now what we're doing is is demystifying
the<00:03:48.410> carburetor<00:03:49.190> which<00:03:49.400> everyone<00:03:49.880> is<00:03:50.000> so

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
the carburetor which everyone is so

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.710 
the carburetor which everyone is so

afraid of they're very very simple and

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.210 
afraid of they're very very simple and
mechanics<00:03:53.720> just<00:03:53.959> laughed<00:03:54.260> their<00:03:54.620> asses<00:03:54.650> off

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.070 
c-clip which it's shaped like a C and
you<00:04:43.760> take<00:04:43.940> it<00:04:44.060> off<00:04:44.150> and<00:04:44.419> you<00:04:44.660> can<00:04:44.690> put<00:04:44.840> it

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
you take it off and you can put it

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.909 
you take it off and you can put it
either

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
either

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.460 
either
two<00:04:46.610> steps<00:04:46.910> lower<00:04:47.090> or<00:04:47.389> two<00:04:47.600> steps<00:04:47.810> higher<00:04:48.110> one

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
two steps lower or two steps higher one

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.830 
two steps lower or two steps higher one
step<00:04:48.710> at<00:04:48.830> a<00:04:48.889> time<00:04:49.090> it<00:04:50.090> will<00:04:50.210> give<00:04:50.330> you<00:04:50.419> more<00:04:50.630> gas

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
step at a time it will give you more gas

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.080 
step at a time it will give you more gas
or<00:04:51.080> less<00:04:51.260> gas<00:04:51.500> now<00:04:52.370> what<00:04:52.550> we're<00:04:52.669> going<00:04:52.850> to<00:04:52.910> do

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
or less gas now what we're going to do

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.390 
or less gas now what we're going to do
is<00:04:53.360> we<00:04:53.690> need<00:04:53.840> to<00:04:53.900> attach<00:04:56.889> the<00:04:57.889> end<00:04:58.190> of<00:04:58.310> the

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
is we need to attach the end of the

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.780 
is we need to attach the end of the
cable<00:04:58.820> right<00:04:59.630> here<00:05:01.540> right<00:05:02.540> here<00:05:03.550> the<00:05:04.550> end<00:05:04.700> of

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
cable right here right here the end of

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:11.820 
cable right here right here the end of
this<00:05:04.880> cable<00:05:05.180> right<00:05:06.520> here<00:05:08.110> has<00:05:09.110> to<00:05:09.380> go<00:05:10.300> through

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
this cable right here has to go through

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:21.330 
this cable right here has to go through
the<00:05:12.830> top<00:05:16.479> of<00:05:18.970> the<00:05:19.970> slide<00:05:20.210> first<00:05:20.840> thing<00:05:20.990> we<00:05:21.110> do

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
the top of the slide first thing we do

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.850 
the top of the slide first thing we do
go<00:05:22.340> through<00:05:22.550> the<00:05:22.640> top<00:05:22.820> this<00:05:23.000> line<00:05:23.240> and<00:05:23.590> it<00:05:24.590> fits

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
go through the top this line and it fits

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.050 
go through the top this line and it fits
right<00:05:25.130> here<00:05:25.370> just<00:05:26.060> like<00:05:26.180> that<00:05:26.240> see<00:05:26.780> real<00:05:27.680> easy

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
right here just like that see real easy

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.740 
right here just like that see real easy
then<00:05:29.060> it<00:05:29.479> gets<00:05:30.200> a<00:05:30.289> little<00:05:30.410> bit<00:05:30.590> harder<00:05:31.750> then

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
then it gets a little bit harder then

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.230 
then it gets a little bit harder then
what<00:05:32.960> we<00:05:33.050> have<00:05:33.200> to<00:05:33.229> do<00:05:33.440> is<00:05:33.710> take<00:05:33.979> it<00:05:34.250> and<00:05:34.789> put<00:05:35.150> it

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
what we have to do is take it and put it

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.750 
what we have to do is take it and put it
through<00:05:35.390> the<00:05:35.570> spring<00:05:35.870> and<00:05:36.140> then<00:05:37.039> through<00:05:37.610> the

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
through the spring and then through the

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.100 
through the spring and then through the
bottom<00:05:38.120> of<00:05:38.270> the<00:05:39.039> plastic<00:05:40.840> there's<00:05:41.840> a<00:05:41.930> hole

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
bottom of the plastic there's a hole

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:48.680 
bottom of the plastic there's a hole
right<00:05:42.289> there<00:05:42.350> watch<00:05:45.610> come<00:05:46.610> on<00:05:46.700> yeah
