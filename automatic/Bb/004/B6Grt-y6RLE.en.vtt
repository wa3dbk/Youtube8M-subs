00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
bottoms straight across and then I'm

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.750 
bottoms straight across and then I'm
going<00:00:30.949> to<00:00:31.009> divide<00:00:31.159> this<00:00:31.519> one<00:00:31.819> into<00:00:32.780> six

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
going to divide this one into six

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.650 
going to divide this one into six
sections<00:00:34.760> going<00:00:35.600> down<00:00:35.809> you<00:00:36.019> can<00:00:36.050> see<00:00:37.480> how<00:00:38.480> I'm

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
sections going down you can see how I'm

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.720 
sections going down you can see how I'm
cutting<00:00:38.989> I'm<00:00:39.170> leaving<00:00:40.129> a<00:00:40.219> bit<00:00:40.370> at<00:00:40.489> the<00:00:40.519> end

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
cutting I'm leaving a bit at the end

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.080 
cutting I'm leaving a bit at the end
that's<00:00:41.149> not<00:00:41.269> cut<00:00:42.190> you<00:00:43.190> can<00:00:43.370> cut<00:00:43.429> it<00:00:43.699> into<00:00:43.850> eight

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
that's not cut you can cut it into eight

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.900 
that's not cut you can cut it into eight
sections<00:00:44.120> if<00:00:44.780> you<00:00:44.899> have<00:00:45.079> a<00:00:45.109> fatter<00:00:45.589> leek<00:00:46.429> this

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
sections if you have a fatter leek this

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.660 
sections if you have a fatter leek this
one<00:00:47.120> was<00:00:47.269> pretty<00:00:47.510> skinny<00:00:47.929> so<00:00:48.350> I<00:00:48.379> just<00:00:48.710> did<00:00:49.010> six

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
one was pretty skinny so I just did six

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.180 
one was pretty skinny so I just did six
sections<00:00:50.120> you<00:00:50.390> can<00:00:50.420> also<00:00:50.660> do<00:00:50.899> it<00:00:51.019> with<00:00:51.109> four<00:00:51.469> or

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
sections you can also do it with four or

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.340 
sections you can also do it with four or
any<00:00:52.519> number<00:00:52.850> you<00:00:52.879> think<00:00:53.329> that<00:00:53.839> you<00:00:54.050> want<00:00:54.230> to

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
any number you think that you want to

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:08.080 
any number you think that you want to
try<00:01:05.050> pull<00:01:06.050> out<00:01:06.230> the<00:01:06.530> lowest<00:01:06.920> piece<00:01:07.640> of<00:01:07.910> the

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
try pull out the lowest piece of the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.380 
try pull out the lowest piece of the
leek<00:01:08.300> no<00:01:08.660> I<00:01:09.040> started<00:01:10.040> by<00:01:10.400> going<00:01:10.700> around<00:01:11.030> and

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
leek no I started by going around and

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.320 
leek no I started by going around and
just<00:01:11.630> rolling<00:01:11.990> over<00:01:12.380> one<00:01:12.410> on<00:01:12.740> each<00:01:13.130> of<00:01:13.580> the

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
just rolling over one on each of the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.520 
just rolling over one on each of the
stalks<00:01:14.750> of<00:01:15.080> the<00:01:15.230> league<00:01:15.440> there<00:01:15.980> each<00:01:16.400> of<00:01:16.700> the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
stalks of the league there each of the

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.930 
stalks of the league there each of the
sections<00:01:18.530> and<00:01:21.190> sometimes<00:01:22.190> this<00:01:22.400> works<00:01:22.610> well

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
sections and sometimes this works well

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.420 
sections and sometimes this works well
and<00:01:23.210> other<00:01:23.600> times<00:01:23.930> it's<00:01:24.380> better<00:01:24.860> just<00:01:24.980> to<00:01:25.250> do

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
and other times it's better just to do

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.680 
and other times it's better just to do
each<00:01:25.640> section<00:01:26.210> at<00:01:26.330> a<00:01:26.360> time<00:01:26.450> and<00:01:27.880> as<00:01:28.880> I<00:01:29.180> went<00:01:29.390> I

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
each section at a time and as I went I

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.290 
each section at a time and as I went I
decided<00:01:30.080> to<00:01:30.520> just<00:01:31.600> continue<00:01:32.600> up<00:01:33.700> each<00:01:34.700> section

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
decided to just continue up each section

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.990 
decided to just continue up each section
and<00:01:35.450> finish<00:01:36.020> each<00:01:36.260> section<00:01:36.800> at<00:01:36.920> a<00:01:37.010> time

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.910 

because<00:01:41.000> it<00:01:41.090> makes<00:01:41.300> it<00:01:41.450> stay<00:01:41.660> together<00:01:41.920> easier

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
because it makes it stay together easier

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.940 
because it makes it stay together easier
if<00:01:43.190> you<00:01:43.430> do<00:01:43.580> each<00:01:43.820> one<00:01:44.060> at<00:01:44.210> a<00:01:44.300> time<00:01:44.540> sometimes

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
if you do each one at a time sometimes

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.180 
if you do each one at a time sometimes
so<00:01:45.950> that's<00:01:46.220> how<00:01:46.400> this<00:01:46.610> one<00:01:46.820> was<00:01:47.000> working<00:01:47.210> out

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
so that's how this one was working out

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.890 
so that's how this one was working out
it<00:01:49.190> also<00:01:49.340> works<00:01:49.730> better<00:01:49.940> if<00:01:50.090> your<00:01:50.270> leek<00:01:50.450> is<00:01:50.630> not

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
it also works better if your leek is not

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.890 
it also works better if your leek is not
real<00:01:51.800> cold<00:01:52.460> because<00:01:52.910> if<00:01:53.030> it's<00:01:53.150> cold<00:01:53.480> they

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
real cold because if it's cold they

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:03.790 
real cold because if it's cold they
don't<00:01:54.080> bend<00:01:54.470> as<00:01:54.680> easily

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.880 

so<00:02:04.800> we<00:02:04.920> just<00:02:05.100> continue<00:02:05.580> around<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:06.030> think<00:02:06.890> until

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
so we just continue around I think until

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.560 
so we just continue around I think until
it's<00:02:08.070> finished<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:09.290> think<00:02:10.290> I<00:02:10.350> got<00:02:10.590> mainly<00:02:11.570> five

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
it's finished I think I got mainly five

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.080 
it's finished I think I got mainly five
or<00:02:12.840> six<00:02:14.360> circles<00:02:15.360> five<00:02:16.110> or<00:02:16.290> six<00:02:16.940> fringes<00:02:17.940> on

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
or six circles five or six fringes on

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.640 
or six circles five or six fringes on
each<00:02:18.270> one<00:02:21.770> sometimes<00:02:22.770> you<00:02:22.980> can<00:02:23.130> only<00:02:23.250> get<00:02:23.430> four

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
each one sometimes you can only get four

00:02:24.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
each one sometimes you can only get four
sometimes<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:25.830> can<00:02:25.980> get<00:02:26.130> seven

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:33.530 

you

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.589 

now<00:03:33.780> when<00:03:33.959> you're<00:03:34.080> done<00:03:34.739> I<00:03:34.769> think<00:03:35.519> I<00:03:35.760> cut<00:03:36.450> the

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
now when you're done I think I cut the

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.300 
now when you're done I think I cut the
top<00:03:36.870> off<00:03:37.049> of<00:03:37.110> this<00:03:37.349> one<00:03:37.560> a<00:03:37.590> bit<00:03:37.829> made<00:03:38.069> it<00:03:38.220> a

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
top off of this one a bit made it a

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.119 
top off of this one a bit made it a
shorter<00:03:38.760> stalk<00:03:39.209> some<00:03:39.959> people<00:03:40.260> cut<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.860> stalk

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129 
shorter stalk some people cut the stalk

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:45.259 
shorter stalk some people cut the stalk
into<00:03:41.400> lots<00:03:41.879> of<00:03:42.090> little<00:03:42.390> frills<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:44.060> also<00:03:45.060> go

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
into lots of little frills to also go

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.440 
into lots of little frills to also go
around<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.629> bottom<00:03:46.049> and<00:03:46.730> cut<00:03:47.730> a<00:03:47.760> point<00:03:48.180> on

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
around the bottom and cut a point on
