two<00:00:12.870> videos<00:00:13.230> showing<00:00:14.070> you<00:00:14.250> how<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.610> solve<00:00:14.969> the

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
two videos showing you how to solve the

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.730 
two videos showing you how to solve the
front<00:00:15.330> these<00:00:15.570> two<00:00:15.870> layers<00:00:16.080> of<00:00:16.230> rubik's<00:00:16.529> cube

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
front these two layers of rubik's cube

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.310 
front these two layers of rubik's cube
so<00:00:17.670> with<00:00:18.119> that<00:00:18.240> said<00:00:18.570> we're<00:00:18.930> going<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.140> sell

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
so with that said we're going to sell

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.590 
so with that said we're going to sell
solve<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.770> top<00:00:19.980> layer<00:00:20.220> so<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.180> top<00:00:21.359> layers

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
solve the top layer so the top layers

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.929 
solve the top layer so the top layers
like<00:00:21.779> solving<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.260> bottom<00:00:22.640> first<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.789> all<00:00:23.880> if

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
like solving the bottom first of all if

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.060 
like solving the bottom first of all if
we<00:00:23.970> have<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.269> make<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.420> blue<00:00:24.720> cross<00:00:25.140> but<00:00:25.859> we

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
we have to make a blue cross but we

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.939 
we have to make a blue cross but we
don't<00:00:26.279> have<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.269> match<00:00:28.199> up<00:00:28.439> these<00:00:28.529> edge<00:00:28.710> pieces

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
don't have to match up these edge pieces

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.730 
don't have to match up these edge pieces
to<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.310> center<00:00:29.730> center<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> counterpart<00:00:30.900> which

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
to the center center a counterpart which

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.310 
to the center center a counterpart which
kind<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:31.980> makes<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.189> bit<00:00:32.309> easier<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:33.020> you<00:00:34.020> will

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
kind of makes a bit easier so you will

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.709 
kind of makes a bit easier so you will
have<00:00:34.489> three<00:00:35.489> cases<00:00:35.850> with<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.149> there<00:00:36.540> are<00:00:36.630> no

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
have three cases with this there are no

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.139 
have three cases with this there are no
parity<00:00:37.230> errors<00:00:37.559> which<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.340> can<00:00:38.640> find<00:00:38.940> on<00:00:39.090> a

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
parity errors which you can find on a

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.400 
parity errors which you can find on a
4x4<00:00:39.420> in<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:40.469> 3x3<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:42.000> solve<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.660> you'll<00:00:43.230> have

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
4x4 in a 3x3 so solve this you'll have

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.950 
4x4 in a 3x3 so solve this you'll have
three<00:00:43.800> cases<00:00:44.000> first<00:00:45.000> case<00:00:45.270> will<00:00:45.629> have<00:00:45.750> a

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
three cases first case will have a

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.590 
three cases first case will have a
center<00:00:46.289> piece<00:00:46.410> with<00:00:46.860> no<00:00:47.190> other<00:00:47.550> edge<00:00:48.270> piece

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
center piece with no other edge piece

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.770 
center piece with no other edge piece
surrounding<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:50.210> second<00:00:51.210> case<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.420> will<00:00:51.750> have

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
surrounding it second case you will have

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.000 
surrounding it second case you will have
an<00:00:52.620> l-shape<00:00:53.809> third<00:00:54.809> case<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.500> will<00:00:55.649> have<00:00:55.829> a

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
an l-shape third case you will have a

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.840 
an l-shape third case you will have a
tee<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:57.050> straight<00:00:58.050> line<00:00:58.309> those<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.520> three<00:00:59.699> cases

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
tee a straight line those in three cases

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.090 
tee a straight line those in three cases
you<00:01:00.090> will<00:01:00.180> get<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.989> may<00:01:01.170> get<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.859> cross

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
you will get you may get the cross

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.850 
you will get you may get the cross
straight<00:01:02.579> way<00:01:02.730> but<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.750> very

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
straight way but that is a very

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.310 
straight way but that is a very
one-in-a-million<00:01:04.860> chance<00:01:05.450> so<00:01:06.450> with<00:01:07.049> any<00:01:07.140> of

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
one-in-a-million chance so with any of

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.130 
one-in-a-million chance so with any of
them<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.799> need<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.040> perform<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.520> algorithm

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
them you need to perform this algorithm

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.530 
them you need to perform this algorithm
so<00:01:10.140> if<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.530> was<00:01:10.650> just<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.979> center<00:01:11.340> piece<00:01:11.540> find

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
so if it was just a center piece find

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.039 
so if it was just a center piece find
any<00:01:12.810> blank<00:01:13.409> edge<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.010> form<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.939> if<00:01:15.659> it's<00:01:15.990> a

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
any blank edge and form it if it's a

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.859 
any blank edge and form it if it's a
t-shape<00:01:16.700> make<00:01:17.700> sure<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.030> blank<00:01:18.299> edge<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.720> the

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
t-shape make sure the blank edge is the

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.620 
t-shape make sure the blank edge is the
right<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.580> the<00:01:20.580> face<00:01:20.820> you're<00:01:21.090> using<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.540> you

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
right of the face you're using so you

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.390 
right of the face you're using so you
have<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.840> pick<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:22.140> blank<00:01:22.409> edge<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:23.130> make<00:01:23.250> sure

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
have to pick a blank edge and make sure

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.859 
have to pick a blank edge and make sure
you<00:01:23.490> have<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.640> blank<00:01:23.939> edge<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.390> right<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.750> it

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.649 

next<00:01:28.250> if<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.400> have<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.700> straight<00:01:30.060> shape<00:01:30.299> just

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
next if you have a straight shape just

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.440 
next if you have a straight shape just
find<00:01:30.840> any<00:01:31.110> one<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.740> these<00:01:31.890> blank<00:01:32.159> edges<00:01:32.490> so

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
find any one of these blank edges so

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.690 
find any one of these blank edges so
I've<00:01:33.540> got<00:01:33.689> an<00:01:33.780> L<00:01:33.930> shape<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:35.070> here<00:01:35.220> we<00:01:35.340> go<00:01:35.490> for

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
I've got an L shape so here we go for

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.340 
I've got an L shape so here we go for
this<00:01:35.850> algorithm<00:01:36.060> make<00:01:36.930> sure<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.290> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
this algorithm make sure you have the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.170 
this algorithm make sure you have the
blank<00:01:37.560> face<00:01:37.799> in<00:01:38.009> front<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.939> blank
